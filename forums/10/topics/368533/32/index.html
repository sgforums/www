              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p>Following Troll (il)logic (TM), the entire US army is unprofessional and useless simply because they are not of SOCOM standard. That is clearly an absurd and unreasonable line of thinking.</p>

              <p><br> Just to prove my point, I have to recycle my post for these
              retards.</p>
              <p>Here goes <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>It's truely fascinating to see many Singaporean males churning
              out excuses after excuses to defend their own stinkiness and trying
              desperately to overturn the truth that they do not stink and
              annoyed the people of the public.</p>
              <p>I would rather see them admit that they stink but comes up with
              good, positive ideas and suggestions to improve their own
              image.</p>
              <p>Since they are too wussy to bring it up to their superiors and
              create awareness, then they should be more self-aware and accept,
              acknowledge the public opinions about them.</p>
              <p>Singaporean guys have this appalling habit of hiding behind
              their dreaded national service and demanded respect from the public
              and act patriotic when they think it will brings them absolute
              victory in whichever arguments they're into.</p>
              <p>Singaporean guys cannot lose, surrender, or even accept
              criticism regardless if it is for the sake of their own good or the
              goodness of many others. This will turn around and bite
              them back at their face when they realised they
              aren't able to cope with failures, defeat, setbacks in
              their lives.</p>
              <p>Sadly, this is the present and the future of Singaporean
              males that we are witnessing. If they aren't able to self-aware.
              self-correct, self-reflect within themselves, then it is
              almost certain that they are not capable of bringing any
              future to themselves, their families and their country.</p>
              <p>It doesn't take much efforts to bring out their true ugly nature
              within themselves and expose them for all to see.</p>

              <p>In case you are not well educated, AIDS do not spread through the air. It spread through contacts like blood. Malaria doesn't spread through the air too. It needs an Anopheles mosquito to spread to another person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apparently, your daughter is having nightmare because you didn't educate her well about NS men. For your information, they are not smelly green monster. Please educate her with the right things. We do not want uneducated and people with low EQ in this society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not want to spend your husband hard earn money by taking taxi, what makes you have the right to ask NS men to take taxi? Is it fair for them? I'm sure your husband earn more than NS men. I think it will be better for you to get your own car. I'm sure if you are going to take taxi, you will complain about taxi-drivers. By the way, they are not boys scout, they are NS men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they have germs on themselves and you hope that they don't take public transport, don't you have germs on yourself too? Germs is everywhere and on everyone. Can you stop it? Apparently not. You shouldn't breathe too. Because we share the same air as the NS men and they have germs. Please buy an oxygen tank and mask for your kids and yourself. How do you know they went go Geylang to visit prostitute? Did you stalk them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If NS men should be quarantine in Tekong, why don't you quarantine your kids and yourself at home since your kids and yourself are smaller in numbers compared to NS men? It's always better to keep the minorities away than the majorities right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not like PAP, why are you here? Shouldn't you be migrating? I should let you know this, in case you are not well-educated. PAP has build Singapore till what it is today.

              <p>Singapore is a democratic country. You can't stop others from doing what they want or force them to do what you want. If you can't accept this, I think Singapore isn't a place for you.</p>

              <p>This pseudo-feminism that you highlight is bad for everyone because:</p>
              <p>-It is really gynocentrism (belief that women are superior to men) in disguise. </p>
              <ul>
              <li>That is no better than male chauvanism.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>-It strikes others as an attempt to acquire all the rights of men but none of the responsibilities. [edit: "To have your cake and eat it."]</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Many of these characters are the first to argue that women can run marathons, vote, achieve top positions at work, and climb Mt Everest.</li>
              <li>Now, i stress that i have no problem with such claims *<em>in themselves</em>*.</li>
              <li>Yet, strangely, after making such claims, these *same characters make a U-turn and claim that women are too weak to do NS/have better things to do than NS... (as though men don't)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>--&gt; I have no problems with feminism *per se*, but this disingenuity strikes me as, at best, absurd, and at worst, deceptive.</p>
              <p>-It reflects poorly and unfairly on many sensible feminists (or just "feminists") out there.</p>
              <p>-It alienates ppl who'd otherwise sympathise with feminism</p>
              <p>-Thus, it holds back or even undoes progress that took feminists years to achieve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seeing all this, it's unsurprising that feminism gets quite a bit of undeserved flak among (NS)men.  </p>
              <p>Yet feminism *is a worthwhile movement, just as other forms of gender egalitarianism are. This makes it all the sadder.</p>

              <p>In [edit: "short"], "feminism" is needlessly turned into unthinking female chauvinism/ unthinking male-bashing. That hurts feminism, which i think is a good cause.</p>

              <p><em>Lokey said:</em></p>
              <p><em>"Like every1 else, some people have BO so dont. What is so strange about this?</em></p>
              <p><em>Do they bathe at all? YES. WE bathe."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good points, all. Still, there's more to it.</p>
              <p>The point isn't simply whether we can bathe or not. In general,</p>
              <p>1.) Before bookout, NSmen do try to smell good *if it's feasible*. They may bathe, apply deodorant/powder, wear new uniform, wear civies etc.</p>
              <p>We *do make the effort wherever we *can.</p>
              <p>2.) However, sprucing up isn't always possible. Sometimes you don't want to shower because you don't want to sabo your mates during area cleaning (by not being available to clean and by leaving soap suds etc). Sometimes there are simply too few cubicles for too many people. Sometimes the showers are down. Etc, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>The point is, smelling nice isn't always possible in the SAF. We don't like it, but we *can't do much about it*.</p>
              <p>3.) Often, sprucing up is futile. Even after showering, you may still sweat quite a bit. Sometimes/often (more so with recruits/trainees), you'll kena corporal punishment. Often you'll have to walk a long distance to the gate, and then to the bus-stop/MRT station. If you're wearing civies, it's bad enough. Imagine how sweaty you'll be in no. 4. Often you'll book out when it's hot- it's just a question of *how hot. </p>
              <p>In any case, you'll probably pick up at least a mildly unpleasant odour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We don't want wild applause for defending our country etc etc. But we *do hope for some modicum of empathy and respect, if not understanding. We want others to at least *try to put themselves in our shoes and see where we're coming from, not least because that's what we'd do for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>**</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will admit that my stated intention to hammer the troll with military equipment was inappropriate. Whether it was a *joke or not, it was unacceptable.</p>
              <p>However, my contempt still stands.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I believe you owe me an apology over your inappropriate comments since you have admitted it was unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Taking an overly long period of time to realise it was unacceptable but not mature enough to make a quick apology to the person involved, doesn't means you are excused.</p>
              <p>It doesn't ends and will never end unless I can read your apology post to me.</p>
              <p>It will end when I say it ends, and that will never come from a cowardly retard like yourself who has the guts to post publicly to discuss using military equipments on civilian like me and yet do not have the courage to own up and make a public apology about it.</p>

              <p>Flaming from <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/253279">Crazydeezee</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/users/26326">SingaporeTyrannosaur</a> doesn't prove anything. Because it will only provide further prove to my opinions made earlier towards Singapore males and army boys.</p>
              <p>Despite their countless flaming, it only shows how little or zero abilities that these two childish retards has. Having wasted a couple of pages specially dedicated to determine my credibility has certainly shown all forumers here just how childish they are.</p>
              <p>I would called them a troll and a leprechaun as I think they complement each other very well in this forum. For their information, trying desperately to create a negative image about me doesn't means it's the truth and I'm definitely not afraid of it. I have every confidence with who I am and what I'm capable of and what I'm not capable of.</p>
              <p>The only reason why I refer to them as retards is because, they simply are not able to take a neutral stance to analyse and judge the posts from TS in a neutral manner. And it's really not that difficult to see their subjective opinions from their posts. If they are not able to read and accept TS post with an open mind and heart, then whatever non-flaming posts that they may try to create, certainly carries and will contain their own bias opinions. The reason is simple, these two retards came to post their respond to this topic because they do not like TS and me. Therefore it would be silly of you to imagine that these two retards are capable of adopting a neutral stance like yourself.</p>
              <p>And lastly, like I have mentioned before. I certainly looked down and despise Singaporean men IF they are unable to treat their national service as their obligated duty and received it with pride. Hiding behind their own national service and using it as a shield to silence ALL public opinions and criticism is absolutely lame and not acceptable IF they really took their national service with pride. People who does things with pride would do all their best to correct and ensure they project the best of themselves in the public and takes public criticism and opinions seriously.</p>
              <p>It is very true and still a real fact that many if not all army boys stink and has created a sense of displeasure among the public. It's unfortunate that one member of the public has finally had enough of it and decided to make a post out of it. But I'm more disappointed with the responses from many current or ex-army boys in here. It seems that somehow, they have been instilled with the impression that the public should have hold onto their tongues and should NEVER had criticised them in here because these army boys has done their dues and the public owes them an eternal debt for their national service which itself is an unavoidable duty for all of them to serve with PRIDE and HONOR.</p>
              <p>So tell me, where has all the pride and honor evaporated to?</p>
              <p>I need to set things straight for these misled Singaporean army boys in here. THE PUBLIC DO NOT AND DOES NOT OWE THEM ANYTHING even if these Singaporen males need to serve their national service and they think they have wasted their years serving in national service. Well, at the moment I really think I will agree that these Singaporean males have truly wasted their time serving their national service if people like <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/253279">Crazydeezee</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/users/26326">SingaporeTyrannosaur</a> are the end result of guys who have done their national service.</p>
              <p>Their posts in here, behaviour towards females, attitude towards national service, and their contempt towards public criticism truly exposes them as A SHAMEFUL &amp; UGLY SINGAPOREAN GUYS.</p>
              <p>As for how many more unashamed and ugly Singaporean guys are in support of their appalling clause, I shall wait and see to find out if I am wrong.</p>
              <p>It's truely unfortunate for <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/253279">Crazydeezee</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/users/26326">SingaporeTyrannosaur</a>, because it doesn't ends and will NEVER END until I say it end.</p>

              <p><br>2. Perfume/deodorant/powder is to be included in the emart item and the field pack item. [Actually SAF powder is already an useful emart item, maybe not scented. That's why]</p>
              <p><br>3. Sgt/Trainers are not allowed to issue corporal punishment before book out. <br> <br><strong>Officers’ reply as expected would be: [Taiji back]</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>1.    It is up to individual personnel to ensure their own personal hygiene. I would communicate to the Medical Corps to work on this campaign.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>TS has post a good suggestion.  Perhaps, it is really time to look into the BMTC policy.</p>
              <p>So at the end. I get it, it is the "high rank" guy's fault. OK better do your job properly, if not get condemned.</p>

              <p>Don't you *dare insult 250K boys like that, then claim *you have the moral high ground. None of us asked for you to come and disparage our service. None of us asked you to try to force us off public transport. If anyone owes a bloody apology, it's *you as well.</p>

              <p>Pls lah, Parn. Keep screwing yourself over, why don't you?</p>
              <p>While you're crowing about how you've "sealed [our] fates", you've just sealed yours. Hang yourself with your own rope, eh? Oh and, lest you think i'm "threatening" and "terrorising" you, i'm speaking *<em>figuratively</em>* (emphasis added for your sake)- assuming you can wrap your excuse for a brain around that concept.</p>
              <p>Might i add that, given your lack of credibility, any attempts to deny and/or cover up your statements will only make you look more like a coward. At least i admitted my mistake and retracted the inappropriate statements.</p>
              <p>Will you?</p>
              <p>Really, you're just a joke to everyone here now.</p>

              <p>These drinker guys' wifeys got my namecard, they also got the credit bills and receipt that indicate my place. All because these guys are not careful, went home with all those alcohol smell and drunk and the next moment a SMS or a call came in calling "lao Gong" by PRC women. So, u think aunties not angry ar??</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>My sister Parn is a very direct person, she speaks with no consideration of others, i suggest you all take her goods of her posting and leave the bad behind. But you guys got to agree to give her credits for argueing with all of you single handed and also churned this thread into an emotional, anger and interesting topic. That is my sister.</p>
