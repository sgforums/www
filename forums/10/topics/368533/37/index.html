              <p>Theoratically, TS is harmless, only voicing a complain, as is her right in a democratic country. She did it thoughtlessly and insensitively on our gallant boys, which in turn earned the ire of our countrymen.</p>
              <p>Being only a complain, it can easily be dealt with, either to ignore or to look into it for further enhancement and improvement of our transportation without banning anyone or insulting further anyone. All it takes is a creative mind and a genuine attempt for a solution.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, Parn and a few others went overboard with such complains and impunged the integrity and honour of our valiant men who had sacrificed so much for our country, making it safe simply by their presence and willingness to manned our weapons, a deterrant to any nuthead aggressor who might think it will be a walkover if they so much as rattle their sabres.</p>
              <p>I had spent the best part of my youth in the service of my country, making it safe, with news that were never published. The tension me and my fellow generations of men felt was real, and even wrote our last will and testament placed in enveloped with our trusted friends in the event things got out of hand and we have to go on a defensive battle.</p>
              <p>Weapons and ammunitions were 'live'. No more 'bang bangs' simulations. Rehersals were conducted with all seriousness. None love war, the killings it will bring as well as the opportunity that we will be killed or maimed in return. The bullet fired has no name and will hit anyone - private soldier or general.</p>
              <p>I am now out of NS, and only serving in reserves, which I and my fellow generations of citizens took up willingly despite the mock grudges, and understood the need for it. The war monger mad hatter is out of office and a new generation of politicians rules their states, with hope for better days to come and our new generations of youth be spared the tensions we faced, but prepared still always.</p>
              <p>Some may flee, but many that I know will courageously stay, not that they love war, but they know full well that if they flee, no one else will be left to protect our defenceless citizens as the cowardly Brits did in 1942 - our families, our relatives, our friends, which we are fully inter-connected by the virtue of being a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>For Parn to tarnish our integrity and honour is unforgivable. Fuck you! Fuck you Parn. But in the end, we males will still defend people like you and shed our blood for you, for there is a debt of honour we males must pay for being Singaporeans. It was your forefathers and ours who made Singapore great, gave us all that we are living now and more, an obligation we must repay and never to forget.</p>
              <p>All I can hope for is that you and your kind may not be taken seriously, and that people like you spare a thought for us male citizens. That there is no war is not evidence of our incapability, but rather,it proves our strength and the fear incalcated into their minds that we are prepared to give as good as it gets if some nuthead foreign leader decides to use military force on us. </p>

              <p>Good points, mostly.</p>
              <p>Not everyone likes NS, but what to do. When you got to go, you got to go.</p>
              <p>Whether the British were cowardly or not, we probably can't rely solely or even primarily on foreigners to defend us.</p>

              <p>I dunno if the troll knows this but it's quite easy to figure out his/her IP and eventually track down to his/her home. If he/she is using wireless network in school even better... apparently the troll didn't know that his/her terminal is logged.</p>
              <p>Now all we need to do is to submit a report to the relevant authorities on how a certain individual called JusticeLegal is attempting to cause public disorder on sensitive issues and the rest is history. I am sure a little exposure will he/she put things in perspective.</p>

              <p>The most laughable one is that she demands respect for being female when her behaviour shows that she is anything but a woman... in fact not even a little girl. To call her an immature little girl would be an insult to immature little girls, and insult to womankind. Unfortunately for her, when she lose, she loses, the rest is just noise and posturing.</p>
              <p>If she wants us to treat her with "respect" despite her behaviour then our NS has indeed totally failed in raising up men who can tell the difference between what is worth treating and what is best left to their own screaming fits.</p>

              <p>1. These so-called 'smelly NS-boys', are doing their bit for their country. Although forced, but they still do their part and not go AWOL. What about you? Giving birth to 2 kids don't count as "duty to country". Whats more, with your attitude now, i wouldn't be surprised that your girls turn out to be like you. And since ALL males go through NS, i doubt they will find a mate unless a foreigner has gone blind and takes a liking to them.</p>
              <p>2. Although true the NS pay is increasing, but so is the standard of living. Most of them are matured enough to contribute to the household with the ALLOWANCE they get from SAF. They are also matured enough to be thrifty enough to save splurging on cabs and take public transport so they don't have to ask parents for money.</p>
              <p>3. They can't help it if booking out, the precious moment at the end of every week, is a sweaty one.</p>
              <p>4. A repetition of previous post, TAKE A FUCKING CAB or GET YOUR OWN FUCKING CAR if you get phobia of germs. Better still, go live in a bubble.</p>
              <p>5. Finally, you owe every mother son, and their parents an apology. For what? For calling them names. Smelly is a name label. Imagine someone calling you or your precious daughters bitches, whores, sluts in your face. For discriminating other parent's sons, who risk their lives doing NS and protecting the land YOU live in. NS isn't "boy scouts" as you perceive. Boy scouts are just plaining boy. By the end of 2 years, NS turns boys into men, sons of Singapore.</p>
              <p>And you will do this IF you are a big heart person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, if you can talk so much, why not just bear your hubby a son to carry on the family name and not disgrace yourself?</p>
