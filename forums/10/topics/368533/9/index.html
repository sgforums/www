              <p><br> You mean the army don't allow the boys to take a shower before they

              <p>Will they shoot you if you really insist on taking a shower? If
              not, could you all please use your brain and take a shower before
              you leave the army camp for goodness sake!</p>
              <p>And also please be smart enough to bring in one set of your
              non-havoc and non-offensiveÂ outside clothings when you leave
              the army camp.</p>
              <p>So having air-con buses to pick up and send army boys home is
              not relevant? You must be blind then.</p>

              <p>You clean the quarters together as a team, and that includes the toilets. You don't sabotage the platoonmates who have to clean the toilets with your soapsuds. You won't get shot but you'll literally miss the boat by staying back - together with everyone else. Anyway the extra bath isn't going to help much since there's the marching and push-ups afterwards.</p>
              <p>And no, recruits are meant to wear their uniforms when they leave the camp, including on the journey home. You talk about having some sense of pride instead of whining but contradict yourself by telling them to take off the dress in which they serve. Bring an extra set along? Wait till you see how much goes into the bags...and if there are enough toilets in White Sands. Go and plead with someone else to build an XL-size locker room that's going to see meaningful use only once a week.</p>
              <p>This is not primary school so don't expect schoolbuses unless you're willing to see a portion of your tax go towards ferrying thousands of NSFs weekly. And all the nonsense about Japanese soldiers, whining and foreign brides is what I'm going to ignore.</p>

              Ah Chia I thought you anti PAP one? SAF is formed by bastard PAP
              right? you of all people should support me. Is it too much ask NS
              Boys to take taxi? It is more hygenic for us and keep us cooler.
              Otherwise they walk around with smelly green uniform full of germs
              from tekong can kill us one. Got poor pregnant lady in intensive
              care due to H1N1. Tekong so many germs you want us to die of boar
              flu. Really all the NS boy if they cannot take initative take taxi
              should just quarantine in tekong keep all of us safe. Anyway
              thankfully my husband no need serve NS as his country don't need to
              such thing. But sigh my daughter still frighten after encounter
              with green smelly monster. Cry every night. So NS boy who read this
              hope you take pity on all of us Singaporean and take taxi ok?</p>

              Seriously, are you trying to discriminate the government? 
              
              One thing, i was once an NSF booking out from tekong, although most of the time i do take cab back home and that's because I'm really tired from the training and moreover my house is near.. If taking public transport is wrong for NSF booking out from tekong, then you should use your god-forsaken PEA brains to think, isn't public transport for all to use. If you're not happy with some things are done, you can jolly well get your arse up to meet the MP about how this issue, I'm sure he'll don't even bother with such pea minded singaporeans. oh ya, you shouldn't even be called one. you've no right to be one. locking the NSF up in tekong? so should we also lock you up at home for 2-3 mths to see how you feel. i've much more multi millionaires friends that you could ever imagine and i don't see any behaving in childish and proud behavior like you..
              
              Since she's so afraid, bring her to Woodbridge Hospital or IMH and get her locked up for a few month, i'm sure she'll enjoy it there.
              
              Get your whole family and leave the country.

              <p>First of all, there's so many things I want to clear up

              <p>1stly, i want to back up JusticeLegal (the TS) and also Parn.
              Both of them have very sensible arguments, esp that long post by
              Parn further up in this page.</p>
              <p>and in case anyone doubts my credibility in NS (hello,

              back up your claims with evidence.</p>
              <p>The thing is: nobody can deny that army guys indeed stink.</p>

              <p>however, when the bus goes into old lim chu kang road, where Lim
              Chu Kang Camp I and II are, that's where the bus takes on the

              <p>TS's proposal of asking NSFs to take taxis is a bit too far,

              <p>come on, that isn't hard to do. To be fair, we have to consider

              <p>NSFs already have a lower-than-life reputation in SG. let's all
              be more zhen-qi and have more pride in ourselves. Wearing that No.
              4 uniform is not a thing to be proud of and being known that you're

              <p>since u also talk about Lim Chu Kang u should also know that Sungei Gedong Camp requires the NS guys to walk for about 20 mins before reaching the 975 bus stop? that's excluding the walking time within the Camp (can be 20 - 30 mins).. waiting for e bus would require 20 - 40 mins as well (depending on peak hrs). how would there be no perspiration after that..?</p>
              <p>which well groomed NSF doesnt want to smell good n look good? of cos there are ppl who are not affected by their appearance.. If I'm not wrong ammo command is nearer to civilisation then those in Lim Chu Kang which means you dont have to walk that far to get a bus...</p>
              <p>both TS and parn deserve to hav a reprimand or 2.. their points are baseless and prejudice.. they make egoistic comments and it would be more practical to have them take a cab then the thousands of male NSF everyday..</p>

              <p>From what the TS descibed, it sounds like the men were most likely to be from Tekong. And when I saw her/him and Parn's comments, I was disappointed. I think you are just discriminating the men in uniform!</p>
              <p>1. Do you see a police officer in uniform and complain to them that they are stinky when they patrol the streets to keep us safe?</p>
              <p>2. These army boys which I assume them to be recruits have only their weekends off to enjoy with their families and gfs, I'm pretty sure they would want to book out as fast as they can and with speed comes a little sweat. The army uniform is designed to be able to last the harsh conditions of any combat environment. I'm pretty sure making them smell nice isn't on top of their design list.</p>
              <p>3. From a microbiologist point of view, saying the army boys are a source of bacteria and viruses simply showed the lack of knowledge you have of this world. All of us are a host to a large variety of bacteria and our bodies are in contact with viruses everyday. I think your daughter have a higher chance to kenna hand foot and mouth disease from the child care centres than common flu from the army boys.</p>
              <p>4. When the army boys dress up in the civilian clothings and book out, I'm pretty sure you won't detect them through smell.</p>
              <p>5. To ask them to take a taxi home instead of bus ride, is simply bias and depriving them of their rights. They have the same rights as you and your children and they can choose how they want to go home.</p>
              <p>6. Air con transportation for the SAF personnels to be sent home? Can... you want to pay extra tax? Money has to come from somewhere. They want to save money by taking bus cannot issit?</p>

              <p>You clean the quarters together as a team, and that includes the toilets. You don't sabotage the platoonmates who have to clean the toilets with your soapsuds. You won't get shot but you'll literally miss the boat by staying back - together with everyone else. Anyway the extra bath isn't going to help much since there's the marching and push-ups afterwards.</p>
              <p>And no, recruits are meant to wear their uniforms when they leave the camp, including on the journey home. You talk about having some sense of pride instead of whining but contradict yourself by telling them to take off the dress in which they serve. Bring an extra set along? Wait till you see how much goes into the bags...and if there are enough toilets in White Sands. Go and plead with someone else to build an XL-size locker room that's going to see meaningful use only once a week.</p>
              <p>This is not primary school so don't expect schoolbuses unless you're willing to see a portion of your tax go towards ferrying thousands of NSFs weekly. And all the nonsense about Japanese soldiers, whining and foreign brides is what I'm going to ignore.</p>

              <p><br>I see, so national service is important for you guys to serve but none of you think that you all are important enough to be ferried from your camp to home and home to camp?</p>
              <p>If not, why is such service not implemented by the army then?Â I think it is because NONE of you guys bothered to tell anyone about it. I don't think there's anything wrong with sharing a few good suggestions among yourselves to make your national service experience better than your worst nightmares. Just take a look at how many Singaporean guys wimping out at the thought of going to national service is already a good reason for them to be looked down upon by people who don't have to go national service. Such wussies!!!</p>
              <p>If it is possible when you all were in primary school, I don't see why it is NOT POSSIBLE when you all are grown up.</p>
              <p>Do you really know which portion of your taxable income goes to benefit which sector/department? If you don't, then I don't see why you are acting like Mr. Merlin-know-it-all and advise us about your concerns regarding our tax monies.</p>
              <p>Feel free to ignore those irrelevant portions of my post, I only ignore those irrelevant people who tried desperately to reply my post. Especially insensible people like Gedanken and EtherealLife, I don't even want to try toÂ talk sense with insensible people like those two retarded people.</p>

              <p><br>Seriously, are you trying to discriminate the government? One thing, i was once an NSF booking out from tekong, although most of the time i do take cab back home and that's because I'm really tired from the training and moreover my house is near.. If taking public transport is wrong for NSF booking out from tekong, then you should use your god-forsaken PEA brains to think, isn't public transport for all to use. If you're not happy with some things are done, you can jolly well get your arse up to meet the MP about how this issue, I'm sure he'll don't even bother with such pea minded singaporeans. oh ya, you shouldn't even be called one. you've no right to be one. locking the NSF up in tekong? so should we also lock you up at home for 2-3 mths to see how you feel. i've much more multi millionaires friends that you could ever imagine and i don't see any behaving in childish and proud behavior like you.. Since she's so afraid, bring her to Woodbridge Hospital or IMH and get her locked up for a few month, i'm sure she'll enjoy it there. Get your whole family and leave the country.</p>

              <p><br>Public transport is for all to use, and you are definitely correct in that sense.</p>
              <p>BUT it doesn't means you can wipe SHIT all over yourself and stink out everyone in the public transport until they vomit foam out of their mouth and have to live with your daily SHIT PASTING routine.</p>
              <p>You really think too highly of your $1.20 or you are just an inconsiderate rude Singaporean?</p>
