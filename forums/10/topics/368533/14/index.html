              <p>Ah Chia I thought you anti PAP one? SAF is formed by bastard PAP
                                      right? you of all people should support me. Is it too much ask NS
                                      Boys to take taxi? It is more hygenic for us and keep us cooler.
                                      Otherwise they walk around with smelly green uniform full of germs
                                      from tekong can kill us one. Got poor pregnant lady in intensive
                                      care due to H1N1. Tekong so many germs you want us to die of boar
                                      flu. Really all the NS boy if they cannot take initative take taxi
                                      should just quarantine in tekong keep all of us safe. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Anyway
                                      thankfully my husband no need serve NS as his country don't need to
                                      such thing. </span></strong>But sigh my daughter still frighten after encounter
                                      with green smelly monster. Cry every night. So NS boy who read this
                                      hope you take pity on all of us Singaporean and take taxi ok?</p>

              <p>But the following statement is really too much!</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>We pay tax to maintain army boy they should use the pay to take
                                      taxi and go home. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">So many of them no money because they spend on
                                      prostitute and get <span>AIDS</span> then when seat on bus
                                      they cut themselves and spread <span>AIDS</span> to us. </span></strong>That is why taxi better. Somemore Singapore got more non ns boy
                                      than ns boy. So majority should take bus. They minority nd smelly
                                      should take taxi. make sense mah</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This is too much! Can this be considered as defamatory?</p>
              <p>This is not only mocking us, but slamming and painting all who wear the uniform as sexual deviants who do nothing else other than to look for sex after they book out!</p>
              <p>Not just discrimination against men who don the uniform, but taxi drivers as well.</p>
              <p>They deserve less than a bus driver?</p>

              <p>Another comment from parn that paints us as sex deviants!</p>
              <div id="post-body-9245036" class="body"><blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">This thread is so funny, suggestion for air-con buses specially
                                      to pick up and send army boys home is a good suggestion. &lt;--
                                      Don't understand why army boys are not supporting it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">As for the stinky part, it's true that most if not all army boys
                                      stinks worse than bangalahs. Unfortunately these are Singaporean
                                      boys and they simply DO NOT UNDERSTAND the meaning of the word
                                      STINK is never going to become a COMPLIMENT of any form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Just because they had to serve the army for 2 years, they
                                      assumed they can act like  WWII Jap soldiers and
                                      everyone had to stand with their STINKINESS!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Don't be unreasonable and force your own unreasonable thinking
                                      onto the public just because you guys need to serve the army for 2
                                      years. You all can always serve the army and have a choice NOT
                                      BE STINKY in public transport right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Be considerate and fair to people in the public who do not serve
                                      in the army and get free food, money, lodging for 2 years like you
                                      guys does. Don't Singaporean guys get more starting salary than
                                      Singaporean girls when they goes out to work in the society?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Grow up and don't whine like be a wussy and hide behind
                                      your national service everytime you all get criticised correctly.
                                      It's not the army's fault that you all are unable to accept the
                                      right criticism, it's your own fault.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Where's the national pride in serving the national service when
                                      Singaporean guys like you all are expecting the rest of the public
                                      to suck your cocks with a smile when you all are obviously stinky
                                      and stubbornly refused to admit that you stink?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Serving army is no longer a WOW factor for Singaporean girls in
                                      Singapore, it can only be used by desperate Singaporean males to
                                      WOW all the foreign maids or brides into
                                      surrendering their virginity to those Singaporean males.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">No wonder Singaporean guys are so mad with bangalahs,
                                      competitors for foreign maids' virginity right?</span></p>

              Thank you for your reply to topic. Really glad to see parn and Nikar support me in this issue. I am sure all of us here agree that NS boy are smelly when they book out. Mode of transportation still debatable. But I stand firm they take taxi not bus cause they not only smelly but may be carrying known virus like AIDs or maybe boar flu. This very dangerous to rest of us Singaporean. As to why I don't take cab, I want to save my hubby money. He work so hard in this country, it is the least I can do for him. And my kids like buses also. Anyway my poor girl was recovering but bobian last night got to go whitesand to buy things then see all the ns boy again. She start to cry say all the smeely green monster coming to catch her again. In my heart I ache like anything. Why SAF allow all these boys book out smeely dirty lidat. Make my little princess so scared. If they take taxi or stay in tekong all the way all these won't happen. and we won't get funny virus. maybe increase in malaria due to ns boy book out.
              I heard got increase in malaria in singapore. most likely due to ns boy book out spread to us. actually parn idea of give them air con bus good idea. save us and benefit them. hope all ns boy here will tell your officer to get bus for you and you all pool money together to get the bus. really we all tax payer sponser your food and gun heavy toll on us. I guess this is minimum you all can do.

              <p><br>yo, Aunty ar! I thot mei mei me is the worst here, you seem to be more worst then me, me kowtow to you. Guess you are going to offend alot of NSmen here again,  and now you link NS smelly boys to malaria, oh my gosh, the storm is coming soon. You really top class.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, infact i agree that NS boys are really smelly when they book out, like my bf last time in NS, especially the 1st 3 months, everything book out, also smell like shit. I had to standby Boss perfume, spray it like beckham. My bf told me actually, all of them smell very nice initially, but the damn army make them march here and there in the hot afternoon sun, exercise here and there before allowing them to book out, by that time, all of them sweat like a pig liao...that is why smelly lor. So, i suggest that SAF should not delay NSmen booking out, let them have a good rest, bath, change to nice clean uniform and bookout.</p>
