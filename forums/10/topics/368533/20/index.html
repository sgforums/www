              <p><br>It depends on how much sweat and how wet and disgusting is the condition of the seat after the army boy sat up from it.</p>
              <p>What if you were that little boy? And your Mum reacted like what TS did, took out a tissue to clean the seat for you so that you will be PROTECTED from whatever is invisible and maybe not deadly enough bacteria?</p>
              <p>Would you blame and flame your Mum in the same manner?</p>
              <p>Taking out an tissue and wiping it may seems to be terribly offensive for outsiders like yourself and to the army boy, but that action is absolutely justifiable for all Mothers out there who loves and want to protect their child.</p>
              <p>Do you think the Mother reacted in that manner should not have done it? Do you really think YOU and all YOUR OPINIONS are more important than her maternal instincts towards her own child?</p>
              <p>You speak easily of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></strong>cute <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>ensitivity <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>yndrome, but take a look at yourself and tell me who is the person who is really affected by a simple gesture generated from a Mother's maternal instinct to provide the best possible protection for her child. It's YOU, and YOU ARE REALLY THE PERSON WITH <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></strong>cute <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>ensitivity <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>yndrome!</p>
              <p>Your failure to comprehend and assess the entire situation correctly is due to your bias-ness and your own self-generated 'righteous' ego. You should look and assess both situation with neutrally before you go jump on people like me.</p>
              <p>I seriously doubt you will even be capable enough to admit your own error and swallow a slice of your own humble <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></strong>cute <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>ensitivity <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>yndrome pie.</p>
              <p>And for your information, I do not have BO like you or any women in your family.</p>

              <p>Think of it this way, if those army boys do not exist to sweat or stink up the your precious bus, which is public and for all to use, you would have no security against external forces who would invade this country. True enough, you may say soldiers these days are like boy scouts, but I do not dare to doubt these "boy scouts" ability to handle a weapon or tank in overcoming the enemy should there be a game of survival played between 2 armies. Given the blood, sweat and tears we sacrifice for this nation, and I'm not spreading propoganda here, I believe every soldier wants to be treated like a citizen of Singapore and of course enjoy the simple right to travel on public transport, instead of being forced to travel separately due to some hyperchondriac's dissatisfaction with their smell. Your having posted here reveals how ill-informed you are about NSFs coming from Pulau Tekong. One day, eventually, your daughters are going to have to go through that phase in life when they have friends/boyfriends in the army. I think they would not be making sick faces upon seeing them book out in their greens, however smelly or dirty those NS boys will be. Till then, I hope you would get out of your ivory tower in supposing that public transport is only for the clean and the pleasant-smelling folks like yourself. Do try to spare some thought for the cab drivers too. I doubt they'd like smelly dirty army boys stinking up and dirtying their taxis anymore than you being so intolerant of said behaviour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and if you really still want to argue your point, remember that, every drop of sweat is shed because a soldier has toiled to contribute to your defence and safety. Every sickness they carry is evidence of the sacrifice the soldier goes through to train to defend you. Any unpleasant smell you detect off these individuals is evidence that soldiers are really toiling long and hard so that your country remains safe. I hope you would be a little bit more tolerant of such "disgusting" bits</p>

              <p>Wow, hard not to notice this thread when i logged in after awhile being overseas.</p>
              <p>I was in the UK in the past few weeks and i saw a whole town lining up to pay respects to the hearses of fallen British soldiers recently killed in Afghanistan. Anonymous bystanders actually shed tears to persons they did not know who died while serving in a faraway country. A war that actually have no bearing on them whatsoever. But still, they come and pay their respects.</p>
              <p>Here, we Singaporeans complain about smelly uniforms and NS boys occupying seats on buses or trains. No wonder most of our servicemen wants to keng all the time.</p>
