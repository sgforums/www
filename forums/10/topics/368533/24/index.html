              <p>Five questions should produce FIVE answers.</p>
              <p>1) Do you admit that army boys stink and spread their BO on public transport without any form of consideration for public opinions?</p>
              <p>2) Do you agree that this problem can be avoided or resolved easily if the army boys regards public opinions considerably to contain and reduce their stink and BO before they hop onto public transport?</p>
              <p>3) Do you agree that army boys wearing their uniform should do their best to uphold their image as protector of this country and take considerate amount of personal responsibility to ensure they present/project only their best appearance/odour to the public and especially when they are in the public?</p>
              <p>4) Do you agree that Singapore army boys has much to learn from overseas army boys in other non-third world countries regarding public behaviour and image?</p>
              <p>5) Do you agree that it is also unacceptable for Singaporean guys who has been in the army or currently in the army, to discuss about personal/group slayings using army equipments to threaten and terrorise anonymous forumers in an online forum?</p>

              <p>Answer 1:</p>
              <p>Yes it is true that a certain percentage of NS Staff do have body odour and that is a clear problem in social hygiene. However, do note that out of this people, there are people who are and are not self-aware of their surroundings. To say that every NS Staff has odour and that everyone is not aware is not true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer 2:</p>
              <p>I do agree that the problem can be resolved easily if everyone does listen to others opinions. But it only goes that far. No one(not even any democratic government) can instill confirmity within its population. If every NS Staff does indeed take measures to reduce the BO emitted, it will definitely be of greater social benefit should the criteria to answer 1 be met. But do note again, that only goes that far also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer 3:</p>
              <p>Yes I agree that Army Boys do have to uphold their personal and military image as protectors of this sovereign state. Being as politically correct as possible, everyone should take full responsibility for his social deeds/misdeeds on society. Public image counts greatly to the generalised image of the SAF/RSAF/RSN as a whole. But it is very hard to COMPLETELY ERADICATE odour. Some people might find male perfume disturbing. I'd like to hear Parn's view on that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer 4:</p>
              <p>This I disagree upon. Singapore has maintained a relative well-rounded National Service regiment. I am half-Korean and I do know the regiment of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. I have lived in Israel for 2 years and I have basic understanding of their culture. In these two countries, they both have compulsory National Service. I beg to differ on this. Compared to the two countries that I use in this case study, Singaporean NS Men are very well-behaved in the public domain. Both Israel and the Republic of Korea are now first-world countries(or second-tier, depending on how you see GDP).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer 5:</p>
              <p>I agree that it is unacceptable for NS Men to discuss about matters which might threaten the social fabric of this nation(and that includes the issue of directed hatred). No country's defence force should allow such matters of civil and military contempt to happen.</p>

              <p>But if given a choice i would take a non aircon bus.

              <p>Even if take taxi the driver will directly shoot at you for being smelly!</p>
              <p>I once ride my mountain bike till Tampines Mountain Bike trail from bukit panjang and while coming back i encountered some problem with my bike, end up take taxi. Halfway thru the journey the uncle opened the windows and say to me "sorry ah, your sweat very smelly. I cannot tahan" with a giggle.</p>
              <p>I didnt feel offended but embarrassed. I rather take the bus with my NS buddy than to take taxi and kena critised alone.</p>
              <p>But if given a choice i would take a non aircon bus. Because i can smell my own smell when take aircon, sometimes i cant tahan my own smell also.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
