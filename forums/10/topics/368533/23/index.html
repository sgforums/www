              <p><br> Really? I don't see many are willing to admit and reply my
              questions here.</p>
              <p>Would you like to try?</p>
              <p>1) Do you admit that army boys stink and spread their BO on
              public transport without any form of consideration for public
              opinions?</p>
              <p>2) Do you agree that this problem can be avoided or
              resolved easily if the army boys regards public opinions
              considerably to contain and reduce their stink and BO before they
              hop onto public transport?</p>
              <p>3) Do you agree that army boys wearing their uniform
              should do their best to uphold their image as protector of this
              country and take considerate amount of personal responsibility to
              ensure they present/project only their best appearance/odour to the
              public and especially when they are in the public?</p>
              <p>4) Do you agree that Singapore army boys has much to learn from
              overseas army boys in other non-third world countries regarding
              public behaviour and image?</p>
              <p>5) Do you agree that it is also unacceptable for Singaporean
              guys who has been in the army or currently in the army, to discuss
              about personal/group slayings using army equipments to
              threaten and terrorise anonymous forumers in an online forum?</p>
              <p>You can always run away and avoid them like a coward if you are
              unable to reply them.</p>
              <p>I understand that even despite national service, not many
              Singaporean males are brave enough to stand up for themselves but
              are always willing to gather together for gender bashings and
              bullying.</p>
              <p>It's in their blood to run away when they are losing and I will
              not be surprise.</p>
              <p>Just needed to expose this serious flaw in our present
              society.</p>

              <p>I ANSWERED YOUR FREAKING QNS!!!! You implied as if NS man like to smell bad. Hello, we also want to impress girls or guys hor. We are force to bath in camp before we book out, we are asked to wear a new pair of uniform when we booked out. We put our laundries in zip lock bags so it won't smell. We wear perfume if we have one. Every soldier got talcum powder and is asked to used it so we don't smell bad. We do not gender bash you, but you realise that this topic is really demoralising to the NSman that try to defend the country. Giving NSman a little bit of face. Maybe, if you realise that with a little bit of pride given to them, might actually encourage them to stand and fight when the time really comes????</p>
