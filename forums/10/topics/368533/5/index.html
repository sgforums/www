                                      when a group of army boys boarded the bus with us. Gosh they were

                                      me. Their sweaty body touch mine hands and my kids and I glared at
                                      them. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SAF should really ban their soldiers from taking the bus.
                                      Can't they take taxis with their pay? What are our tax payer money

              <p>That goes to show the general impression that the SAF soldiers are getting for donning that green uniform.

              <p>So what if your children are girls, then?? Next time you will not let them get married or pak tor with army boys is it? What about your grandson (if you can live that long), then how?? No need go army is it?</p>

              <p>I seriously hope that you will kanna retribution for saying things like this. SAF soldiers protect you and you say such disgusting things about them. What germs?? Germs are everywhere, anything can cause diseases, it is your own immune system that is fighting against the germs. If your immune system is weak, anything can cause disease to you.

Then lastly, decide to sign on with the SAF and then your daughter will be with the SAF for the rest of her live. She will then marry an SAF soldier and both SAF, every day come back sweaty and smelly and wear the damn green camou number 4 and walk here and there.
