            <div class='col-md body'>There is nothing wrong with the government. Most decision made are rather right. maybe for a few. The HDB prices is this way to protect the private sector. Government purposefully market the price nearer to the market rate.<br><br>But been an absolute government is a time bomb. They could have done things wrong and cover it up totally and no one can find our or challenged against the government. Therefore there is a need for a certain amount of opposition in the paliment to reflect our voice or monitor to make the government better. Unlike PM Lee had said that the opposition will make him worry how to do his job. The opposition will in fact instead make he do his job better so he can be accountable to the the people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two things that bothered me this election<br><br>a) Frequent reminder of PAP's past record<br><br>b) The younger forumers were rude to an elder stateman like Lee<br><br>I dont see how PAP's past record is an indication of its future performance. SUre, it hass done well. Clap clap. So? Those were the days under LKY, and GCT. We dont know how the future will be if we were simply complacent and self assured under 'PAP's past record'. I am more for leaders who tell me they can manage change.<br><br>And they were saying the young journalists shouldnt be so assertive yada yada. Whose future is at stake now? Why shouldnt they try to bring their point forward? Has Lee Kuan Yew himself a good role model by being polite to people when he tries to bring his point forward?<br><br>Duh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">First of all, I want to thank snow leopard for your reply</span><br><br>who are the major shareowners of bus companies? Temasek right? so who demands high dividend payout and record profits? Temasek right? so who are the greedy ones really? Temasek right? and who runs Temasek? so don't blame the average singaporean on the street who doesn't buy shares.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">I shall rephrase it to <strong>some greedy rich Singaporean</strong>. Temasek only make to serve them.</span><br><br>yes and no. i know of speculators and opportunistic upgraders who change flat every 5 years during the property boom period and profited in doing so. but this group is only the minority. most people buy a flat to stay and the price of new flat is controlled by none other than HDB. even the resale market is in some ways pegged to the new releases so indirectly the price is also influenced by HDB.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">So, that is also cause by greedy rich Singaporean that can afford to buy multiple houses right?</span><br><br>so i must say that they have everything to do with these. although i must add that they've put in control measures to prevent property speculators from inflating our property prices<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">In that case, it is the greedy rich Singaporean that is at fault and not the PAP.</span></div>
