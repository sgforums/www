            <div class='col-md body'><p>The exodus continues<br>Foreigners more than make up for increasing local outflow; unfortunately it doesn't help consolidate nationhood. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Feb 24, 2008<br><br>YEARS of strong economic growth have failed to stem Singapore's skilled youths from leaving for a better life abroad, with the number topping 1,000 a year. <br><br>This works out to 4%-5%, or three in 10, of the highly educated population, a severe brain drain for a small, young nation, according to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. <br><br>Such high-end emigration is usually associated with less better-off countries where living conditions are poor. Here the opposite is the case. <br><br>Last year the economy created almost 200,000 jobs, far in excess of the 38,000 births recorded. <br><br>The future doesn't look better, either, despite Lee holding out promises of 'a golden period  in the next five to 10 years. <br><br>Lee believes the exodus, which has been worrying him for two decades, could only grow because 'every year, there are more people going abroad for their first or second degree.  <br><br>The emigration rate, one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis, is a blow to the government, particularly to Lee, who takes pride in building up this once poor squatter colony into a glittering global city. <br><br>They are people who abandoned their citizenship for a foreign one, mostly in Australia, the United States and Canada. <br><br>It is particularly serious for two reasons. First, Singapore is a young nation that is working hard to consolidate its nationhood and its people, and second, its defence lies in a reservist army. <br><br>This is made up of young men who have served two years of compulsory military training when they reach the age of 18. Any big outflow will badly affect security, not to mention the economy. <br><br>Adding to a declining birth rate, the problem of emigration, which appears to have worsened during the past few decades as people became better educated, will further reduce the base of this well-trained people's army. <br><br>Hundreds of thousands of foreigners and permanent residents who have come to Singapore help make up the numbers, but they do not have to serve national service. <br><br>The emigrants, mostly professionals, don't leave Singapore out of poverty but to seek a better, less pressurised life. <br><br>Lee recently said the brain drain is touching close to this family. <br><br>Lee's grandson, the elder son of Prime Minister Hsien Loong, who is studying in the United States, has indicated that he may not return. <br><br>Over the years, the children of several Cabinet ministers have also made Britain or the US their home. <br><br>Lee, aged 84, has often spoken on the issue with emotions, once tearing when referring to the losses. <br><br>However, he has offered no reasons for the exodus beyond economic opportunities, although the government more or less knows what they are. <br><br>Singaporeans who have or are planning to emigrate are given a host of 10 questions and asked to tick the three most important ones. They include the following: - <br><br>&gt; High costs of living <br><br>&gt; Singapore is too regulated and stifling <br><br>&gt; Better career and prospects overseas <br><br>&gt; Prefer a more relaxed lifestyle <br><br>&gt; Uncertain future of Singapore. <br><br>Some liberal Singaporeans believe Lee himself, with his authoritarian leadership and unpopular policies, is largely to blame. <br><br>Singapore's best-known writer Catherine Lim calls it a climate of fear that stops citizens from speaking out against the government, saying it could eventually lead to the decline of the state. <br><br>She praised the government for its economic achievements but added: 'A compliant, fearful population that has never learnt to be politically savvy could spell the doom of Singapore.  Globalisation, which offers opportunities in many countries like never before, is a big reason for the outflow. <br><br>Many countries, including populous China, are making a special effort to attract foreign talent. <br><br>Others who leave were worried about the future of their children living in a small island, and look for security and comfort of a larger country. <br><br>The exodus is more than made up  at least in numbers  by a larger intake of professionals from China and India. <br><br>'The trouble is many of the Chinese then use us as a stepping stone to go to America, where the grass is greener, Lee said. <br><br>'But even if we only keep 30%-40% and lose 60%-70%, we're a net gainer,  he added. <br><br>He believed, however, that the Chinese would cease to come in 20 to 30 years' time, when China's living standards rise to match Singapore's. <br><br>Some feel the large presence of foreigners, and the perks they enjoy over locals in military exemption as well as in scholarships, are themselves strong push factors. <br><br>They see the foreigners as a threat to jobs and space, undermining salaries and loosening the nation's cohesion. <br><br>'I just feel very sad to see the Singapore of today with so many talented, passionate Singaporeans moving out and being replaced by many foreigners,  said one blogger. 'I feel sorry for the future.  <br><br>Others point out the danger of an easy fix in numbers without regard to quality. <br><br>'Foreigners treat this place as a hotel, when the economy turns they will leave,  said a teacher who is seeing more and more foreign students in his class. <br><br>Lee recently made a passionate appeal to youths to think hard about their country. He said they had received education and opportunities provided by Singaporeans who had worked hard for it. <br><br>'Can you in good conscience say, Goodbye! Thank you very much?' Can you leave with a clear conscience? I cannot,  he said. <br><br><br></p></div>

              <p>Thing is FT dun have to do national service. Say an Aussie grad who completes his education by 21yrs old..gain a few yrs experience and come here at age 25. Singaporeans grad at 25 only with reservice commitments to boot. That Aussie is FT in demand. The Singaporean Fresh grad will be fighting for his survival at the same age in his own country. How do we mitigate this factor ?</p>

              <p>It is unlikely a 16 yr old has the resources to migrate on his own. I have no issues with serving NS as well. I'm not in the business of pushing for the abolishment of national service.</p>
              <p>However if a young foreign chap comes here and take up citizenship without having to serve NS and gets a well paying job. Naturally Singaporeans will be disenchanted. Not only do we graduate later, we are actually protecting them. Out of every 4 we protect, 1 is a foreigner. The foreigner who graduates earlier, earns more and do not have to serve NS.</p>
              <p>"Come to my country, don't worry ! I'll protect you and you'll earn more than me to boot, why not take up citizenship as well !"</p>
              <p>We cannot deny that this is a problem. At the same time we still need these people to fill jobs. However, what can be done to lessen the discontentment ?</p>

              <p>Thing is FT dun have to do national service. Say an Aussie grad
                  who completes his education by 21yrs old..gain a few yrs experience
                  and come here at age 25. Singaporeans grad at 25 only with
                  reservice commitments to boot. That Aussie is FT in demand. The
                  Singaporean Fresh grad will be fighting for his survival at the
                  same age in his own country. How do we mitigate this factor ?</p>

              <p> Comparing male sg and foreign graduates and assuming equal abilities, an sg graduate becomes a junior manager/associate level manager by the age of 28-30.  The foreign grad by virtue of having started work earlier at 21, becomes a senior manager/AVP level manager at age 28-30.  Some even become heads of departments by 30.</p>
              <p>So you can imagine the great disparity a few years makes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Wow, he still has good conscience! Can he say with a clear conscience that Sg is a 1st world city when his cabinet refused to increase the public assistance for the aged and sicked so that they can have the basic 3 meals a day?

              very lucky that getting PR for other country not as easy as getting PR in Singapore leh.
              
              If those listed countries lower their PR recruitment standards to SGP's current standards, the brain drain speed will double or even triple.
