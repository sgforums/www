            <div class='col-md body'>For those of you who missed his response to Robert Yeo's previous claim:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Dec 16, 2005<br>How adventurer Khoo sees his many feats<br>IN RESPONSE to Mr Robert Yeo's questions in the letter, 'Why spend $150,000 on Khoo's trivial pursuit?' (ST, Dec 13), let me explain why I believe in North East Community Development Council (CDC)'s Dare to Dream Fund.<br><br>I do not depend on charity and public funds for a living. My income is derived from giving motivational talks (to corporations and schools), book royalty, sponsorship and product endorsements.<br><br>Sponsorship is not a donation. I have obligations to sponsors in return for their investments. In receiving sponsorship, the same business principles apply - marketing and sales, cash flow, crisis management and customer satisfaction. For major expeditions, there are legal contracts involved.<br><br>North East CDC has been very supportive of my endeavours, partly because I live in the North East district. By doing what I do best, I hope to inspire residents of the district to step out of their comfort zones, try something they have never dared to do, learn to take some setbacks and, in the process, become stronger people.<br><br>Standing on the summit of Mt Everest and reaching the South and North poles were some of the proudest moments of my life. I was proud to be a Singaporean. The reward was extremely enriching and spiritual.<br><br>Did I do it for self-glorification? The answer is yes if it means trying to prove to myself and pushing my own physical and mental limits.<br><br>But if it is thought that I was out to make a name for myself and to be famous, it would be the secondary outcome. There are many easier ways to be famous than risking my life. There is no gold medal or cash reward waiting at the summit or the South Pole.<br><br>When I die, I want my son to be inspired by me. I want him to know that his dad is a person of courage who dared to stand up for what he believed in, and one who did not give up easily. I also believe that this is my way to contribute to the Singapore I love.<br><br>Khoo Swee Chiow</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Reference: <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/storyprintfriendly/0,5578,359204,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/storyprintfriendly/0,5578,359204,00.html</a></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, i don't know why he got funded for doing a thing like staying under water. What does it prove? It just boasts his ego, that's all. And what? that he has good lungs? If he is doing this out of his own pocket, then fine, but keep in mind, he is doing this using public funds, and the money could have been used for better use, such as giving it to sports association like gymnastic. They won gold medals for singapore, despite it not being a core sport. And now, they can't even go Asian Games.<br><br>The 'feat' done by Khoo is all about personal glory, rather than bringing glory to the nation. For that, i see no reason why we should celebrate his accomplishments.</div>
