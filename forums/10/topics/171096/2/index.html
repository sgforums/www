            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I do not depend on charity and public funds for a living.

I have obligations to sponsors in return for their investments. In receiving sponsorship, the same business principles apply - marketing and sales, cash flow, crisis management and customer satisfaction. For major expeditions, there are legal contracts involved.<br></strong><br><br>so it's all about money isn't it?<br><br><strong><br>North East CDC has been very supportive of my endeavours, partly because I live in the North East district. By doing what I do best, I hope to inspire residents of the district to step out of their comfort zones, try something they have never dared to do, learn to take some setbacks and, in the process, become stronger people.<br></strong><br><br>as you've admitted earlier, it's all about money isn't it?  inspiration?  that's part of the whole bullshit isn't it?<br><br><strong><br>Standing on the summit of Mt Everest and reaching the South and North poles were some of the proudest moments of my life. I was proud to be a Singaporean. The reward was extremely enriching and spiritual.<br></strong><br><br>this is like someone who brags about having gone to some exotic country on an all expenses paid holiday with porters to carry his luggage.<br><br><strong><br>Did I do it for self-glorification? The answer is yes if it means trying to prove to myself and pushing my own physical and mental limits.<br></strong><br><br>the example you set for the rest of the country is this.  self glorification comes above all else, including the lives of your comrades.  they can rot and die or become paralysed later on but they won't stop you from achieving self glory.<br><br><strong><br>But if it is thought that I was out to make a name for myself and to be famous, it would be the secondary outcome. There are many easier ways to be famous than risking my life. There is no gold medal or cash reward waiting at the summit or the South Pole.<br></strong><br><br>if not for your sponsored trip up the mountains, you would still be a lowly employee.  what else have you got to show for easier ways of making money?  no gold awaited you at the top no doubt, but gold as you've shown us all, is for your taking that has everything to do with that one single deed.<br><br><strong><br>When I die, I want my son to be inspired by me. I want him to know that his dad is a person of courage who dared to stand up for what he believed in, and one who did not give up easily. I also believe that this is my way to contribute to the Singapore I love.<br></strong><br><br>well, you weren't there when your pregnant wife needed you the most.  for your own selfish glory, you chose to forsake your family.  what a father you are.  contribute to singapore?  sounds more like living off singapore.</div>

The rules state that people who were successful in applying for the funds before cannot apply, but it seems that no one applied except Khoo, so they gave it to him AGAIN.

Isn't that what our beloved gahmen is attempting to develop?<br></strong><br><br>arduous to some extent perhaps but not extraordinarily so.  south pole and highest peaks maybe.  but cooped-in-a-tank gimmick?  that deserves sponsorship?  that's entrepreneurial endeavour?  more like waste of public funds isn't it?  you mean garmen is agweeable to sponsoring any kind of silly act?<br><br><strong><br>And it seems that you're conveniently overlooked the difficulties and life-threatening situations each of his task requires. As he already mentioned, there is no 'medal or cash incentive' for each of his journeys, evidently a snipe at SSC's cash incentive scheme for sportsmen. He is clearly differentiating himself from the average sportmen that SG has developed.<br></strong><br><br>what life threatening situation is there in the cooped-in-a-tank gimmick?  any time he wants to he can surface right?  it's not as if he is tied up and performing some houdini trick.<br><br>sports is something you can identify with, something you approve because it involves graceful skill or extraordinary human abilities.  we all can run, but we can't run as fast as shyam so we respect him for that.  we play badminton, but we're not as skillful or graceful as susilo so we applaud his achievements.  cooped-in-a-tank act?  who gives a damn?  just about anybody can coop-in-a-tank, with oxygen, liquid food, sanitation provided, the whole gimmick is designed for any average joe to last in that tank.  what testament to human spirit or ability is there?<br><br><strong><br>If that isn't enough, he has proven that certain dreams don't require a a huge cash flow to realise, but merely requires the right approach through appropriate channels. Campaigning for sponsorship is a win-win situation for both the campaigner and the provider. After all, you think Lance Armstrong or Amelia Earheart held decent jobs?<br></strong><br><br>that cooped-in-tank gimmick isn't exactly cheap and it uses public funds.  win-win?  he won, the public lost.  he got his fame (which would lead to fortune), what did the public get in return?  Lance Armstrong is a testament to human spirit and triumph.  i don't know what that cooped-in-a-tank act signifies.  Amelia earhart had to work hard to save for her adventures.  our friend?  open mouth only money pour in like rain.  so easy, hardly the true pursuer of dreams and passion that amelia is.<br><br><strong><br>And as to your cynical remark: so it's all about money isn't it?, my question to you is quite simply: What isn't?<br></strong><br><br>cynical to you perhaps, but nevertheless appropriate.  he sounded as if he's doing some wondrous good for singapore when in fact he is merely doing it for his own glory while hypocritically claiming to be contributing to the country.  what good has he done for the country submerging himself in a tank?  so to answer your question, why claim to be doing something noble when in fact you're actually doing it for your own selfish reasons?  and if it is selfish endeavour why use public funds?<br></blockquote></div>

Even in his interview in LIFE! a few days back, he was partially uncertain whether or not to proceed with the trip. It was after discussion and agreement with his wife that he carried on. And ironically, the only thing she's pleasantly upset with is he missed the christmas period to complete his underwater record.<br><br><strong>your sentence deserves a little refinement:<br><br>with khoo, it's about going for personal records and in order to get public sponsor for his personal adventures he has to at least appear to be making a difference to society when in actual fact nobody gives a damn. self glorification comes at the very core of the package. it is not asked, not demanded but comes implicitly and expectedly. in the eyes of the greedy, there is not such thing as greed, in the vocabulary of the mismanaged, there is not such thing as mismanagement. all funds spent are for the sole benefit of just one person. </strong><br><br>As your prepared speech already highlighted, <span style="color: red;">in actual fact nobody gives a damn.</span>, why devote so much of your time to pour slime on him? Since you consider his 'feats' inconsequential anyway, why bother to re-word it so 'eloquently' for a smear campaign that borders on a personnal attack?<br><br><strong>my anger appears "misguided" only in the eyes of someone who sees the entire episode from the perspective of just one person - khoo, for it is only through his eyes that self benefit makes sense. to the public at large however, such acts of self glorification can't be right and any resulting anger not misguided.<br><br>his prior adventures were at least adventures in their own right but this fish tank act is altogether boh liao and meaningless. furthermore, prior sponsors were mainly corporate but this time round he used so much public funds. also, we're getting a bit tired of his antics and lastly i'm merely responding to your post for otherwise i wouldn't even be bothered. </strong><br><br>Does going for self-glory have a mandatory negative connotation stamped onto it? By your account, should we then be slamming everyone in the guiness book of records who are just completing 'bo liao and meaningless' tasks for the sake of personal benefit? To have their name imbued in some worthless Encyclopedia is just a waste of resources and time isn't it?<br><br>In any case, you're stated your position on the funding part so we'll leave it as that.<br></div>
