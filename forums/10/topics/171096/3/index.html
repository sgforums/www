But again, what crime has been committed? You ignored that question to fill your displeasure. The only probable issue here is ethics to which i emphasize: there is no law. Like it or hate it, that's reality.<br></strong><br><br>i do not have the wish nor the capability to hang anybody.  the more eager you defend his virtues, the more impetus for me to highlight his moral failings.  the analogy with crime is to illustrate that the right or wrong that we have done, doesn't lessen simply because there was someone else with whom the deed was committed.  the question was answered but you failed to understand the answer.<br><br>at the end of the day, whether or not you have done wrong your conscience will tell.  of course conscience can be blinded by fame and fortune but they won't blind the common masses.<br><br><strong><br>To each his own. I'm not here to preach or convince others who already have established principles. If you deem he has broken ethics rule #1, then it's your opinion.<br></strong><br><br>yes it's my opinion, and that of many others too ...<br><br><strong><br>I used Kinabalu as an example. Evidently, the 7 highest peaks will certainly be several tiers higher as a challenge, especially to those you so arrogantly put as 'inadequate'. If you find it so easy, maybe you can duplicate the same feat Khoo did and then reiterate your contemptuous remarks after. It's always easy to claim simplicity when you merely talk the talk.<br><br>And btw, kinabalu has a ready route to the summit that doesn't require a pick axe or rapelling rope....<br></strong><br><br>well, well what have we here, another change of goal posts after the original one has been beaten?  perhaps you should climb kinabalu without having to train for months before issuing me the challenge?<br><br>we are all drawn to or fascinated by different things.  to the mountaineer, climbing is the ultimate challenge and all else pale in comparison.  but to a non-mountaineer, that goal may be of no consequence.  perhaps to the layman, who has never climbed anything higher than bukit timah, mountain climbing is as daunting as the mind can imagine that deserves the utmost admiration.  but for the better informed, mountain climbing is simply an activity which, like all other activities, becomes easier with practice.  and unlike some competitive sports, where the bar never keeps still, the highest peak is a static goal that once conquered is forever conquered.<br><br>taunt me anyway you like, it is not lack of will but purpose for not conquering mountains.  as khoo himself has said, life is short.  i'm not gonna waste it on someone else's goals.<br><br><strong><br>For your info, his wife openly stated her support independently. Even in his interview in LIFE! a few days back, he was partially uncertain whether or not to proceed with the trip. It was after discussion and agreement with his wife that he carried on. And ironically, the only thing she's pleasantly upset with is he missed the christmas period to complete his underwater record.<br></strong><br><br>i think khoo is a very lucky man for having such an understanding and devoted wife.  like all devoted wives, the husband can beat her, abuse her, hurt her but she will continue to love him and protect him and will never say a word that will make him look bad.<br><br><strong><br>As your prepared speech already highlighted, in actual fact nobody gives a damn., why devote so much of your time to pour slime on him? Since you consider his 'feats' inconsequential anyway, why bother to re-word it so 'eloquently' for a smear campaign that borders on a personnal attack?<br></strong><br><br>prepared perhaps, thanks to your original script.  my purpose is not to slime him, for it gives me neither pleasure nor benefit.  my purpose is to present the other side of the coin, that you have conveniently chosen to ignore.  if you only mention his good, then someone else has to bring balance to the whole picture by showing his bad as well.  so what you define as "personal attack" is nothing more than the other half of the story that may be non-existent to you, but is nevertheless there.<br><br><strong><br>Does going for self-glory have a mandatory negative connotation stamped onto it? By your account, should we then be slamming everyone in the guiness book of records who are just completing 'bo liao and meaningless' tasks for the sake of personal benefit? To have their name imbued in some worthless Encyclopedia is just a waste of resources and time isn't it?<br></strong><br><br>i have made my stance very clear many times, i wonder why you still ask.  pursuing self glory is a personal choice and endeavour.  nobody gives a damn really.  but when you try to elevate a selfish endeavour into something that it isn't, like glory for the nation and worse still fund it using public money, then that's altogether revolting.  i have no problems when someone wastes his own time and money doing worthless stuff.  but i will speak out when he wastes public funds doing worthless stuff yet claims to be bringing glory for the nation.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is interesting to see the arguements in this thread and below is how I feel.<br><br>I appreciate record breaking personnels and salute them, but I think this Khoo guy is overdoing it and the relevant authority should not further indugling in supporting him too much.<br><br>Year in Year out, it is always this Khoo guy doing all the record breaking and it seems to me that public funds has been used to sponsor him.  Like it or not, I feel that it shouldn't be the case.  It is time to give other people the chance.<br><br>Khoo has achieved what many people have not been able to do, climbing mountains, swimming cannels, etc..etc..  He has achieved so much and get recognised, I do hope that he is not too conceited and become arrogant and thinking that whatever he thought of a new idea, funds will be there for him to use.  No qualms for him in finding his own sponsorship or funds that are private, as long it is not a public funds.  I think we Singapore has achieved a lots of records and for a matter of speaking, it should be in a more competitive sports that is should as in games.  Personal expedition to achieve glory for nation or own, I think Khoo has done it, thus hope that this year, it is not him again for those stunts that does not really inspire the masses.<br></div>
