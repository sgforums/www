              <p>Have you ever noticed a common clause added to the end of every report about the impact of economic slowdown on China?</p>
              <p>Something like <em>"increasing the risk of widespread unrest in China"</em> in most western media and consequently çº¢æ¯› Ang-Moh's discussion forums.</p>
              <p>I have been to China's countryside (Anhui, Yunnan, etc.) several times lately. There is a big gap between the city rich and the rural poor, yes. But life in Chinese countryside went on as usual. Unskilled labours who lost their factory jobs moved back to their rural homes but that doesn't seem to bother them much as long as their farmland is still there.</p>
              <p>That is also true in Thailand now. People who lost their jobs just move back to plow their land. Laid off workers took to the street but there have been no bloody violence related to the massive lay-offs and most protests ended in a very short period of time after negotiation between the owners and the employees.</p>
              <p>Farmland works as another form of "social security" in developing economies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the West either lack genuine understanding about East Asia or have displayed their real desire to see the Orient, which has the potential to compete for resources in the future, falling apart.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I was exactly talking about this news.</p>
              <p>Similar protests happen in Thailand too. You are probably not aware of them because Thailand is too small a target. But China is a big, sweet one. The articles are mostly written in a way that it is happening at every single corner of the country and as if the people are turning against the government.</p>
              <p>And Times Online is the same newspaper, which quoted only part of a speech given by Thai Foreign Minister that the demonstration, which he also joined, was fun. In fact, it purposely left out the whole context. The story was twisted. So far there has been no apology from the writer.</p>

              <p>ease, there is no unrest in china, people still do what they should do.Making money, working. the guangdong part, is affected relatively bigger, they mainly depend on export, the export is shrinking, many factory shut down, the worker laid off, then we go back to farm land, let's why china by all means reserve a sufficient scale of farm land, to accomodate the jobless worker, when economy turns down.</p>

              <p>Won't say wouldn't care lah.</p>
              <p>But it's no longer fashionable to tell outright lies, the trend is to take the portion of the truth they want to present and spam it so often that it becomes the whole and only truth that matters. Our media has often been accused of doing so no? </p>
              <p>If our press and media can do this, there no reasons for me to doubt it would be done by the Western media, the Iraq war and the recent Israel/Palestinian conflict has already been more than adequate in demostrating this.</p>
              <p>The Western world has already been shamed by the recent financial crisis, their vaulted ideals of Democracy and Free market Capitalism has shown its flaws. Thus they are eager to show their people the "mess" that is in the inferior, no freedom and authoritian societies.</p>

              <p><br>I never quite understand this mentality. I mean to my knowledge, the US has never been invaded by other countries since the burning of Washington in 1814, even then it was in retaliation for the invasion of Canada. Unless you want to count Pancho Villa even though it was more of a raid than an actual war.  </p>
              <p>Yet somehow, they're so paranoid about the loss of dominance that it seems to defy all reasoning.</p>

              <p>Good point! However, I am not sure that is the case. We Thais,
              despite overwhelmingly under western influence, have begun to be very
              skeptical of such traditional notion since the coup of Sep 19.</p>
              <p>I
              am sure all of you usually watch CNN and BBC or read The Economist to
              follow the recent political crisis in Thailand. The people, who called
              themselves PAD, dubbed the Yellow Shirt People, took to the street
              protesting against the attempt by the Pro-Thaksin Proxy Government to
              amend anti-corruption clauses in the Thai Constitutions. The
              Pro-Thaksin people's ultimate goal of amending the law was to abolish
              the court's power to punish corrupt politicians, including the exiled
              Thaksin. These western media still held an old belief that Thaksin was
              an elected PM, handed out money to the poor and was later toppled by a
              coup but (purposely) ignored the fact that he has an appalling record
              of human right abuses.</p>
              <p>- Some 1,000 of innocent Thais have died in extrajudicial killings in his War On Drug Campaign 5 years ago.</p>
              <p>-
              A businessman was gun down in northern Thailand 6 years ago after he
              demonstrated that Thaksin dodged tax payment worth billions of Baht in
              the past.</p>
              <p>- One Muslim lawyer mysteriously disappeared after he
              attempted to uncover who commanded the mass killing of some 200 Thai
              Muslims in southern Thailand. His body has not been found until now.</p>
              <p>Have you ever heard of these things in western media?</p>
              <p>I am not done yet....</p>
              <p>Last
              year, while Thailand was under the rule of Pro-Thaksin government, a
              large number of Yellow Shirt Protesters were hit, injured, amputated
              and killed with several bomb attacks.</p>

              <p>And
              I don't want to show the following picture of a man with his both feet
              cut off and bleeding so bad because it may be obscene to you. The other
              man was bleeding after a rocket grenade was fired into the protest site.</p>

              <p>Instead,
              western media called them "Royalist Thugs", "Elite", "Anti-Democratic",
              etc or only reported "they occupied the Airports."</p>
              <p>And these have been totally absent from their reports. These ones show Pro-Thaksin (The Red Shirt People).</p>
              <p>A
              60-year old radio host in Chiangmai was gunned down in front of
              hundreds of people for he was against the Pro-Thaksin government.
              Normally, western media either did not report at all or showed only
              peaceful scenes of these people.</p>

Moreover, as the dust settled, the conspiracy theory was no longer a theory. It's true. Alan Greenspan even said publicly about 2 years ago that the invasion of Iraq was motivated by "oil".</span></p>
              <p>Have there been any apology coming out from those western media? NONE.</p>
              <p>It is not suspicion that carries on after the colonial history. It is common sense because sometimes dots can be connected to tell the big picture of what is going on and what they probably have in mind.</p>

              Rural folks are not so badly affected by economic downturns for they can always live off the land. It is the urban people who will get restive for they have no jobs and no land to live off!
