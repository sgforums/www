            <div class='col-md body'>KANDAHAR, AfghanistanÂ—In his 29 years, Mohammed Daud has seen the faces of perhaps 200 women. A few dozen were family members. The rest were glimpses stolen when he should not have been looking and the women were caught without their face-shrouding burkas.<br><br>"How can you fall in love with a girl if you canÂ’t see her face?" he asks.<br><br>Daud is unmarried and has sex only with men and boys. But he does not consider himself homosexual, at least not in the Western sense. "I like boys, but I like girls better," he says. "ItÂ’s just that we canÂ’t see the women to see if they are beautiful. But we can see the boys, and so we can tell which of them is beautiful."<br>Though rarely acknowledged, the prevalence of sex between Afghan men is an open secret, one most observant visitors quickly surmise. Ironically, it is especially true here in Kandahar, which was the heartland of the puritanical Taliban movement.<br><br><a href="http://afghanistanis.tripod.com/id13.html" rel="nofollow">http://afghanistanis.tripod.com/id13.html</a><br><br>For those who want yto study further ....search this word : " HALEKON"<br><br>It appears that the Islamics of Afghanistan have a tradition of men called halekon. The halekon is a younger, beautiful man who is partnered with an older man. One anti-Taliban told the paper: Â“The Taliban had halekon, but they kept it secret. They hid their halekon in their madrasas (religious schools).Â”<br></div>

He said he would say "aye" to do away with the law.<br><br>"Personally, I think the whip should be lifted for a very open debate and open expression of opinion by the MPs. And if that was so, I would vote for a repeal of the act. From my understanding of my parliamentary colleagues, my guess is that I will be in the minority," said the MP at a packed forum yesterday organised by local theatre company W!ld Rice at the National Library.<br><br>Lifting the whip means MPs can vote according to their convictions and do not have to toe the party line.<br><br>Also giving his support to repeal the anti-gay law was Nominated MP Siew Kum Hong, who had previously oppposed Section 377A of the Penal Code, which bans homosexual sex.<br><br><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20070716-18471.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20070716-18471.html</a><br><br>YOU CANNOT TRUST YOUR MP TO PROTECT YOU ANYMORE.....even PAP MP has betrayed our core beliefs....</div>
