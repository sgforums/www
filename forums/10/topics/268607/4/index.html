Gay people should know let such practice stay private. As long as it is private then there will be no discrimination against gay or even their homosexual conduct among them.<br><br>Let society including the church know the need for gay to live their lives even if in their own perception open homogexual conduct is still largely regarded as abnormal or a sin or evil,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gay people sodomize each other in a twisted parody of normal male-female sexual intercourse. Gays usually seek to "turn" straight men by sodomizing them, in so doing, desensitizing them to the trauma of sodomy and exploiting their sexual confusion to supplant their normal male identity.<br><br>By "turning" men at a young age, older gays seek to exert sexual and emotional control over their younger partners. This is due to the insecurity they feel because gay relationship are inherently unstable. All gay men have been "turned" some time in their young life, the younger the better for the older gays partner. Old gay men usually are lonely as their younger partners go after younger men and so seek even younger partners to maintain their dominance. This is why sometimes gay men become pedophiles.<br><br>Gays like to hide this reality by talking about sexual freedom etc. The move to garner social acceptance of gay relationships is an offensive strategy to allow gay men to hunt freely. Society must not tolerate this aggressive gay agenda. Do not be fooled, gays are men and are capable of all the cunning that devious minded men are capable of. They will cry foul when you confront them but behind your back will plot to discredit you as a bigot so that they can advance their agenda. If in superior numbers, you may be raped by them.<br><br>The only reason the gay agenda is taking hold in Singapore is because overseas gays with money are coming here to find new hunting grounds and they want to soften up the playing field. Gay relationships are parasitic and destructive. In the US. where "gay freedom" is a strong movement, the national average for single parent households is 50% and this single parent upbringing is causing many psychological problems among the next generation. Gays are lucky they are not being hunted down like the vampires that they are and they should not try to become daywalkers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reverend Yap Kim Hao, a former bishop of the Methodist Church in Singapore and Malaysia said :<br><br>"Many of the Christian churches regard homosexuals as a sin through their interpretation of the biblical teachings and I have a different interpretation,'<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/classic/news_display.php?id=800" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/classic/news_display.php?id=800</a><br><br>The Methodist Church has reaffirmed it's objection to homosexuality, although the Church's very first Bishop, Bishop Dr. Yap Kim Hao, opposes this stance. The opposition of Bishop Dr. Yap has led to his being denounced by the current leadership of the Methodist Church in Singapore, and barred from both celebrating sacraments and preaching in the pulpit.<br><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/methodist-church-in-singapore" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/methodist-church-in-singapore</a><br><br>But then bishop Yap is still preaching at some gay church........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm honestly so sick and tired of Singaporeans being so homophobic. You guys treat homosexuality like a disease. You preach racial tolerance and acceptance of all religions but when it comes to a homosexual lifestyle choice you call people 'vampires' because of their sexual orientation. All of you discriminating are far worse than them.</div>

I feel so much like laughing straight at your face. <strong>The government is the one preaching racial tolerance and what-nots</strong>. It's just a way for them to control the crowd. Racism still exist, just not in the "national" level. Acceptance of all religions? Please tell that to the Jehovah's Witnesses.<br><br>Similarly, our society is one of conservative culture. Just because you accept them, does not mean our society has to. There is currently <strong>only one person</strong> calling them "vampiries", and that is Dr Who.<br><br>Do not generalise because the backlash will whip you in the ass. Or maybe even poke you in the ass, since you seem all for homosexuality, anyway.<br><br>-----<br>All that said, I personally have nothing against the homosexuals. If they do kiss in public, then for goodness's sake, you can just turn away. You do know you can turn 360 degrees, yes?<br><br>Homosexuality is a decision they chose to take- by keeping them underground, that doesn't mean they don't exist. You're so narrow-minded it's pathetic.<br><br>On homosexual gay acts... if they wish to do that, oh well, they can do whatever they want. But the moment one of them starts doing something funny to me, that's over the line. And I will defend myself. I'm straight, you see.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I shall add my 2 cents here.<br><br>Dr Who may be the only one calling names in this thread, but he's part of that conservative group. And there are many people in this group that say among themselves or to their children that homosexuals are 'evil' and 'sick'. What's the difference?<br><br>Gay activists aren't helping their cause either when they demand for every imaginable sort of right and privilege - including the right to marry in any church, and to prosecute those who preach against homosexuality. Some of them think it's alright to make life difficult for others since they were once persecuted and ostracised.<br><br>Personally, I'd let a pride parade go on as long as they likewise let heterosexuals to hold their own peacefully. Jokes about homosexuality should be allowed to go on, because we have jokes about kinds of sexual activities and the colour of our hair (and jokes involving northern Britons and farm animals).<br><br>I get hit on sometimes in the sauna but I brush the gents off politely, and they get the message. They're people with feelings too, so don't you talk about them as if they're any less.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by binarynwitz:</div><div class="quote_body">Shut the f<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>uck up, if you do not understand our culture here.<br><br>Similarly, our society is one of conservative culture.
