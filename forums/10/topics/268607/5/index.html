I feel so much like laughing straight at your face. <strong>The government is the one preaching racial tolerance and what-nots</strong>. It's just a way for them to control the crowd. Racism still exist, just not in the "national" level. Acceptance of all religions? Please tell that to the Jehovah's Witnesses.<br><br>Similarly, our society is one of conservative culture. Just because you accept them, does not mean our society has to. There is currently <strong>only one person</strong> calling them "vampiries", and that is Dr Who.<br><br>Do not generalise because the backlash will whip you in the ass. Or maybe even poke you in the ass, since you seem all for homosexuality, anyway.<br><br>-----<br>All that said, I personally have nothing against the homosexuals. If they do kiss in public, then for goodness's sake, you can just turn away. You do know you can turn 360 degrees, yes?<br><br>Homosexuality is a decision they chose to take- by keeping them underground, that doesn't mean they don't exist. You're so narrow-minded it's pathetic.<br><br>On homosexual gay acts... if they wish to do that, oh well, they can do whatever they want. But the moment one of them starts doing something funny to me, that's over the line. And I will defend myself. I'm straight, you see.[/b]</blockquote>Well considering we both have nothing against homosexuals doesn't it disturb you that people, I assure you not only Dr Who but those agreeing with what he's saying, and many others (I've spoken with numerous people about the subject) are so openly discriminating against homosexuality and all of those who disagree just back off.<br><br>Sure the government is loosening it's laws on homosexual behaviour but not by much. You could get arrested for racist remarks but when there seems to be nothing wrong with calling homosexuals vampires and inhuman (again this isn't limited to Dr Who).<br><br>Even on one of the forms you have to fill in when you join NS one of the questions ask if you have any physical or mental problems and one of the checkboxes is for HOMOSEXUALITY. Yes homosexuality is considered a physical/mental issue here but I guess it's your culture to discriminate and hate those who are different like you said so I can't say anything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this is that Singaporeans clamour for a more open society. The government wants to give us this, including the possibility of removing the law about gays.<br><br>Its all about personal choices really. Removing the law doesn't really make Singapore a society that welcomes gays to kiss publicly or say/do whatever they want. Removing of the law doesn't mean we condone their actions. It just means that we respect them as fellow HUMAN BEINGS, and that they have their own rights to make their choices as to what sexual orientation they prefer.<br><br>Besides, removing the law doesn't mean Singapore is going to be a moral-declining state at all. Condemning gays/lesbians in the forum is as bad as not giving up a seat to the elderly/pregeant, or making fun of disabled people. Who are we to have the right to say what's right or wrong? Who are we to say that gays/lesbians are freaks, or whatever u say they are? Do u really think they are different from us, when maybe we are as full of "sins" as they are, albeit in different ways?<br><br>Think again<br><br></div>
