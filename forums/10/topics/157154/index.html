What the three posted are beyond and extreme over the limit.  so did the others involved.  They all need to be responsible for their actions.<br><br>Casual race remarks from students to adulthood about each other will forever be there. and usually taken ad mere remarks, tossed them aside all the time.<br><br>how each individual "manage" race remarks and differences is more important.  they will have to be more cautious or not say in the open harmful extreme hurting remarks so carelessly and irresponsibile except pertaining to national or social topics , crime reporting and investigation, needy assistance, help or educaton which are printed and discuss openly to address problems and improvement.<br><br>We go another country gets race remarks or treatment all the time, we don;t report to police there or write to their newpaper.<br><br>The lady that brought up the issues on dogs saliva did not manage well knowing that singapore is a multiracial and animal lover country.<br><br>She directed as religious complain rather than public health and physical safety or hygiene issue.<br><br>"knowingly that its a sensitive issues among many"<br><br>So did the editor that allowed the print.  both of them equally at fault in the first place.  if this were to be printed in a majority dog loving country with crazy animal activists, consequences would have been much worse.<br><br>it was a religious and race disaster print from the beginning. that should nvr be allowed<br><br>The editor and ST should be warned or even fined heavily for printing such religous and race topics.  As media, they should be responsible for allowing such topics although may seem or look harmless in plain form.  this form of media publishing cannot be overlooked as small matter.<br><br>it would happen again, if the any such differences topics or feedback are printed again.<br><br>" Educating "managing" remarks of all kind to all ages is the correct the way to go to prevent any such things from happening again"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people will continue to cry to the govt and expect them to clap down hard on so-called racism. Some people even wrote that the authorities should arrest the taxi driver as it was he who started the chain of events.<br><br>Herein lies the problem. On one hand, we want more freedom and real democracy. On the other, we huddle back into our cribs, asking our nanny to indulge us, pamper us, spoon-feed us.<br><br>Isn't racism an issue that all Singaporeans should combat together? Why wait till the govt takes some punitive action then raise hell? Why tolerate daily racist remarks by strangers until the bubble bursts and someone calls 999? Why not start telling forumites off when they cross the line? Why wait till moderators censure their posts?<br><br>Just like the case of the lawyer who got beaten up while telling off a punk who was openly talking on his phone in the cinema, singaporeans should not be discouraged or turn a blind eye to such blatant disregard of the law, especially when it affects the wider public as a whole.<br><br>The pain he suffered cannot beat the joy he must have felt in seeing these punks land some jail time and paying compensation.

I am also very shocked to see Taiwanese politicians still fighting in the parliament till to-date. Where is Wen Min?<br><br>In Singapore there is civility. What about Taiwan?<br><br>And oh yes, in Taiwan when people not happy they not only go against the government, they whack each other silly.....  In Singapore we don't resort to  violence and that is not because we "listen to the government" but simply we have no respect for people who don't exercise self-refrainment.<br><br>Do all the Taiwanese internet forums support English? If not, it is high time they did as English is one of the major world languages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear patdog112,<br><br>before you comment on the jailing of the bloggers as unfair, pls think about the large picture and the historical context that this incident was coming from. For this moment, I'm going to argue that Singapore does not restrict the freedom of speech, but it does not meant that people can abuse the right and make irresponsible remarks such as racist ones. Even if you want to make anti-government or anti-PAP remarks, I think it's your responsible to provide a constructive and responsible response.<br><br>In case you have never bothered to check out Singapore's history, let me give you a very short lecture on Singapore history, which will explain why these people are tried for making their remarks in their blog.<br><br>Have you ever heard of 1964 racial riot? Ever wondered why it happened? If you ask me, in addition of the political situation that time, it was mainly due to people making irresponsible remarks, which fired up the crowd. Although, till this day, historians and politicians are still arguing who was in fault for starting the riot, I will say that the irresponsible remarks made by M'sia (not meant to criticise the other side, just my viewpoint only) had directly created the racial tension that led to the riot. Right here, I'm not pointing the arrow to anyone, but the point that I'm making was that the allowance of 'free speech' without supervision can be destructive to the peace in Singapore, given its societal pluralism. That's the reason why the Singapore government has been advocating racial harmony.<br><br>However, pls note that right now, I'm not saying that Singapore should not be moving towards a more liberal democracy but given the fragile social structure of Singapore, one should exercise more caution in making remarks, especially any remarks which explicitly targets at any particular community in Singapore, be it Chinese, Malay, Indian or whatever.<br><br>Anyway, when you are talking about 'min zhu' in Singapore, have you ever considered the context by which why Singapore does not seem to be 'min zhu' to you?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by patdog112:</div><div class="quote_body">i was so shocked when i read the news..everyone should have freedom to say anything he or she likes..Wheres MIN ZHU?<br><br>in taiwan there's min zhu in singaporE? everyone just have to follow the government? shit lar..please shouldnt just listen to the government...in taiwan when people not happy they just do against the government... in sg i dont think anyone dares to do that!<br><br>why i type chinese then sg forums wont display??it shuld support chinese?</div></blockquote></div>
