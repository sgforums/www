            <div class='col-md body'>"udontknowme", I must say that this issue differs quite greatly from the GST hike thing. If the government were to just abolish the law like that, its reprecussions,including being out of power, will probably be very great. I believe that the Govt should make the people understand it rather than leave it in shades of grey while the minorities out there suffer.<br><br>The penal code on rape is labeled as "Outrage of Modesty" while this gay thing is "Outrage of DECENCY". Which means gay is not decent and people who are should refrain from commiting so. People are use to a no-gay society, the tranquility of the familiarity. That is probably one reason why people are having trouble accepting them. They are simplity not used to and ready. But it does not justify such a long wait over all these years of controlled freedom and violition.</div>

The "lemming" approach of following the crowd is a textbook example of a lazy mind.<br><br>While your supposed "generation" takes TIME to realise the truth, there are people out there who are forced to live their lives the way others want them to. If someone came to your house and demanded that you change the colour of your living room just because the people outside can't stand to look at it, would you? Let me guess....with your concept, you should just close the windows to your house and suffocate inside till the people on the outside take their time to channnngeee their perception...<br><br>The only reason why Pride Parades are held is to combat oppression.<br>Stop the oppression and we wont see "butterflies" flying down your pretty little street.</div>
