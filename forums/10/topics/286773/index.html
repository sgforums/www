            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I noticed several discussions on Section 377A of the Penal Code but I have not seen the actual extract anywhere (unless I missed it). Here it goes.<br><br><blockquote>Unnatural offences.<br>377. Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.<br><br>Explanation.<br>Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section.</blockquote>Personally, I think the principle of enacting the law is understood as protecting health and hygiene but the sentence, I must say, is pretty harsh.<br><br>The other area that makes it hard to take a stand is whether the sexual preference of gays are inborn or "bred". It is ironically the same debate as whether intellect is nature or nurture. I think no one really has the answer.<br><br>Regards</div>

The least our government should do is to grant them the most basic rights to them by abolishing the law so as to allow them the freedom equivalent to all mankind and not treat them as rejects of our society.<br><br>Since our PM as already mentioned that this law is sort of like a dummy, we already know that sooner or later it will be gone. So why keep it there in false pretence and why not just abolish it once and for all?<br></div></blockquote>Well ask your parents and grandparents what they think. Go outside PAP kindergartens and ask the aunties waiting outside for their kids what they think. Go outside churches, temples, mosque, synagogue and ask them what they think. That is society, give it time to evolve.</div>

So, when your Gen is in charge of the S'pore 10-15 yrs from now.... you could then change this law. Goodluck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess thats the reprecussions...But if singaporean could learn to "live and let live" and accept the fact that they are around us, It will be like how we live together with so many races. Compromise and a little graciousness will be beneficial for our society. Why do people have weird views of homosexual?? Why do people view homosexual in a very negative light, then let me remind them that they are around you even if you are unaware. They are just ordinary people whose orientation is being shun by society. We should sympathise rather than criticise. Is it so selfish to accept others into our society? Should we neglect them and shun them? I thought this issue to be similar as those of the past, such as religion,races,freedom and all. I think just because it involves a person sexual life therefore this topic is rarely broach. If it is not for this, I believe it might have been resolved decades ago...I think.</div>
