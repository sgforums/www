Since the issue was address by Parliament recently, I think the general public should help voice their opinions so as to help the Govt decide whether to abolish it or not.<br><br>P.S Children running around with AK?? That might be your point of view of a future but its certainly not mine. It post a direct threat to humanity existence if denying a child a AK 47 is a violation of rights.

Even though this particular issue is not properly address, we still live in quite a nice society.<br><br>But with regards to the issue pointed out by kramnave, I agree that such behaviour will be deem inappropriate for minors and the older generations. It is against what was taught to them and therefore they judge it as wrong.<br><br>But why so? Just because of some of these practices is deem inappropriate as it go against certain teachings? It is natural that a man should go with a girl but who are they to dictate they should not otherwise? Its up to personal preference actually and no one exactly has the power to stop you from pursue your own personal stuff.<br><br>Since its kept in shades of grey and not proactively enforce on them, then why is it still doing there??The longer the Govt give the public this false sense of "SECURITY", they will become more used to it. If they were to just abolish, no doubt they will be debates here and there, blah blah blah, but eventually the matter will just breeze over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The lack of acceptance toward homosexuals is often just an expression of<br>dislike to minority groups, to anyone who is different or to any opinion that is<br>dissimilar. This feature is characteristic for primitive mentality, regardless whether the person who expresses this feature is an illiterate or is graduated from university. However, the development of personality and ability to understand and accept othersdo not proceed automatically, but are developed through the processes of learning and upbringing (Boczkowski, 2003, p.25).<br><br>There are also people with unconscious or unsolved inner problems who<br>express their aggression and hostility towards outside world by condemnatory<br>attitude to all minority groups. As well the lack of self confidence is often<br>recompensed by acts of ridicule and condemning people who are different in their opinions, skin color, origins etc. (Boczkowski, 2003, p.25).<br><br>It should also be kept in mind that attitudes towards gays and lesbians are<br>strictly connected with beliefs about what causes them to be homosexual. People who believe that homosexuality is something one chooses to be, display much more negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians than people who believe that it is something they cannot change (LeVay, 1996, p.2).<br><br>Results of research made by J. Piskur and D. Degelman confirmed above<br>mentioned statements. They took 105 college students and divided them into three groups. The first one read the summary of research that stressed biological origins for sexual orientation. The second group was asked to read a summary that did not support such origins. The third group did not read any summary. Afterwards, all the students filled out the questionnaires which tested their attitudes towards homosexuals. Piskur and Degelman found that the students, who had read the summary that emphasized a biological basis for sexual orientation, expressed significantly more positive attitudes towards gays and lesbians than students from the two other groups. This experiment suggests that beliefs of causation of homosexuality do influence attitudes towards homosexual people (LeVay, 1996, p.4).</div>
