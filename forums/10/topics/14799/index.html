Those puppies were shivering in the cold (less than 10d/c) in the infamous Shenzhen street. This Mother F-ker approach me and ask if i want to make soup out of them! f-king chow C B.<br><br>Any news of Swiss eating CHINA's 'DA BEN Xiong'.</div>

It's just that we do not see the cruelty because it is hidden from us, and we thus do not think about it.<br><br><img src="http://www.imgstudio.com/lthumb/76012451543.jpg"><br><br>[This message has been edited by witness (edited 20 October 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree "three" hehe. It's because we don't see the slaughtering, that's there isn't much objection to eating mutton, pork and chicken etc.<br><br>I'm an animal-lover, and sometimes when I see documentaries of animals, I often tell myself it's really sad that we breed them for food. Sometimes I even tell myself that I won't eat meat next time. But the moment a plate of steaming hot braised pork comes onto the table, I simply forget about the cruelty and proceed to devour the delicacy in delight.<br><br>People out there may feel a much greater sense of pity for dogs mainly because dogs are commonly kept as pets and have become friends for life with their owners. As you're so close to the pets that they've become your best friend, it's only natural that you feel a sense of pity for them. If you kept a chicken as a pet, or maybe a pot-bellied pig, you may feel that it's totally inhumane to slaughter animals for food too.<br><br>I can't really figure it out myself, whether it's right for us to breed animals for food. But come to think of it, it's the survival of the fittest. We need meat for nutrition. It's either we take pity on the animals or we die of malnutrition. Unless one day someone can develop a kind of food that contains similar minerals, vitamins etc to meat... Until then, er, don't look too much. You need to eat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is by tiny steps that we ascend the stars.</span><br><br>[This message has been edited by CheekyCow (edited 29 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with C-Cow (hm...why am i not surprised by the pro animal stance from C-Cow) that it is mainly a cultural thing...i mean, are you going to eat pork if you knew that they are marched before their buyers and slaughtered after that production-line fashion...or how chickens are kept in coops barely big enough for their bodies, and fed all sorts of antibiotics and steroids to make them grow faster...<br><br>if people want to feel for these creatures, they could always not eat meat at all, after all buddhists monks have been vegetarians for millenia and nothing bad came to them...also, by not creating the demand for meat, one would be handing a message to the producers...</div>
