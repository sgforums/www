              <p>I have come to notice that Chen Show Mao, Baey Yam Keng and Nicole Seah seem to have quite a lot of charisma about them. What I mean is that these three look to be emotional magnets for the voters.</p>
              <p>I have seen CSM's speeches during rallies and in parliament. He has a great way with words and makes people want to sit up and listen. Sometimes I wonder if he is indeed speaking from his heart or is it pure spin that has been manufacutred by some PR guru. CSM has 35000 likes on Facebook, making him the most popular opposition MP.</p>
              <p>Speaking of PR gurus, that reminds me of Baey Yam Keng's position as MD of Hill &amp; Knowlton, one of the world's largest publicity firms. It seems like he is using his many hats to create some kind of synergy, while avoiding conflicts of interest. BYK comes across as a different kind of Man in White. His outlook is more liberal, as the shirtless man controversy attests. He is also personally uncomfortable with Section 377A, meaning he could be confused with being pro-gay. There are very few good guys left in PAP, and BYK is among them. He is the only reason for me to vote PAP, but his opponent had better not be Nicole Seah.</p>
              <p>Nicole Seah made waves as Singapore's youngest-ever election candidate last year. From her rally speeches, I gathered that she is humble and down-to-earth. I like her as a person and think she has it in her to make a good MP, like what Chiam See Tong was for the last 27 years. However, sometimes I wonder if her speeches were professionally-written by someone else and that she does not even mean a thing she says.</p>
              <p>CST ruled Potong Pasir from 1984 to 2011 using the sheer force of his personal character. He has not relied on spin, but on pure sincerity and desire to serve. The voters in his district stood behind him despite his troubles with his own party. What about Aljunied GRC? What are its MPs planning for the locals? Are they serving from their heart or thinking only of themselves? Is CSM relying purely on charisma to survive or does he have more than that?</p>
              <p>There is no point portraying oneself as humble and down-to-earth if there is no intention to be like that. To take the lead, one must have the sincere desire to serve the electorate. Politics is about servant leadership. An elected leader is but a representative of the rank-and-file.</p>

              <p>If you live around the Kovan/Paya Lebar area, you'll see Chen Show Mao doing the exact same thing that Chiam See Tong did in Potong Pasir and Low Thia Khiang does in Punggol - that is, serving the people of their respective districts (via Meet-the-people Sessions and the like).</p>
              <p>Of course, one could say that it's still all just a great big act- and that while he is being a servant leader, it's not sincere and not from his heart. Sceptics, as they are, will always continue to doubt.</p>
              <p>To quote The Oracle from The Matrix Reloaded, "You just have to make up your own damn mind."</p>
              <p>Having watched his speeches in parliament, I would say Chen Show Mao is definitely a man of substance. I also saw him once at Heartland Mall... he seems like a sincere MP to me.</p>

              <p>once again...the citizens must be wary of populistic politics...it is also important to challenge the oppositions aside to criticising the incumbent..</p>

              <p>sometimes, we, the citizens, need to be scolded and awakened to what is in our best interests than living in the shadows of oratorical elegance...else, our country would be led to dangerous roads...</p>

              <p><br>Yes, Chen has substance in his words. His proposal of pegging Ministers' pay to MP allowance makes quite a lot of sense.</p>
              <p>What I am concerned about is that what comes out of our politicians' mouths are nothing more than well-crafted spin developed by professionals and not heartfelt words. This makes me doubtful of Nicole Seah at times even though I like to think of her as someone who is sincere about bringing change.</p>
              <p>Baey Yam Keng is apparently well-remembered by residents of Queenstown, who were sad to see him leave for Tampines during last year's election. At the PAP rally in Tampines, BYK spoke of his weekly block visits in his previous ward and how it took him 3 years to cover each and every apartment block in Queenstown. Seems like this particular MIW has been hard at work, unlike some of his colleagues.</p>

              <p>BTW, is BYK really pro-gay, as this <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/12/hes-pap-and-dares-to-dissent/">article </a>seems to suggest? Is he really uncomfortable with S377A and wants it repealed or is this yet another piece of spin coming from a highly-charismatic PR guru? Is BYK's liberal image merely a creation of the MIW to fool voters or is he for real?</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree with that. Just look at (Dis)Grace Fu. She is so wrong yet PM Lee still defend her to the death. At least CSM has common sense.</p>
              <p>But what I am more interested is in what makes a leader popular. Is it the fact that he is capable in his job or he is simply likeable in person? I mean, why were Wong Kan Seng and Mah Bow Tan so hated? Was it due to personal or professional reasons?</p>

              <p><em>In a new column called "The Flip Side", local blogger <span id="lw_1326939271_2" class="yshortcuts">Belmont Lay</span> lets loose on
               local politics, culture and society in his weekly musings. To be taken 
              with a pinch of salt and with parental permission advised. In his first 
              post, he talks about the disturbing silence of the majority that 
              supported <span id="lw_1326939271_1" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>'s
               ruling party.<br> </em></p>
              <p>Hi, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>I regret to inform you that the People's Action Party you 
              painstakingly built across 50 years has unfortunately turned into a 
              lightning rod for flaming in the eyes of the young, savvy Internet 
              generation.</p>
              <p>Hardly a week goes by these days without someone from your political 
              party causing a bit of a stir. And that moment gets transmitted all over
               the place primarily through something called "<span id="lw_1326939271_0" class="yshortcuts">Facebook</span>" and "Twitter".</p>
              <p>There could be many reasons for this.</p>
              <p>PAP MPs might have been overprotected over the years by a docile 
              state media, so when they falter they look particularly bad.</p>
              <p>Or your fellow comrades might be Luddites tending to avoid computers 
              in the belief these manifest "viruses" contagious to people.</p>
              <p>But the chief reason might be PAP MPs having developed a natural 
              ability to put one's foot into one's own mouth.</p>
              <p>Just this week, Acting Minister for <span id="lw_1326939271_4" class="yshortcuts">Community Development, Youth</span> and Sports Chan
               Chun Sing committed a political faux pas. In our generation's parlance,
               this is what is popularly known as a "FAIL".</p>
              <p>Asked by a member of the public during a community dialogue if lower 
              ministerial salaries might produce unmotivated ministers, Chan answered 
              with this gem of a failed wisecrack:</p>
              <p>"(For example,) you go to Peach Garden, you eat the S$10 XO Sauce 
              chye tow kuay (fried carrot cake), you can be quite happy right? Because
               you are satisfied with the service and so on. On the other hand, you 
              can go to a hawker centre, even if they charge you S$1.50, you might not
               want to eat it if the quality is not good."</p>
              <p>As far as bad analogies go, this one takes the cake.</p>
              <p>This analogy is so bad, it is like trying to milk kittens for cheese 
              pies.</p>
              <p>See what I mean? Bad analogies like the one I just proffered is 
              almost as bad as Major-General Chan's failed attempt.</p>
              <p>But his is worse. Partly because his higher-than-higher education at 
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was under a scholarship 
              bearing your name. I only managed to hold fort at the <span id="lw_1326939271_5" class="yshortcuts">National University of Singapore</span> with an ill-gotten Arts degree.</p>
              <p>However, as awful as these things are, there are indeed worse.</p>
              <p>The viciousness and savagery in which the online crowd tears into the
               PAP MPs is something of a phenomenon to behold.</p>
              <p>It is like watching Singapore Idol, but more wildly entertaining, 
              provocative and sinful to partake in.</p>
              <p><strong>Disturbing silence</strong></p>
              <p>So, I don't know if you've noticed this worrying trend, but it seems 
              that the majority of people -- about 60 percent of them who voted for 
              your party in the General Election of 2011 hardly seem concerned enough 
              to come out into the open to defend you and your comrades when they come
               under heavy fire online.</p>
              <p>Now, hear me out: This Silent Majority is truly disturbing. They are 
              the ones who should be there for your party. Through good and the bad. 
              Thick and thin. During and after general elections.</p>
              <p>Look, your people at the <span id="lw_1326939271_6" class="yshortcuts">PAP</span> are pretty good at organising grassroots
               activities. I remember vividly, during GE 2011, busloads of retirees 
              and senior citizens were transported to nomination centres all over 
              Singapore to cheer on your party.</p>
              <p>It was truly amazing to see senior citizens exert themselves in the 
              name of politics. And later packed away back on the bus with catered 
              lunches.</p>
              <p>So why can't your people, young, old and otherwise, be motivated to 
              show up online and take on the PAP haters?</p>
              <p>Why leave your office bearers, who are representatives of 
              Singaporeans, in the lurch during times of online crises?</p>
              <p>This matter is of utmost importance. You need to look into it.</p>
              <p>The opposition has already gained a foothold online.</p>
              <p>Take Workers' Party Chen Show Mao, for example.</p>
              <p>He is beguiling, wide-eyed, charismatic, eloquent, effectively 
              bilingual, selfless, determined and social media-savvy.</p>
              <p>And when he speaks in Parliament, he has everyone eating out of his 
              hands.</p>
              <p>When he updates his status on Facebook, he creates a virtual stampede
               to see who can "Like" his post first.</p>
              <p>Half the ladies on my Facebook friends list are saying they fantasise
               about the day they meet the Workers' Party MP in a dark, lonely alley.</p>
              <p>So that they can have the chance to converse with him in their 
              half-past six Mandarin without anyone within earshot and feeling 
              embarrassed that they are only mastering the Chinese language now to 
              communicate with this Taiwan-born maverick.</p>
              <p>The other half, more or less, are quite convinced they want to have 
              his babies.</p>
              <p>It's safe to say if this trend carries on, it won't bode well for 
              your party in the future.</p>
              <p>Because I just checked the calender, it's not even past January 2012,
               yet so much has happened.</p>
              <p>I don't have the solution and I doubt you do, too. As far as I can 
              tell, you're not even really on Facebook.</p>
              <p>Maybe, the least anyone in PAP can do is to take a cue from Chen Show
               Mao.</p>
              <p>Then they can start to be half as awesome.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I would say so. <br> <br> I'm not from Baey Yam Keng's constituency, but a number of my
              friends tell me that he is a good MP, doing
              regular walkabouts around his area and keeping
              in touch with the ground even when the elections aren't
              lurking around the corner.<br> <br> Personally, I find Baey Yam Keng to be quite a likeable
              character.</p>

              <p>There are rumours that BYK might be gay, but he is married with 3 children. I understand he is not comfortable with S377A, feels offended when female clients wear low-cut tops when they come see him and found the A&amp;F shirtless man poster to be in better taste than most lingerie ads.</p>
              <p>Also, he has a certain bad-boy charm and speaks in a gentle tone, which swept all the aunties of Queenstown (and Tampines) off their feet. His background in PR also puts him in a good position as a MP as both require heaps of charisma, which he has.</p>
              <p>The thing that sets me thinking is whether his liberal outlook is one that has been constructed by his masters or his very own world view. Given BYK's background, is it possible to trust in him or is he only putting on a farce?</p>

              <p>He seems quite legit and for real to me, though that's just my opinion.</p>
