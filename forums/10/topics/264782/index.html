            <div class='col-md body'>Date: Jul 1 2007<br><br>TO: The Editor, The Straits Times,<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>The recent outbreak of dengue could have been prevented in view of the previous outbreak which has occurred only about a year ago.<br><br>The key issue raised by Minister in charge is that people have been spreading mosquito by their inconsiderate habits of various kind. But is this assumption proven. No doubt there may be cases of negligence among the people but was the latest outbreak caused by such habits?<br><br>I feel that the key issue here is how the ministries and the government should coordinate and take serious preemptive measures to deal with a problem of such nature.<br><br>It is pertinent perhaps at this stage of evolvement to a more inclusive and caring society that various ministries and the government as a whole should tackle issues and problems holistically. In the past, it would appear that there has been manoerving of issues and problems with legalistic wrangling of laws and regulations on the assumptions or presumptions that someone is at fault and to pass certain duties and responsibilities to citizens.<br><br>Over the years, we have already seen too many such laws and regulations passed on presumptions of such nature with penalties imposed on citizens for its own negligence and inefficiencies from HDB's own poorly designed windows, lack of structural checking on buildings to illegal immigration where old lady landlords were presumed guilty of habouring illegal to mosquito breeding attributable to insufficient preemptive measures by NEA.<br><br>It is my humble view that government should take on the larger role of looking into all problems holistically and solve them by preemptive measures instead of legalistically passing more laws and regulations to presume responsibilities by citizens to solve problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The press is working very closely with the ruling party and may have a set of guidelines to comply with on publishing of articles.  They are made to protect the interest of the govt.  Perhaps that explains why your letters are not published.   The media/press in our country is one of the tools of propaganda.   I hope both locals and foreigners who read the local papers will be aware that the press is exercising propaganda and it only report what they and the ruling party want people to know.   Perhaps, we should post in both local and foreign forums to let people know of whatever important news that the local press does not publish.</div>
