I want to help these people, but I can't. And from what I can see, it appears not much is being done to help them either,' he says, convinced that his departure, along with that of 12 other volunteers, has set back the consumer cause.<br><br>WHAT HAPPENED THEN...<br>Â• MARCH: Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, 41, a director of the NTUC, becomes Case president.<br><br>Â• May: Mr Seah Seng Choon, another NTUC man seconded to Case for two years, is appointed executive director.<br><br>Â• May/June: The rift in Case becomes public, when Mr Seah and Mr Loke make contradictory press statements on whether Case should investigate maid abuses in homes.<br><br>Â• June: Mr Loke diverts journalists' calls to Mr Yeo, citing a new directive that frowned on him speaking to reporters.<br><br>Â• July: Big divide over CaseTrust. The new management wants to rope in recently-privatised PSB Corporation, a government- linked organisation, to help volunteers audit businesses which sought accreditation. Volunteers prefer to stick to the academics who did the job, who are seen to be more neutral.<br><br>Â• Sept 24: Mr Loke and 12 volunteers walk out, citing unhappiness with the leadership's top-down approach. This cripples the group's 22-member CaseTrust committee, leaving Case with about 40 volunteers. Mr Loke says he was leaving to 'pave way for the major changes' that he 'totally disagreed with'.<br><br>They walked out in September, furious at what they say is the 'I-say-you-do' attitude of the new leaders.<br><br>Three months on, Mr Loke still feels a sense of betrayal, hurt and disappointment over the way Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had imposed changes without discussing or consulting them, all volunteers.<br><br>'We've not spoken,' he says, 'I've made a clean break.'<br><br>Mr Yeo, from the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), became Case president in March.<br><br>He proposed, and the central committee agreed, that the volunteers are to be placed under Mr Seah Seng Choon, another NTUC man, who became Case's executive director. He would assign them duties.<br><br>Before, volunteers had, by and large, decided among themselves how to go about organising their activities.<br><br>Unaccustomed to being left out of what he sees as a critical change, Mr Loke, who was the volunteers' leader, felt it was time to go when the central committee took the vote in his absence.<br><br>Mr Yeo, when he got wind earlier in the day of the possible walk-out, sent numerous e-mail messages to Mr Loke at his law office, asking for a meeting.<br><br>'It was too late,' says Mr Loke.<br><br>The quit notices were already on the way and reached Mr Yeo's desk just after 3 pm on Sept 24.<br><br>Since then, Mr Loke has been fighting the good fight from his law office in Shenton Way, where his firm of two partners has a general practice.<br><br>Cynics may think he wants to get even but the 41-year-old bachelor seems married to the consumer cause.<br><br>'For 20 years, I have been eating, sleeping and breathing this cause. I can't give up.<br><br>'In any case, I'm a person who goes forward, and not look back,' he says, listing his post-Case activities.<br><br>He wrote an article on consumers and the law for the Law Gazette, the Law Society's monthly magazine.<br><br>Now, he is writing two books.<br><br>One is on fair trading laws, his hobby horse. The other is on promoting business excellence, which he is co-authoring with some international experts.<br><br>The fair trading book will deal with what businesses and consumers need to know when they want to enforce their new rights, as encapsulated in the proposed Fair Trading Act, likely to come into effect by next June.<br><br>To educate businesses about the impending Act, Mr Loke says he, with help from 'some like-minded friends', is organising a series of forums, to start next April.<br><br>He hopes to imbue in companies a culture of business excellence that avoids sending customers away unhappy.<br><br>Though he still spends the same number of hours promoting consumer advocacy, life in his office, in particular, has changed dramatically.<br><br>The fax machine is now quieter.<br><br>Where once a fax from the Case office in the Ulu Pandan community centre would arrive every half hour for him to solve a case, the faxes today are likely to consist only of legal documents.<br><br>He used to rush down to Ulu Pandan, often after work, at 5 pm.<br><br>Now, he stays in his office until 7 pm, when he leaves to dine at home with his mother and sister at their River Valley condominium.<br><br>Before, he would spend entire Saturdays at the Case office, discussing game plans and holding meetings.<br><br>Now, he spends Saturdays with friends, discussing how to make Singapore a better place for consumers.<br><br>While friends' support of his headline-grabbing resignation was heartwarming, Mr Loke says he was most touched by the encouraging calls of people who knew him only briefly and some who were complete strangers.<br><br>'Strangers looked up the law directory for my number and called to say 'hello'. Some asked me to start a new organisation, saying they would help me run it.<br><br>'Even the very people we at Case were fighting against, like direct-selling companies, called me to say they're behind me.'<br><br>As he walked the streets, people would stop him to say: 'Good job!'<br><br>Even hawkers would 'smile an extra big smile', he recalls.<br><br>Looking back, he says, almost wistfully: 'I never expected such a tragic outcome to my 20 years at Case.<br><br>'It was a reality check. Nothing is forever, even if you are doing something that is good, that is right.'<br><br>Then, as if remembering his credo never to live in regret, he says: 'I must find other areas where I can let my heart beat.'</div>
