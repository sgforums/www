            <div class='col-md body'>Sedition across actual or cyber borders is not counted as sedition. Sedition in other blogs outside Singapore like in Iran will not cause concern according to our laws and system. Our bloggers who are seditious will be instantly punished whereas for seditions posted in Iran, but hyperlinked to our local blogs on same page, nothing can be done!!<br><br>It is all in the name of pragmatism or leadership. For pragmatism, all the principles of fairness and equity are not important.<br><br>So welfare is bad but double charging of citizens on lands and triple vehicle taxes (excise duty, COE and ERP) are good leadership as government can accumulate surpluses for bigger salaries and bonuses of NKF type.<br><br>The rest of problems like high costs or GLCs' privatising to charge higher fees and unfair competitions against citizens for business are leadership and pragmatism.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I've been reading in the papers, those who do get nabbed for watching and downloading porn were mostly those who were already being nabbed for other crimes.<br><br>For example, let's say there's this fraudster who cheats old people of their savings. He gets arrested in his home. When investigators look through his computer files, they may encounter some downloaded porn pics. So the fraudster will get charge with both fraud AND the totally unrelated charge of possessing porn.<br><br>It's quite rare that someone gets charged for owning porn per se - unless if someone else decides to saboh him, of course.</div>
