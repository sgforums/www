            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What are the changes to the S pass quota? Is there a change to the S pass levy and criteria?<br>With effect from 1 Oct 06, the company S pass quota will be increased from 5% to 10%.</strong><br><br>For Manufacturing and Services sectors. The additional 5% will come from companiesÂ’ existing R pass quota. This intention is for companies to take on more S pass holders at the expense of R pass holders, thereby improving their foreign workforce profile (see Annex I for illustrations).<br><br>For Construction and Marine sectors. The additional 5% will also come from companiesÂ’ existing R pass quota. This is similar to the current 5% S pass quota for Construction and Marine companies, which already draws on companiesÂ’ existing R pass quota (see Annex I for illustrations).<br><br><strong>The levy of $50 for S pass will remain unchanged. The criteria for S pass applications also remain unchanged. Please refer to MOM website at www.mom.gov.sg for further details.</strong><br><br>My company has a frozen quota of 6 S pass holders. Do I get to keep the quota of 6 S pass in addition to the 10%?<br>In July 2004, MOM granted companies with existing Q2 pass holders a quota for S-passes that is equivalent to their existing number of Q2 pass holders (as at 30 June 2004 i.e. a frozen quota) or 5% of their workforce (excluding EP holders) whichever is the higher. This same principle will apply when the S Pass quota is increased to 10%. Your company will be granted the frozen quota or 10% of your workforce (excluding EP holders), whichever is the higher number.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cheaper costs in west draw foreign business<br><br>Chengdu attracting record foreign investment and many blue-chip companies<br><br>Jul 17, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>CHENGDU - CHEAP labour and lower start-up costs are luring foreign companies to Chengdu, helping to revitalise an ancient western city determined to close the gap with the more prosperous east.<br>Chengdu, China's western cultural and economic capital for centuries, has engineered a partial revival by raking in record foreign investment over the past six years, and vaunts the presence of 78 blue-chip companies.<br><br>Motorola, IBM, Intel, Coca-Cola and Toyota have led the charge of top brands that together have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into new factories. Swedish retail giant Ikea and German software giant SAP are next in line.<br><br>Chengdu's economic boom can also be seen in the towering new five-star hotels which host a growing number of foreign trade delegations drawn to the river city, teeming with new restaurants and luxury retail boutiques.<br><br>'Companies are considering Chengdu because everything is cheaper here,' said Mr Wang Yi, an official with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. 'The start-up costs are much higher in the eastern areas of China and the competition is fiercer.'<br><br>China's shoe industry is one sector that has already started moving operations to Chengdu in hopes of taking advantage of cheaper production costs, despite greater logistical challenges.<br><br>Ms Emmanuelle Hermandesse, manager for the Sino-French children's shoemaker Great Yield, bets that in five years' time, Chengdu will rival the traditional eastern shoe powerhouses of Fujian, Zhejiang and Guangzhou.<br><br>'You're paying a little more for transportation, but you're making that up with cheaper labour,' said Ms Hermandesse, who has relocated her main factory from south-eastern Fujian province to Chengdu.<br><br>Chengdu's economy has roared ahead, with average annual growth of 13 per cent over the past several years - well above the 10 per cent national average - but officials are still cautious about the city's prospects.<br><br>'We have favourable economic policies such as lower taxes but, in reality, we are still slightly behind the curve in Chengdu and this makes it more difficult to attract foreign companies,' said Mr Wang.<br><br>Today's Chengdu boasts highways, bridges, a first-class technology centre and an international airport - evidence of the billions of dollars that Beijing has ploughed into infrastructure.<br><br>But that investment has yet to translate into direct wealth for most of the city's 7.5 million residents. Average worker salaries of around 700 yuan (S$140) a month lag well behind those in premier economic centres such as Shanghai and Guangdong in the south, where the average worker makes at least double that amount.<br><br>Mr Richard Morgan, a Chengdu-based consultant working on Sino-EU business development projects, said that the onus is now on Chengdu and other western regions of China to become more entrepreneurial.<br><br>'The 'Develop the West' campaign has helped to develop infrastructure and provide valuable incentives to foreign companies but Chengdu and other western regions must increasingly rely on entrepreneurship and the private sector to market themselves as a destination for foreign investment,' Mr Morgan said. -- AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE<br></div>
