            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think we should fire the opening shots in any war, especially if it still can be settled through diplomatic means.  however, tripwire isn't totally wrong also, perhaps stronger measures could be taken, for example, letting RSN or Coast Guard vessels, meet incoming RMN ships and escort them back out again.  another option would be to get some fighters to 'boom' their intruding ships on full afterburner where possible.  I doubt M'sia will fire a shot on such an occasion.  Especially after both sides already sign an agreement to refer the thing to ICJ, won't reflect well on them.<br><br>aND CX I like ur point about clown givign out balloons, haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's why Singapore is showing restrain, we refuse to engage in their petty game of invasion and counter invasion, instead telling them to back off and not push the line. If anything, if Singapore really does open fire, it will not be a tit-for-tat increase in firepower but probably an all out, everything thing goes chinese new year thw way it was supposed to be last time display of firepower aimed at all their vital parts... after all fighting a war of increasing steps will disadvantage us as we are a lot smaller and cannot afford to take a lot of protracted tiny pin pricks of incidents, rather we bow them over with a haymaker opening move.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A war is as unpredictable as it can be. By stating out the facts, we singaporeans will know more or less our chances in a war with Malaysia. It is not a far-fetched theory. No one expected Japan to attack Manchuria, but they did. What we are trying to do here is to create a sort of "self-awareness" topic on a possible war with Malaysia.<br><br>Anyway, War between Iraq And The USA is so highly publicised that the issue of a war within a week of your post is impossible. US going to war will just create a new wide-spread critisism and and maybe possible stale relations with Germany,France,Belgium and China. US won't go to war that fast.</div>

Because I rather be a parasite. Cling on to other people threads. No time and no point to start a new topic and disappear for a few days as I'm busy fighting my own "war" and survival.<br><br>2. War is imminent, only how soon. My bet is within one week. Look at the amount of reserve forces currently called up in US, Britain and I believe Aust. Can't simply waste tax payers money and de-mob, right?  Read BT, lots for major firms jittery due to war proceedings. BTW, West also took high regard on "face value" like the East. When will Bush Jr put his face on the chopping board and if he don't follow thru, see what will happen in the next election. Beside, when there is a war, no presidential can take place, lengthen his stay, good for his 2nd term stay propaganda for a job well done (provide minimal casualty and swift war and put a interium dummy govt, to US advantage....which is definately unilkely). Another improtant point, Bush Jr hometown is Texas, a place where guns rule the street in olden days and they like to have gun fight. Like his father but only finishing up the unfinished business Bush Snr left to him.<br><br>3. War is really bad in short term due to innocent casulty. But in business context, it is good in a long run. Principle applies, what goes up must come down. Business will flourish once an unstable state / hard lined bovt is removed and a stable govt is elected, spice up economy. 30 years down the road, new generation will not remember too clearly on this war incidents but like Singapore (previously), busy riding the tide of good economy.<br><br>4. I want the war to start fast and end faster (If war is imminent). Otherwise, not only Sg is suffering, 60% of world economy is suffering also. (Excl. China and India). The business operators and consumers are living in a suspense state,  no one is committing any deals, how to survuive? This is the time where who have the last laugh, only those who have been frugal and thoughtful will.<br><br>Only when once this war business is finish, we can get on with our lives and move on. By then, all undesirable or fly by night companies will be erased off the ROC. Already, thousand of coys in Sg have winded up.<br><br>Anyway, for pleasure reading only.</div>
