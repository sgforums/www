By stating out the facts, we singaporeans will know more or less our chances in a war with Malaysia. It is not a far-fetched theory. No one expected Japan to attack Manchuria, but they did. What we are trying to do here is to create a sort of "self-awareness" topic on a possible war with Malaysia.<br><br>Anyway, War between Iraq And The USA is so highly publicised that the issue of a war within a week of your post is impossible. US going to war will just create a new wide-spread critisism and and maybe possible stale relations with Germany,France,Belgium and China. US won't go to war that fast.</div></blockquote>Like I said, it is my prediction for a business decision. Of course I hope I'm wrong that war will materialise, very curel. But I hate to get caught a situation when the shit his the fan....very messy.</div>

Except, when I reply to such post, I like to spice it up. Please don't correct me but state factually why my view is wrong.<br><br>My understanding becomes shallow when war is discuss between M &amp; S. It will forever be a fiction. Could not imagine how it will take place, the roots are too deep to dig.<br><br>Tell me, how do you state your point constructively for things that will never happen for things I perceive in my opinion, which is still fact?<br><br>Still remember what I wrote in my previous post about war mongery between M &amp; S by forumner during by tripwire hunting season period in I think either the "War" or "Is it time to ram RMN boats?" threads? True enough, it was reported in The New Strait Times the very next day about Young PAP war mongering effort. I predicted that this will happen and it did, only sooner. We were really caught with our pants down for doing thing that was started by M side. When we tell Young PAP to stop all these war mongerging discussion, we were seen as a guilty parties to the mistake, stupid right? It was really a disservice to SG by those Young PAP suckers and we have had. Forumners are too naive and not cunning in comparison with M and though that " Chue Kong , there song" and nothing will happen, fat hope. We are always caught unprepared and worst, for things not in our favor. I not boasting but I saw it coming and it did. Remember a post"Anti-SG Forum" by someone. M can also do the same to us. I wonder what will happen if M also reported that SG forum also had war mongers.  Would those guilty parties say "It's me, It's me, let me take the blame, I'll be the hero"?<br><br>Which is why I don't advocate / encourage war subject and thus never welcome in any of such discussion. The truth is too hard to bear when it is lighted. Also, when I see one such post, I enjoy "messing" it up.<br><br>And last reply to your post, derogatory post received derogatory reply, vis a vis,which suit it quite well.</div>

That's why I gave my opinion, which still hold water and is an undeniable fact, not fiction. May as well discuss, when can Singapore have a clonaid!!!<br><br>More realistic discussion, I say within one week from my post, 85% chance that US-Iraq might erupt. Within two - three days thereafter the war, petrolum price will rise between 8 - 10 cents/litres.<br><br>Rather than when and how M is eating S bullet or craps like that!!!! Dream on........</div></blockquote>The prediction came true for the petrol part. See Straits Times 12 Feb 02 under home section or http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,171192,00.html?.  Petrol price had increased. Only error, I guess the other way round. That means that thre will be another round of increase when the war start.<br><br>See whether my prediction of war within a week from 11 Feb 03 come true.

            <div class='col-md body'>with so much commercial traffic there and all the sabre rattling, rsn and malaysian naval ships near pedra branca are very likely to have an accident soon, guns covered or not as you mentioned. once the ships start play bumper cars, and someone gets his head knocked and pride hurt, some bloodthirsty finger pointing and blame shifting will start. looking at how the malaysians explained that the absence of malaysian ships patrolling pedra branca caused the rss courageous accident, i think they'll come up with an incredible explanation how the accident was totally singapore's fault.<br><br>personally, i think that the rss courageous deaths were the first singapore casualties in the claim over pedra branca.</div>
