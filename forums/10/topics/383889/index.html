              <p>The Straits Times.   Dec 4, 2009</p>
              <p>By Elena Chong, Courts Correspondent</p>
              <p>A CHINESE national was jailed for nine weeks on Friday for throwing two lighted match sticks at her lover’s fish farm and caused damage of more than $200,000.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cleaner Liu Gui Ling, 37, a Singapore permanent resident</strong></span>, admitted to mischief at the fish farm at sea off Pasir Ris at about 2am on April 9.</p>
              <p>A Community Court heard that the night before, Liu and her lover, Mr Goh Khoon Heng, 53, the fish farm owner, had a dispute over some financial and personal matters.</p>
              <p>At about 2am, she lighted two match sticks and threw them into the trash bags at the fish farm. Some structures of the fish farm caught fire, causing damage of between $220,000 and $230,000.</p>
              <p>Liu, who surrendered herself to the police, told Judge Soh Tze Bian in between sobs that she had a two-year-old child with her lover, and that they planned to wed next year.</p>
              <p>She could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Karen Wong<br>Fri, Nov 02, 2007<br>The New Paper</p>
              <p>SHE was his regular masseuse.</p>
              <p>But when he stopped going to her, the China national began stalking him.</p>
              <p>He claimed that she phoned him several times and showed up at his office and his home a few times. She even went to his office and refused to budge when she was asked to leave.</p>
              <p>Another time, she stuck notices about her grievances against him on his car.</p>
              <p>It got so bad that businessman Howe Jee Tian, 55, who is married with a 19-year-old daughter, took out a private summons against her.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Song Jing, who is now a Singapore PR</span></strong>, was found guilty of criminal trespass, mischief and using criminal force after a three-day hearing. The district court fined her a total of $1,000.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Mr Howe, managing director of a building contracting company, got to know Song in 2003 at a massage parlour in Holland Road.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Song was his masseuse</span></strong> whenever he visited that parlour.</p>
              <p>She later moved to another massage parlour at International Plaza in Tanjong Pagar and he continued to be her customer.</p>
              <p>When he stopped going to her sometime last year, Song began to pester and stalk him.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, there is no law against stalking and Song was taken to court for the offences she committed in the course of it.</p>
              <p>The court heard that on 26 Aug last year , Song went to Mr Howe’s office at Gul Lane, burst into his room unannounced and interrupted a meeting he was having with his accounts manager. He asked her to leave, but she ignored him. She just sat on a chair, stayed silent and refused to budge.</p>
              <p>He then called the police.</p>
              <p>Still, she refused to leave until after the police arrived and spoke to her.</p>
              <p>Three months later, at about 10am, one of Mr Howe’s employees noticed Song pasting pieces of paper on his car parked outside his office building.</p>
              <p>The employee told Mr Howe what was happening and he went out to investigate.</p>
              <p>He said he saw Song pasting notices listing her grievances about their relationship on his car. He snapped a photograph of her with his handphone camera and told her to stop.</p>
              <p>COMMOTION</p>
              <p>She turned around, shouted at him and grabbed his collar. She continued shouting and refused to let go of his shirt.</p>
              <p>Mr Howe’s foreman and two other workers saw the commotion and came to his aid.</p>
              <p>He had to send his car for cleaning later, spending $175 to get all the glue marks removed.</p>
              <p>One day during the trial in July, Song – who was representing herself – started laughing and crying. An ambulance had to be called for her and the trial was postponed to another day.</p>
              <p>District Judge Eddy Tham found Song guilty of committing mischief, using criminal force by grabbing MrHowe, and trespass.</p>
              <p>She pleaded for leniency saying that she had come from China in 2001 to work as a beautician and later a masseuse. She is married with one son.</p>
              <p>She added that she was suffering from depression.</p>
              <p>Judge Tham fined her $1,000 and ordered that she compensate Mr Howe the cost of cleaning his car.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘There were no aggravating factors in the present case, but neither were there any exceptional mitigating circumstances.’</p>
              <p>He noted that despite Song’s claim of depression, she could not show the court how her condition reduced her culpability.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘She had continually harassed Howe despite Howe repelling her, time and again. She did not show any remorse for her actions.</p>
              <p>‘She defiantly claimed trial even when there was not much of a defence….’</p>
              <p>Judge Tham also noted that Song is not ‘impoverished’, as she is employed as a masseuse and could afford to pay a private investigator $5,000 to get information on Mr Howe.</p>
              <p>She has filed an appeal against her sentence.</p>
              <p>Mr Howe’s lawyer, Mrs Christine Sekhon from Sant Singh Partnership, declined to comment on the case, as the appeal is pending.</p>

              <p>A foreigner needs to acquire a Employment Pass before he/she is
              eligible to apply for PR</p>
              <p>An EP requires around a monthly 2500 salary in order to
              have.</p>
              <p>The government assumes that if your CPF contribution rate is
              25%(my memory's kinda bad on the actual percentage) of 2500, then
              you are eligible for EP. The ministry don't bother checking on the
              employer or employee on whether 2500 has really exchanged hands.
               </p>
              <p>So some foreigner could cheat the system by contributing more of
              their actual salary into the CPF, giving the illusion that he/she
              is earning 2500 and above.</p>
              <p>I'm assuming this is how this women became PR. And since the
              only requirement for a PR to become citizen is to be a PR for 2
              years, becoming a PR is pretty much a guranteed citizenship.</p>

              <p>overheard from a conversation between me and 2 American and Japanese colleagues that my company is bringing in more ppl via the Landed PR Scheme. So out of curiosity, googled it and found it to be almost like a express road to PR. The foriegners apply for the PR even before they reach Singapore and as long as they find a job within 12 months, their PR status can be granted in double time! Another policy from the MIW!</p>

Successful applicants have ONE (1) year to find a job or relocate their families to Singapore, upon which permanent residence will be granted.</p>

              <p><br>Wise words...</p>
              <p>.. but must at least try to do something about it as a responsible citizen leh.</p>
              <p>O'wise, those elite uncaring faces will increase their own salaries by 60 p/c after the next GE, just as they did <strong>AFTER</strong> the 2006 General Elections.</p>
              <p>Those elite uncaring faces are self-serving and calculative people, you know...</p>
              <p>They won't have any qualms, or conscience, to add more diamonds into their own pockets if they think they can get away with it.</p>
              <p>In fact, they will tell you that they are doing you a favor as they actually deserve more than what they are paid...  (between 2 - 5 times more than Barrack Obama).</p>
              <p>Yes, governing Singapore is definitely more difficult than governing the USA, France, Germany, U K, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan... et al.</p>
              <p>That's why being paid 2 - 5 times the salary of Barrack Obama is not enough for them...</p>
