              <p>Why not? as long as you are earning a honest living, qualify yourself to be a PR, in fact they are better than some of those foreign educated ones who committed crime in our country.</p>
              <p>During my school days, there was this bangala guy doing cleaning for our house and pubs, he works very hard, my father paid him well, he went to study ITE at nite, managed to get a Singapore indian girl and married her, now he is a PR, with two lovely singaporean kids and a cleaning business of his own, and he is still working very hard and happy too. My conclusion is, people who struggled their life in other countries, can see the true differences of poor and good living condition. Singapore is alway an nice place in the view of those peoples you catergorised above, it is only our peoples who never been thru true hardship, been spoonfeeded thru years by government and parents, will find hell here even if it is a heavenly place. For some of our local peoples had become complacency here.  </p>

              <p>The research, carried out by think tank the New Economics Foundation, says hospital cleaners create £10 of value for every £1 they are paid.</p>
              <p>It claims bankers are a drain on the country because of the damage they caused to the global economy.</p>
              <p>They reportedly destroy £7 of value for every £1 they earn. Meanwhile, senior advertising executives are said to “create stress”.</p>
              <p>The study says they are responsible for campaigns which create dissatisfaction and misery, and encourage over-consumption.</p>
