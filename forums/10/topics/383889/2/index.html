              <p>overheard from a conversation between me and 2 American and
              Japanese colleagues that my company is bringing in more ppl via the
              Landed PR Scheme. So out of curiosity, googled it and found it to
              be almost like a express road to PR. The foriegners apply for the
              PR even before they reach Singapore and as long as they find a job
              within 12 months, their PR status can be granted in double time!
              Another policy from the MIW!</p>

              <p>A debatable possibility.</p>
              <p>Quite a sizeable chunk of them(majority, really) stayed as PR even though they've been working for like a decade here. </p>
              <p>Why not? Except for housing, they pretty much enjoy the same benefits.</p>
              <p>Actually i realised that after talking with my colleagues, in the next upcoming election, the odds are is that the voting majority would still vote for the PAP.</p>
              <p>Why you would say?</p>
              <p>We forget that with the influx of immigrants, a lot of people are looking for a place to rent. So anyone who is willing to let out a room(or a spare flat) would enjoy an additional monthly income. I would say this number of people are very significant.</p>
              <p>Yes, it may go either way on whether the new citizens are going to continue voting for the PAP. But i think the choices of the people who are benefitting from the income these immigrants bring would be far more predictable.</p>

              <p>Ya, my nearby coffee shops' cleaners paid was $800/mth, after that Lim Swee Say and Chan Soon Seng visited them and asked them to upgrade at e2i, now their paid is $1200, more friendly and well mannered, also they use better equipped trolleys to collect plates and special digital dish washers that they used it with ease. Coffee shops boss removed some of the PRC workers, now older singaporeans got work, more paid and more friendly. I think we shouldn't laugh at being called a skill cleaner, at least they qualified to work in hotel if coffee shop decided to retrench them, in another words, skills is there and being skill motivate one to work, and also one become more marketable in the economy.</p>

              <p>A CHINESE national was jailed for nine weeks on Friday for throwing two lighted match sticks at her lover's fish farm and caused damage of more than $200,000.</p>
              <p>Cleaner Liu Gui Ling, 37, a Singapore permanent resident, admitted to mischief at the fish farm at sea off Pasir Ris at about 2am on April 9.</p>
              <p>A Community Court heard that the night before, Liu and her lover, Mr Goh Khoon Heng, 53, the fish farm owner, had a dispute over some financial and personal matters.</p>
              <p>At about 2am, she lighted two match sticks and threw them into the trash bags at the fish farm. Some structures of the fish farm caught fire, causing damage of between $220,000 and $230,000.</p>
              <p>Liu, who surrendered herself to the police, told Judge Soh Tze Bian in between sobs that she had a two-year-old child with her lover, and that they planned to wed next year.</p>
              <p>She could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined.</p>

              <p>Ya, my nearby coffee shops' cleaners paid was $800/mth, after that Lim Swee Say and Chan Soon Seng visited them and asked them to upgrade at e2i, now their paid is $1200, more friendly and well mannered, also they use better equipped trolleys to collect plates and special digital dish washers that they used it with ease. Coffee shops boss removed some of the PRC workers, now older singaporeans got work, more paid and more friendly. I think we shouldn't laugh at being called a skill cleaner, at least they qualified to work in hotel if coffee shop decided to retrench them, in another words, skills is there and being skill motivate one to work, and also one become more marketable in the economy.</p>

              <p>tan reborn<br> <br> If you look around, not only the China Chinese but also other
              races. Particularly, the Pinoy and Pinay.<br> <br> I stay in a location where 20 yrs ago one hardly find Indian but
              recently the proportion of india Indian in supermarket and shopping
              centres are more than the Singapore Malay that I am seeing

              <p>Don't forget singaporean indian population has increased from 7.1% to 9.2%. As of this year, there are 3.2 million Singaporean. If you inlcude the 1.8 million non-singaporean residents, the percentage of indian population  (both Singaporean and india indian) of the entire 5 million should be about 15% or even higher. If you put the indian together other south asians, their population could be more than 20% of 5 million Singapore residents. That's is definitely higher than 14% malay population. </p>
