              <p>I beg to differ. Tell any rational person about the pay of the
              Singaporean ministers and see whats their reaction. + recent losses
              by Temasek and Mat Selemat "Houdini". Talk about overpaid, overfed
              monkeys. The only way I think they can defuse public anger is to
              reduce their pay but I think they will only announce that on
              April's Fool Day.</p>

              <p>Does the losses of Temasek affect your life ? Does the pay of Singaporean ministers affect your life ? They don't. That is why I'm saying that Singaporeans are not as angry as the Malaysians. Complaining about the government and Singapore has been the our favourite hobby for decades but come election day, people are still voting for the PAP. The Malaysian opposition can promise to scrap the NEP, can promise to weed out corruption etc, things that affects peoples lives. What can and have the Singaporean opposition promise you that will change your life ? Don't get me wrong, I'm not running them down. Its just that we already a very strong government but few ministers should really resign (Raymond Lim and Wong Kan Seng).</p>

              <p>Don't get me wrong, I think they are paid too much as compared to governments overseas and i do not like it when Temasek loses money as well. However, if Temasek never lose money and if the ministers draws a salary similar to yours, what difference does it make to your life ? It'll just make you feel better thats all. I'm not trying to change your views or anything like that. I'm just trying say that we have very different problems as compared to the Malaysians. They have problems that directly affect their lives (NEP, Corruption, ministers waving the keris etc, religious issues etc).</p>

              <p>When you can't go into the local medical faculty with straight As because of quotas and the education minister waves the keris at you when you complain, it affects your bloody life. I can don't convert but what can i do when my church and temple is pulled down and not replaced ? I can don't convert but what happens when my spouse does and naturally so does my kid ? This affects your life. Corruption is not only about money. Corruption is about shoddy public works, inefficiency, denial of fair competition etc. We can perhaps pay the ministers 10million each legally and Singapore will still run as it is. We start getting businesses to pay the ministers 10million each, we are screwed. It is no coincidence that the world's most screwed people are living in very corrupt countries, its not just about the money your government earns. As i said, we have very different problems from Malaysia. Problems that may not be big enough to change governments, I may be wrong but that is what i feel.</p>

              <p>I can agree there are different problems between Malaysia and
              Singapore. There's another list I will probably go into in the
              future. The severity are about the same.</p>
              <p>The NEP affecting normal people and not helping the poor as it
              is intended to resulted in Malay defection, not just Indian and
              Chinese disgruntlement. That I can agree.</p>
