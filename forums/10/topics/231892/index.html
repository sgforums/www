            <div class='col-md body'>IN THE Review article, 'To receive, S'poreans must learn to give' (ST, Jan 11), Ms Salma Khalik argued that the Human Organ Transplant Act, which states that specified organs taken from deceased persons can be given only to Singaporeans or permanent residents, is selfish.<br><br>This is because if no Singapore citizen or permanent resident is waiting for an organ, it cannot be harvested, even if there are foreigners who need it urgently.<br><br>A Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesman responded by saying that 'We don't want to be seen as doing a tourist trade in organs. We don't want to see a waiting list of foreign patients.'<br><br>Ms Khalik had earlier pointed out that Singaporeans have no qualms getting organs from abroad. I would go further.<br><br>The MOH spokesman's explanation is politically correct. Organ trading is frowned upon and usually not allowed in countries where political correctness reigns. However, it is entirely irrational and medically incorrect.<br><br>No one is harmed by harvesting an organ for transplant into a foreigner needing it desperately when there is no potential local recipient.<br><br>On the contrary, a life is likely to be saved. Whether money changes hands is irrelevant. If a person needing an organ transplant is willing to pay for it, what is wrong in us allowing this, so long as Singaporeans and permanent residents take priority over foreigners?<br><br>To go further, our law which prohibits live-donor organ transplant whenever there is a contract or arrangement is irrational.<br><br>Healthy people can live with one kidney or after having part of their liver removed. If monetary incentive makes a potential living donor more willing to save another life, what is wrong in allowing that?<br><br>What is important is that a competent doctor must have assessed and determined that the potential donor's health is not at risk when he gives away the required organ or part of it.<br><br>Once that has been confirmed, whether the living donor is doing it from the goodness of his heart, or because he needs money desperately, the fact is that another life is saved.<br><br>So long as the donor is fully appraised of the risks and consents voluntarily, who are we to decide for him?<br><br>Some years back, a TV personality was allowed to receive part of the liver of her fiancee, yet an Indian woman in a similar dire situation was not allowed to receive a transplant.<br><br>This probably was because it could not be confirmed then that there were no commercial considerations involved. So that poor woman died.<br><br>This contrast is ethically very muddy. It should not happen again.<br><br>Dr Lee Wei Ling<br>National Neuroscience Institute<br><br>NO REASON FOR BAN<br><br>If a person needing a transplant is willing to pay for it, what is wrong in us allowing this, so long as S'poreans and PRs take priority over foreigners?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>View organ donation as gift to another human<br><br>I REFER to the article by Ms Salma Khalik on the willingness - and even the potential - for Singaporeans to donate organs for non-Singaporeans and overseas patients.<br><br>The Bone Marrow Donor Programme (BMDP) endorses the philosophy that organ donation should be viewed as a gift to another human being, irrespective of where he may be in the world.<br><br>BMDP has a register of 40,000 individuals who have pledged to donate bone marrow to any patient with matching DNA who requires a transplant of bone-marrow stem cells to survive. BMDP works with similar registers around the world to provide this donation.<br><br>While we maintain confidentiality between donor and patient, I do not recall any occasion when a donor has refused to help a patient on the grounds that the patient is either not a Singaporean or a resident here. The spirit in which our donors come forward to donate bone marrow is humbling in the extreme and in a personal capacity - as the mother of a transplant patient - and as president of BMDP, I thank all of them for their selflessness and generosity.<br><br>It is perhaps time for a change in the conventional wisdom. Singapore offers excellent medical facilities and infrastructure and we can surely support a climate wherein patients who require any kind of transplant can benefit from the same philosophy that we nurture in BMDP.<br><br>Jane Prior (Ms)<br>President<br>Bone Marrow Donor Programme<strong></strong></div>

BMDP works with similar registers around the world to provide this donation.<br><br>While we maintain confidentiality between donor and patient, I do not recall any occasion when a donor has refused to help a patient on the grounds that the patient is either not a Singaporean or a resident here. The spirit in which our donors come forward to donate bone marrow is humbling in the extreme and in a personal capacity - as the mother of a transplant patient - and as president of BMDP, I thank all of them for their selflessness and generosity.<br><br>It is perhaps time for a change in the conventional wisdom. Singapore offers excellent medical facilities and infrastructure and we can surely support a climate wherein patients who require any kind of transplant can benefit from the same philosophy that we nurture in BMDP.<br><br>Jane Prior (Ms)<br>President<br>Bone Marrow Donor Programme[b]</strong>[/b]</blockquote></div>
