The spray-painted message: 'O $ Pay $, No $ Sell Kidney.'<br><br>On the beautiful streets, most of the poor have at least one operation scar.<br><br>A woman asked her unemployed husband to find a job.

            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum 19 Jan 2007<br><br>IN 'BAN on organ trading entirely irrational' (ST, Jan 16), Dr Lee Wei Ling argues that it is 'entirely irrational and medically incorrect' to ban organ trading because 'no one is harmed... a life is likely to be saved... and whether money changes hands is irrelevant'.<br>Though motivated by a desire to see more lives saved, Dr Lee's position is a slippery slope that can lead to inequality and exploitation.<br><br>Once we put a monetary value to human organs and they become marketable products, people will take a different stance towards organ donation. Why donate a kidney when one can post an offer on eBay and make some money?<br><br>When torn between earning $10,000 from a kidney sale and getting nothing out of it, we know how money-conscious Singaporeans will decide. Greed will displace altruism. This will translate into a diminished supply of free organs.<br><br>Legalisation of the organ market benefits the rich most. The poor who do not have enough financial means to pay for expensive organs, operation costs and hospital fees will then have to wait longer for whatever is in the reduced pool of free organs. With the sale of human organs banned, rich or poor all wait in line.<br><br>Besides, why would the rich assume the risk of transplant to donate their organs to their loved ones when they can pay others to do so?<br><br>Dr Lee argues that 'so long as the donor is fully apprised of the risks and consents voluntarily, who are we to decide for him?'<br><br>Unfortunately, not everyone makes decisions with full understanding of the long-term consequences. Some may be blinded by greed or desperation, while others may be immature and myopic. For some, an organ sale could present an opportunity to break out of poverty, to settle a bad debt, to possess a dream car.<br><br>As our brother's keepers to some extent, we need to protect our fellowmen from making decisions that they may regret later.<br><br>There are horror stories in Latin America of traffickers faking adoption of children or kidnapping them to harvest their organs for sale to rich families.<br><br>What starts off as an incentive to encourage organ donation or a gesture of gratitude to donors could blow the lid off Pandora's box. It would be wise to keep the lid on.<br><br>Seto Hann Hoi<br><br></div>

'O $ Pay $, No $ Sell Kidney''; ST, Jan 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> on Dr Lee Wei Ling's call to allow organ trading.<br>It is not easy to be objective when we are thinking about issues that evoke basic human emotions like love and fear. Mdm Lim is quite right to say that if we allow the sale of human organs in Singapore, the rich will buy and the poor will sell. That is the nature of demand and supply in a free market, so why are we suddenly so shocked and fearful that money can do quite a bit of magic? In fact, Singaporeans are already buying organs from outside Singapore because we can afford it and it is an option.<br><br>However, I do not think that's the spirit of Dr Lee's argument for legalising the sale of human organs in Singapore. Someone has to be objective. If a good person like Mdm Lim could point out the possible evil consequences of such a proposal, then I am infinitely grateful that there is another person such as Dr Lee, who's both objective and brave enough to point out the obvious good in such a proposal: It will save lives, and each life is precious.<br><br>I am sure that any competent government would have the ability to put in place checks and balances to prevent abuse and to stop the poor from being further disadvantaged, and implement them well enough for real benefits to be seen.<br><br>Jim Chow Wen Kah<br><br></div>
