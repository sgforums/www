So the British government tried to cut the backlog by paying doctors more for seeing more patients. They fund it by raising taxes and hospitals who cut their backlog get more money whilst those who do badly get their funding cut. Over the past three years, the salaries of GPs in UK have jumped by a third.<br><br>Are Singaporeans willing to pay more in taxes? No, I don't think so.<br><br>Get treatment early. Those who can afford it should go to the private sector. There are plenty of doctors who are more than happy to see new patients in private clinics and hospitals. But Singaporeans want healthcare cheap and all flock to public hospitals which are overloaded with work. Do we want doctors to see more patients but spend too little time to give the right amount of attention?<br><br>Make a fuss and jump the queue will get you seen earlier, but it means someone else who does not know how to complain will be seen later. The problem is just passed on to some other unfortunate soul.<br><br>So the solution is to bring in more cheap foreign doctors with lesser qualifications. But we are not willing to compromise on standards. Why not take in more medical students? We have, but once they qualify as specialists they will leave for private hospitals. My ex-student leaves immediately to work in a private hospital once he qualifies as a specialist and immediately earns more than me as his teacher. How does training more doctors help when the problem is not that we lack doctors, but too many doctors leaving for the private sector.<br><br>As long as public hospital charges are so much lower and people are willing to wait 4 months rather than go to the private sector, doctors in public hospitals will be overworked and underpaid. The problem will continue unless we force those who can afford it to seek treatment in the private hospitals.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to the topic...<br><br>Like little ant I am against trading in organs. The rich will be able to afford to get organs and the poor will not. That is unfair and unethical.<br><br>Some have suggested that the State should pay for organs and then distribute to all based on clinical need, not ability to pay. It is naive. So who's paying for all these organs and who's selling? You must be really poor to be willing to sell your kidney to someone you don't even know and I don't see Singaporeans willing to pay more taxes for the government to buy all these organs.<br><br>If you allow trading in organs, we will see most organs coming from the desperately poor in China, India, Burma and Bangladesh. Is that something Singapore should be proud of?<br><br>No, I am against organ trading but I do agree we can relax our regulations on live organ donation. If Fiona Xie needs a kidney and thousands of starry-eyed young guys are willing to donate their organs, there is no reason to stop it as long as there is proper counseling.

We don't want to see a waiting list of foreign patients.'<br><br>Ms Khalik had earlier pointed out that Singaporeans have no qualms getting organs from abroad. I would go further.<br><br>The MOH spokesman's explanation is politically correct. Organ trading is frowned upon and usually not allowed in countries where political correctness reigns. However, it is entirely irrational and medically incorrect.<br><br>No one is harmed by harvesting an organ for transplant into a foreigner needing it desperately when there is no potential local recipient.<br><br>On the contrary, a life is likely to be saved. Whether money changes hands is irrelevant. If a person needing an organ transplant is willing to pay for it, what is wrong in us allowing this, so long as Singaporeans and permanent residents take priority over foreigners?<br><br>To go further, our law which prohibits live-donor organ transplant whenever there is a contract or arrangement is irrational.<br><br>Healthy people can live with one kidney or after having part of their liver removed. If monetary incentive makes a potential living donor more willing to save another life, what is wrong in allowing that?<br><br>What is important is that a competent doctor must have assessed and determined that the potential donor's health is not at risk when he gives away the required organ or part of it.<br><br>Once that has been confirmed, whether the living donor is doing it from the goodness of his heart, or because he needs money desperately, the fact is that another life is saved.<br><br>So long as the donor is fully appraised of the risks and consents voluntarily, who are we to decide for him?<br><br>Some years back, a TV personality was allowed to receive part of the liver of her fiancee, yet an Indian woman in a similar dire situation was not allowed to receive a transplant.<br><br>This probably was because it could not be confirmed then that there were no commercial considerations involved. So that poor woman died.<br><br>This contrast is ethically very muddy. It should not happen again.<br><br>Dr Lee Wei Ling<br>National Neuroscience Institute<br><br>NO REASON FOR BAN<br><br>If a person needing a transplant is willing to pay for it, what is wrong in us allowing this, so long as S'poreans and PRs take priority over foreigners? </div></blockquote>I think the Devil is in the Details.<br><br>There is no first principle reason why organ trading MUST necessarily lead to a scenario where the rich benefits and the poor suffers.<br><br>Risks and fear associated with the transplant procedure will help discourage many potential organ sellers. Layers of regulation can be imposed to minimize impact to the poor.<br><br>However, idealism aside, such legal details will have limited precedent in the international community. Organ trading law itself will be a risky legal innovation, unless we wish to copy countries which currently permit organ trading.<br><br>Such bastions of human rights and compassion they are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I REFER to the recent debate on the sale of human organs.<br><br>While there are many forms of organ transplant, kidney and liver transplants would be the two most viable and much needed that would be carried out under a legalised human-organ trade.<br><br>A check with the Ministry of Health website revealed that there are approximately 600 people waiting for a kidney transplant every year. Every year, patients die because they are unable to get a suitable transplant.<br><br>The demand for organs is compounded by the shortage of organs. Currently, under the Human Organ Transplant Act (Hota) and the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act (MTERA), cadaver transplants are carried out. However, only 53 cadaver kidney transplants were carried out in 2005. Even taking into account the 43 live-donor transplants, it still falls short of the required number.<br><br>Already, many Singaporeans have gone overseas for transplants, and the article, 'Allow the sale of human organs?' (ST, Jan 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, mentioned that 'Singapore bans organ trading, but it supports people who go elsewhere to buy an organ by giving them subsidised drugs on their return.'<br><br>What are the implications here? When we are allowed to buy organs overseas, why should we be disallowed from selling them?<br><br>What is the alternative solution to the problem of organ shortage, if we are against the trade in human organs?<br><br>In my opinion, Singaporeans need to more willing to donate their organs to those in need. They should not be opting out of Hota, and should pledge their bone marrow more readily under the bone-marrow transplant programme.<br><br>However, if cadaver organs are still insufficient even if no one opted out of Hota and all Singaporeans opted into MTERA, do we still have reason to ban organ trading while patients continue to die every year, and some Singaporeans go overseas to buy organs for transplant?<br><br>Chew Yun Zhi</div>

The authorities make regular visits and if they fail to show their yellow cards or did not turn up for their checkups, they can be arrested. This is a compromise to ensure that they are not driven underground and makes it easier to monitor them for STDs and treat them early.</div>
