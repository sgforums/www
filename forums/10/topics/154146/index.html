            <div class='col-md body'>It also seems to me like keeping Singapore students. What I mean is that this idea will "force" a lot of students to study here. Because with just a PSLE certificate, you can hardly go overseas and continue your studies, unless you plan to migrate there.</div>

I believe so. It is only a matter of time. This is my view. You can opposed my view.</div>

I like their education system. After finishing secondary education, they like us can pursue what we call A Levels. They also can pursue what we call a diploma. But their diploma is different. They spend most of the time working and very little time for theory to understand how a company works.  If we had an education like that, it would be better. There will be more people who have this practical knowledge rather than students who have just knowledge only.</div>
