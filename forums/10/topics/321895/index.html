              <p>I have one classmate from China who was suddenly offered a PR-ship by ICA last year for no reason. Attracting foreign talent, maybe?</p>
              <p>And the ICA has encouraged him to take up Singapore Citizenship 3 years later, which is two years from now.</p>
              <p>My classmate has lived in Singapore for a few years already and he speaks just like all of us. He also gets A1 or A2 for his English as well.</p>
              <p>He told me that he likes Singapore very much, too. However, he somehow feels that Singaporeans generally would not welcome him to become a Singapore Citizen and he feels puzzled whether to take up Singapore Citizenship or not.</p>
              <p>Singapore and China Citizenship. Which one should he choose?</p>

              <p>Not all china chinese know Singapore and the ruling party well.  So I see it necessary to let foreigners know about Singapore and her currently ruling party.   Recently, I spoke to a china foreign worker and was told she is applying for PR and thereafter she wants to become citizen.   I asked him about how well she know Singapore and the ruling party on the way they run Singapore, she does not know much.</p>
              <p>I told her about it and thereafter she decided that she will only want to stay here make money and return to China as she does not agree with the way the ruling party is "taking care" of the people.</p>

              <p>Respect is not given but earned. You do not need to have Singapore citizenship to get respect. Respect is also not given to a piece of paper that gives you a certain citizenship. Its just that Singapore citizenship just happen to open more doors to other countries but I think the western countries will get the message that Singapore citizenship is losing it previous value as it is given rather freely to anyone who wants to be a citizen.</p>
