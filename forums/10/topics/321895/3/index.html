              <p>my friend needs to serve NS too even though he is first generation PR because now the policy has changed.</p>
              <p>according to my friend, the ICA says it is compulsory for him as first generation PR to serve NS under this "attract foreign talent" scheme. den my friend visited the BMTC already...</p>
              <p>but my friend can choose whether to serve NS or not. if he chooses not to serve NS, then his PR will be taken away and it will be hard for him to apply for a student pass or etc. next time in Singapore</p>

              <p>what is so great and good about the ruling party that people wanna be PR or citizen.   Your china govt is better in taking care of you people.   When you people get old, china govt pay you pension, if you get old here you will not be receiving pension.   The PAP gahmen make you pay for insurance and you are only allow to draw the money at age 80 and above.    70 years old and above are allowed free travel on public transport and in Singapore when you grow old, no money no talk.</p>

              <p>I support forcing all PR to choose to convert to Singaporean after they have stayed in Singapore for maybe 2 to 3 years. And having 1st generation PR serve NS as well (including reservist). If so, I will welcome them with my both hands extended (both legs also can). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>But from what I know from all my PR friends, none wanted to convert to Singaporean as they don't see any advantage in doing so (maybe should make it mandatory?).</p>

              <p><br>Yeah quite 'lucky' in that sense lor. but as mentioned earlier, my friend has the freedom to give up his PR-ship in order not to serve NS next time, if he feels like doing so.</p>
              <p>Also under the "foreign student scheme", this will not result in him being punished by the garmen. If he gives up his PR-ship, then he may have difficulty applying for student pass next time in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But my friend said that he "looked forward to NS" after the garmen organised a visit to the BMTC for him this year and he found his IMT result to be quite good, which may have boosted his confidence in NS.</p>
