            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I have come across a number of people whose views relating to other races and religions are frighteningly bordering on racism. As a Chinese and non-Muslim, I want to reassure particularly Singaporean Malays that these people are the minority.<br><br>The following are my personal views but I hope there will be others who will support me:<br><br>1. On employment, I am completely against employment based on racial or language abilities if that is not absolutely required for the job. Obviously if I want a Chinese language teacher, I will select candidates who have a good command of the language. But if I am looking for a security guard or production engineeer, I support laws that will make discrimination on the basis of race or language illegal.<br><br>2. On the issue of religion, I believe we should be more sensitive to the religious teachings and practices of Muslim Singaporeans. Relating to the issue of dogs in public vehicles, the current ban should stay. However, we can and should explore possible alternatives/compromise with the Muslim community, such as the possibility of transporting pet dogs confined to approved cages and enclosures so that there is no chance of dog saliva staining taxi seats.<br><br>3. On national service, I support putting Muslims/Malays on an equal footing with other races with regard to assignment to various vocations. Assessment of security risks should be based on individuals, not an entire race. It is not healthy to have Chinese boys serving NS mainly in the army and Malay boys in the police. There should be greater integration during national service.<br><br>4. On education, I support strengthening of compulsory teaching on race and religious relations. There should be greater cooperation between mosques and schools to organize joint activities for students of all races and religions. In schools, there must be greater integration of all races. Students of different races may be separated for language classes but must have other lessons together.<br><br>5. On the legal front, I do support the use of the Sedition Act to stamp out racist remarks. I know many do not agree with me but having read the remarks posted by one of the bloggers who has been charged, I think the risk is real and cannot be ignored. I hope in time, we will not need such laws as it is a disgrace that we need them in society. Unfortunately, at the moment, I think we do.<br><br>6. I also urge Muslim leaders to reach out to heartlanders in the neighbourhood and invite them to participate in non-religious, social activities in the mosques. Is it possible to expand the activities of the mosques beyond the religious to incorporate social concerns in the community as well? Can mosques work with community centres to organize activities and classes for the community?<br><br>7. I urge Chinese Singaporeans in particular to cultivate friendships with Malay Singaporeans (how many Malay friends do you have?). I certainly hope to be invited to participate in the Eid celebrations every year by my Muslim friends.<br><br>I believe building strong relationships with Muslims in our community is the best way to combat racism and the risk of terrorism.</div>

If she were seen siting on the same table with us, she would have her ear full when she gets home, especially when wantan noodle or bar cho mee are seen on the table, roast pork or bahkuteh would be worse.<br><br>Sometimes even avoiding each other, like not taking a seat next to an indian on an MRT, could be seen as discrimination.<br><br>It takes two hands to clap. In the end, besides being sensitive and respect on one side, there is also a need for tolerance and understanding on the other side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let's hold our horses before jumping up and down and clamouring for legislations for everything shall we ....<br><br>it's a grand idea of course, to enact laws that'll aim to stamp out discrimination in the work place .... but let's take a look at how effective such a practise would be:<br><br>remember the brouhaha over job adverts that says "chinese only " or "chinese speakers only" etc ? ....<br><br>say you legislate a law that says that such adverts are illegal ... what happens then ? ... non chinese chaps would simply be rejected for the job at the interview then .... nothing has changed ... except that time was wasted on both sides ...<br><br>fudgester brought up a good point ... racism is not limited to the chinese alone ... this is definitely apparent if you've been surfing blogs around ... the thing is ... ending discrimination and racism is not some high and mighty ideal that can be solved with legislations and social engineering ... it got to start with you and me ... how many of our grand parents, if not parents (whatever your race is)... fed us with stereotypes of other races when we were young ? ... a cousin of mine was nearly disowned by his parents for insisting on marrying a malay girl ... and I know how indian parents can be like ... cos i dated an indian girl once ... it never got anywhere, because of who i am to her folks ...<br><br>setting up rules and laws would only drive discrimination and racism into "deep stealth" mode ... take Canada for example, where i am now ... there are lots of nice pretty laws in place designed to ensure "equal opportunities and diversity in the work place" ... as almost every employer would put in their job ads, but it just drives rednecks underground ... and reveal themselves in stealthy ways ....e.g. the terse, almost unfriendly way of speaking to you, white guy infront of you in a convinence store checkout may get a warm "hey, how's it going" ... while you get a "yes ? " ... and a stare ... and the example goes on and on ......<br><br>in the end ... you can only make laws to make people act in a certain way ... but you cannot shape the way they think ... it'll probably take at least a generation more to get there ... but we can start today with you and me ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why have to pick chinese and muslim?  Just say minority race will do.  why not indian, erusians?  even PR and new citizens here already have so many races.  Why cannot employ an indian, or erusians or ah mo or vietnamese, china prc, HK and indonesians.   Why no one think others might be more racists against chinese and taking opportunity to gun down chinese.  By not commenting in public does not mean that others are commenting behind somewhere.  Where do you think JI come from? Money jealousy or Jihad or not happy here?  You will be shock if you hear what other races comment about chinese in the backgroud especially in HDB void decks.  its ten times more dangeorus and threats.  where do you think jihad come from.  look at indo, the first sign of riot, they wack chinese first. Why pick on chinese?  Jealousy or JIhad?  indo also have many indians.<br><br>There are things to take note when commenting about races, we must not make some races higher than others races.  Right now , its like one minority race higher status and get all the attention than other minority races.  This dangerous.<br><br>When a there is a job opening, hundreds from all races apply for the same job.  but can only employ one.  even every race has to compete will many more and higher qualify of the same race.  Sometimes the job went to a foreigner.  because gov promote foreign talent.<br><br>Its a tough world to survive.  The most stupid is to think can get hire because of race.  I even more shock gov just detain anotehr JI member.  How many are out there?  If gov don't take this seriuosly and clamp down JI cells and eliminate them fast,  a bomber may strike first.  London has learn its lesson, the bombers are even britsh citizens.  In Britain,  Enemy among them. And worst, their community and familes nver report to authorities. Why?<br>Are the bomber heros?<br><br>How many NSmen and their parents wants their sons to be in police, civil defence or SAF.  Why not before enlistment, ns men and parents choose where they want to go.  Police and civil defence will get 90%, and SAF gets 10% or might even be 1%.  its like you tell your friend,  lucky go police and SCDF.  The placement are design to serve singapore best in terms of racial coverage to provide best and safe security.  I f i have second chance of NS, i choose civil defense, police, and SAF last.  of course those like saf combat can sign on, take aptitude tests and take place of those that don't like.<br><br>Even the sons want to join saf combat, will the parents agree after a few cases of death incidents.  When so comfortable in SCDF and Police , why go SAF.  SO many guard duties, can get charge and guard room easily for tiny mistakes,  and so many strict orders to follow and somemore stay in.<br><br>if that day comes, a lot of chinese,indian and erusian and many races will be very relieved  that all their precious sons can choose SCDF for NS.  AFter all serving SCDF is just as high profile as others.  and get to see their sons most days.<br><br></div>

Police and civil defence will get 90%, and SAF gets 10% or might even be 1%.  its like you tell your friend,  lucky go police and SCDF.  The placement are design to serve singapore best in terms of racial coverage to provide best and safe security.  I f i have second chance of NS, i choose civil defense, police, and SAF last.  of course those like saf combat can sign on, take aptitude tests and take place of those that don't like.<br><br>Even the sons want to join saf combat, will the parents agree after a few cases of death incidents.  When so comfortable in SCDF and Police , why go SAF.  SO many guard duties, can get charge and guard room easily for tiny mistakes,  and so many strict orders to follow and somemore stay in.<br><br>if that day comes, a lot of chinese,indian and erusian and many races will be very relieved  that all their precious sons can choose SCDF for NS.  AFter all serving SCDF is just as high profile as others.  and get to see their sons most days.<br><br></div></blockquote>sibei cheem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">I have come across a number of people whose views relating to other races and religions are frighteningly bordering on racism. As a Chinese and non-Muslim, I want to reassure particularly Singaporean Malays that these people are the minority.<br><br>The following are my personal views but I hope there will be others who will support me:<br><br>1. On employment, I am completely against employment based on racial or language abilities if that is not absolutely required for the job. Obviously if I want a Chinese language teacher, I will select candidates who have a good command of the language. But if I am looking for a security guard or production engineeer, I support laws that will make discrimination on the basis of race or language illegal.<br><br>2. On the issue of religion, I believe we should be more sensitive to the religious teachings and practices of Muslim Singaporeans. Relating to the issue of dogs in public vehicles, the current ban should stay. However, we can and should explore possible alternatives/compromise with the Muslim community, such as the possibility of transporting pet dogs confined to approved cages and enclosures so that there is no chance of dog saliva staining taxi seats.<br><br>3. On national service, I support putting Muslims/Malays on an equal footing with other races with regard to assignment to various vocations. Assessment of security risks should be based on individuals, not an entire race. It is not healthy to have Chinese boys serving NS mainly in the army and Malay boys in the police. There should be greater integration during national service.<br><br>4. On education, I support strengthening of compulsory teaching on race and religious relations. There should be greater cooperation between mosques and schools to organize joint activities for students of all races and religions. In schools, there must be greater integration of all races. Students of different races may be separated for language classes but must have other lessons together.<br><br>5. On the legal front, I do support the use of the Sedition Act to stamp out racist remarks. I know many do not agree with me but having read the remarks posted by one of the bloggers who has been charged, I think the risk is real and cannot be ignored. I hope in time, we will not need such laws as it is a disgrace that we need them in society. Unfortunately, at the moment, I think we do.<br><br>6. I also urge Muslim leaders to reach out to heartlanders in the neighbourhood and invite them to participate in non-religious, social activities in the mosques. Is it possible to expand the activities of the mosques beyond the religious to incorporate social concerns in the community as well? Can mosques work with community centres to organize activities and classes for the community?<br><br>7. I urge Chinese Singaporeans in particular to cultivate friendships with Malay Singaporeans (how many Malay friends do you have?). I certainly hope to be invited to participate in the Eid celebrations every year by my Muslim friends.<br><br>I believe building strong relationships with Muslims in our community is the best way to combat racism and the risk of terrorism.</div></blockquote>Other country is also making use of their superiorty to humilate singapore.My Lit teacher said there was one time where i tink malaysia or indonesia said to us...You're a red country right in the region of greens...guess what it means <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Why?<br><br>As in all things equal, we have to assume that racists are found in many races and not just a few targeted.

            <div class='col-md body'>since this topic of asking mandarin speakers to write chinese, i have my doubts about any employer will go that far to ask a candidate to write chinese unless that job requires candidates to write and speak chinese regardless of the race must show language competancy in order to qualify for the job.<br><br>many chinese can speak mandarin but cannot even write or read.  I think thats the rationale for the written test.  Next will be to use chinese and tamil word softwares.<br><br>A chinese restaurant at coffeeshop writes chinese for orders and indian restaurant also write tamil to take orders.  if don;t know how to write, how to take orders.  Not only restaurants some indian provision shops in little indian also write tamils for stock checking. Its the same with non tamil speaker and writer apply for a job in a tamil speaking and  writing restaurant or organisation.<br><br>the type of job this candidate in the story is going for must be appropriate.<br><br>Since raise again, i still have doubts about the story behind it and what is the whole intent.<br><br></div>
