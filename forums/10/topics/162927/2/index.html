            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with some of these minority group immigrants (without naming any particular group) that have migrated to western/european countries is that instead of trying to fit in with the local people and culture, they expect everyone else to bend over backwards to accomodate them, and worse, they also try to impose their values and way of life onto their host country. I say they should never have left their homeland if they hate it so much in their new countries. They end up being a drain on government resources and a source of potential instability in the country. Perhaps immigration policies need to be looked into to avoid more of this.</div>

Thats on top of having a liberal immgration policy towards them in the frist place.<br>The real problem is that the French are too accomodating. Thats why they can't even put down the riots after two weeks. You start rioting in Singapore or KL and it will put down the very same day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is indeed saddening that racism will exist forever.<br><br>So long as we continue to look different and lead different ways of life, there is no way in hell we can eradicate an insidious prevalence that we have tried and invariably failed to banish for 50-60 years (it arguably began with the inception of the United Nations Organisation in 1945). Proclamations can be made so as to declare that all races are equal, but history dictates that all men were never equal. It is daunting to alter such a mindset, especially when many people have accepted this (mis)conception for as long as they have lived, and many of these bigots continue to embrace such principles at will.<br><br>How do we eliminate racism completely then? The only possible (but never feasible) method is to make everyone look the same (despite the trivialities connected to physical appearance with reference to racism), do the same things and enjoy equal rights and privileges. Make everyone yellow, white, black or any other colour. We will all eat the same food, be monolingual and speak one common language only, celebrate the same festivals, wear the same clothes and essentially be one race with only common culture speaking one common language -- the Human Race.</div>

If don;t pay school fees from primary to seconday or JC or ITE ,  no one have the guts to kick the student out.  Afterall gov promise everyone must go pri and sec and ITE have money or no money.<br><br>Unversity and poly have clear cut subsidies offer by many organisation like mendaki and some others which in turn, i am not sure where they get most of their fundings.  you can check their websites or poly websites and their qualifying guidelines.<br><br>Gov have entrusted the school fees problem to the work of the organisation to help various grps.  Even bursaries are given out  to needy qualify and deserving students.   Various organistions help subsidised different amount .</div>
