My father could have, of course, taken the money spent on me and my siblings' education and gotten a fancier car or something (like some of my friends here, father drives a beemer SUV, son takes out an education loan and waits tables on weekends) Harsh and pompous words from a young man if you may, but I see some of my already working friends ordering new cars within a year of going onto the work force, and complaining about debts and payments that leaves them with nearly nothing every month (and mounting credit card debts)<br><br>Do you think the people in the backwaters of asia have as much material things as we do ? ... doesn't that say something ? that happiness is not about the amount of material things that one accumulates ? in the end, it's up to each of us to balance our needs and wants with what we can afford ...

Some of his friends and colleagues didn't managed to latch onto the population boom, but they certainly were able to travel a lot more, drive a flashier car with the more disposable income that they have, in the end, it's your own personal choice. A car is not a luxury item, a nice house is not a luxury item, it's up to each of us to make that choice, and to live with the "consequences" of our decisions, no one compels anyone to make that stretch, take on debts and payments that one can barely afford. My father could have, of course, taken the money spent on me and my siblings' education and gotten a fancier car or something (like some of my friends here, father drives a beemer SUV, son takes out an education loan and waits tables on weekends) Harsh and pompous words from a young man if you may, but I see some of my already working friends ordering new cars within a year of going onto the work force, and complaining about debts and payments that leaves them with nearly nothing every month (and mounting credit card debts)<br><br>Do you think the people in the backwaters of asia have as much material things as we do ? ... doesn't that say something ? that happiness is not about the amount of material things that one accumulates ? in the end, it's up to each of us to balance our needs and wants with what we can afford ...

You cannot justify time savings to owning a car juz becuz you need take a few buses to reach your workplace. If that is your argument, then you are basically using money (in the form of feeding a car) to get convenience. So you cannot complain here cuz there ARE ppl who really take a few buses and they still do not opt for a car.<br><br>The maid is another excuse. Becuz you got a maid, you have to work harder outside to feed your maid at home correct? Suppose one of your member sacrifice job to do the household chores? Of cuz you would argue the money earned outside is more than what you pay the maid.<br><br>Car and maid are not necessities depending on how one prioritise their needs. By making some of your needs as necessities you find out you need pay so much more and that is when you complain money not enuff.<br></div>

Before that, it is a iron rice bowl. With such strong support, it is no wonder they spent more than wat they need.<br><br>Signed on regulars have limited career life span and if those regulars do not save for a rainy day, they will find themselves out of job after their contract expires and no longer renewed. Those money earned earlier can only tide them over a certain period but at the rate they splurge on condo and cars and maid I doubt much is left over.<br><br>I was a former gahmen employee and I roughly know the mentality and mindset in those civil services.
