Dun ever compare with people ba.. coz that will only make you feel sour.<br><br>Being happy seems to be easy yet difficult.  It depends on how you define happiness.  Some people thinks happiness means having all the money they want, posh car, dining at a posh restaurant etc.. but to some people, just a roof over the head, decent 3 meals and enough to spend is enough.<br><br>However, living in sg is stressful bcos of the competition and also the fast paced society.
