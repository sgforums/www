As a cleaner in kopitiam or food court.<br><br>2. Self employment as a taxi driver.<br><br>3.

It looks like Singaporeans are relatively problem free and happy - not much suffering in Singapore. The people I met in America are generally unhappy with their lives and is always talking about trying to change it. But in singapore, PAP are in power for 40years and still going strong because of strong mandate by the people.<br><br>With such brilliant and capable government in singapore, I can't believe singaporean are unhappy.

            <div class='col-md body'>The following was published in today's Straits Times.<br><br>Can some of you, make sense of it??<br><br>=========================================<br>Positive motivation key to happiness<br><br>Jul 17, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>WE HAVE the best airport in the world. Our per capita GDP is one of the highest in Asia.<br>We rank among the global elite for the quality of our workforce and transparency of our financial markets.<br><br>We have first class educational institutions and our students routinely rank among the smartest in the world.<br><br>We have a government that is respected internationally for integrity and effectiveness. We pride ourselves on our clean environment and label ourselves a garden city.<br><br>Our city is so safe, anyone can walk down a dark alley in the middle of the night without missing a beat.<br><br>If we are doing so well on all fronts, why do we have the dubious honour of ranking among the most miserable people in the world ('Singaporeans the least happy people in Asia'; ST, July 13)?<br><br>It is no coincidence that the wealthiest nations are among the least happy in the world.<br><br>The pursuit of material wealth is often an end in itself. In the pursuit of happiness, the means is as important as the end.<br><br>One reason that propels a nation forward economically is dissatisfaction with the status quo and motivation to progress.<br><br>We would not have developed from a resourceless, war-torn country to our present state had we not embodied these principles.<br><br>But we internalise these principles so well, we personify them in every facet of our lives.<br><br>If I live in an HDB flat, I am not happy and want to move to a condominium. If I drive a Toyota, I want a Mercedes. If my child scores 80 marks in an exam, I want him to score 100. I am perpetually dissatisfied so I am perpetually unhappy.<br><br>We need to draw a distinction between negative and positive motivation. Negative motivation means I am not doing well and I cannot be happy until I do better.<br><br>Positive motivation means I have made progress and I am happy to know I can do even better.<br><br>Time pressure also impacts our well-being. Not only must we move ahead, but we must do so in little time. That, too, can be traced back to our transformation from Third World to First in barely 40 years. We are used to getting results in a short time.<br><br>It is clearly impossible to step on the brakes in the present global environment. In fact, we need to step on the accelerator just to keep pace.<br><br>Nevertheless, if we run through the list of places that rank ahead of us, we see China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. They do not lag behind us in economic growth. Some are on par with us or ahead of us in their development. The profile of their population is not radically different either.<br><br>There is probably a common set of reasons for the general unhappiness of Singaporeans. That will take in-depth research to uncover.<br><br>There is another set of reasons that is individualised and will take honest self-reflection to reveal.<br><br>Whatever the reasons, the sure-fire way to continue languishing in the 'relegation zone' of similar surveys is to dismiss the conclusions as beyond our control. This is where we need to be dissatisfied with the status quo and be motivated to progress.<br><br>Felix Ang Kok Hou<br></div>

Everywhere, from the workplace to school or even at kindergarten level, u can see signs of fierce competition.<br><br>Hence,  parents have no choice but to try to push their children to be among the best. From young, they are already instilled to have a competitive mindset where all others are your competitors.<br><br>Besides, the education system (the school, the teachers) has always placed more emphasis on academics and results, rather than on morals and human values.<br><br>Spore is a society which allows little room for those who cant make the mark set by the govt. As a result, parents, who have no control over this, have to follow suit.
