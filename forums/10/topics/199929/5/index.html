But our gov shouldn't forget those who merely just wants to be able to make a living, meaning to be able to make enough to survive and save some for old age.<br><br>We are not comprised of bright and successful entrepreneurs, scholars, CEOs, and whatever. Even in motor racing, there are races for slower or lower capacity cars. Hence to say, those whose time is running out, and or who simply either don't have money or what it takes in terms of intellect to keep up and "progress together", need a way to carve out their living in a MEANINGFUL way, or in ways they know how.<br><br>From observation, if things don't change, Singapore in decades to come will be made up of foreigners, and locals of the older generation will be shipping out, cashing out their savings and living out their old age elsewhere - where the money in savings counts into larger digits. The younger generations here will be globally mobile, and can take flight anytime as they will have their nest already setup elsewhere.<br><br>Likeliness of this happening is very high. </div></blockquote>We hve shared the same thought!<br><br>I am 50 years old now and we hve planned to migrate to other less stressful place or countries when my son had served his bond with gov.<br><br>We dont want to be like our parents working until they drop!!!<br><br>We are not anti-gov nor opposition parties supporters but to tell the gov why we are not happy!!!</div>

It's interesting that as more Singaporeans realise that the world does not centre around a tiny red dot, we are more willing to venture abroad for a relaltively better life.<br><br>Just like to share some of my mom's and my own experience concerning coming over to Sydney/Melbourne. My mom (bless her, strong lady) came over here back in 1984 when I was serving my NS and her main reason for the move was due to a lack of education (she does not have PSLE) and the high cost of running a business (yes, even back in 1986 it was expensive). She took the plunge to set up a food business in Sydney with 2 of her friends. With elementary knowledge of English she found the going very tough. Also she faced many difficulties, including being mistaken for a drug pusher and having her premises searched. Nothing happened to her as it was a case of misunderstanding and the people in charge returned personally to apologise.

She even got married to a jolly RAAF veteran recently. Now she may apply for an Aussie pp anytime she desires without having to go through Singapore authorities because of her long residency in Australia.<br><br>As for me, went over to Sydney to study after getting out of NS during the mid-80s. School fees was really CHEAP compared to Singapore uni because mom managed to obtain resident status for me as family. I think I paid about two hundred over for tuition per term, compared to about two thousand per year I would have paid for SU. The great thing was not so much the cheaper fees but the opportunities that were available. Small-time employers were always on the look-out for students in and out of term time. Remember working in an orchard, picking fruits for 12 bucks an hour, and a dive shop in Cairns for around the same rate during vacation.<br><br>Anyway, to get back to point, the whole idea of going away from Singapore is to take advantage of opportunites. I believe that there are only limited chances in Singapore. Most of my friends who stay in Singapore have more or less fixed jobs and opportunities.

I'm proud to say that I've not collected unemployment benefits though it's tempting and some say a given right since I'm a tax-payer too.<br><br>My personal advice to people who are contemplating leaving Singapore is this: the only limiting factor is your heart and mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, what I see is that in other countries, as a citizen you are in true possession of your RIGHTS to speak your mind. If there's anything you object to, you are allowed to voice it. And if you are wrong about your opinion, you will be corrected but NOT encarcerated.<br><br>IN other countries, it may not be as safe and convenient, but at least you are at your own free will and right to survive the best you can or know how. You can defend yourself, and fend for yourself. Here in SG, we just have to take what is STIPULATED, like it or not. If you are not up to par, you're pretty much financially "dead".<br><br>These are the DIFFERENCES.<br><br>Here, in SG, teens are pressured to do well in school to the point of suicide. And yet, for those who finally made it out of Uni., find jobs scarce for them.<br><br></div>

This cannot be avoided.<br><br>It is a catch22 situation for us. On one hand, we hope those talents will stay, on the other hand they may go too. Another problem is using what criteria do we determine a person as a talent ? Currently, it is by educational, profession experience and academic performance.<br><br>We sporeans always complain a lot but if we take a step back, sometimes we can guess the motivation behind those policies. It is a matter on how you look at this issue and like all policies there will be a group of ppl being disadvantaged and a group of ppl getting the advantage. It is always so in policies. It is too difficult to come out with perfect policies that benefit ALL parties. </div></blockquote>What is the points to adopt the policy and make us feel unhappy and leave the country whom the gov had spent at least 500k on them,is it worthwhile???<br><br>Sporeans are unhappy  which has given a very clear signal to our gov,pls do somethings!!!.I dont like to bring along my son and future daughter who are both trainee docs migrate to overseas after 5 years.<br><br>Are u sure these PDMMs and FTs have the necessary academic qualifications and experiance??? Pls look into the recent ah hou's and recent AMK murder cases and  TV telecasts to let me know the facts.They are not the talents but a bunch of thieves/pro and sucking our S$,the real talents will be in USA,we are attracting flies.la.<br><br>Sg gov ,we urge u to treasure our local talents and not treat us as a second class citizen for this is our country,we born here but not these "FTs"</div>

THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY WAT WE WANT TO PROGRESS OUR COUNTRY!!!DO U WANT A BUNCH OF THIEVES AND PRO LIKE THESE PDMMS!!!! </blockquote>Now tis sounds a bit contradictory... on one hand u r saying u do not want them to pogress for our nation then on the other hand u say u do not want them out. U want them in or u want them out ?<br><br><blockquote>WHO R U TO ASK US GO? IF THIS IS THE ATTITUDE OF OUR GOV WE WANT THEM TO GO FIRST!!! </blockquote>Frankly I do not have any malicious intent when I suggest people to migrate if they find singapore too stressful. IMO I also felt singapore is too stressful and migrating out is a good way to improve the standard of life. If tat is wat u felt, then really, migrate. Do not treat tat statement negatively  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
