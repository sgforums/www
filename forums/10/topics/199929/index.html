We should have a prospering economy, creating good jobs for all."<br>- PM Lee Hsien Loong, National Day Rally 2004<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"Nearly 300,000 Singaporean workers earn $1,200 or less in gross monthly income. Half of them, or one in 10 workers, earn even less - $900. They are the group most vulnerable to retrenchments and fallout from economic restructuring. Many already struggle to make ends meet and have little or nothing for their medical and retirement needs."<br>- Straits Times, July 1, 2005<br><br>Please make up your mind: Are we digits or not? 20 Jan 06<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>Â“We must remember that workers are not simply factors of production or economic digits."<br>- ex-DPM Tony Tan, Straits Times, Aug 4 2003<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"At the end of the day, we are so many digits in the machine. The point is Â– are these digits stronger than the competitors' digits?"<br>- MM Lee Kuan Yew on Singapore workers, History of Singapore, 2005<br><br>Your CPF is *ahem* sound 27 Dec 05<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>"Our CPF system based on individual savings is sound. The CPF will provide a basic retirement pension for most Singaporeans."<br>- PM Lee Hsien Loong, May 1, 2005<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"As of last year, only about 40 per cent of active CPF members who turned 55 meet the CPF minimum sum of $84,500. Of these, slightly more than half had set aside no more than $40,000 and had to pledge their properties to make up for the shortfall. The CPF Board estimates that 10 economically active persons are supporting one elderly person. By 2030, only 3.5 persons will be supporting one elderly person."<br>- Straits Times, Dec 18, 2004<br><br>Economy growing? 11 Dec 05<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>"We are growing our economy, creating more jobs, and providing Singaporeans the skills and opportunities to look after themselves and their families."<br>- PM Lee Hsien Loong, May 1, 2005<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"...the spiraling numbers of applications for the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund to help needy children. The number needing help tripled from 3,735 in 2001 to 10,419 in 2003. According to CDC figures, those needing financial aid swelled from 14,300 to 22,500 in 2002, and 31,570 in 2003."<br>- Straits Times, Jan 29, 2005<br><br>Land of opportunity for whom? 8 Nov 05<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>"We want to make sure that all Singaporeans benefit from our success. As we forged ahead, nobody should be left behind...This will be a land of opportunity for all."<br>- PM Lee Hsien Loong, Straits Times, Feb 19, 2005<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"Monthly incomes for households in the bottom 20 per cent fell 3.2 per cent a year, from $933 in 1998 to $795 in 2003."<br>- Straits Times citing the household expenditure survey, Jun 18, 2005<br><br>"Seven in 10 polled were not aware of any financial assistance schemes, although more than half of them said they had faced financial hardship in the past year. Almost 16 per cent of the respondents, all living in one and two-room flats, had family members who often went hungry."<br>- Straits Times citing a poverty survey conducted by Social Development Feedback Group, Jan 29, 2005<br><br>Backtracking over Taiwan and South Korea 17 Oct 05<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>Â“If in 10 years, Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea were better societies because they adopted the US model (of democracy), Singapore would hurry to catch."<br>- PM Goh Chok Tong, National Day Rally, 1995<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"Singapore is an improbable nation and therefore cannot be compared to such places as South Korea and TaiwanÂ…I think in 20 years our society will change. But I do not see a Western model...as the target we want to aim for."<br>- PM Lee Hsien Loong's speech at the Foreign Correspondents Association, Oct 6 2005<br><br>Which hospital is that again, Mr Lee? 27 Sep 2005<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>"We run a (healthcare) system where you have to co-pay...but you get the attentionÂ…In Singapore, within half-an-hour, you would be in SGH (Singapore General Hospital), TTSH (Tan Tock Seng Hospital)...and within one-and-a-half to two hours flat, you'd know what went wrong.Â”<br>- MM Lee Kuan Yew on the state of Singapore hospitals after his wife was flown home from London after suffering a stroke there, Today, Nov 3, 2003<br><br>The Reality<br><br>My dad was sent to the A&amp;E department three times in two months because of stroke and, each time, my family had to wait at least six hours before he was pushed to a wardÂ…When my dad finally got to the ward, it was past 2am. And we had arrived at the A&amp;E department about 7pm; it took more than six hours before my dad was seen by a neurologist. If my dad had been taken to the ward earlier and been treated by a neurologist, his chances of living might be higherÂ…The neurologist told us that my dad had the worst kind of stroke anyone could get. Sadly, he was pronounced brain dead the next day.<br>- Ms Tan Tze Yee, author of the above letter, Straits Times Forum, Aug 18, 2005<br><br>Recently, my father, who is in his late 70s and has multiple illnesses and end-stage renal failure, had to wait seven hours for a bed at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). We were told that as no bed was available, he would be placed in the observation ward first. This had happened many times before and we were prepared to wait for one to two hours for a bed for himÂ…However, it was not until seven hours later that he was wheeled into the ward. During this time, no doctor came to see him.<br>- Ms Rodziah Shaari, author of the above letter, Straits Times Forum, Aug 13, 2005<br><br>The future is ours (the PAP's) to make 19 Aug 2005<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>"Our prospects are brighter than before. Our economy is growing strongly again. The future is ours to make."<br>- PM Lee Hsien Loong, Inauguration Speech, Aug 12, 2004<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"4,190 people were made bankrupt in the first 11 months of last year - the highest in 19 years."<br>- Straits Times, Jan 15, 2005<br><br>"More and more Singaporeans are working past the age of 65 as they lack retirement funds. As of June last year, 35,727 Singaporeans aged 65 and over were still employed, up from 22,699 a decade ago (1993), according to MOM statistics. The majority, or 35.7 per cent, worked as cleaners and in other related menial jobs. This means their incomes will fade with their strengths."<br>- Straits Times, Dec 18, 2004<br><br>All the spinning is giving us a headache 10 Aug 2005<br><br>The Rhetoric<br><br>"Job prospects look rosy for Singapore"<br>"Outlook for job creation is good"<br>"Job market at its best in three years"<br>"Brighter prospects in job market"<br>- Straits Times headlines in the months of Aug, Sept and Oct 2004 (NB. PM Lee Hsien Loong was inaugurated on Aug 12).<br><br>The Reality<br><br>"Job creation has dipped. Between January and March, 16,900 jobs were added - around half the 32,700 jobs gains in the last quarter.Â”<br>- Straits Times, June 16, 2005<br><br>Pay us top dollar: Goh 2 Aug 2005<br><br>The Rhetoric<br>"The price of good government is $34 million a year - or the cost of five plates of char kway teow per citizen. Has the performance of my Government justified its wage? Has my Government given you safe homes, stable jobs and fuel to dream of all the tomorrows?"<br>- (Then) PM Goh Chok Tong urging Singaporeans to accept pay increases for Ministers and political office holders, July 1, 2000<br><br>The Reality<br>"Unemployment rate among the working population living in HDB flats had increased from 4.9 per cent in 1998 to 7.8 per cent in 2003."<br>- Straits Times citing a HDB survey, Jun 21, 2005<br><br>"More and more Singaporeans are working past the age of 65 as they lack retirement funds. A survey of 1,140 people aged 40 to 59 years showed only one in three felt they had enough to retire on. Another one in three planned to downgrade to a smaller home to make up for their shortfall in retirement funds. Frighteningly, almost four in 10 said they were counting on luck, in the form of a Toto or 4D windfall, to bankroll their retirement."<br>- Straits Times, Dec 18 2004<br><br>Best quality of life...for whom? 26 Jun 2005<br><br>The Rhetoric<br>Singapore offers best quality of life in Asia for expatriates.<br>- Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, March 2002<br><br>The Reality<br>Two thousand Singaporean families are so poor they cannot afford to send their children to school.<br>- Reuters, March 2002<br></div>
