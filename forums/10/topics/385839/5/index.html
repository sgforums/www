              <p>The matter is, when casinos, the govt will say that Singapore fail, not they fail ya, you got to get this clear first.  And if casinos really fail, the govt would raise the cost of living higher, increase Gst, tax, ERP, etc etc as high as possible to recuperate the lost, because it is you,  the citizen faults. In the first place, why you dun stop the govt from doing it???</p>

              <p>My dear Uncle,</p>
              <p>The question to ask yourself is very simple,..if you dun built casinos?, the money will also go into their pocket, if you dun pay 10 millions for intergration of immigrant, the money will also end up in their pocket.</p>
              <p>And, money in Singapore depreciate like no other countries do, i am not saying the sing dollars, i am saying the value of saving...just let ask simple logic question, your 10k fix deposit in bank will end up worth only $5 to 6k in 10 years time, because cost of livng will rise during this period and your money will become less and less value,..what is a millionaire today compare to 15 years ago, nothing,....on the street, lots of millionaires lor..so it is logical and better for the govt to spend now, if not, money get smaller in value and also in the end, they may pocket it...</p>

              <p><strong>By Jonathan Burgos from Bloomberg</strong></p>
              <p>Jan. 18 (Bloomberg) — Genting Singapore Plc is ready to start operating Singapore’s first legal casino as soon as the city state’s government issues its gambling license, the company said today.</p>
              <p>Genting Singapore’s stock added as much as 4 percent this morning on speculation gambling may begin at the company’s Resorts World Sentosa complex as soon as February’s Chinese New Year holiday.</p>
              <p>“We are ready,” Robin Goh, a spokesman for Resorts World, said. “We can open the casino as soon as we have the license.”</p>
              <p>Four hotels and 10 restaurants within the $4.5 billion Sentosa island complex will begin accepting guests from Jan. 20. A Universal Studios theme park in the complex is also waiting for a license to operate, and will open as soon as that is issued, Goh said.</p>
              <p>A second casino resort, the Marina Bay Sands, being built by Las Vegas Sands Corp., will open later after encountering construction delays. Singapore announced in April 2005 it was overturning a ban on casinos that had been in place since independence. Resorts World and Marina Bay are the only two casino developments approved so far.</p>
              <p>“We believe they, Resorts World, will get their gaming license before Chinese New Year,” Aaron Fischer, a gaming analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets in Hong Kong, said in a telephone interview. “We expect gaming revenues to be bigger. There is a huge gaming market in Southeast Asia.”</p>
              <p>In a report published last month, CLSA Asia Pacific Markets said it estimates Resorts World’s gaming revenue to rise from $2.5 billion this year to $3.8 billion by 2013. The Singapore casino market will generate $3 billion in revenue this year, growing to $6 billion in 2013, CLSA said in the report.</p>
              <p>Genting Singapore gained 3.2 percent to S$1.29 as of 2:30 p.m. in Singapore. The stock climbed 200 percent in the past year, compared with a 67 percent gain for the benchmark Straits Times Index. – Bloomberg</p>
