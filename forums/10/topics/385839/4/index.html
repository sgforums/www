              <p>When you walk into the casinos, you already lost $100, then at each stalls, most players will stand to loose out, because casinos bet in a way that the banker always had that 70% of wining you.</p>
              <p>4D and TOTO already make Singapore pools one of the richest pools in Asia, imagine each casino stall is like another 4D counter, how to loose??? And if you look at Casino business, you dun even need to buy raw material or do any stupid manufacturing and production, just create the nice ambience atmosphere, get the right people in and i bet the return of investment can be more than 80% gain.</p>
              <p>In taiwan, there are small casinos all over the country, some legal and some illegal,  as one of relative worked as a casino supervisor said that the trick lies in the ambience and lighting, once you entered, it will urge you to gamble and that even if you are losing big, you still enjoy it. Until, you are out of the casinos, then you realise your loses.  </p>

              <p>Hmm overhyped yes but that only make things look worse. You see there's a strong reason why North Koreans are made to believe in the divinity of their leaders which is an extreme exaggeration. I personally can't wait to see how it goes after say 8-10 years down the road.</p>

              <p>Day dream that these casinos will go away. LV , Macau all grow bigger and bigger and bigger...</p>
              <p>What an idiot to believe that the casinos are here to attract the PRC or the Indian.These places are build to suck the locals and many good Singaporean will turn bad. Trust me, wait till you see those bus load of people disappearing from Goldenmiles heading to Genting, you surely know where to find them. Tell me which Casino in the world survive on tourist or foreigner?</p>
              <p>I have only one suggestion. Ask God to put a curse to yourself if you break your vow to walk into these casinos one day. It better to die fast than slowly agonising your entire family.</p>

              <p>In 2008, the commercial casino industry employed more than 375000 people: more direct employees than the U.S. automobile industry, software manufacturers ect.</p>

The same survey found that gaming industry employment also benefited local economies by lowering public assistance payouts, increasing sales of homes, cars and major appliances, and increasing charitable giving and volunteerism.</p>

              So what if Casino fails, our government already collected revenue thru Land sale, Taxes and very soon ERPs!
              
              4 new ERP gantries

              SINGAPORE - A new road system in the Marina Bay area will be completed soon to serve the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort and the Marina Bay Financial Centre this year, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced on Thursday.
              
              The road network will present another option for motorists to enter the Central Business District (CBD) - with a cost. Four new ERP gantries will be put up to deal with the expansion of the CBD area.
               
              The first ERP gantry will be located along Bayfront Avenue leading towards Temasek Boulevard. Another gantry on the other side of Bayfront Avenue will also be erected.
              
              The third and fourth gantries will be located at Marina Way and Marina Station Road leading into Central Boulevard.

              <p>I assumed is not like a cash injection but thru extension of credit.....so it is a inflating of property market and of course once you built such a Big structure and such a high profile debate in Singapore. it is hard to tear down such a Landmark before making a political sucide if it fail.....</p>
              <p>Big project many heads will drop after opening....</p>
