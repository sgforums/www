              <p>Did they use false passports to enter Singapore before arriving at the Casino ?</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Resorts World Sentosa expects visitor numbers to its casino to dip significantly from Wednesday when the public holidays end.</p>
              <p>This, after an overwhelming response to its opening, during the first three days of the Lunar New Year.</p>
              <p>The casino has attracted some 41,000 people so far.</p>
              <p>Police also made its first arrests when two foreign nationals, believed to be Mongolians, tried to use a false passport to gain entry.</p>
              <p>Some 6,300 guests tried their luck at the casino during the last day of the Lunar New Year public holidays.</p>
              <p>The more popular games included baccarat, roulette, pontoon and blackjack.</p>
              <p>Although it was the end of the holiday period, some punters said they will be back.</p>
              <p>Teething problems also emerged during the first three days of operations.</p>
              <p>Long waits, overwhelmed facilities and confusion over dress code were some of the complaints received.</p>
              <p>Resorts World Sentosa said there have been initial problems, and will take feedback from guests seriously.</p>
              <p>Krist Boo, vice president, Communication, Resorts World Sentosa, said: "We had to turn away some of the customers on the first day because they came in slippers. So, the dress code for the casino as with a lot of world—class casino, is no slippers, no singlets and no shorts.</p>
              <p>“So, we realised that some of the customers are not aware that the signs have been posted outside the casino. Yesterday, we started putting up more signage to inform the customers to come in proper attire."</p>
              <p>With many new dealers on the floor, gamblers also questioned their competency.</p>
              <p>Said one visitor to the casino: "It’s very slow, I don’t see a lot of Singaporeans also. They are still at a learning stage and they made a number of mistakes."</p>
              <p>Ms Boo added: "Mainly our croupiers are new to the industry. They started training as early as August last year so they have been training for quite a while. But nothing beats the real thing. So, when the casino opens, many are learning on the job."</p>
              <p>Resorts World Sentosa said it would take some time for the croupiers to gain experience and they are working hard to put things right. — CNA/vm</p>

              <p>Does the Taiwanese 'hum' need a new face to look after its own interests when no one is prepared to accept the 'hum' ?</p>
              <p>Sing-a-longrean or not - the Taiwanese 'hum' will always be a pseudo-Singaporean with its heart and soul always with the village in Taiwan.</p>
