              <p>Both the IR projects will survive - with or without Singaporeans visiting the casinos.</p>
              <p>On opening day itself, CNA had reported that the numerous Food &amp; Beverage outlets at the Genting Resorts saw long lines of customers - prepared to wait for 45 minutes and more - when the food is about the standard fares served by most hotels.</p>
              <p>The added Universal Studio attraction at the Genting Resorts will surely help Genting to draw a larger crowd then the LV Sands at the Marina - and as happened on last Sunday, there were hordes of ludicrous people prepared to pay S$10 for a preview without the rides being operational.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Woodlands and Tuas ICQ on the Singapore side have seen traffic jams on the first day of Lunar New Year - and this has not been the experience over the last ten years.</p>
              <p>On the balance, both the IR will not depend on the respective Casinos to recoup their investments, and have targetted the MICE activities as the main event - at least on paper as had been declared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question that should be asked is - will the entrance fee of S$100 - paid by Singaporeans only - be kept by the Singapore Government or by the Casinos ?</p>
              <p>If kept by the Casinos, there could possibly be some "arrangement" to placate pissed Singaporeans for the bad gambling omen of losing S$100 before they even play.</p>
              <p>If this S$100 should go into the Government Treasury - most gambling Singaporeans will prefer to spend the S$100 travelling to casinos around the region, where they can have a short break away from home.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I dun think the $100 is stupid. Genting Malaysia also got rule that so called protect the country's "elites". They do not allowed MUSLIMS in MALAYSIA to enter the casino but MUSLIMS from other countries are allowed. What do you make of that? It is a protection to ensure the MUSLIMS in the country do not get into further financial turmoil then they already do. $100 is not alot for those who are rich or can afford to. But $100 will definitely make people think twice about just walking in any time and gamble away their money. If you do not have this rule, Singaporeans who have nothing to do will say hey lets go gamble lah. Singapore is small and The casinos are easily accessible, the last thing we want is that the casino becomes a place where people goes just because they could.</p></div>

              <p>In Malaysia, it is not just to prevent the poor Malays from entering the Casino - as it is more to do with Politics - to prevent the PAS Opposition Party to have any leverage to accuse UMNO for allowing a Casino to exist and undermine the Malaysian Muslims.</p>
              <p>It will be difficult for the Malaysian authorities to check on the religious faiths of the many overseas visitors to Genting Highlands - as there are Indonesian "Malays" who are Christians and Hindus, and similarly there are Middle-eastern nationals who are from other faiths other then Islam.</p>
              <p>Religion is not a category that is stated in one's passport.</p>

              <p>I never said it is a major obstacle. I said it will make people think twice. Imagine there is no $100 levy now. I just finished watching movie in Vivocity and nothing to do. And we will go "hey lets go to the casino" We do not want the casino to be a place where people can anyhow walk in and gamble any time they want to. Sure, it would not stop addicts probably but I am sure it would stop me. I can only tell you, if there is no $100 levy, I am sure I would be at the casino most probably a few times a month. With the amount that Singapore Pools are generating every year, we can see the Singaporeans are  people who gamble ALOT, without some sort of preventive measures, things will just get out ot hand. And I agree with what you said, it will not stop ALL PEOPLE but it definitely will stop SOME PEOPLE.</p>

              <p>As I said, no measures are perfect. They are trying ways and means, with the exclusion list, with all the counselling etc.... they are trying, but we all know it wun stop all addicts but it will stop SOME addicts. Just like the $100 Levy, it will not stop ALL SENSIBLE people but it will stop SOME SENSIBLE people. The thing is we cannot expect them to please everyone. The IRS and Casinos are definitely going to reap in economic benefits for the country (of cos how it will benefit the citizens are up for debate). The fear is of course that citizens might fall into more social issues. They are trying to balance that out now. They are starting out to weed out those people like me I will not even step into the casino now. I will not even think about it cos of the Levy. So in time to come, as they review their regulations, they might find better ways to stop those people which the Levy could not stop. But all these take time, dun they. But for now, I am sure the levy has worked its course to a certain, whether it needs to be changed or revised, only time will tell.</p>

Just like the $100 Levy, it will not stop ALL SENSIBLE people but it will stop SOME SENSIBLE people. The thing is we cannot expect them to please everyone. The IRS and Casinos are definitely going to reap in economic benefits for the country (of cos how it will benefit the citizens are up for debate). The fear is of course that citizens might fall into more social issues. They are trying to balance that out now. They are starting out to weed out those people like me I will not even step into the casino now. I will not even think about it cos of the Levy. So in time to come, as they review their regulations, they might find better ways to stop those people which the Levy could not stop. But all these take time, dun they. But for now, I am sure the levy has worked its course to a certain, whether it needs to be changed or revised, only time will tell.</p>

              <p>If the S$100 "will not stop ALL SENSIBLE people but it will stop SOME SENSIBLE people" - then it has already failed its purpose.</p>
              <p>If "not ALL SENSIBLE people" can be stopped, can these "unstoppable" people be "SENSIBLE" in the first place ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, the $100 levy is another PAP ploy to collect "loose change" while at the same time "pretending" to address the social concerns from the outcry by the many NGOs who are representing the various facets of the larger Singapore Society.</p>
              <p>Just as the PAP Government had implemented the ERP system by charging loose change of $0.50 and $1.00 along major trunk routes used by Singaporeans, the situation has not improved, and require the introduction of either higher charges or more ERP gates along the same routes.</p>
              <p>This can be seen in the additional ERP gantries along the CTE, along Orchard Road, and now even the inner City Area; and as seen in the new ERP gantries that are in the directions of traffic heading home and operational in the evening up to 10p.m.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The immediate economic benefit that comes from the IR is the supposed 10,000 jobs created - (although no clear figure can be available to be confirmed by NGOs as to how many are taken by Singaporeans).</p>
              <p>Then there is the spin off support industries supplying the two IRs, the new and old visitors attracted to Singapore by the IRs.</p>
              <p>More importantly, there is the supposedly all important MICE activities that draw more down-stream benefits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What will the social cost be to Singapore when the FTs from the lower strata are allowed into the IRs - as there are nothing stopping them except their own good sense of responsibility to their distant families ?</p>
              <p>Will industrial accidents increase ?</p>
              <p>Will there be more - petty or serious - crimes committed ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>As I have said, the casino is for the local. No casino in the world operate without local. Macau is for Chinese, LVegas for American/Chinese, Aussie casino for Ausssie Chinese, Genting Malaysia for Malaysian Chinese. So what make you think that Singapore casino is for the Angmok? So I am proven right from day one the casino opened yesterday..it for Singaporean Chinese!!!.</p>
              <p>Do we need anyone to tell us how many Singaporean is going to lose life saving to these casino? Casino is worse than drugs and it is addictive. No one can control the urge to continue gambling, regardless if you win or lose.</p>
              <p>It terrible that this shit government allow casino on our soil. I have lost many of my dearest love ones to these casino. I seen many of  my friends and colleagues gambling away their career and business to these casino. Those who lost their money are in the mid forties beyong and who supposed to be rationale. I live in China and travel often to Macau and Hong kong and you will be shock to see that crowd at the immigrations and the millions of Chinese that fill the hundreds of casino daily at macau. Each casino is easily twice or three times the size of genting in Singapore. Evertime without fail, there are always ppl who dress in luxury brands cloth who beg you for a dollar or two for the transport crossing the boarder.</p>

              <p>Both the IR projects will survive - with or without Singaporeans
              visiting the casinos.</p>
              <p>On opening day itself, CNA had reported that
              the numerous Food &amp; Beverage outlets at the Genting
              Resorts saw long lines of customers - prepared to wait
              for 45 minutes and more - when the food is about the standard fares
              served by most hotels.</p>
              <p>The added Universal Studio attraction at the Genting
              Resorts will surely help Genting to draw a larger crowd then
              the LV Sands at the Marina - and as happened on last Sunday, there
              were hordes of ludicrous people prepared to pay S$10 for a
              preview without the rides being operational.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Woodlands and Tuas ICQ on the Singapore
              side have seen traffic jams on the first day of Lunar New Year -
              and this has not been the experience over the last ten years.</p>
              <p>On the balance, both the IR will not depend on the
              respective Casinos to recoup their investments, and have
              targetted the MICE activities as the main event - at least on paper
              as had been declared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question that should be asked is - will the entrance fee
              of S$100 - paid by Singaporeans only - be kept by
              the Singapore Government or by the Casinos ?</p>
              <p>If kept by the Casinos, there could possibly be some
              "arrangement" to placate pissed Singaporeans for the
              bad gambling omen of losing S$100 before they even
              play.</p>
              <p>If this S$100 should go into the Government Treasury - most
              gambling Singaporeans will prefer to spend the S$100 travelling to
              casinos around the region, where they can have a short break away
              from home.</p>

              <p>I never said it is a major obstacle. I said it will make people think twice. Imagine there is no $100 levy now. I just finished watching movie in Vivocity and nothing to do. And we will go "hey lets go to the casino" We do not want the casino to be a place where people can anyhow walk in and gamble any time they want to. Sure, it would not stop addicts probably but I am sure it would stop me. I can only tell you, if there is no $100 levy, I am sure I would be at the casino most probably a few times a month. With the amount that Singapore Pools are generating every year, we can see the Singaporeans are  people who gamble ALOT, without some sort of preventive measures, things will just get out ot hand. And I agree with what you said, it will not stop ALL PEOPLE but it definitely will stop SOME PEOPLE.</p>

              <p>i disagree.</p>
              <p>if someone wants to gamble, there's no stopping him as there are plenty of others to choose from.</p>
              <p>if someone doesnt gamble, he will not be tempted to gamble at all.</p>
              <p>the levy is imposed to appease those self righteous people who are against the building of casinos.</p>
              <p>of course it is a also a neat sum for the coffers which no amount is ever enough.</p>

              <p>Where does the 100 go to ?</p>

              <p>Every decision made by the poodles are for greed and sugar-coated with holy intention.</p>
              <p>What is the difference between them collecting the 100 as compared to being collected from man in black ?</p>
              <p>It is the same - you still lose 100.</p>
              <p>It is increase the wisdom of the common folks to understand the true wisdom.</p>
              <p>Simple reasoning:</p>
              <p>Increase in GST - help the poor ? which poor ? foreign scholars ?</p>
              <p>Increase in ERP - did the traffic flow improve if you are forced to pay 50 cent more ?</p>
              <p>Increase in transport cost - did the service improve ? Why is air con switched off ? Is the frequency too little ?</p>
              <p>All the above increases was sugar-coated with holy intention, did it solve the basic problem or it have made some one richer ?</p>

              <p>Just a simple question for all to answer.</p>
              <p>Where does the 100 go to ?</p>
              <p>If you know the obvious answer, then there is no need to discuss over it.</p>
              <p>Every decision made by the poodles are for greed and sugar-coated with holy intention.</p>
              <p>What is the difference between them collecting the 100 as compared to being collected from man in black ?</p>
              <p>It is the same - you still lose 100.</p>
              <p>It is increase the wisdom of the common folks to understand the true wisdom.</p>
              <p>Simple reasoning:</p>
              <p>Increase in GST - help the poor ? which poor ? foreign scholars ?</p>
              <p>Increase in ERP - did the traffic flow improve if you are forced to pay 50 cent more ?</p>
              <p>Increase in transport cost - did the service improve ? Why is air con switched off ? Is the frequency too little ?</p>
              <p>All the above increases was sugar-coated with holy intention, did it solve the basic problem or it have made some one richer ?</p>
              <p>You be the judge.</p>

              <p>Sad to say, the place is ruled by a group of poodles with the mentality of "it is not my problem" as they are not affected by the changes they implemented.</p>
              <p>They dun pay GST, dun take public transport and may have super cash free card to handle the ERP increase.</p>
              <p>But, they are more concerned about the "bonu$" bring about with each change.</p>
              <p>As for the FTs, they are not affected as their clan can secured any position to created in the money losing organisation.</p>
              <p>So, they dun lose.</p>
              <p>As for the common folks, dun be "choosy", be cheap, be faster, be better cos you are not a elite then your life would be harder and dun complain.</p>
