              <p>i was once proud that im in a country that does not operate such
                  big gambling industry in my homeland. now i feel rather ashamed
                  that the casino will be opening soon.</p>
              <p>Gambling is already a problem here yet they are still pursuing
                  with the opening of the casino. so whats the ad on stop gambling
                  whereby mark lee asked his daughter for money for? it's so
                  contradicting. we all know that gambling has and had been a source
                  of family problems, no one can deny that.</p>
              <p>i can forsee the future whereby this county will become
                  corrupted in a sense that ppl will loan money from loansharks to
                  gamble, people will go for broke while they gamble resulting in
                  bankruptcy, etc.</p>
              <p>furthermore i would like to highlight whats up with the free
                  jobs to foreigners? tourist will come over to singapore and see
                  that the staffs are made of PRC, pinoys, thais,m'sians (no pun
                  intended to any) hold on one sec,are they singaporeans? definitely
                  not! we have to (if not must) use singaporeans as staffs or else
                  tourist might think that singapore is part of china.</p>
              <p>even if sombody starts a petition (again) to stop the opening of
                  the casinos, it'll be swept into the dark just like that</p>

              <h1>Singapore Says Casinos May Support Growth Amid Sluggish Exports</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 11, 2010</span></p>
              <p><strong>By Shamim Adam from Bloomberg</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><span lang="EN">Singapore’s first casinos and the opening of new pharmaceutical factories will support economic growth this year as overseas demand may remain weak, Trade Minister Lim Hng Kiang said today.</span></p>
              <p>“External demand will continue to grow but at a sluggish pace,” Lim said in response to a question in parliament.</p>
              <p>“Domestically, the opening of new facilities for the chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters as well as the opening of the Integrated Resorts will also provide a boost to growth.”</p>
              <p>The island, seeking to reduce its dependence on electronics manufacturing, is allowing casinos to operate in the country for the first time and has lured investment in pharmaceutical and bio-technology industries. Genting Singapore Plc unit Resorts World Sentosa plans to open part of its $4.5 billion project this month, and Las Vegas Sands Corp. says it may open the Marina Bay Sands in April.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s economy shrank for the first time in three quarters in the October-to-December period as weaker manufacturing output interrupted the island’s rebound from its deepest slump since independence in 1965. The nation will probably avoid sliding back into a recession amid an “uneven” recovery in 2010, Lim said.</p>
              <p>“The risk of a return to recession is low in the absence of further financial shocks,” Lim said. “But growth momentum in the second half of 2010 may slow down as the effects of global fiscal stimulus measures and inventory restocking wane.”</p>
              <p>The economy will grow 3 percent to 5 percent in 2010, the minister said, reiterating a previous forecast.</p>

              <p>Singapore’s labor market has “stabilized” as business and hiring sentiment have picked up in recent months, Lim said.</p>
              <p>More companies were planning to increase their headcounts in the last quarter of 2009 compared with earlier in the year, he said.</p>
              <p>“The unemployment rate, however, is likely to stay up for some time as it typically lags economic recovery,” Lim said.</p>
              <p>The minister reiterated a government forecast that inflation will average between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent this year. Low domestic interest rates reflect global conditions, he said.</p>
              <p>The island has maintained a “robust” financial regulatory framework that is well placed to meet stringent global standards, helping attract funds to local markets, Lim said. – Bloomberg</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, as a globe trotter, I have never seen a casino go bust, most are making money. So, i think singapore casino will not fall, however those theme parks may suffer because of hot whether and competition from elsewhere like Disney in Hk and coming up in shanghai can give you better for money within a cool atmosphere.</p>
              <p>Talking about Lee Ka Sing and Stanley Ho, one of the richest in Asia, and they are all in Casinos business, I think singapore IR will make money.</p>

              <p>I think the casinos should not fail... however how big it is of benefit to the economy is questionable.</p>

              <p><br>hello, told you how many time already, Casino will not fall, no matter what, it will not fall, Singapore peoples may fall, but Casino will not fall, even if it is not doing well, govt will help by pouring billions into it again, so simple, just change the CPF withdrawing policy again or increase Gst and other cost of living, I am sure they can support the IR casinos forever. Understand or not?</p>
