              <p>Uncle, first of all, the govt do not wish Singaporeans or PR to gamble, that is why there is a $100 entrance fees, the ideas is also not to attract, malaysians, for they got genting and many other illegal dens to go to, and as indonesia, they got cruise to nowhere to gamble on, most philipinos and souther indonesia peoples go to Australia's casino, and the thai gamble among themselves, Macau is als very near.</p>

              <p>Are PRs Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Since when was PRs ever considered to be blocked from entering when they still hold their nationality from other countries ?</p>
              <p>If I am damn stupid, does it make you any cleverer to speculate that Genting Resorts will not be targetting the region when it present a market size of 240 Million Indonesians, 63 Million Thais, 85 Million Vietnamese, and 92 Million Filippinos. </p>
              <p>Are you certain that the Arabs and Chinese will want to visit Singapore even if they are targetted, and will not prefer to visit a more temperate climate at Genting Highlands in Malaysia - where the Malaysian immigration rules are more relaxed ?</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese 'hum' will never fail to continue to be irrelevant with its flippant replies loaded with intentional controversies simply to draw attention to its attention seeking whorish ways.</p>

              <p>In the characteristic ways, the Taiwanese 'hum' will indulge in its typical 'la la la' flippant ways of 'talking cock'.</p>
              <p>We should believe that it had received some training as a lawyer but never having the brains to deal with legal details, and can only end up working as a pimp in PAPa's sleazy bars, and walking the streets at night.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese 'hum' will suckle up the PAP and attempt to draw attention away from the $100 entrance charge, when it is obviously another ploy for the PAP government to milk the Casino for its own benefits from Singaporeans again - while at the same time placating the many over righteous voices of concern to this Casino scheme proposed by LHL and finally approved by LKY .</p>

              <p>No, the luxury sentosa glove property had attracted alots of rich arabs and Chinese.</p>
              <p>You see, my friend, in Arab and China, you are refrain from indulging in free life, meaning gambling, drinking, sex, fun, shopping spree etc etc, as a rich and powerful man, you need to protray yourself as a credible person. In your homeland, you got both your religion and political restrain to enjoy life.</p>
              <p>IR provide full membership, boarding, escort and social escort services with special gambling room of top VVIP class for them, these peoples coming here will be king, enjoy their wealth here like a king, you can go tour and spent 10 to 20k, they come here and spent 1 million is nothing to them, in return, they feel free, well protected, free from family, free from their country rules and regulation, it will be like having money and now got the chance to spend.</p>
              <p>From the day they landed in Singapore, all chauffuer and service peoples will be waiting to serve them on the pretext of business in Singapore, which the casino can also make it look like one, this is what Singapore IR is built for, not for layman ya, how much can they earn from those shouting picture picture and finger pressing jackpot machine???

              <p><br>Singapore can go wider into the 'service industry' - do we need a Taiwanese 'hum' to provide the flesh service and make it into a 'industrial service ' ?</p>
              <p>If it is nothing more then more bull from the Taiwanese 'hum' pretending to know "everything about nothing" - simply to drive any thread off-track with its irrelevant remarks, views, and stupitity.</p>
