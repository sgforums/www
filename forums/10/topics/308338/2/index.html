              <p>http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2008/02/obama-is-not-fit-to-lead.html</p>
              <p>I'm so surprise that he is gaining so much support from American
              voters. This Barak Obama feller is not even qualified enough to be
              Singapore's President - a presidential candidate in Singapore is
              required to have had experience as the chairman or CEO of a statutory
              board, or of a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million.
              Obama would have been disqualified in Singapore yet Americans are
              considering for leadership of a country 100 times our size.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br>Americans
              should learn from Singapore and have a preselection process for their
              presidential candidates based on a set of stringent criteria so that
              unqualified people can be weeded out and not waste the time of voters.
              Better still make the criteria so stringent that only one person can
              qualify and do away with the election process altogether...that would
              really save alot of time.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br>This
              Obama guy is just a 2 term rookie senator who has not undergone
              rigorous grooming to ensure that he fits into the political
              establishment. He is not only threatening to change America, he is
              threatening to change the world. Lets look at what changes Obama is
              aiming for (most of the text is taken from <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">his campaign website</a> and you have my comments in red:</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 130%;">1. Labor.</span><br></strong>Ensure
              Freedom to Unionize: Obama believes that workers should have the
              freedom to choose whether to join a union without harassment or
              intimidation from their employers. Obama cosponsored and is strong
              advocate for the Employee Free Choice Act, a bipartisan effort to
              assure that workers can exercise their right to organize. He will
              continue to fight for EFCA's passage and sign it into law.</p>
              <p><strong>Protect Striking Workers: </strong>Obama
              supports the right of workers to bargain collectively and strike if
              necessary. He will work to ban the permanent replacement of striking
              workers, so workers can stand up for themselves without worrying about
              losing their livelihoods.</p>
              <p>[<span style="color: #990000;">Oh
              this Obama guy really has alot to learn from Singapore! We (in
              Singapore) all know the main role of unions is to persuade workers to
              accept collective wage cuts during recessions and to moderate their
              demands when times are good.]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">2. <strong>Tackling Poverty. </strong>Obama
              will raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation to make sure that
              full-time workers can earn a living wage that allows them to raise
              their families and pay for basic needs such as food, transportation,
              and housing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">[Minimum
              wage is an idea repeatedly rejected by our esteemed leadership. Having
              no minimum wage allows a govt to boast that it has created numerous
              jobs that does not pay enough for basic living and to berate its
              citizens for being fussy when they reject these jobs. Come on....
              people who cannot make a decent living because there are thousands
              imported from Bangladesh willing to do their jobs cheaper should be
              taught to accept inevitable fate instead of trying to raise a family on
              their low salaries.]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">3. <strong>Shine Light on Earmarks and Pork Barrel Spending</strong>:
              Obama's Transparency and Integrity in Earmarks Act will shed light on
              all earmarks by disclosing the name of the legislator who asked for
              each earmark, along with a written justification, 72 hours before they
              can be approved by the full Senate. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">[I
              hope that Mr. Obama understands that spending our national estate
              upgrading budget selectively on constituencies based on political
              support does not amount to pork barrel politics. It serves to educate
              voters on the importance of their votes.]</span></p>
              <p>4. <strong>Open Up Government to its Citizens. </strong>Making
              government data available online in universally accessible formats to
              allow citizens to make use of that data to comment, derive value, and
              take action in their own communities.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">[I
              think Obama has alot to learn when it comes to dealing with govt
              information. Singapore as gone on the other direction by use of the OSA
              (Official Secret Act) to prevent govt data from ever getting to the
              hands of the citizens. Singapore has no Freedom of Information Act
              (FOIA)which means you can only get data that the govt chooses to
              release to you..... data that will help you understand that your govt
              is doing a great job and that you should be grateful for their
              leadership. All other forms of data is considered harmful, confidential
              and against national interest. All you need to know is how great your
              govt is.]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Looks like
              Barak Obama has alot to learn about leadership, good governance and
              integrity from Singapore leaders. His lack of grooming really shows up
              in his desire to bring drastic change to his country. Singapore leaders
              carefully selected and groomed for the job knows the importance of
              promoting harmony and acceptance rather than change. They harmonise the
              goals of the power elite with the amount of hardship ordinary
              Singaporeans can be made to endure to perpetuate a system they have
              created to give themselves the highest remuneration in the world.
              Singaporeans are lucky to have good leaders.</span></p>
