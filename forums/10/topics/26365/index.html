But there is no sure way of knowing what job you would have so get settled in your NS life first.

SISPEC was still in pasir labar camp then and the 4 coys around the parade square was the absolute WORST place to be...<br><br>i was in sispec DELTA at that time and the OC was this SOF nut who was at least twice our age, but at least 3 times our level of fitness and easily 5 times our level of endurance...<br><br>so there we were, waiting for our next posting and praying like hell that we'ld get the hell out of here when i heard my name: cpl. tan, ASLC! F@#$%g S%&amp;T...<br><br>the worst thing was, i posted just right across the parade square into BRAVO  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  whose OC was a certified sadist...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> out of the frying pan, into the fire...<br><br>moral of the story: NS is not like a box of chocolates... at least u're sure u get chocolates when u buy chocolates... in NS, u get anything from sweets to shits... its a bittersweet experience...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think of it this way.......what can't break you will only make you stronger! I used to have low self-confidence, low morale and all. This is to the point where i feel that i am inferior to others in terms of capabilities,achievements and looks!But after i entered the Army, I am whacked real hard and suffered. I have not bathe for days, doing CASEVAC,cuts from mimosa from leopard crawling,dig stupid drains on Sunday,kena typhoon in Taiwan......The list goes on.Think positive, this is a valuable life experience! Furthermore you are not the only one doing it,countless guys are going through the same if not more siong training.I have grown to be a man so can you..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
