Paper cant wrap around fire remember?<br></div></blockquote>Gazelle. I totally agree with you. You cannot beat people's power. But you can put laws in place to prevent people from being able to have power for a long long time.<br><br>You can start with:<br><br>1. Creating a system that does not give them equal opportunity to get a rally space.<br><br>2. You can give them less TV airtime.<br><br>3. Less AND/OR biased press coverage.<br><br>4. Threaten them into submission.<br><br>5. Don't let them assemble for peaceful demonstrations.<br><br>6. Sue the only potential candidates -&gt; Get rid of them and Scare others.<br><br>7. Make them put a 10k bond to run for elections.<br><br>8. Dig up the dirt on their past mistakes and make them bogeymen.<br><br>9. Create a system where you must have as many opposition members as the current government to contest in GRCs. And then when they meet that number, increase the number of candidates.<br><br>10. Keep redrawing the GRC boundaries where you know they have a weaker base to become bigger. And then require that they match the large number of candidates to go against them.<br><br>11. Blackmail them into not getting lift upgrading if they don't vote you.<br><br>12. With all the above and with other perks and bonuses you can make them into sheep. Threaten them with sure failure. It's psychological warfare.<br><br>It's actually quite easy to prevent the people from having power.<br><br>The only way then to wrest control would to take the government by a coup or force. But that would result in unnecessary bloodshed and would set the country backwards. Which none of us want. Not even the opposition.<br><br>We love Singapore too much to do that.<br><br></div>

If PAP wants to hold high moral ground, it should shed the hypocrisy that upgrading carrots dont work. If they dont work, stop using it. Action speaks louder than words.</div>
