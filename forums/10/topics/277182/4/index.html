LHL is holding prime minister and finiancial minister which resembling that power and wealth of the nation is in the same person hand.

Anyone one has noticed are there other politician that through Singapore's history was holding power and the wealth of the nation beside LHL?<br><br>The Lees power has reached until today that it seems like no one can stop what ridiculous policies they want to pass down to people.

They will behave in the way not to offend the gahmen, their boss.   I look down on such mentality.</div>
