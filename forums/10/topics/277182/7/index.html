            <div class='col-md body'>I believe most oppositions are opposed to the government controlling their money. Why? Because a majority of this group of ppl just don't know how to think hard enough to make ends meet and the easiest way is to blatantly blast the government to get money back. They want the government to spoonfeed them all the way. The government is realising that they have spoonfed too much and by implementing the new policies, should encourage creative earning rather than waiting for the government to feed you.<br><br>I hope such ppl also don't expect their real-life parents to feed them to their graves too.<br><br>I say...dun be lazy.<br><br>I also say oppositions are not thinking long term.<br><br>Please feel free to be angry at my opinions thank you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But the thing is, they must field candidates in the West part of Singapore. Turns out during the last election, the battle was mainly in the North and Eastern parts of Spore. As a result, many West areas were walkovers. Not enough manpower or wanting to concentrate their resources in 1 area ain't good enough reasons. I have seen what the MPs in my area had done for me. Now I wanna see what the opposition can propose to improve the area I live in. For a start, a walkabout would be appropriate, but that just ain't happening. Or do they think that just because it isn't election year, hence there's no need 2 show their face?</div>
