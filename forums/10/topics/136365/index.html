            <div class='col-md body'>i wanna ask all of u christians here?? no offense.. but i want to know.. how many of u ppl here actually thing what the bible said are 100% true??<br><br>the fact that u believe n follow god.. and u will go heaven, if u dun.. u will go hell this kind of theory..<br><br>the fact that u must believe n follow god.. u will forever be heal from all diseases and u will never get sick..<br><br>the fact u will get all the miracles u can get if u believe and follow god..<br><br>or the contridicting part of the bible.. god is there to give u faith.. the faith for u to carry on.. even when he is unable to reach to u..<br><br>practically.. i have no offense on the religion.. i have only all these doubts about it.. y do i ask that??<br><br>i was invited by my fren to a city harvest service few months ago.. it was held at indoor stadium because they had invited an oversea pastor.. (forgotten the name le.. but according to what they say.. he is very famous and had been going all over the world.. i think he is call pastor heen or sth.. )<br><br>these are the things that he actually said.. every word came from his month..<br><br>he mentioned that a town near egypt, before the town was taken over by the egyptian, these ppl believed in jesus, and they never got sick until egypt took over the town..<br><br>he too mentioned he once saved a long-term wheel-chaired lady to be able to walk again by just saying that he will give miracle in the name of god.<br><br>at the later part.. he demostrated something that is call "miracle". the pastor asked wheel-chaired patients.. bed-widden patients, patients with uncurable diseases like cancer.. to come onto the stage..<br><br>he actually said this to the patient " by the name of lord jesus, i give u miracle". then these patients either they would claimed they felt better, or the person will walk again etc.. at the end of it.. he even demostrated the "great miracle".<br><br>i din see the "great miracle". cos i really feel very unpleasant. i have a family of only i being the healthier one, the rest are all haunt by illness. seriously, i dun feel that it is nice.. i understand it is a way to attract ppl to join the church.. but isnt this something really wrong??<br><br>i do see ppl actually believing this, crying, shedding tears when they see this scene..<br><br>i really want to ask the christians ppl in this forum, how many of u will actually believe so when u see this??<br><br>i still insist i have no offense asking this questions, but i really wanna know.. best if there are ppl from city harvest who witness this too to give a pov of this incident..</div>
