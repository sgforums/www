Becoming another sheep to try and make the shepherd change his way of doing things is pointless and ineffective. Staying abroad means u gain the ability to change things more than u ever will by entering politics. U can think of it as talk only all u want, but I've already made things happen before, I know my way is effective. U commoners dun chup, nevermind. not like you even being physically in sg makes any difference. The people who can make things happen chup me is enuf.
