U really think joining politics to do the bidding of a master over them is the answer? Like I said, u simply have no idea how things work. I've changed things before, by simply voicing out here. I've made things happen by voicing out here. I know how the politics work in sg, i know how the party works in sg. I know the people who will be joining the political system in sg in future by relation, I am related to the party by family, I know and realised far more things than u do, long ago, since i was 10+, while I was in sg, than u ever did or do. Just because I'm overseas, what gives u the credentials and rights to dismiss my efforts?
