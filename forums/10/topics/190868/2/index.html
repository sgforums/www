What about the med students? And if PSC scholars are not allowed to defer, how come current PSC scholars who have finished their degrees are allowed to defer further for their post-grads? they've got a basic degree, shouldn't they go back to serve? how come they're allowed to defer FURTHER?<br><br>I don't think its true that NOBODY is allowed to defer. They're just pulling wool over your eyes, laughing as they let people with special ties defer. If u want fair, then ANYBODY can defer, as long as its for the purpose of further studies, and then only for basic degrees or diplomas.</div>

The "hard" part of acheiving a good positive sort of equality, is how to ensure people have that sort of integrity and honour to return.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>really? nobody AT ALL, is allowed to defer? What about the med students? And if PSC scholars are not allowed to defer, how come current PSC scholars who have finished their degrees are allowed to defer further for their post-grads? they've got a basic degree, shouldn't they go back to serve? how come they're allowed to defer FURTHER?<br></blockquote>For almost a decade or more, medical students are not allowed to defer automatically. Those who are medically fit and have performed well enough during BMT to make it to Officers Cadet School are allowed to defer for local studies so that SAF will have a supply of cheap medical officers. Perhaps if the SAF thinks it is just as critical to have a cheap violinist in the army, it may allow this exception  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>PSC scholars are no longer allowed to defer following the new legislation. Those who have applied and have been granted deferment previously obviously will be allowed to carry on.<br><br>It is time to plug the loophole in our system as I have urged the government to do and I am glad that has come about. The bear is right: so this chap has to forgo this great opportunity for the time being, but so did numerous others over the years.</div>

I call it elitism otherwise.<br><br>I have no issue with allowing someone to defer to train in a skill that is crucial for running the army.
