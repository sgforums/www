Your unhappiness with the ruling party is of no concern to us. If the current regulations are set in place, why go out and try to bend it?

The route for a regular regardless is similar, abeit more towards a military regime.<br><br>Likewise, if such offers cannot suffice, why would they sign on in the first place?

I wonder what has feeling insecure got to do with all these, maybe you are the one with the insecurity. By the way, what is the number of MOs who will sign the contract if what you proposed is implemented? Do you have any slightest idea? Maybe you can conduct a survey and see.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If I am a broken recorder, you are no different from a has been broken, discarded cassette tape player who is playing the same tune of arty-farty should be allowed to defer. We both are staunch supporter of our own views. There is no way we are going to see eye to eye on this matter. Period.<br><br>I am tired of arguing with you. I am gonna wait and see what is the outcome. I am not expecting you to accept my views neither am I going to accept your points. At the end of the day, all these talks have no bearing on something concrete as to determine if violin plucker gets to defer or not. It is currently awaiting appeal, so I will leave it as that. It is up to you now if you want to continue to blindly champion your views. Be my guest.<br><br>You want to have the last say, you can have it. Not that it is going to help in violin plucker's case.</div>

The route for a regular regardless is similar, abeit more towards a military regime.<br></blockquote>Yes I am sure we will not find enough of them because I am a doctor as well. Of course every man has his price and if you are prepared to pay MOs 10-15k a month to see sick parade and cover exercises, you may find some who are willing to sign on.<br><br>But enough MOs for the entire SAF? I doubt it. First, there is the regimental lifestyle that does not appeal to many, the yearly IPPT that you have to pass if you want your bonus and promotions etc..Secondly, the army retires SAF officers by the time they reach 45-50 years old...it's cheaper to hire younger ones who are combat fit...What will these middle-aged MOs do at that age? Compete with young grads for GP jobs after 20 years of seeing cough and cold? Third, pay in the army is linked to rank and for promotion to MAJ and beyond, you have to be a specialist. Can the army ever beat the private sector for specialist pay? In any case, a specialist in the army will become incompetent before long because most of your patients are young and relatively well. Fourth, there is an image problem. SAF MOs are not as well regarded as other doctors. Fifth, if you run your own clinic, you are God. In the SAF, your CO, Camp commandant and a dozen other people are your Gods. Finally, having done 2.5 years of NS would a doctor want to continue playing soldier with horrible dog biscuits, stinking uniforms without a bath for days, mosquitoes everywhere, no sleep for days and complete exhaustion?<br><br>Maybe some might do it for the money but personally, I won't take the job for less than 50k a month  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But as I said, if the SAF is prepared to pay through their nose for regular MOs to run the SAF Medical Corps, I totally agree we should not allow medical students to disrupt and there is no need to do so.<br><br>Until that happens though, no deferment/disruption to anyone unless essential for operational needs.<br><br></div>

I wonder what has feeling insecure got to do with all these, maybe you are the one with the insecurity. By the way, what is the number of MOs who will sign the contract if what you proposed is implemented? Do you have any slightest idea? Maybe you can conduct a survey and see.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If I am a broken recorder, you are no different from a has been broken, discarded cassette tape player who is playing the same tune of arty-farty should be allowed to defer. We both are staunch supporter of our own views. There is no way we are going to see eye to eye on this matter. Period.<br><br>I am tired of arguing with you. I am gonna wait and see what is the outcome. I am not expecting you to accept my views neither am I going to accept your points. At the end of the day, all these talks have no bearing on something concrete as to determine if violin plucker gets to defer or not. It is currently awaiting appeal, so I will leave it as that. It is up to you now if you want to continue to blindly champion your views. Be my guest.<br><br>You want to have the last say, you can have it. Not that it is going to help in violin plucker's case.</div></blockquote>Regarding paywise for MOs and the number who may or may not sign up, i'm not clairvoyant, so i won't claim to say i know how many will sign up if that was implemented. I do know it will axe the requirement that MOs disrupt in the middle of NS for further studies.<br><br>Have you heard the saying: 'Money makes mare go'? There is always a price and how much one is willing to pay to recuit the best. If they are willing to pay ministers top dollar to run a country and deem that cost necessary, why not an MO who also has an equally important role in the military?<br><br>Is my suggestion flawed? Or are you unwilling to accept that possibility at all?<br><br>Tired of arguments? You repeatedly state that this will be your last post, yet continually respond afterwards.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  It seems you are not prepared to let others have the last say, even if that idea was far from my mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Blind championing? Up to now, you still failed to address my argument that that a one-for-all policy should apply, else if selective deferment was permitted, it should be catered across the board on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>You started out claiming deferment is denied to all, then later on moderated it to 'SAF regulations' permit SOME but not others to defer and the rules should be respected and not questioned. Changing your tact is like moving your goalposts; that doesn't help your cause at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>The final decision may have gone against him, but the debate will continue to rage on for years to come as Ike isn't going to be the last to challenge the system.<br><br>I can understand that no decision will ultimately please all parties, but it would be foolish to dream of such an ideal outcome.</div>

Of course every man has his price and if you are prepared to pay MOs 10-15k a month to see sick parade and cover exercises, you may find some who are willing to sign on.<br><br>But enough MOs for the entire SAF? I doubt it. First, there is the regimental lifestyle that does not appeal to many, the yearly IPPT that you have to pass if you want your bonus and promotions etc..Secondly, the army retires SAF officers by the time they reach 45-50 years old...it's cheaper to hire younger ones who are combat fit...What will these middle-aged MOs do at that age? Compete with young grads for GP jobs after 20 years of seeing cough and cold? Third, pay in the army is linked to rank and for promotion to MAJ and beyond, you have to be a specialist. Can the army ever beat the private sector for specialist pay? In any case, a specialist in the army will become incompetent before long because most of your patients are young and relatively well. Fourth, there is an image problem. SAF MOs are not as well regarded as other doctors. Fifth, if you run your own clinic, you are God. In the SAF, your CO, Camp commandant and a dozen other people are your Gods. Finally, having done 2.5 years of NS would a doctor want to continue playing soldier with horrible dog biscuits, stinking uniforms without a bath for days, mosquitoes everywhere, no sleep for days and complete exhaustion?<br><br>Maybe some might do it for the money but personally, I won't take the job for less than 50k a month  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But as I said, if the SAF is prepared to pay through their nose for regular MOs to run the SAF Medical Corps, I totally agree we should not allow medical students to disrupt and there is no need to do so.<br><br>Until that happens though, no deferment/disruption to anyone unless essential for operational needs.  </div></blockquote>I have no intention of forcing views down anyone's throats and it's pretty obvious that you stand by your opinion.<br><br>I would like to address one particular point regarding an image problem for doctors.<br><br>Eventually, you might conclude that people who DO sign on may come across as 'lesser doctors' because of the image issue concerning a lack of professional experience in mainstream medicine.<br><br>However, it can also be suggested that with greater operational exposure, especially to peacekeeping missions for the UN, such MOs may encounter greater difficulties related to combat injuries such as bullet wounds, extraction of sharpnel and head injuries. All this can only boost the experience of future MOs and bring them up to par with their public service equivalents. This will definitely allow them to specialise in combat injuries and will also dispel the misconception of the 'lesser doctor'.</div>
