It should not even be a contested topic...<br><br>Make it mandatory to serve your two years after you finish your ITE/JC/Poly then you go ahead and do what you want.

How can you <strong>ensure</strong> that he will be back to serve? All upcoming musical talents in singapore may not be potential defaulters, but every person who is allowed to defer their NS for overseas studies is a potential defaulter. Nobody is saying that the violin boy is definitely going to default, but there will be factors that may lead to the higher possibilities of defaulting when he is over there.<br><br>I am not green-eyed over his chance to go overseas for his education as I too have been there and done that after serving my NS without any deferment or disruption. The issue is that now that the regulations have been tightened why should he be an exception to let him defer?<br><br>To most of us, it probably doesn't matter much if he turns out to be a great musician. All we want is fairness, equality in dealing with this issue, is it too much to ask for? We pulled in our fair amount of effort in protecting this country before we even go for our higher education that is also important for our career. By letting violin boy defer, isn't that as good as telling the rest of us that our own future is less important than his? Tell us, how is this justified?<br><br>If he is really good at his music, he should not find any problem in developing his skills elsewhere. If his music talent can't even stand the test of time, then perhaps he may like to reconsider if making music is his future.</div>
