Assuming that he is allowed to defer his NS for his violin plucking lessons. Few years down the road, he decided not to come back, so who is going to be responsible for that? Are we just going to resign and accept the fact that another one just defaulted on NS? I may be quick to think of him as a defaulter, but ain't you as quick to brand him as a non-defaulter?

If such a situation can be avoided, then it should.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>With music qualifications, do you doubt that he cannot find a niche market in Singapore to promote music and the arts? Are you comparing the relatively PALTRY PAY of musicians against the MONEYBAGS of investment bankers, litigation lawyers, CEOs of MNCs etc? How narrow-minded is that? There is more to just earning big bucks. and there are certainly more opportunities in the west, where music is well-established. But shouldn't we start somewhere? How else should we progress?</blockquote>Frankly, in my opinion with a classical music degree, the prospect in the West is better. I can't even recall any classical musician that is based in Singapore who have made it good. I have never compared the salaries of different professions, that's your assumptions. What I am comparing is the availability of classical music career in Singapore right now. The situation might change, but till it does, I stand by my thinking. You might be the arty-farty person, but not me. Progress in our society, that's definitely a yes, but not at the expense of compromising national defense. An additional man in the orbat is an additional fighting chance.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>Your single comment of <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'while he is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">plucking</span> his violin strings</strong></span></span>' displays abject contempt for a fellow Singaporean. In times of war, will you be one of those who selectively chooses <strong><span style="color: indigo;">WHO TO AID IN BATTLE</span></strong> even if we all wear the same uniform? What a pity then that  in such times, instead of being selfless, you choose to remain selfish.</blockquote>I have already mentioned that I am a selfish person. All human beings at one time or another are. Heck, I don't even know this violin boy that well, so give me the reasons why I should do his share of defense? Why don't you offer yourself to SAF to take up his duties instead when the s.hit hit the fan.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>You already mentioned that no one will lose sleep if Ike serves at a later date, so why express your insistence that he must serve NS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRST</span>? Will the Curtis Institute reserve his place for 2 years? Do you think every tertiary institution in the world is run in the same manner as our local Universities?</blockquote>If curtis is unwilling to bend their school rules, why can't he look for other schools? It is not the school that make the musician, but the person himself. If he is really so good at plucking violin strings, then all the more he should prove to the world that no matter where ever he ended up in, he should be able to shine. If he is unable to do that, doesn't that again question his musical 'talents'? I never thought that every tertiary institution in the world is run in the same manner as our local Universities, you assume that I did.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>You should tone down your judgemental comments and instead reflect on the possible opportunities of how best a balanced decision can be made. Imagine Curtis Institue getting a "sorry, NS first" response to their invitation</blockquote>If that is really an institution of quality, then it should be able to understand the reasons why violin boy have to serve first. Unless most of their instructors are old men/women who are about to kick the bucket in the next 2 years, then perhaps that might explain their music teachings is more important than the national defense of a country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>What we (those who are against him deferring NS) are asking for is just fairness. If he is allowed to defer for his violin plucking lessons, so must others who wants to take up tertiary courses before serving NS. What about people with a genuine family problems, shouldn't they allow to defer NS as well. By this alone, this will result in a whole lot of other problems and pray tell what is the solution then. I am not saying there is no better solution in the future, but currently the best one is to refuse deferrment for everybody.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Just so that you know what you are talking about, here is a link to the Minister's speech.<br><br>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/resources/speeches/2006/06mar06_speech2.html<br><br>I don't agree that we should allow any disruption to anyone just because of tertiary studies, because the system must be fair to all. In this regard, I do not agree that PSC scholars should enjoy disruption unless there is an operational need for the SAF to do so.<br><br>As for medical students, there is such an operational need. Let's go back 20 years. When I enlisted, both medical and dental students were allowed disruption because we needed medical and dental officers in the army. This special treatment granted to these two groups has always been a source of grief and about 10 years ago, the policy was revised.<br><br>Dental services are outsourced to private dentists, supplemented by a small number of regular dental officers. Obviously we don't have enough DOs but we decided we do not need so many dentists anyway and so dental students were no longer allowed to disrupt.<br><br>What about medical students? A proportion of medical students who perform well enough during BMT to make it to OCS are allowed to disrupt and finish medical school, so that when they return they can be trained as medical officers. The rest were not allowed to disrupt and complete their NS as rifleman, signaller etc.<br><br>As a result, we have a rather morbid situation where there are doctors who are consultants in the hospital but do their ICT as riflemen. In view of the dire shortage of medical officers (there is a gradual attrition over the years due to downgrading, emigration etc), there have been recent attempts to make these rifleman doctors medical officers. But by then they are reservists and you cannot call them back for more than 40 days a year. The hospitals are also unable to let so many of these doctors go at the same time for MOCC. And how do you reduce the 9-month OCS course to 40 days? They have tried to do that, but from what I hear the results are far from satisfying and of course, they only solve the reservist MO shortage.<br><br>Therein lies the problem. For operational reasons, we need medical officers both in active and reservist service. You can train someone to be a driver during his 2 years of NS but you cannot do that (nor can the SAF afford to) train doctors during that period of time. The only solution is to allow some of them to disrupt for medical school so that the SAF can properly operate.<br><br>If you have a solution that does not involve disruption and yet provide the SAF with its medical officers, I am sure MINDEF will be happy to hear it.</div></blockquote>What you've given is a whole load of bull. (excuse my frankness) You just proved the fact that people are willing to make concessions to further some sloppy manpower planning, <strong><span style="color: red;">IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION </span></strong>to your staunch views <span style="color: blue;"><strong>AGAINST</strong> </span>disruption. That was the very essence of your argument wasn't it? To absolutely deny any and all requests for deferment? Yet you seem to readily condone the powers-that-be who have opened a loophole to solve their MO problem? Selective preference on your part then?<br><br>Our govt always claims to recruit the best minds, pay them the highest salaries pegged at top executives of top companies around the world, yet they cannot solve an already wrong recruitment policy?<br><br>Well, allow this humble peasant to offer one suggestion:<br><br>Allow medical students to COMPLETE their NS, then go for their 5-year medical course, at which time, SAF can recruit fully trained 'riflemen' as MOs, pending the relevant conversion course. With the right attractive package, it should have no problem enticing potential MOs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been observing this thread, for sometime........ I personally have finished NSF and is now reservist in a particular Guards battalion.<br><br>I personally think that this violinist should not get a disruption or deferment, bcos if you take a look at the SAFSA and MDC. Many of our artiste and celebs came from MDC. I believe there is a SAF band in which perhaps they can post him there. This way, he can still retain his abilities in playing the instrument at the same time complete his NS, interacting with other skillfull musicians. I believe ppls like JJ Lin is from MDC if I am not wrong..... I sympathise and agree to a certain extent that NS system should not be given leeways to the special class of ppls and I can understand the anger some display here in the forum. But think of it this way....... the risk of dying or kana some veri major injuries during NS, NS disrupting the 2.5 yrs of your precious youth, I have experience myself some difficulties coping by in the university.<br><br>I strongly believe this sentiments and srguement abt NS system should not be just solely discussed in a single package or individually. One must look at the entire social, economical mindset of the Singaporeans. I have encounter other country ppls like Swede, Finns on other forums. Both nations have been pratising NS systems for long time. Their citizens ironically, seem to be veri positive and supportive of their conscription systems. After some lengthly discussion, I came to this conclusion........ Yes, at times, their conscripts do chao keng, but they do NS as they want to protect their way of life and most importantly, their democracy. Thus if we relate back to Singapore..........<br>Everything here is so mudane, banal, state-own and controlled. Thus, the ppls dun find any means and reason to love our country. look at the scholars in our tertiary education system, the govt give them free education, food, logging, laptop and on top of that they get 500 a month. Think of it this way, the govt rather give the chance to a foreigner 3000km away, rather than a local JC or Poly students. U chiong for almost one plus yr in SAF then u get 500 dollars onli. Laggi best, during holiday, they go home to play, while most Singaporean males are also packing their packs, to enjoy a few weeks stay in the wildlife reserves of Lim Chu Kang or Marsiling. Lol.  Next time u graduate the govt will most prob slap a pink IC at their face and they bcome Singaporeans while u have to suffer all those Mob,RT, ICT, wat more, u stand to lose your jobs to these new 'talents' as they no need reservist. Dun get me wrong, I am not whining here. If the govt do not give respect to all Singaporeans, treating this island as a rich harbour, when u happy u come, going gets tough u leave........ how do u expect Singaporeans to love NS or even love Singapore. Sometimes GCT should ask himself, why are Singaporeans quiting? Is it just bcos other countries have greener pasture. Wat makes a Singaporean? How would some one love a place when they dun even own anything, or their views are never respected. If our govt still hang on to this " Singapore is like a hotel" mentality towards the foreigners, dun expect there will be any improvement in morale of the ppls .</div>
