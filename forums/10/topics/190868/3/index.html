But everyone are talented in their own niche. So how to justify who gets to defer? You may suggest on the mean test system and stipulating terms and conditions like a one-time deposit but will a talented poor man's son be able to fork this amount in the first place?<br><br>Another point of issue is the case of Pianist Melvyn, there is certainly no way to measure whether a man would gladly returned to serve his motherland if the offer at the other side of the pasture is more enticing, more than the deposit he placed. Monetary value aside, isnt it socially logical for any talents whom are on the verge of success to push further onto international stage, ie to strike while the iron is hot than to make a U-turn? How many would risk giving up something so close on achieving by coming back to serve faithfully after the legal deferment contract ends? If so, do they formed the majority? Even so, will they served half-heartedly? What happen if the majority break contract? Does it show money can buy freedom? Will it be fair to others who served? Obviously a risk is at play here. Instead of creating an environment of citizenry inequality, upsets by the risks involved, how about turning the tide around and enforce equality and fairness to each and everyone.<br><br>Without a doubt, the rigidity of this system however stringent it may seem, bring about social equality among fellow Singaporeans. We, regardless of family backgrounds, diversive of talents, ethnic groups or religions, luck or fate are all born and raise here. It is this common destiny, the obligation to the nation that we all share, that make us similar or brothers-in-arms not a system tilted in favour of the talented - Without fear or favour.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

If he is talented, he will be able to find his own opportunities after NS. While the same opportunity may not knock twice, if he is determined to study music, he will find his own path. If the opportunity does not seek him, then he should take the proactive role to create his own opportunities.<br><br>If most of us can go back to school after our NS, why can't a musician?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  During NS, he can choose to practise over the weekend to maintain his violin proficiency  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The main point of discontent is that for those who have served or are currently serving NS is that since the law has been tightened to disallow anymore deferment, why should he be given special treatment? For many of us, we too have our share of missed opportunities, but still we served and moved on in our life.<br><br>Let's assume that if this Ike is given leave to study music before he comes back and serve NS. What is the guarantee that he will come back? Can anyone ensure that? It might be no big deal to SAF if Ike decided to skip town and play music, but it sure pissed me off badly, that I have to do his share of protecting his parents, dogs and cats while he is at it. To the arts loving people, Ike may be the next music star, but to an old boor like me, I prefer an additional man to the SAF orbat for any emergencies.</div>

The "hard" part of acheiving a good positive sort of equality, is how to ensure people have that sort of integrity and honour to return.

For me the stand is clear, nobody should be more equal than others when it comes to serving NS. If the violin boy gets his deferment, then ain't we back to square one that people with "special" talents gets the special treatment? This ain't animal farm whereby "four legs good, two legs better" motto applies here.<br><br>This may be a rare opportunity for him. However, as mentioned in my earlier post, if he is really determined to stay in the music field, he should be looking for other opportunities not wait for the opportunity to look for him. A true talent will always be good at what he is, regardless of the passing of time or opportunity. If his talent can't stand the test of time, then surely it must make you wonder how true is his talent?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea how many have the chance to be world class sia? How many actually fit to be in this catagory? Singapore should be more flexible in this.... I am wonder how come community service like becoming a monk or Priest can exempt NS and ICT and not world class talent? It's the person future I say go for it. How many in the whole corhort of NSF fits into the category anyway. I think less than 10? or even 5....</div>
