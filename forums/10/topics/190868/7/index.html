            <div class='col-md body'>For goodness' sake... just let the guy go and get his education overseas, and make him sign an undertaking to ensure that he returns to Singapore eventually to do his NS liability. Warn him that if he were to ever default on NS he would be subject to full prosecution to the full extent of the law upon stepping on Singapore's shores again.<br><br>He's talented, but that does not make him an elite. Elitism is all about favouring one type of people over the other on virtue of birthright or wealth. In this case, it's due to his ability. That does not make him an elite in any way.<br><br>You may say that if he's so good, his ability will not diminish after two years of NS. Well, let me ask you: are you a good violinist yourself? Otherwise you're in no position to be judging his ability.<br><br>And it's not as if every single mother's son is going to default on his NS liability just because we grant deferment to one person. I will willingly stay back and hold the fort for this one guy so long as he promises to return one day.<br><br>You may say it's unfair to let one guy defer his NS, but I say it's even more unfair to prevent a talented person from fully realising his dreams. It's really hypocritical to say that we should develop our arts scene locally and yet deprive this one person from nurturing his abilities in the arts.<br><br>So Lazerlordz, count me in as another NSman who supports giving this guy deferment.</div>

Afterall, at the moment, with a music qualifications, what can he do in Singapore? There are more opportunities in the west for him.

Why should a scholarship be a passport to 'disruption' ?<br><br>So long as scholars and medical students get their deferment, the debate will always rage on. </div></blockquote>Just so that you know what you are talking about, here is a link to the Minister's speech.<br><br>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/resources/speeches/2006/06mar06_speech2.html<br><br>I don't agree that we should allow any disruption to anyone just because of tertiary studies, because the system must be fair to all. In this regard, I do not agree that PSC scholars should enjoy disruption unless there is an operational need for the SAF to do so.<br><br>As for medical students, there is such an operational need. Let's go back 20 years. When I enlisted, both medical and dental students were allowed disruption because we needed medical and dental officers in the army. This special treatment granted to these two groups has always been a source of grief and about 10 years ago, the policy was revised.<br><br>Dental services are outsourced to private dentists, supplemented by a small number of regular dental officers. Obviously we don't have enough DOs but we decided we do not need so many dentists anyway and so dental students were no longer allowed to disrupt.<br><br>What about medical students? A proportion of medical students who perform well enough during BMT to make it to OCS are allowed to disrupt and finish medical school, so that when they return they can be trained as medical officers. The rest were not allowed to disrupt and complete their NS as rifleman, signaller etc.<br><br>As a result, we have a rather morbid situation where there are doctors who are consultants in the hospital but do their ICT as riflemen. In view of the dire shortage of medical officers (there is a gradual attrition over the years due to downgrading, emigration etc), there have been recent attempts to make these rifleman doctors medical officers. But by then they are reservists and you cannot call them back for more than 40 days a year. The hospitals are also unable to let so many of these doctors go at the same time for MOCC. And how do you reduce the 9-month OCS course to 40 days? They have tried to do that, but from what I hear the results are far from satisfying and of course, they only solve the reservist MO shortage.<br><br>Therein lies the problem. For operational reasons, we need medical officers both in active and reservist service. You can train someone to be a driver during his 2 years of NS but you cannot do that (nor can the SAF afford to) train doctors during that period of time. The only solution is to allow some of them to disrupt for medical school so that the SAF can properly operate.<br><br>If you have a solution that does not involve disruption and yet provide the SAF with its medical officers, I am sure MINDEF will be happy to hear it.</div>
