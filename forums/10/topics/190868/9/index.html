Now i think its becoming very clear. We've started down the slippery slope of communism when we not only accept the sort of equality that damages the nation and society, but exhort it vigoriously like a few individuals have done so here. clearly there is nothing right at all about this sort of farcial equality imposed on us, but for some, the existance of equality itself holds more precedence over the SORT of equality in existance. Unfortunately they don't see how foolish they really are do they? Then again, they might be communists, so it wouldn't seem wrong to them to begin with.</div>

The potential loss is SAF have one less fighting man.<br><br>As someone has mentioned, SAF's business is to maintain operational capabilities to deter aggressors. SAF is not into making music and MTV nor nuture nobel prize winners. Unless there is an operational requirement, then the rules can't be bent.

Assuming he gets the deferment, the HQ tells the unit, too bad you only get 9 men. So instead of 10 RPs sharing a duty roster, now they have only 9. Again assuming that unit 1 managed to get a replacement from unit 2, it will be unit 2's turn to face the shortage. This as you can see is where the shortage in manpower comes in if he is allowed to defer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Serving at 25 is not any less than a man at 19 as I viewed it. However, why must he go before serving NS when the deferment he has applied to has been rejected? What is wrong with going to music school later? If he is really talented then he should have no problem establishing himself in other schools. Has he tried to defer his enrolment in the music school instead? Why should NS be of less importance than a music school? Which is more important, national defense or music? Without a country, there will be not even be a patch of soil for any aspiring musician to even start learning piano or violin.<br><br>Promotion of the art is MICA idea not Mindef nor SAF. Ike should at least try to approach MICA for a scholarship if he has to give up his place at this current music college. Other avenues of scholarship can also be sourced from other music school of similar standing. So what is so wrong about doing it?</div>

However, how does it contribute to the operational capabilty of SAF? I blindly champion the the NS cause WITHOUT deferment just like you champion pursuing arts that is of NO VALUE to SAF operational status. I will say we are both guilty of it. I did not conclude that you say music &gt; daily lives of average singaporean. I was just asking you why is violin plucker's music education more important than daily lives of average singaporean. The fact that the regulations have been tightened to disallow any more deferment, so why should violin plucker still carry on and try his luck? Given the fact that his deferment has been rejected based on the new regulations, why should his appeal to be approved (which at this point have not been)?<br><br>Like you, I have addressed your points to as best an effort as I can. It is just too bad we both see things in different light.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>To have world class musicians, one has to be acknowledged as world class first.

Without one, you can't have the other.<br></blockquote>Nobody is questioning the need to establish a good music school here and the need of musicians to do that. However, why should that be of more important than maintaining the operational capability of the country. Why can't violin plucker just shelved his education (as required by law for him to do his NS) and go later.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>Stop sounding like a one-who-knows all.

To use us as an asset to fight in a foxhole is as what my brigade commander, S3 and S2 have said during my NS and ICTs that amounts to point where the sub-units have been overran. The doctrine which you mentioned are applicable to infantry, guards and armour line companies where the whole battlegroup fights together and it doesn't applied to us.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>You are attempting to rationalise why MOs deserve deferment over a 'violin plucker'. In an earlier reply to Oxford Mushroom, i already raised a suggestion on reforms regarding the recruitment policy that would nullify the need to 'defer' potential MOs for further studies. This certainly could be restructured and implemented by our million-dollar ministers who cannot seem to solve a simple manpower riddle.<br><br>The crux of the matter is simple: you defer MOs, your open a loophole for others. If you provide for such options and make concessions for a 'special' group, why should others be excluded as well? There are ways to make an ideal 100% blanket ban on deferment, so why isn't that considered? Isn't it more obvious that the powers-that-be WANT to keep this channel open for a select group's benefit?</blockquote>So, let's for now say don't offer deferment to anyone including MOs and violin pluckers. Faced with a projected shortage of MOs where are you going to find the MOs required for the next few years? Offer MOs contract, that is provided they take the bite, how many will? Your unhappiness with the ruling party is of no concern to us. If the current regulations are set in place, why go out and try to bend it? As you admitted, there is no need for a violin plucker to be in SAF, so why allow violin plucker to defer and in turn lose an additional soldier for now?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>How different is a disruption vs a deferment? Isn't disruption a sub-set of deferment? However you choose to see it, a disrupted personnel is still given 'time off' when he should be serving. Isn't Teo Chee Hean just trying to mitigate his difficult position of attempting to pander to both sides of the masses: those pro and against his upping of the disruption penalty?<br><br>For every one man loss to disruption, you are one man short. Isn't that what you were against from the start? </blockquote>Well, like your argument, what you chose to believe is something that we cannot control. Our stand is on the operational status of SAF should not be compromised by people pursuing a certification that is of no use to SAF. Period.<br><br>If violin plucker can defer his NS, why can't he do the same, that is to defer his studies? Why should SAF give in to violin plucker and not vice versa? Is he more important than the national defense?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>I wonder who's uptight?

Nobody knows. Why do people jump the gun, that's because they don't want to see a repeat of such events granted that regulations were just tightened? Why allow the possibility of such thing to happen when you can prevent it?<br><br>Like it or not, we all have our opinions, and nobody is forcing you to accept them. BTW, I had wanted to end the discussion, but you are the one who wanted the last word which is why I am back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
