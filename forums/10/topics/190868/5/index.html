As for women doing NS, the best vocation for them would be ER nurses. SMM can open up a course specially for them, and they will be enlisted directly there.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, so far I guess everyone involved in this discussion is of 2 camps. One being in favour of letting Ike defer NS for his music studies.

So what kind of fairness are you talking about here? Being A Singaporean, you are constrained by your obligation to your nation. I am not against NS, I am fully for the national defence. But seeing so many foreigners can easily become citizens without the NS nor ICT obligations really make me envy them. And best, they enjoy the same benefits, including the progress package (if I am not wrong). Why can't we make them serve ICT at the civil defence? At least we are talking about fairness now that all natural Singaporeans or "converted" Singaporeans do play some parts in the national defence. Giving the NS Men some releft is not sufficient - not even enough to have a decent meal. And what about those "converted" Singaporeans who did not convert their children's citizenship? They are keeping an alternative exit. Do you think they will stay here to fight for our country during emergency? They will claim that they did not serve NS and hence do not know how to shoot.<br><br></div>

NS have to be fair, if there's to be deferment let it be for all.  Everyone has a talent, be it in musical or any others for that matter.  You can be a great plumber, nurse, even house-husband, it's all a talent.  But when it comes to NS, everyone must know it's a sacrifice.  To be interrupted in the prime of your life, is something nobody would want.  I feel sorry for the boy too and I wish him all the best, but he must know that want Singapore ask from him is something asked of for all the males in Singapore.</div>
