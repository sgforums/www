            <div class='col-md body'>the long and short is, u look at this thread, and then u look at the way everyday singaporeans view issues like this, then u know its no surprise why we cannot progress artistically and culturally as a nation. The division here is so deep.<br><br>The funny thing is, why does the govt even bother to pretend to want to promote the arts? Why keep acting? Might as well drop the act. Backwards equality as a cheap appeasement of part of the populace will keep u in power in the short run, but does no good for the nation in the long run. Already u see some people who have this mentality that people who did not serve have no moral right to comment on such issues. That is not healthy for any nation, to breed only spiteful people who are easily greened. Worse, the same sort of people assume everything around them without bothering to check the facts 1st.<br><br>Doesn't look good then, for the future.</div>
