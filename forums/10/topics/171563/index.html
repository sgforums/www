NS SLAVES BEING USED AS GUINEA PIGS FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS?<br><br>Coffee lovers, the army wants you<br>Scientists hope to develop a caffeine pick-me-up pill for SAF soldiers<br><br>By David Boey<br><br>DEFENCE scientists are looking for 'regular caffeine drinkers' to take part in a study that they hope will lead to the development of a special pill to keep soldiers alert in the field.<br><br>In what is believed to be the first extensive study of the effects of caffeine on Asians, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore's leading defence research and development organisation, will spend three years analysing the natural stimulant, which is found in foods such as coffee and tea.<br><br>The idea is that they will be able to reproduce the pick-me-up feeling regular coffee drinkers enjoy in the form of a slow-release pill enabling Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers to remain vigilant even if sleep deprived.<br><br>Mr Fabian Lim, 40, head of the Military Physiology Lab at DSO's Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, said: 'Several experiments will be conducted to understand the metabolism of caffeine in the local population...and if these effects translate into enhanced vigilance in the military context.<br><br>'DSO is also working on a pill that will maintain a sustained release of caffeine, so that caffeine is made available in the body over several hours.'<br><br>The idea of caffeine pills is not new. Studies carried out in Europe and the United States have resulted in pills that delay the onset of fatigue. 'In the US Army for example, caffeine is consumed by their soldiers in the form of a chewing gum,' Mr Lim said.<br><br>But while caffeine pills can be bought off the shelf, DSO wants to develop its own tailor-made concoctions.<br><br>DSO scientists will attempt to break new ground by experimenting with caffeine pills of different potency. DSO's caffeine pills have been specially blended in Singapore for the study.<br><br>The tiny burgundy-coloured pills hold anything from the equivalent of half a cup of coffee to caffeine doses equivalent to two cups of coffee.<br><br>DSO scientists will try different doses on people with varying body weights, physical conditions and ages. The idea is to find the best match for different Asian body types.<br><br>Scientific data on how caffeine affects Asians is scarce and DSO wants to scrutinise the stimulant's medical and psychological aspects to ensure the specially-blended pills are safe.<br><br>Anyone aged between 18 and 35 - an age window that DSO said is 'representative of the age group in the SAF' - can take part in the study.<br><br>A DSO advertisement published in The Straits Times on Dec 7 has netted about a dozen responses, but Mr Lim hopes at least 60 more people will step forward.<br><br>DSO said it is targeting people who drink more than three caffeine-based beverages a day. Volunteers will be paid, but DSO said the amount is confidential.<br><br>The caffeine drinkers will be asked to stay at DSO's institute, next to the National University Hospital, for 48 hours. The tests will be repeated four times over a six-month period.<br><br>While at the lab, volunteers will be given capsules containing different caffeine doses, ranging from the equivalent of half a cup to two cups of coffee, then be asked to perform simple tasks to test their reflexes and mental agility.<br><br>For more information, call Mr David Fun on 6485-7108 or e-mail fchiokyu@dso.org.sg<br><br></div>
