            <div class='col-md body'>I read with amazement and disgust the recent incident, wherein an elderly man dies in a fight with co-tenant (flat-mate).<br><br>Why must government, dictate how people live?? Must the gov deny us every drop of our RIGHTS as humans?? From retirement savings, to jobs, to a life of NO RETIREMENT / IMPOSSIBLE TO RETIRE (wonder what Retirement Funds are for as such), and to the end of our lives.<br><br>To this incident, I ask the gov; Do your people, have eyes to see what your "policies" are doing to people?<br><br>======================================================<br><strong><span class="large">Elderly can't rent flat alone. Some have no choice but to share with people they dislike </span></strong><br><strong>FLAT WOES<br>March 30, 2007       </strong><br><br>PUT two strangers together in a small space and sparks are bound to fly - and not in a good way.<br><br>Counsellors who spoke to The New Paper said that fights between co-tenants in Housing Board rental flats are common.<br><br>Mr Anthony Teo, programme coordinator at the Thong Kheng Seniors Activity Centre in that Jalan Bukit Merah, said friction is inevitable after living together for a while.<br><br>He said: 'About 75 per cent of people who live in such rental flats are elderly people with no relatives. So they have co-tenants.<br><br>'But sometimes, co-tenants move out because they don't get along with their flatmate.'<br><br>Under the HDB's Joint Singles scheme, two singles who are at least 35 years old can rent a one-room flat together. Their gross household income must not exceed $1,500 a month.<br><br>HDB does not allow a senior citizen to rent a flat alone.<br><br>Mr Teo said: 'When one co-tenant dies or moves out, the HDB will ask the existing resident to look for another flatmate.<br><br>'Otherwise, the HDB can assign a co-tenant to the flat.<br><br>'Many co-tenants are friendly after being introduced to each other. But friction can arise after living together for some time.'<br><br>Mr Teo recalled one case where tension arose because the main tenant was hygienic, but his elderly co-tenant left tissue paper all over the place.<br><br>'They quarrelled regularly within two months of living together. I talked to them and told the co-tenant not to be so dirty.<br><br>'I also told the main tenant to give way as the co-tenant was older. After two months, the co-tenant moved out.'<br><br>And once there is friction, it is hard for two flatmates to continue living together, Mr Teo said.<br><br>'Elderly people tend to bear grudges after a quarrel. Even after counselling, they resume quarrelling after a few days.'<br><br>Yesterday's Bukit Merah case was not the only instance of flat-sharing gone wrong. At least three other cases have been reported previously.<br><br>On 21 Aug 2005, Chew Thiam Huat, 48, bludgeoned his 64-year-old flatmate Soh Chiang Tam to death.<br><br>He then stabbed the body with a kitchen knife, believing that Mr Soh had a winning lottery ticket that belonged to him.<br><br>Chew was jailed for life on reduced manslaughter charges after it was found that he was a schizophrenic.<br><br>On 31 Jan 2004, Goh Sing Teck, 54, an odd-job labourer, repeatedly slashed and stabbed his co-tenant, Mr Raymond Chia Teck, 51, on the chest, arms and legs after they had a quarrel.<br><br>Mr Chia, who sustained 11 stab wounds, died in hospital. He had provoked Goh by swearing at him, challenging him to a fight and kicking him in their one-room rental flat in Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>In a note, Goh had written that 'everyone here can hear him scolding me every day'. He also cited a lack of privacy and repeated abuse from the victim as further motivation.<br><br>Goh was convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.<br><br>On 17 Sep 2002, Chia Moh Heng, 52, unemployed, stabbed his co-tenant, Mr Pang Siew Yin, 55. They shared a Jalan Kukoh flat.<br><br>Chia, who had a history of mental illness, was convicted of culpable homicide and jailed for life for manslaughter.<br><br>HDB does not allow an elderly person to rent a flat on his or her own to prevent accidents from happening, and to ensure that there will be someone to take care of them.<br><br>In a previous report in The New Paper On Sunday, an HDB spokesman said: 'For elderly persons, a more practical housing arrangement would be for them to live with family members for care and support.<br><br>'However, if for some reason, a single elderly person needs rental housing from HDB, there must be at least two single citizens, or one citizen and one permanent resident, to rent the flat together.<br><br>'Apart from ensuring optimal usage of the flat, this arrangement ensures that they have each other for mutual care and support, and is especially important if one of the occupiers is weak in health.'<br><br>In its latest annual report, HDB states that there are 19,491 one-room flats and 22,549 two-room flats.<br><br>Of these, about one in five of such flats are in Bukit Merah (4,231 one-room flats and 4,927 two-room flats).<br><br>Rentals range from $26 to $205 per month for one-room flats and $44 to $275 per month for two-room flats, depending on each household's gross monthly income.<br><br>In a Straits Times report earlier this year, Lions Befrienders, an elderly welfare group which looks after more than 700 elderly singles, said that some of the elderly residents who share rental flats do not get along, and some are driven out by their flatmates.<br><br>Its volunteers have found elderly people sleeping at the void deck of their block, feeling stressed and anxious.<br><br>There are no separate bedrooms in one-room flats, and the welfare group suggested improving these flats to let tenants have their own rooms and give them privacy.<br><br>Elderly people tend to bear grudges after a quarrel. Even after counselling, they resume quarrelling after a few days.<br><br>- Mr Anthony Teo, programme coordinator at the Thong Kheng Seniors Activity Centre in that Jalan Bukit Merah<br><br></div>
