            <div class='col-md body'>i have no qualms with making good progress with china both politically and economically. but why it need to be SM lee and not minister of trade nor foreign minister? i think he should relinguish his power and be really behind the screen as advisor for the minister in respective ministry. otherwise singapore would stillbe regards as one man country" special one".<br><br>yes we are making progress in our economy but he problem is the growth are not felt by all ranks in singapore. and govt are not addressing this seriously.<br>cost has to be curbs. we have to relook the privatisation of GLC company. does it hinder the growth of local enterprise.<br>why the need to privatise impt dept like power, water,transportation, HDB why it would be much better to be in govt control.<br>do we need to explain more on the motive??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As with a recent poll taken of 100 people by the straits times, all of the 100 polled did not want the govt out of office, but merely censured for certain acts that have not gone down well with the people.<br><br>The handling of the IRs was highlighted as a decision that went ahead despite a significantly high negative response from the people.<br><br>Another irk was the manner in which the RC and incumbent PAP MPs managed residents during elections. Yusof from the hotly contested Aljunied GRC described his visit from his MP whom 'he didn't know' as cold and 'dissatisfactory'. The MP (who is not named) gave him a quick handshake, thrust a bottle of newater into his hands, and left. It was all very well rehearsed and executed.<br><br>Sylvia Lim on the other hand, spent several minutes talking to Yusof, not just 'shaking his hands' but was 'sincere'. Hence the WP got his vote.<br><br>Top of the polls was:<br><br>1. a desire to have alternative voices in parliament to act as a check on the govt<br><br>2. disapproval of ruling party tactics such as votes-for-upgrading strategy<br><br>3. the view that ruling party candidates were unapproachable.<br><br>Most of the people even concurred that the majority of Ruling party candidates were seen as 'stand-offish' and 'out of touch' with ordinary people.<br><br>Judging by the rate this goes, people may one day yearn to have a 50-50 coalition govt, PAP-opposition run, with PAP running the national issues while the opposition handling the affairs of the people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At least Singapore is fairly stable and peaceful. thanks to the far-sightedness of MM. PM seems to pale beside MM but it is not a fair comparison because it is very difficult to govern Singapore now with so many intellects and street-wise people and the rapid globalisation of Singapore. MM faced different challenges in his era.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is actually a new challenge to everyone, not only the MM. Besides, who is the <strong>head</strong> of our state? Isn't it the PM? The title of MM is more like an honour to him. His contribution now should more for advisory and guidance, it shouldn't be one who should hold much power, is it not? I am not cursing him, but how many more ten years can he serve our nation? It should be time for him to really hand over whatever he is still holding and be an adviser or guidance for the minister and the potential office holder. Is better to let them learn this way, isn't it...</div>
