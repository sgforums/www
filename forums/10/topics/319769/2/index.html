              <p>In 1988, the ruling People's Action Party amended the Parliamentary Elections Act to create GRCs and to move away from the single member constituency system. GRCs started out at a size of 3 in 1988 but have steadily grown bigger in subsequent elections.</p>
              <p>The current act enables the President, who is generally under advice of the Elections Department, to create a GRC from 3 to 6 electoral wards. In each GRC, at least one candidate or MP must be from a minority race — either a Malay, Indian or Other. The lack of transparent separation of powers between the Elections Department and the ruling party has led the opposition to accuse the government of gerrymandering.</p>
              <p>GRCs operate with a plurality voting system, meaning that the party with the largest share of votes wins all seats in the GRC. (This means that even with a one-vote plurarity or majority, the winning team gets to win the whole GRC.) All Singaporean GRCs have had a People's Action Party (PAP) base. Some opposition parties have won seats in SMCs, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but never in a GRC.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Look at things from a business perspective, maybe that will make you feel better. When one considers himself to be the pioneer in the market, he damn wishes to dominate the market, if not to monopolize it eternally. But when competition creeps up, it calls for innovation, and some takes it to mean “whatever it takes to win”. This gives rise to social conflicts that were insofar best defined by Karl. You may find it morally repulsive, but others, especially those who get to share a bite of the cake without having to subject to public approval and/or endorsement would think that it is their entitlement. However, as you have mentioned, that the game-rule had been in place for some 20 years and still existing, then there can only be two possibilities:</span></p>

              <p>Situation 1 tends to foster a climate for 2, if and where there is little perceived avenue for independent analysis of an "experienced" climate of messages and communication that are geared towards diffusion of opinions backing the concept of legitimacy. </p>
              <p>It is also evident that depoliticisation is also entrenched and comprehensively adopted through various schemes that are influential from formative years of a citizen. </p>

              <p>I do not foresee much change in the next elerction  given that it is around 3.5 years away.  That is very short time for change.</p>

              <p>This forum is very well-known Not! to most young working poreans I spoke to.</p>
              <p>They are oblivious about the on-goings like GN, Chee, the 1 nat under L vid and Cath Lim and her blog and views and vid, TOC, the Yawning Bread and I would not mind mentioning Kum S K blog and of course Sammyboy , Mr Brown and HWzone.</p>
              <p>How much facts do the youths really know?</p>
              <p>Is there sense of Justice and Righteousness in today's Youths?</p>
              <p>Are people too Pragmatic to the extent of being merc?</p>
              <p>Not that I support Chee or SDP, but having read his final speech in the court, I say that I believe Chee is really not acting.</p>
              <p>I have too much respect for this guy now. I used to also suspicious that he is acting and weird.  It takes time to understand Brilliant people . His linguistic ability is stunning. More impressive is his never say die spirit which i think religion has a part to play.</p>
              <p>Having said the above, I must say that this does not prove I am anti-incumbent.</p>
              <p>For all you know, I may be supporting the incumbents to improve. Dah shi teng , mah shi ai. </p>
              <p>No one will ever know who I support. For my personal wellbeing, I must keep this a secret.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As mentioned earlier, those who enjoy specific returns, especially those who stand to reap benefits from the current status quo, will practically resist any innovation that threatens their power-hold and therefore property rights that bring large rewards; be it real or apparent. They are prone to ignore the developments and changes in their environment that demand innovations, particularly those that will result in a redistribution of powers and rewards; especially if those changes are initiated by the change seekers that form the significant others within the society. However, this withholding and denial of changes inevitably develops into a blindness that subjects the bureau to considerable inertia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Malaysia is a good example. Umno’s inertia led to the development of blindness and arrogance; and despite clear signs of deterioration in its support base and demand for more equitable treatment amongst the masses, it took no action to remedy those faults. Years of manipulative politics had led Umno to the belief that it is indispensable and the people cannot survive without it. However, the recent election results spoke otherwise; rudely awakening them from their sweet dreams. Thence, corrective actions were taken but only to be proven faulty as problems kept multiplying and thereby putting the coalition in a stage of crisis.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Change resisters may suppress the need for innovations for only a limited period of time, even if attempts to eliminate change seekers are undertaken, it still does not produce an elixir that accords eternality. External pressure will proliferate under unavoidable factors such as demographic and socio-political changes that eventually even the change procrastinators will find that aversion is no longer a means of survival and they will be coerced into <span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";    '>coalescing</span> the change seekers. Ultimately, the scenario as depicted by Michael Young in his famous work “The Rise of Meritocracy” materializes. Social and political conflicts will reach irreparable heights that a new order will replace the old with much wounds to heal. The old Chinese saying has it that there is "no everlasting dynasty".</span></p>
