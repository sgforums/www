            <div class='col-md body'>Being a bo-chap government, ex-PM Goh must have thought it a wonderful idea to encourage the growth of private charity organizations like NKF. So he loved all the VWO of whatever description from NKF to moral societies to st john or st what next.<br><br>Little did he realize that his little government outposts like the nkf and all the x- and y- challenges etc have had different plans on their own. Their CEOs pretended to be charitable but actually all intend to make use of politicians' naivety to use their support to collect as much donation monies as possible while getting these politicians to support them with getting the highest salaries and self-rewards from all such public as they can.<br><br>The public in the nature of public is also bo-chap of some kind. It pretended to go along toeing the line to donate as much as they can as the big president is smiling down on all the good charity shows and performances.<br><br>But public got many sides of public characters though. One moment it may appear generous but don't let they get wind of some immoral turpitude or lack of righteousness in the use of their public donation monies especially when there were golden taps for their own toilets or telling of some lies which make it unpalatable.<br><br>Public is a sort of untidy national conscience keeper. If they see wrong without any evidence, they will keep quiet without saying a thing and keep a low profile. But when they see the ministers are getting richer and beginning to forget how to serve with all the monies and bonuses rolling in and making their lives so comfortable, the public may get rather uppish with its own pricking sense of vendetta or wanting of blood. Don't ever underestimate the public conscience. They are no fools and will not suffer fools gladly. So whatever good ministers are getting beware of the limit or unspoken limit for the public know where that limit is even if the ministers see no limit and may want to get more by telling some good stories.<br><br>So beware, anyone in any public charity organizations, do not act smart too fast. Politicians are politicians they cannot be on your side forever.<br><br>Look after yourself well. Be a good citizen to raise charity to do a good deed. But do not expect politicians will support you if you are exposed by the whistle blowers who got wind of any more abuses of donation monies for the public has a conscience. It may react pretty fast to any wrong doings while every body still thinks it is right for people to be paid talents.<br><br>The scenario is as a result of let-down by politicians of public charity organizations, in the aftermath of nkf, more charity people will eventually drop out of charity works leaving dear government to wonder what it is going to do with so much sucking of monies from the poor and yet the rich government is making more and more excuses not to lower costs of living while paying themselves the obscene self-reward beyond the peanuts without any self-regulations.<br><br>What will the public conscience do with such an abuse. Time will tell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since when charity organisations have a good name after the NKF Saga? To help the sick and needy, Donations are poured in to aid them. And also social workers need to be paid for what they deserve. The government want to eat the profits because of the ministers' payrise. So sabotage the profitable organisations first.
