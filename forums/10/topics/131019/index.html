These coffeeshop owners? It's all gobble-lisation and these "sme" owners dun stand  a chance<br><br>It also means that for any aspiring coffee-shop owners, they've have to lose even  more $$ for an even longer term before they can break even<br><br><span style="color: brown;">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sub/storyprintfriendly/0,5578,303898-1110059940,00.html?<br><br>March 5, 2005<br>Lifeline for struggling HDB businesses<br>By Lynn Lee<br>LAST Sunday, hairdresser Madam Shu Mee Ying, 60, made less than $20 at a salon she has been running for 34 years on Mei Ling Street. At the barber's shop next door, her husband Mr Thia Mok Chui, 63, fared hardly better.<br>But both are clinging on. Their two long-time employees would have no work if their shops folded, they said. Besides, the couple cannot imagine doing anything else.<br>It's a familiar story among shopkeepers running the 15,200 Housing Board shops here: They want to get on with their trade but the going is tough.<br>Despite makeovers and lifelines, small shops here are in big trouble.<br>An estimated 4,000, mainly those closeted in the heart of HDB neighbourhoods, are sinking deeper into the red each day, said the general manager of the Retail Promotion Centre, Mr Chng Hoon Hoon.</span><br><br>And dun forget, ever time a major property company wants to open a mall in the heartland, major frachises like Macodnald, U2, Goirdano, KFC,SK Jewellery, etc<br><br>Will want a pic of the action and open a shop in the mall......adding to the misery of other nearby hdb shp owners.....<br><br>And who owns the land and approves the ownership of it to these proerty firms ?</div>

This fact is not admitted by the government who continue to increase the rentals or withdraw the past rebates given during the 1998-2001 recessions.<br><br>The same thinking is applied to bus fares. The fares will be increased because the economy is now back to growth again according to the government.

They will no longer be value in the market on day. Due to age. Someday they will lose all the earning power when they cannot get a job. So....... what happen then ?<br><br>OPEN up a shop in the HDB ?
