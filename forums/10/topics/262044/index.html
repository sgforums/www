            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ElderShield is an affordable insurance scheme to assist people who become severely disabled</strong>. It provides a monthly cash payout of $300 for a maximum of 60 months to help pay for medical bills or home care in the event of severe disabilities. (In September, it shall be $400/mth for up to 6 years)<br><br>To be eligible for Eldershield payout, one has to fulfill the following disablities:<br><br><strong>Disability shall mean the inability of the Policyholder to perform <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least 3</span> of the following Activities of Daily Living,</strong> even with the aid of special equipment, and always to require the physical assistance of another person throughout the entire activity.<br><strong><br>Washing:</strong> The ability to wash in the bath or shower (including getting into and out of the bath or shower) or wash by other means.<br><br><strong>Dressing:</strong> The ability to put on, take off, secure and unfasten all garments and, as appropriate, any braces, artificial limbs or other surgical or medical appliances.<br><br><strong>Feeding: </strong>The ability to feed oneself food after it has been prepared and made available.<br><br><strong>Toileting:</strong> The ability to use the lavatory or manage bowel and bladder function through the use of protective undergarments or surgical appliances if appropriate.<br><br><strong>Mobility:</strong> The ability to move indoors from room to room on level surfaces.<br><br><strong>Transferring: </strong>The ability to move from a bed to an upright chair or wheelchair, and vice versa.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">If one cannot do at least 3 of the above activities daily, that person must be quite severely disabled. However, even under the revamped Eldershield, the payout of $400/mth can only last up to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6 years</span>.<br><br>What is the point??<br><br>All Singaporeans and PRs above 40 are auto-opted into the scheme. What are the chances of one become severely disabled? Hundreds of millions of dollars are collected but yet the payout is still so little.<br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the current Eldershied scheme, better put the money in Medisave and earn interest.<br><br>For the new Eldershield scheme, it looks more attractive but can the disabled person last 6 years? ItÂ’s not about enjoying life.<br><br>If I canÂ’t do any one of the activities, I will need help. I will be very frustrated and yet IÂ’m not qualified for a claim. Imagine unable to do at least 3 of them. Most likely the disabled person will give up the will to live and prefer to see his Maker within a year or two, maybe even hoping to see Him sooner. DonÂ’t think he can last 6 years.<br><br>Another question is how many of the policy holders will benefit? Minister Khaw has to show some data to convince people to take up the new scheme.<br><br>Otherwise, I will think itÂ’s just another scheme to bankrupt my Medisave.<br></div>

Eldershield exists because the smart ass stated more than once he is not making Singapore a welfare state.  He is so damn fearful the aging population will be a burden to the ruling party (may be if gahmen spend too much money on healthcare for the increasing aging population then may affect them drawing super high pay).  Colded blooded person like him is unfit to be our PM.  Hey, mind him, he was a cancer patient before.  Doesn't seem that he has learnt anything from his past experience as a terminal ill patient!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
