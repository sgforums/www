              <p>No offense, but you truly are a wanker of grand
              proportions.  Metro firefighters aren't trained for bushfires
              nor is their equipment suited.  They have a duty to be on
              alert in the city for fires.  Of course, you know better.</p>

              <p>More Marysville people could have been saved,</p>
              <p>if this story is true.</p>
              <p><em>''....</em></p>
              <p>When <em>The Age</em> approached Mr Willans this week to ask about his
              warnings to DSE headquarters, he said <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Hello. F--- off</span></span></em></strong>," and stated
              emphatically that he would not comment on his role on Black Saturday.
              "They've called a royal commission. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I want nothing to do with any of
              this</span>," he said, speaking outside his house, which survived despite
              several surrounding houses being razed........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>What Mr Willans and other <span style="color: #ff0000;">fire spotters told DSE</span> — and when they did
                  — could be critical in judging whether more people could have been
                  saved had they been warned early and emphatically of the looming danger.</em></p>
              <p><em>Four
                  police who raced to the town late that Saturday afternoon said they had
                  little or no warning of the fire until they they were driving on the
                  Marysville-Buxton road.</em></p>
              <p><em>They were shocked to see the fire's
                  direction and intensity and <span style="color: #ff0000;">were so concerned they discussed turning
                  around and going back for their own safety.</span></em></p>
              <p>(lion note----police are also human.)</p>
              <p><em>But they kept going,
                  found some 200 townspeople gathered on the local sports ground and led
                  them in a convoy to Buxton — taking a gamble that the fire hadn't
                  breached the road.</em></p>
              <p><em>Tragically, <span style="color: #ff0000;">not all townspeople </span>left their
                  houses to join the hasty evacuation — electing to stay and attempt to
                  fight the fire that engulfed them.</em></p>
              <p><em>A key question facing the
                  royal commission is whether DSE command deliberately avoided making the
                  call on warning people to flee the town because of fears of being
                  accused of causing panic — in effect backing the "stay and fight or
                  leave early" theory embraced after the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires.''</em></p>

              disasters, according to some of the country's leading bushfire
              researchers.</em></p>
              <p><em>The comments come as Australia deals with the loss of at
              least 173 lives and many more homes after devastating bushfires
              swept Victoria.</em></p>
              <p><em>In the wake of the nation's worst bushfire in recorded
              history, other experts are also warning worse may be yet to come,
              with climate change and drought increasing the ferocity and
              duration of bushfires.</em></p>
              <p><em>Psychology professor Douglas Paton, of the University of
              Tasmania , says levels of preparedness to deal with bushfires
              within at-risk communities in Australia are "generally
              low".</em></p>
              <p><em>Professor Paton, a researcher with the Bushfire Cooperative
              Research Centre (CRC), says this lack of preparedness for bushfires
              is a significant public policy issue.</em></p>
              <p><em>It is a problem that has been heightened by the increase in
              migration of people to semi-rural areas beyond the edge of
              cities.</em></p>
              <p><em>Professor Paton says it is important any decisions made in
              the wake of the current devastating bushfires are made after
              "careful technical analysis" is completed.</em></p>
              <p><em>But he concedes "there are circumstances in which no amount
              of preparedness is going to make any
              difference".&lt;h3&gt;Fatalistic approach&lt;/h3&gt;</em></p>
              <p><em>Professor Paton says one of the main inhibitions in people
              preparing for the bushfire season is in whether they believe their
              actions will be effective.</em></p>
              <p><em>"The biggest constraint is these people believe the fires
              themselves will be too big and catastrophic for their actions to
              make any difference," he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>He says the media plays a role in this view developing, as
              coverage of bushfires often focuses on the loss and
              devastation.</em></p>
              <p><em>Another factor is the way in which information is
              disseminated to communities.</em></p>
              <p><em>Through the bushfire CRC, Professor Paton and the Tasmanian
              Fire Service will next year trial new ways of informing communities
              about the need to be proactive ahead of the bushfire
              season.</em></p>
              <p><em>However, Professor Paton says it is important "to look at
              exactly what happened [in the latest fires] to see the kinds of
              processes that were in place" and to make sure "these lessons are
              not just lost once the inquiry is finalised".</em></p>
              <p><em>Bushfire CRC chief executive officer Gary Morgan says the
              weekend's fires "show that many communities need to rethink the
              notion of who lives in a bushfire zone and who needs to be educated
              and prepared".</em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Morgan says climate change, weather and drought are
              altering the nature, ferocity and duration of bushfires and an
              ageing and declining volunteer population is challenging the way
              fire agencies are going to be able to manage these events.
              &lt;h3&gt;Better design&lt;/h3&gt;</em></p>
              <p><em>Bushfire urban design expert Justin Leonard of the CSIRO
              says the lost communities can be rebuilt to be more bushfire
              resilient.</em></p>
              <p><em>He says many of the townships destroyed were "conceived long
              before a formal integrated response was devised on how buildings
              and towns should be designed" in the light of extreme bushfire
              behaviour.</em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Leonard says in 90 per cent of cases homes are destroyed
              not by the fire, but by embers that ignite debris lying around the
              property.</em></p>
              <p><em>He says research shows people who stay and defend the
              property have a three to six times greater chance of saving their
              home.</em></p>
              <p><em>However, he says the findings could be subjective because
              the people who choose to stay and fight for their homes may already
              have more fire-proof residences.&lt;h3&gt;When to
              flee&lt;/h3&gt;</em></p>
              <p><em>Professor John Handmer of RMIT University says research
              shows that fleeing at the last moment is the worst possible option
              as it is when most people die or are injured.</em></p>
              <p><em>"This fire shows that leaving late can be the worst decision
              to make," he says.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Alternatively, many people made the perfectly acceptable
              decision that their house was not defendable and decided to leave
              early. They may have lost their home, but they kept themselves
              safe.</em></p>
              <p><em>"At this stage, it is too early to judge the application of
              the 'prepare, stay and defend', or 'leave early' policy, but it
              will be properly reviewed along with the normal review of all
              policies and practices after a major fire event."EOQ</em></p>

              <p>If u let people choose,many will leave behind and fight with the fires.</p>
              <p>This advice take fighting fires is not so difficult--</p>
              <p><em>''CORE ADVICE<br>· People in the area need to remain alert as there may not be a warning should conditions change unexpectedly. Continue to listen to ABC or local radio for updates on this fire.<br>· Be prepared to activate your bushfire survival plan if necessary.<br>· Decide now if you are going to stay or go. Remember that it is very dangerous to leave late with a fire in the area. Road use in the area will be extremely hazardous due to low visibility from smoke. Watch out for fallen trees, power lines, abandoned cars, wildlife and emergency services vehicles.<br>· I<span style="color: #ff0000;">f you plan to stay, remember to seek shelter from radiant heat. Should the fire reach your property, close all doors and windows and stay inside the house while the fire passes.</span><br>Remain alert, extinguish any small fires and if necessary, move outside to burnt ground once the fire has passed.<br>· Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.</em>''</p>
