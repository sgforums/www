              <p>use the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade which are just 50 km away!!</p>

              <p>THE Country Fire Authority has been accused of blocking city
              firefighters from helping fight Victoria's horrific fires.</p>
              <p>Leaked emails accuse the CFA of blocking Metropolitan Fire
              Brigade management and CFA professional firefighters, and
              incompetently handling the fires.</p>
              <p>The United Firefighters Union will tell the royal commission on
              the fires that the CFA panicked and was ill-prepared, despite
              knowing conditions would be the worst in Victoria's history.</p>
              <p>The taxpayer-funded firefighters, who are better trained than
              volunteers, say up to 1200 of them have sat around during, and
              since, the blazes of February 7 — while overseas and interstate
              crews have been flown in to help.</p>
              <p>The CFA and MFB deny the claims and say the firefighters and
              equipment were used "appropriately".</p>
              <p>The union claims CFA managers, or incident controllers, blocked
              MFB crews from fighting fires in at least two areas.</p>
              <p>Union secretary Peter Marshall claimed one incident controller
              told an MFB crew: "Over my dead body are we going to use you."</p>
              <p>"The MFB commander went back and briefed the troops and said,
              'This is the attitude, they don't want to use us'," he said.</p>
              <p>At another location, an MFB taskforce was not deployed by the
              CFA incident controller "because of parochial issues".</p>
              <p>"When they actually got in there the CFA said: 'Where have you
              been? … we've been waiting for you for ages, we needed you'.</p>
              <p>"This is dynamite. It's hard to say it cost lives, but resources
              that have been paid for by the community in the form of fire
              appliances and personnel sat idle while people lost their houses
              and indeed their life."</p>
              <p>The union has been swamped with emails from members frustrated
              at not being sent to fight the fires. One says: "I look at the news
              footage and see volunteers dead on their feet … we are sitting on
              our arses."</p>
              <p>A paid CFA firefighter said he was one of about six
              professionals who sat doing nothing at a station in Melbourne's
              outer north when the fire started.</p>
              <p>"We listened to the events, including guys getting burnt out,
              but we were not deployed," he said. "We contacted the duty officers
              and said: 'We are here.' I don't think they knew.</p>
              <p>"There are 200 (CFA) career firefighters who are disgusted about
              it but too fearful to put pen to paper or stand in front of a
              camera over it because of their careers," he said.</p>
              <p>Another firefighter from near Geelong said professional
              firefighters were prevented from joining the fight.</p>
              <p>He said CFA management wrongly thought that no professional
              firefighters were available.</p>
              <p>Parochialism and politics are the worst problems, the
              firefighters say, with CFA managers viewing the MFB as rivals for
              funds, bolstering arguments for merging the two.</p>
              <p>Some CFA volunteers also do not want outsiders fighting fires on
              their turf.</p>
              <p>CFA chief officer Russell Rees said all firefighters had been
              used appropriately during the emergency. "There's no question the
              MFB were used appropriately and are still being used in specialised
              areas such as victim identification," he said.</p>
              <p>MFB spokesman Simon Breer said the brigade had provided up to
              1000 personnel. He said he did not believe there was a problem with
              its involvement.</p>

              <p>No offense, but you truly are a wanker of grand proportions.  Metro firefighters aren't trained for bushfires nor is their equipment suited.  They have a duty to be on alert in the city for fires.  Of course, you know better.</p>

                  Metropolitan Fire Brigade have hit back at claims they did not work
                  together on Black Saturday and more than 1200 firefighters were
                  prevented from fighting the deadly blaze as hundreds of lives were
                  lost.</strong></p>
              <p>Leaked emails to the United Firefighters Union accuse CFA and
                  MFB senior management of incompetently handling the fires as well
                  as allegations that CFA blocked MFB crews from fighting fires near
                  Alexandra and at Wandong.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">UFU national secretary Peter Marshall said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1200 firefighters</span> from
                  the Country Fire Authority, Metropolitan Fire Brigade and
                  Department of Sustainability and Environment were not
                  deployed.</span><br> <br> “Why were they not used to relieve the volunteer firefighters?” he
                  told the ABC this morning. “The full potential of the
                  firefighters...were not deployed.”<br> <br> He also said the union <span style="color: #ff0000;">would raise the issue during the royal
                  commission</span> into the fires, due to begin in the coming months. “We
                  have seen this sort of thing happen in previous campaigns where
                  there (are) turf wars,” Mr Marshall said.<br> <br> But CFA deputy chief of operations Steve Warrington denied these
                  allegations, saying all the state's fire services worked well
                  together that day. He said the CFA utilised MFB firefighters and
                  their cooperation was preplanned.<br> <br> “It could have been a lot worse if we didn't have the arrangements
                  in place,” he said this morning.<br> <br> Mr Warrington said MFB firefighters were deployed to cover CFA
                  stations in Melbourne and its surrounding suburbs - while CFA crews
                  went to fight to bushfires - as they could not be left unattended
                  on February 7.<br> <br> He also said the MFB were used to helped protect towns like Yea and
                  Alexander. Mr Warrington said the MFB were specialists at fighting
                  urban fires and its equipment and trucks were not designed to cope
                  with hilly terrain of bushfires.<br> <br> MFB chief fire officer Tony Murphy said he understood the
                  frustration of some MFB firefighters who were not at the front line
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">but they decided to fly in specialist wildfire fighters from
                  interstate and overseas for good reason.</span><br> <br> “They are frustrated. They want to be out there but we have moved
                  into a different phase (of wildfire fighting),” he said.<br> <br> <em>Additional reporting: AAP</em></p>
