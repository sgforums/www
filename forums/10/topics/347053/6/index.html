              <p>People seldom thank you decisions of politicians.</p>
              <p>In this case,people will blame if they are mandatory evacuated and the</p>

              <ul>
              <li><em>Residents in this area may
              experience smoke and burning embers reaching their properties, and are
              advised to patrol their houses to find and put out any burning embers
              that may be landing.</em></li>
              <li><em>Protect yourself from radiant heat by
              wearing correct protective clothing consisting of long-sleeved shirts,
              long pants, sturdy boots and a broad brimmed hat. On no account should
              synthetic material be worn.</em></li>
              <li><em>As the fire front approaches, it
              will be unsafe to be either on foot or in a car as the heat radiating
              from the fire will be intense. Buildings will offer the best protection
              during the passage of a fire front. Close all doors and windows and
              stay inside the house while the fire passes. Remain alert, extinguish
              any small fires and if necessary, move outside to burnt ground once the
              fire has passed.</em></li>
              <li><em>If you are caught on the road, <strong>don't get out and run. </strong></em>
              <ul>
              <li><em>Pull to the side, preferably in an area clear of tall trees and long grass. </em></li>
              <li><em>Put your hazard lights on and close the windows and vents.</em></li>
              <li><em>Cover any exposed areas of skin with a woollen blanket and get down as low as possible.</em></li>
              <li><em>Only when the fire has passed do you get out and move to safety.</em></li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li><em>Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.</em></li>
              <li><em>Residents away from home should not try to return to the area as access is limited and the roads may not be safe. </em></li>
              <li><em>Continue to listen to ABC or local radio for updates on this fire.--EOQ</em></li>

              <p><em>Army engineers are racing against time to complete 100 km of firebreaks around threatened towns of Yea and Broadford. <br><br>By
              late last night, army teams operating a fleet of heavy and medium
              bulldozers rushed in from Puckapunyal had carved 10km of fire breaks
              around the two towns, a defence spokeswoman confirmed this morning. <br><br>Elements
              of the 450-strong defence Joint Task Force have been deployed into nine
              high-risk areas bringing a measure of relief for hard-pressed fire
              crews and other emergency workers many of whom have been battling fires
              for more than a week. <br><br>Four search teams made up of 160 defence
              reservists have joined other emergency workers in a grim search for
              bodies in rough terrain around Traralgon, St Andrews, Flowerdale and
              Yarra Glen. <br><br>“Soldiers are well-briefed and equipped to conduct this type of activity,” said the spokeswoman. <br><br>In addition to plant operators, army chainsaw teams are now helping reopen roads closed by fallen trees and other debris. <br><br>Four armoured personnel carriers are accompanying the engineering teams. <br><br>Operating
              as mobile communications centres, they offer good protection against
              smoke and heat and can be used to smash through obstacles in the event

              <p>Mrs Moon said while they sprinklers on the roof and around their
                      property, and had worked to clear the land, by 3pm today, the group
                      decided it was time to leave.</p>
              <p>``As I saw it, there were seven of us, and it was not worth risking the seven of us to save the house,’’ she said.</p>
              <p>Mr Moon said a number of neighbours were not aware of the threat Monday’s blaze posed until the fire was almost on them.</p>
              <p>``There’s a family down the street that didn’t even know the fire was there until it was right behind them,’’ Mr Moon said.</p>
              <p>After leaving property, they congregated in Toolangi at an already burnt out paddock area with up to 40 other cars.</p>
              <p>``The police and CFA were fantastic, they kept on coming back to
                      keep and eye on us, they kept keeping us informed about what was
                      happening,’’ Mrs Moon said.</p>
              <p>At about 7pm this evening conditions eased enough for the group to
                      form part of a police escorted convoy and flee along the Melba Highway.</p>
