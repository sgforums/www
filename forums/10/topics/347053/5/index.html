              <div>Dear All</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I write asking you and others to pray for the situation here in 
                    Victoria. Over the weekend, Victoria state has gone through what has been 
                    the worst day in Oz's history of natural tragedies. To date, 109 people 
                    have died in the bush fires.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>There are 3 major spots of fires - the first was in the South-east 
                    (Gippsland) which is not too far away from my house; and the other two in 
                    the North-east of Melbourne (Kinglake &amp; Marysville). It is sickening 
                    to know that the fires were deliberate and the hot weather fuels the 
                    disaster. It's terrible to know that fires that were put down by the tired 
                    firemen were re-lit by arsonists (cigarettes!) The towns of Kinglake and 
                    Marysville were literally wiped off in minutes. Residents, particularly 
                    children and elderly had no chance to flee. One father who turned his back 
                    to his car, just to go back into his house, turned around in time 
                    just to see his children went up in flames in the car. It's a cruel scene. 
                    I was on the phone with Ariel a no. of times yesterday. The highways 
                    surrounding our suburb had spots of fires. There was a big fire in the 
                    neighbouring suburb and the outside air was black smog. It was bad. We 
                    thanked God that where we were was safe.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Do pray for God's intervention to stop the fires. Pray for the safety 
                    of the residents too. Pray that those who lost their loved ones and their 
                    homes were be comforted and restoration will be speedy for them.</div>

              <p>PREMIER John Brumby has announced a royal commission into the Victorian 
                  bushfires amid suggestions that long-standing strategies for dealing with fire 
                  emergencies may have failed with catastrophic consequences for some people.</p>

              <p>As the death toll from Australia's worst peacetime disaster climbed to 130, 
                  Mr Brumby said the traditional advice to households under threat from bushfires 
                  — "stay and defend or leave early" — may be reviewed.</p>

              <p>1) What is it to you if the fires are contained or otherwise? Do you live in Australia?</p>

              <p>I have mixed feelings about this thread.  In one sense lionnoisy has provided some links to solid information, useful for general following of the terrible goings on.  In another sense lionnoisy has demonstrated complete naivity to the situation at hand.  It's hard to understand why he would be so naive after reading so many news sources. I for one would appreciate the news sources without the lousy opinion tied to it.</p>
              <p>All this talk about logistics and the ADF is utter tripe.  You could have placed a million ADF and CAF members in front of the fires, and you would have ended up with a million charred bodies.  Lionnoisy, you have absolutely no concept of the sheer hellish conditions and how to tackle them.</p>

              <p>I have critized their drugs problems,military hardware performance and procurements</p>

              <p>trying my best not to be bias.</p>
              <p>I posted a thread on last Sat 07 Feb evening, calling ADF shall be called out</p>
              <p>to help fighting the brush fire.MOD deleted the thread.</p>
              <p>On Sunday,i started this thread.I made a mistake,thinking ADF already on the ground.</p>
              <p>In fact,ADF Task force  met the press on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>Is it a little bit  late,too little of men power and equipments?</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After so many deaths,is it better Evacuated earlier than too late,</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and evacuated more than too little?</span></strong></p>
              <p>The authority said they will review the 1''.Leave earlier ''</p>
              <p>Or 2.''STAY and Defend policy''.This is good.</p>
              <p>But before the comopletion of the review of evacuation procedures,</p>
              <p>will it be on a safe side to evacuate people EARLIER who are exposed</p>
              <p>to credible  risks?</p>
              <p>Towns like Yarrn Glen,Healsville etc are currently in the hand of mercy</p>
              <p>of Mother Nature.Any change in wind direction and speed will</p>
              <p>cause deaths again,like in Maryvilles ,Kinglake etc.</p>
              <p>Since no one can tell when the fires will come,it is better prudent</p>
              <p>than taking risks!</p>

              <p>This is a boardband era and this happens!!</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>One of the most bewildering aspects of Black Saturday is the
              disconnect between the general, and ultimately prophetic, warnings
              issued by authorities beforehand and the absence of specific
              information when the fires overwhelmed individual communities.</p>
              <p>A common thread in some of the most devastated towns and hamlets is
              that not one had time to react between seeing fire on the horizon, or
              hearing that it was on the way, and their house exploding.</p>
              <p>In some cases, only minutes would separate the urgent official
              warnings, which would be passed on through the local ABC radio network,
              and a tornado of flames sweeping through the main street.</p>
              <p>In other areas, there were no warnings and only a handful of firefighters on the ground to offer token resistance.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kinglake and St Andrews had already been wiped ou</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t before they were
              mentioned in the radio updates of towns in danger.</span> Death came to those
              communities where fires erupted on the Saturday - and some of those
              blazes were deliberately lit.</p>
              By contrast, the fire that had been raging since last week and was
              causing the most concern for the CFA ahead of Black Saturday - in the
              Bunyip state forest east of Melbourne - has yet to officially claim a
              life. The disaster raises, again, the sensitive question of when to
              abandon a town to the random hand of Mother Nature. <br><br>The old
              advice, leaving it to individuals to decide whether to stay on their
              property or escape, assumed they had hours to make the call. </blockquote>
