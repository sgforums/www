              <p>a b<em>ushfire scientist for more than 50 years says</em></p>
              <p><em>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25031389-7583,00.html</em></p>
              <p><em>''The science is simple. A fire disaster of this nature requires a
              combination of hot, dry, windy weather in drought conditions. It also
              requires a source of ignition. In the past, this purpose has been
              served by lightning. In this disaster, lightning has not played a big
              part, and for this Victorians should be grateful. But other sources of
              ignition are ever-present. When the temperature and wind increase to
              extreme levels, small events -- perhaps the scrape of metal across a
              rock, a transformer overheating or sparks from a diesel engine -- are
              capable of starting a fire that can in minutes become unstoppable if
              the fuel is present. </em></p>
              <p><em>The third and only controllable factor in this deadly triangle is
              fuel: the dead leaves, pieces of bark and grass that become the gas
              that feeds the 50m high flames that roar through the bush with the
              sound of jet engines. </em></p>
              <p><em>Fuels build up year after year at an approximate rate of one tonne a
              hectare a year, up to a maximum of about 30 tonnes a hectare. If the
              fuels exceed about eight tonnes a hectare, disastrous fires can and
              will occur. Every objective analysis of the dynamics of fuel and fire
              concludes that unless the fuels are maintained at near the levels that
              our indigenous stewards of the land achieved, then we will have
              unhealthy and unsafe forests that from time to time will generate
              disasters such as the one that erupted on saturday. </em></p>
              <p><em>It has been a difficult lesson for me to accept that despite the
              severe damage to our forests and even a fatal fire in our nation's
              capital, the political decision has been to do nothing that will change
              the extreme threat to which our forests and rural lands are exposed. </em></p>
              <p><em>The decision to ignore the threat has been encouraged by some
              shocking pseudo-science from a few academics who use arguments that may
              have a place in political discourse but should have no place in
              managing our environment and protecting it and us from the bushfire
              threat. </em></p>
              <p><em>The conclusion of these academics is that high intensity fires are
              good for the environment and that the resulting mudslides after rains
              are merely localised and serve to redistribute nutrients. The purpose
              of this failed policy is to secure uninformed city votes. </em></p>
              <p><em>Only a few expert retired fire managers, experienced bushies and
              some courageous politicians are prepared to buck the decision to lock
              up our bush and leave it to burn''</em>EOQ</p>

              <p><em>''In a letter to my local paper, the Weekly Times, on January 25, I
              predicted we were facing a very critical situation in which 1000 to
              2000 homes could be lost in the Yarra catchment, the Otways and/or the
              Strezleckies; that 100 souls could be lost in a most horrible and
              violent way; and that there was even a threat to Melbourne's water
              supply, which could be rendered unusable by the ash and debris.
              Horrifically, much of this has come to pass, and it is not yet the end
              of the bushfire season. </em></p>
              <p><em>In the face of this inferno, the perpetrators of this obscenity
              should have the decency to stand up and say they were wrong. Southeast
              Australia is the worst place in the world for bushfires, and we must
              not waste any time in getting down to the task of making our bush
              healthy and safe. </em></p>

              <p>"Something which the nation must now attend to as a matter of grave urgency is the problem of arson.</p>
              <p>"This is simply murder on a grand scale.</p>
              <p>"Let us attend to this unfinished business of the nation and come to grips with this evil thing."</p>
              <p>A special taskforce of 100 police officers will investigate the wildfires and hunt any arsonists believed to be responsible for starting some of them.</p>
              <p>Police are convinced at least one of the major fires, which killed 20 people in Gippsland, near the state capital Melbourne, was deliberately lit.</p>
              <p>At least 181 people have died in the fires and the death toll is expected to rise further.</p>
              <p>"Road by road, house by house, we are working our way through," Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon said.</p>
              <p>"We believe the toll will rise. It's a very sad thing for all of us in our community... we hope towards the end of the weekend that the toll will start to settle in terms of numbers."</p>
              <p>In devastated Kinglake, Ross Buchanan risked his life to save his home, only to find his 15-year-old son McKenzie and daughter Neeve, nine, had been killed as fire ripped through the rest of the town.</p>
              <p>"I've lost two kids, nothing can bring them back," he told Sky News Australia.</p>
              <p>The mounting number of bodies has forced authorities to set up a temporary morgue in Melbourne which has so far admitted 101 victims.</p>
              <p>Exhausted firefighters, most of them volunteers who have had little rest since the wildfires flared on Saturday, continue to fight to save communities in the path of the flames.</p>
              <p>Healesville, about 31 miles northeast of Melbourne, is the latest community threatened by the fires, which razed entire towns.</p>

              soldiers have been deployed to assist police with search and recovery.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Joint Taskforce has also provided 150 portable beds or
              mattresses to relief centres in the Baw Baw Shire. This is to enable

              continue their tireless work.</em></p>
              <p><em>The taskforce also includes heavy plant, chainsaw, sections and
              logistics support, which have been assigned to the clean-up task.
              Graders, bulldozers, front end loaders and their operators have been
              asked to assist with fire containment measures, reopening of roads and

              <p><em>The ADF has also been asked to provide aerial imaging of affected

              <p>The problem is that lionnoisy is trying to speculate, and he's doing a lousy job.  The services are doing their best and people are suffering tremendously, and here comes a buffoon pretending to know better than everybody else.  It's misinformation and downright of negative value.  He is not qualified to call such judgements of the premier, the CFA, the ADF, and the PM, and clearly not qualified to speculate on where the fires are headed.</p>
              <p>If he kept this thread to news aggregation then it would be useful, but his poor speculation is grating.  Sure, it's his thread, but it's still a publication on the Internet for others to read and to be misinformed by.  He has made his idiocy public so deserves to be called an idiot publicly.</p>
