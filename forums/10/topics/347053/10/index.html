              <br> Posted: 15 February 2009 1125 hrs 
              <br> <br> MELBOURNE - Australian wildfire survivors have launched a lawsuit
              against a Singapore-owned electricity firm alleging a downed power line
              sparked one of the blazes, it was reported Sunday. <br> <br> Kinglake residents are launching a class action against SP Ausnet and
              the Victoria state government claiming the power line set off a fire
              near the town that killed at least 100 people, The Age newspaper said. <br> <br> The newspaper said police investigating the causes of the fires had
              removed a length of fallen cable and a power pole as evidence. <br> <br> The firm reportedly handling the class action, Melbourne-based Slidders
              Lawyers, on its website urges residents affected by the bushfires to
              contact it and seek compensation. <br> <br> SP Ausnet, part of the Singapore Power Group, refused to comment
              directly on the lawsuit, saying its priority was restoring power to
              fire-affected areas as quickly as possible. <br> <br> "We stand ready to assist the relevant authorities with their inquiries
              if it is necessary for us to do so," it said in a statement. <br> <br> The fire at Kinglake, about 50 kilometres (31 miles) north of
              Melbourne, was one of the most ferocious to sweep through Victoria
              state last week, killing at least 100 people and destroying about 1,000
              homes. <br> <br> Victoria Police chief commissioner Christine Nixon said authorities were still determining how the Kinglake fire started. 
              <br> <br> "At this stage we are not able to confirm how it started. I understand
              there is some legal action that people are taking, but at this stage
              we're still investigating its cause," she told Channel Nine television.
              <br> <br> More than 180 people have been killed in multiple blazes in Australia's worst ever bushfire disaster. </span></p>

              <p>Hey, Fuckedupbusinessman, how's it feel to be living in a city powered by a company that started this disaster?  The danger's closer to home than you could imagine, so you'd better:</p>

              <p>Anyway, this just works out beautifully.  All of the rebuilding work is going to keep the economy going, possibly Australia-wide as well as Victoria, so we look to be in pretty good shape for this recession.  I just love how it's going to be funded by <span>the Singapore Power Group.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><strong>BRUCE Esplin woke at 6am last Saturday with a
              gnawing feeling in his gut. Victoria's Emergency Services
              Commissioner knew the odds were not good for the 3582 firefighters
              and emergency workers who had been placed like toy soldiers across
              the breadth of his state.</strong></p>
              <p>"We were about to face weather beyond our experience, and I just
              had this feeling of dread," Esplin says.</p>
              <p>Across town, Ewan Waller, the Government's chief fire officer,
              was also on edge. By 7.30am he was already sitting in the
              Integrated Emergency Co-ordination Centre in central Melbourne,
              otherwise known as the "war room", where he would spend the next 15
              hours alongside chief Country Fire Authority officer Russell Rees.
              These two men would jointly manage the defence of Victoria against
              the worst weather forecast in memory.</p>
              <p>Barely 60km to the north, thousands of families scattered across
              the hillside regions of Kinglake, St Andrews and Marysville were
              waking up to a lazy Saturday. Many of these were tree changers:
              city commuters who had embraced the lush forested hills for both
              lifestyle and financial reasons.</p>
              <p>They were mostly young families with young kids, and with the
              temperature tipped to hit 44C with strong, hot wind gusts, it was
              cooler to stay in their hillside homes than travel.</p>
              <p>In Marysville, 20-year-old Lucie O'Meara spent the morning
              making pancakes for her husband, Luke, and their seven-month-old
              daughter, Charlotte. She then sat down at her computer and wrote on
              her Facebook site: "I am so enjoying the viewfrom my desk,
              Marysville is beautiful."</p>
              <p>Just before 9.30am, Stuart Coombs arrived at the Victorian
              weather bureau's headquarters in Melbourne's Docklands to start his
              shift.</p>
              <p>One of his jobs was to compile thunderstorm warnings. But when
              he scanned the charts he saw something that disturbed him even more
              than the "very dreadful" forecast of the previous night. "The
              thunderstorm conditions (meant) we knew there would be fire
              activity (from lightening strikes)," Coombs said.</p>
              <p>Even so, for the next few hours, the war room was buoyed by what
              they saw. Although they were concerned by a fire that had jumped
              containment lines in the Bunyip State Forest, east of Melbourne,
              fire activity around the state was modest.</p>
              <p>The day, which Premier John Brumby had warned on Friday might be
              the state's worst, had started well.</p>
              <p>"There was a sense of 'well, we've got to lunchtime and so far
              so good'," Esplin says. "But we knew the most dangerous part of the
              day would be late afternoon."</p>

              <p>None of the 60-odd officials from multiple agencies who had
              gathered in the war room were aware the spark that would set off
              the worst day in Victoria's history had already been lit.</p>
              <p>At 11.30am, Liz Jackson looked out the window of her house in
              Kilmore East, a township near the Hume Highway, 60km north of
              Melbourne, and saw smoke.</p>
              <p>It came from the hill opposite her home where a single power
              pole stood. She called the CFA but the fire spread quickly, fanned
              by increasingly strong hot northerly wind gusts of up to
              125km/h.</p>
              <p><strong>WANDONG</strong></p>
              <p>In the nearby community of Wandong, former CFA firefighter Chris
              Isbister says he witnessed the moment when this little fire grew
              fangs. "Me and my mate headed up the highway to check it out and we
              saw it go into the pine plantation and get really big."</p>
              <p>He returned home to prepare the house, while watching the fire
              come closer. Police advised residents to evacuate, but Isbister and
              two mates stayed and watched the fire's progress.</p>
              <p>"We watched the actual fire roll down one hill and up another,"
              Isbister says. "The wind was so unbelievably strong, we had to hold
              on to fences to stand upright."<br> <br> Only when the growing wall of flames got closer and jumped the Hume
              Highway with ease did Isbister realise his mistake in staying. "The
              fire got into the trees," he says. "The trees would have been 45
              foot high and the flames were twice the size of the trees. There
              was nothing we could do; we were surrounded by fire."<br> <br> He and his mates fled to an already-burnt paddock and sheltered
              under a wet hessian bag as the house caught fire. They lived; four
              of their neighbours did not.<br> <br> The East Kilmore fire swept through Wandong, growing in size and in
              speed. It was being pushed by mighty wind gusts towards the
              communities of Kinglake and St Andrews.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> BACK in the war room, no one knew what had happened in Wandong.
              They had been alerted to the existence of the fire at Kilmore East
              but it was one of many fires that had suddenly sprung up around the
              state and were demanding their attention.<br> <br> There was a new one near Bendigo, one near Beechworth, one near
              Coleraine, another near Horsham and reports of one near the
              community of Churchill in Gippsland in the state's east, near to
              where arsonists had lit several recent fires.<br> <br> Even so, Waller, Rees and Esplin say they had a sense of dread
              early on about the Kilmore fire. "I knew that was a dangerous place
              for a fire," Esplin says. 'A lot of tree changers had moved into
              areas around there and it is difficult fire-fighting country. I had
              a feeling of 'Here it comes'."<br> <br> Waller says: "As soon as we saw that Kilmore fire, in a very short
              time we knew we had a real problem. It was running towards
              populated areas. You could run a ruler along where it was going to
              run - you knew straight away."<br> <br> The ruler along the map showed the fire was heading directly for
              Kinglake.<br> <br> What the war room did not yet fully understand was that this fire
              was behaving like none other they had experienced. It was much
              faster, much larger and was behaving more like a series of
              fireballs than a cohesive fire.<br> <br> The combination of steep hills - which can double fire speed - with
              howling winds and a temperatures in the mid-40s were turning the
              Kilmore fire into a monster.<br> <br> From this moment, and for the rest of what would become known as
              Black Saturday, the bulk of the CFA's fire warnings being relayed
              on ABC radio trailed the reality on the ground. They came too late
              to alert many of the communities in its path.<br> <br> no one was watching the progress of the East Kilmore fire more
              closely that Jason Lawrence, the 35-year-old CFA incident
              controller at Kangaroo Ground, who was responsible for shifting
              fire trucks and tankers around those communities near
              Kinglake.<br> <br> Almost immediately, Lawrence knew he was powerless to do anything.
              "It moved through with such ferocity that there was nothing the
              local brigades could do," Lawrence says.The size and speed of the
              blaze meant decisions about the deployment of fire trucks would
              have to be made on the ground by each individual CFA town chief.
              But with the growing confusion about the fire's progress, they were
              given no clear warnings of its arrival.<br> <br> This was not how the system was supposed to work.<br> <br> <strong>KINGLAKE WEST</strong><br> <br> On the crest of a ridge near Kinglake West, Brian Naylor and his
              wife, Moiree, were at home on their property, which enjoyed
              commanding views over a distant Melbourne. Naylor, 78, was a
              household name in Melbourne having been the dominant newsreader of
              his era, anchoring Seven's nightly news for 10 years and Nine's for
              20.<br> <br> The Naylors had survived the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires in this home,
              but nothing could have prepared them for the Kilmore fire as it
              roared up the back of their property, away from their line of
              sight.<br> <br> It ate the house in an instant. The bodies of Naylor and Moiree
              were found fused together in an embrace.<br> <br> At nearby Pheasant Creek, policeman Roger Wood found 50 men, women
              and children cowering in a supermarket from the advancing fire.
              After checking the road was clear, he told them all to follow him
              to the Kinglake West CFA. They arrived just before the fire rolled
              over them. They survived. The supermarket was burned to the
              ground.<br> <br> <strong>STRATHEWEN</strong><br> <br> The still-growing fire heaved southeast towards Strathewen, a small
              community nestled in rolling hills near Kinglake.<br> <br> The town was defended by CFA captain and local farmer Dave McGahy,
              who was armed with three fire trucks and a tanker. His men were up
              behind the town on Eagles Nest Road when McGahy caught sight of the
              behemoth coming his way.<br> <br> 'Realising the approaching fire would gobble up his team, McGahy
              withdrew them all.<br> <br> "Even if I had 20 strike teams, all that would have happened is
              that we would have had 50 dead firefighters as well," he
              says.<br> <br> At least 30 people left in the town had no chance. They died,
              huddled together in their baths, in cellars, on the cricket oval
              and in their cars as the fire roared over them at 4.20pm.<br> <br> The only safe refuge was the home of local resident and CFA member
              Barrie Tulley, who harboured 19 terrified residents. When they
              emerged from his house, Strathewen was no more.<br> <br> <strong>ST ANDREWS</strong><br> <br> By the time the fire bore down on the 250-strong community of St
              Andrews, it was fully formed and racing. With flames reported to be
              up to 50m high, it now had the power to kill with radiant heat from
              200m away.<br> <br> The Australian's reporter Gary Hughes and his wife, Janice, were
              frantically trying to escape the fire, which he says emerged from
              nowhere and without warning.<br> <br> "The firestorm moves faster than you can think, let alone react,"
              Hughes says. 'You are fighting for your home and then you are
              fighting for your life."<br> <br> Down the road in Yarra Glenn, Melanee Hermocilla, 23, her
              boyfriend, Greg Lloyd, 22, and her brother Jason Hermocilla, 21,
              were house-sitting someone else's home when the fire engulfed them.
              They huddled together under wet towels and phoned their parents to
              say goodbye.<br> <br> ***<br> <br> BY 4.30pm, it was clear inside the war room that things in the
              field were going wrong fast, although no one yet knew of any
              deaths.<br> <br> "The map suddenly became like New Year's Eve on Sydney Harbour,
              there were so many fires," Esplin says.<br> <br> A separate fire had emerged near a sawmill in Murrindindi to the
              north and was travelling parallel with the Kilmore fire towards the
              south of Marysville.<br> <br> "We were sure that the fires were taking houses at that stage but
              we had no idea they were taking lives," Esplin says.<br> <br> "I remember speaking with (CFA chief) Russell (Rees) and he said to
              me, 'This is not good'."<br> <br> Esplin called the Police and Emergency Services Minister Bob
              Cameron and advised him to come immediately from his Bendigo home
              to Melbourne.<br> <br> "I told him we are going to experience losses and we need his
              leadership," Esplin says.<br> <br> The war room was struggling to maintain control of the
              situation.<br> <br> A dense blanket of smoke from the fires was cutting off vital
              intelligence about the movement of the fire fronts.<br> <br> "It became too dangerous for our planes to fly and to map the edge
              of the fires so for quite a while we could not get the intelligence
              we wanted," Waller says. "We had to rely on bits and pieces -
              reports from the field and satellite information."<br> <br> The war room was also monitoring the local ABC which had arguably
              the most up-to-date information because people were calling in with
              instant information about the fires in their area and even in their
              street. ABC announcer Jon Faine, who took their calls and numerous
              SMS messages, says: "They were ordinary people in extraordinary
              distress, they were confused and in desperate straits. And they
              were listening to the radio. They hoped that by ringing us, they
              could get information, that we could give them answers."<br> <br> With power lost in most towns shortly before the fire came through,
              battery transistor radios provided the only link to the outside
              world.<br> <br> <strong>KINGLAKE</strong><br> <br> About 4.30pm, the fire was bearing down on its most vulnerable
              victim, the mountain town of Kinglake with 3000 residents. Kinglake
              CFA chief captain Paul Hendrie had already sent both of his two
              tankers to fight the St Andrews fire in response to their frantic
              requests for help. He had no information suggesting they would be
              needed for Kinglake.<br> <br> "There was nothing (no fire trucks) on the mountain (when the fire
              came)," Hendrie says, "(but) you fight the fire you've got - you
              can't predict the predicament that will come."<br> <br> He was not alone. Almost no one in Kinglake had more than a few
              minutes to realise the fire was almost upon them. Locals say there
              were no warnings on radio or the CFA website and no sirens.<br> Nothing.<br> <br> With a darkening sky and a thunderous roar signalling the approach
              of the fire, many panicked and took to the road in their cars. For
              most, this was a fatal decision. The smoke moved ahead of the fire,
              blinding drivers. Cars collided into each other.<br> <br> In one of those cars were Alex and Anna Thomson, who were trying to
              escape with their three young children. With a black sky and
              flaming embers around them, they dragged their kids from their
              crumpled vehicle and waved for help.<br> <br> "We tried to flag down some car - and I don't blame the four or
              five that went past - but they just kept going," Anna says.
              "Everyone was just doing what they could to survive. I thought we
              were going to die. I couldn't look at the kids. I just kept
              thinking of them burning to death and I couldn't stand imagining
              them dying that way."<br> <br> She had lost all hope when a car pulled over for her family. Two
              strangers - Karl and Jayne Amatneiks - bundled them in and took
              them to a nearby house. They lived.<br> <br> Another man who tried to drive out, Benjamin Banks, says his car
              was hit by a wall of flame that almost tipped it over.<br> <br> The heat melted his car window, causing molten glass to drip onto
              his hand and also his tyres, forcing him to drive on the screeching
              metal rims.<br> <br> He then smashed head-on into another car, and limped out with a
              broken ankle into a nearby paddock. He also lived.<br> <br> But many did not survive the dash out of Kinglake. They were
              incinerated in their cars or cut down as they fled their
              vehicles.<br> <br> Arthur Enver died when he tried to drive out of town on his Harley
              Davidson bike. His wife, who was driving the family car a few
              metres in front of him, survived.<br> <br> For those left in Kinglake, survival depended on nature's lottery:
              whether the fire chose their house or bypassed it.<br> <br> "All of a sudden there was this black, the column of fire came
              virtually over us," Hendrie says. "We heard cars exploding, the
              service station went up.<br> <br> It just got worse and there was blackness all over."<br> <br> Karen Rolands, who was in her house with her husband, Paul, and
              daughters Caitlin, 14, and Nicola, 12, told a family member on the
              phone, "It's too late, we're trapped", shortly before the flames
              overwhelmed them.<br> <br> One of her neighbours, Maryanne Mercuri, was also trapped in her
              house with her husband and three children. It was so dark she could
              not see her children to wrap them up properly in towels. They
              talked about heaven as the fires roared past them and, somehow,
              spared their house.<br> <br> After the front passed, local resident Mike Flynn 64, was found by
              neighbours lying on the footpath, literally smouldering.<br> <br> They dragged him into one of the few remaining houses and held him
              in a pool with only his head above water for the next 10 hours
              until help arrived.<br> <br> <strong>STEELS CREEK</strong><br> <br> After swallowing Kinglake, the fire thundered down the valley
              towards the community of Steels Creek, home to 250 people.<br> <br> Dorothy Barber, 63, lived 500m from her daughter Nicole and her two
              grandchildren, but the flames came through so fast that Nicole
              could not reach her mother before she was forced to flee with her
              own children.<br> <br> With her house exploding around her and no prospect of rescue,
              Dorothy curled herself into a square metre cavity beneath her
              floor. It was six hours before she was found alive amid the ruins
              of her house.<br> <br> Leigh and Charmin Ahern were not as lucky. Their neighbour, Dave
              Twentymen, survived but later found the Aherns' remains inside the
              house.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> BY 5.30pm in the war room, no one knew that Kinglake or Steels
              Creek had been lost and that at least 37 people lay dead in those
              townships.<br> <br> Attention was focused on another drama that was unfolding. Shortly
              after 5.30pm the predicted southeasterly change hit the
              firefront.<br> <br> Now the fires that were heading south were suddenly heading
              northwest, bringing new communities into their range.<br> <br> "It really worried us because we knew the impact would be immense,"
              Waller says. "We knew the eastern flank of the fire would now
              become the front, just like in Ash Wednesday."<br> <br> The temperature, which had hit a record 46.4C in the city, fell
              sharply but the winds associated with the change were gusting at up
              to 125km/h -- more than enough to keep the fires rolling at maximum
              strength.<br> <br> By 6pm, massive chunks of the state were ablaze.<br> <br> Towns such as Horsham and Coleraine were under threat. Also
              worrying Rees and Waller were reports of fire at Gully Road, Upper
              Ferntree Gully.<br> <br> "You can only think what would have happened if we'd had that fire
              rip up the side of the Dandenongs, given the resource capability we
              had," Rees says.<br> <br> <strong>BENDIGO</strong><br> <br> In the goldfields town of Bendigo, mayor Kevin Gibbins was driving
              into town to buy some Chinese takeaway just after 6pm when he
              noticed some low smoke.<br> <br> "It was very, very dark and I thought: 'Where's the fire? It must
              be very near'," he says.<br> <br> It turned out to be a grass fire at Eaglehawk, on the town's
              northwest outskirts.<br> <br> Thought to have been lit by a cigarette butt thrown from a passing
              car, the fire raced across a vacant block, then into adjoining
              bushland and along gullies surrounded by housing estates.<br> <br> It randomly picked its victims, destroying one home but leaving
              those on either side unscathed.<br> <br> Fire embers showered the suburb like confetti, setting the house of
              Kevin "Mick" Kane on fire. Kane, an elderly man with a walking
              stick, died in his driveway as he tried to escape.<br> <br> No one said so at the time, but the Bendigo fire rattled the
              confidence of those in the war room.<br> <br> If a fire like this could rage within 1.5km of the centre of a city
              of 95,000 people, was anywhere in Victoria safe?<br> <br> The Premier had spent the day in Bendigo, having earlier prepared
              his own property for fire threat.<br> <br> As the day wore on, Brumby became increasingly alarmed by the news
              from the fire fronts.<br> <br> Bendigo was on fire, but Rees and Waller were more worried about
              events that were unfolding in Gippsland.<br> <br> <strong>CALLIGNEE</strong><br> <br> In the east of the state the fire that started earlier that
              afternoon, dubbed the Churchill-Jeeralang fire, had burned without
              posing any direct threat to lives.<br> <br> But the southeasterly wind change suddenly turned the firefront
              around and sent it racing towards the farming communities of
              Churchill, Koornalla, Traralgon South and Callignee.<br> <br> At the same time, the communications tower on top of Mount Tassie
              was burnt out, meaning locals could no longer receive fire warning
              updates from ABC radio.<br> <br> Those locals who remained in the ridgetops settlements of Callignee
              and Callignee North suffered possibly the quickest deaths of anyone
              on this day. The flames hurtled up the mountain in an instant,
              incinerating at least 11 people.<br> <br> On Old Callignee Road, 97-year-old Charlie Richardson had stayed to
              defend his house. When it started to burn down, he dived into a
              horse trough wrapped in a blanket until the fire passed. He was
              found crawling towards the road waving a torch to attract
              attention.<br> <br> <strong>FLOWERDALE</strong><br> <br> Back in the Kinglake area, the new wind direction was blowing the
              fire north across the ridges. In its way was the small settlement
              of Flowerdale.<br> <br> The town was defenceless, its only tanker having been sent to fight
              another fire. Several dozen people sought refuge in the Flowerdale
              hotel but the flames hit with such speed and force that many did
              not make it.<br> <br> A mother with her two young boys abandoned her ute at the height of
              the flames but was overcome. Rescuers found the body of her
              10-year-old son lying on his back, his blue eyes staring at the
              sky.<br> <br> Inside the hotel, locals used hoses, mops and buckets to save the
              building and their lives.<br> <br> At the same time, Robert Harrop, was carried in after being badly
              burned trying to save his home. Locals took turns caring for the
              old man, covering his unconscious body in wet towels and removing
              his false teeth so they could place water on his lips. They held
              his hand and spoke to him, but he didn't make it.<br> <br> Nathan Sawyer, a volunteer firefighter from Flowerdale CFA, says
              they were deployed to another town to fight the fire before the
              inferno hit his home. He said the town's tanker could not make it
              back to Flowerdale in time.<br> <br> "The fire just swept through here like no tomorrow " he says. "It
              was just flying. We called it the devil's breath. It was breathing
              down our throats."<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> INCREDIBLY, by 6pm, no one within the war room had yet received any
              confirmation that lives had been lost.<br> <br> "You live in hope here," Rees says. "I can remember thinking about
              six o'clock, if we can get out of here without any lives lost we'll
              be very lucky indeed."<br> <br> Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon was in the war
              room.<br> <br> "We started to watch the wind change and the lights on the board
              that indicated fire activity started glowing," she says.<br> <br> "I though this was going to be terrible, just terrible".<br> <br> By 6pm, the smoke plume was 15km high, 5km higher than a normal
              severe thunderstorm. "It looked more like a volcanic eruption than
              a thunderstorm," Coombs says.<br> <br> The bureau estimated this part of the fire complex was responsible
              for more than 1000 lightning strikes. No one knew how many fires
              this may have started.<br> <br> "You get a sense of dread with something like this, you feel quite
              sick watching it unfold," Coombs says.<br> <br> Amid the dozens of fires being monitored in the war room at that
              moment, there was one that had slipped largely under the radar. The
              Murrindindi sawmill fire that had run parallel to the north of the
              Kilmore fire had also been turned north by the wind change.<br> <br> It its direct path was the scenic tourist town of Marysville.<br> <br> <strong>MARYSVILLE</strong><br> <br> Shortly before 6pm, Lucie O'Meara saw the smoke rising above the
              ridges to the south of Marysville, where she was spending the
              weekend with her husband and baby daughter.<br> <br> "The volume of smoke was massive, it looked like a giant
              marshmallow," she says.<br> <br> Locals say that at this moment birds began to fall from the sky,
              stone dead.<br> <br> Kay Menzies and Nora Spitzer of Cathedral View Natural Therapies
              were massaging a couple at Lyall Cottages in Marysville when they
              heard a tree crash on to a car. The masseurs ran out to see what
              had happened. They saw the wall of smoke coming towards them,
              jumped into their car and fled the town. The couple being massaged
              also escaped.<br> <br> On the corner of Martin and Falls roads on the top of a hill,
              72-year-old Elaine Postlethwaite and her 82-year-old husband Len
              were having an argument.<br> <br> Elaine wanted to flee the fire; Len, a former champion axeman and
              the town's longest resident, refused to leave.<br> <br> "Come on, Len; come on, Len," Elaine implored him as he sat
              stubbornly on the veranda. Len even turned his chair so his back
              was to the oncoming smoke. Elaine left him and was saved by
              neighbours. Len perished.<br> <br> O'Meara says the fire descended on the township in an
              instant.<br> <br> "The air felt like it had been sucked out of us, it was so hot,"
              she says. "I was screaming like a five-year-old girl.<br> <br> "People in cars were doing burnouts to get out and I can still see
              the horror on people's faces, people running up the street with the
              flames behind them."<br> <br> O'Meara ran to take refuge along with many others at the Cumberland
              Spa, a five-star spa brick resort with a swimming pool. But at the
              last minute she was persuaded to run to the local sports ground,
              Gallipoli Park, where about 60 locals had gathered.<br> <br> CFA firefighter John Munday was in a fire truck which sped into
              Marysville only minutes before the fire hit. But when they saw the
              wall of flame he knew instantly that they could not defeat
              it.<br> <br> "We had people banging on the sides of our tanker begging us to go
              back to houses where they knew there were people trapped but we
              couldn't because if we had, we'd all be dead too," Munday
              says.<br> <br> "The whole town died around us as we bunkered down on the outside
              of the oval ringed by funeral pyres while all around us we had the
              screaming noise of gas cylinders exploding in homes."<br> <br> O'Meara huddled in the oval with her husband and baby and survived
              the firestorm. The Cumberland spa, where she was originally headed,
              was burnt to the ground. In an instant, Marysville had ceased to
              exist. Up to 100 people lay dead under its smouldering ruins.<br> <br> "That fire was evil, it had a purpose," O'Meara says. "It was
              hungry."<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> NO one inside the war room knew about the losses at Marysville. In
              fact it was not until 8.57pm that Rees was told officially that
              lives had been lost in Victoria that day. He was told a small
              figure of "less than 14".<br> <br> Even so, with each passing hour it became clearer that the cost in
              lives was going to be substantially more than the initial figures
              were suggesting.<br> <br> "You could see faces and shoulders drop as the news got
              progressively worse," Esplin says. At 8.30pm, The Alfred hospital
              in Melbourne was contacted by the Victorian Health Emergency
              Co-ordination Centre asking it to prepare for a potentially large
              number of burns injuries.<br> <br> The hospital's director of operations, Andrew Stripp, was advised
              to prepare for at least 50 to 100 severely burned patients.<br> <br> "We knew then that this was something in a completely different
              realm to what we'd ever experienced," Stripp says.<br> <br> At 10pm, the Government announced that 14 people had died.<br> <br> Rees already knew that this was a serious understatement.<br> <br> "In my heart of hearts I thought in the 30 to 50 range," he says.
              'I still didn't know about Marysville and I didn't know about
              Gippsland and the extent of lives lost in those places."<br> <br> He did know that the fire had "ripped through Kinglake" but did not
              know the extent of the human cost.<br> <br> At no stage during the day did he and Waller verbalise their
              private fears about the likely death toll. It was the elephant in
              the room.<br> <br> By late Saturday night, news was spreading through the senior ranks
              of the Rudd Government about the severity of the crisis.<br> <br> "It was about 10 o'clock when the phones started ringing and the
              PM's office became involved almost immediately," one official
              recalls.<br> <br> At 10.30pm, Kevin Rudd, who had been receiving updates throughout
              the evening, arrived at his Parliament House office. At 11.30 he
              met National Security Adviser Duncan Lewis, Emergency Management
              Australia director general Tony Pearce and his advisers about what
              emergency measures needed to be taken.<br> <br> Just after midnight, the Prime Minister talked with Brumby and told
              him he would fly to Melbourne the next morning.<br> <br> "It (had) became clear that many, many more people were affected by
              these terrible fires," Brumby says. "It was clear that we were
              dealing with something completely devastating."<br> <br> By this time, federal Attorney-General Robert McClelland had
              already activated the Commonwealth Disaster Plan.<br> <br> Rudd's team was also passing the information to his deputy Julia
              Gillard who had been sitting at her Altona home "glued" to Sky News
              and ABC radio.<br> <br> "We were all on edge, and all nervous, and praying for the best but
              expecting there would be bad news," Gillard recalls.<br> <br> Back in Melbourne, it was after midnight when an exhausted Esplin
              finally left the war room.<br> <br> "I got a phone call as I was driving home that Marysville had been
              basically razed," he says.<br> <br> "I felt the worst I have ever felt in my career. I was as flat as a
              shit-carter's hat. We knew the death toll was substantial and that
              the fires were still burning. I went home with an absolute dread of
              what we would find in the morning."<br> <br> Esplin got home at 1.30am, and slumped down on the veranda.<br> <br> He shook his head and turned to his wife Roz.<br> <br> "The worst has happened," he said. "The absolute worst that you can
              remotely imagine."<br> <br> He was wrong. The reality was beyond imagination.<br> <br> As Esplin turned off the light, the official death toll for Black
              Saturday stood at 14.<br> <br> In truth, more than 200 Australians lay dead, consumed by the most
              savage bushfire seen in this country.<br> <br> <em>Additional reporting: Milanda Rout, Lauren Wilson, Rick
