An aging population is an inevitable byproduct of increasing affluence.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Can we compare our affluence to that of the Americans in the USA, or the Europeans in the Euro Community ? </strong></span><br><br>Definitely yes.

In the US tertiary institutes at least, you will find a much higher representation of Singaporean students rather than Malaysian students. RM50,000 is a real stretch for affording two kids overseas, unless you're talking about somewhere other than Australia, US, Canada, or the UK.<br></div>

I don't think we would lose out in terms of comparison. Singapore has been stated as the Switzerland of Asia. Unfortunately, we don't have the billions upon billions of european and american wealth stashed in our banks. Yet without these resources, we have established low unemployment (yes despite retrenchment, our unemployment rate is still low) and nearly as high a standard of living.<br><br>Japan? The LDP? We started out learning from the Japanese, and i believe our political system has far outstripped it. Do you think the LDP has handled the problems of economic recession (only now recovering after 15 yrs of recession), the aging population, and even corruption? The Japanese government is the very definition of vested interest and pork barrel politics that Singapore has avoided.<br><br>Australia? Do we significantly lose out in comparison to our friends in the nearby continent? Sure many of us dream of living in down under, but the job market is just as tough there, unless you are looking at it as a destination for post-retirement bliss.<br><br>I have no idea on Sweden so I can't comment, but its great that you compare us to a country thats a neighbor to norway, which has a standard of living thats considered #1 in the world.<br><br></div>

If u look back at those who "joined" the elites thru the education system and scholarship boards, u'll realise they didn't really come from humble backgrounds. And what about people who are from average backgrounds who do not want to go thru the education system and scholarship boards? Why must anyone join the elite only thru THEIR system? Why can't other people become an elite outside of the system? Why is the system so afraid and dismissive of people who HAVE risen up to their level outside the system? Why are people told they can ONLY rise thru the system? So are u sure those who succeed on their own merits are given their place in the sun?<br><br>Im not wrong when I say Singapore's system strangles the populace. If u're not "joining" the elite thru THEIR system, regardless of your background, you're dismissed and disregarded as a nobody. The only exception I can think of is Sim Wang Hoo. So u can only join the elite thru scholarly pursuits. What about other areas? Sports, arts, culture, music? No. They disregard you. U really want to tell me that the system does not suffocate the individual? U want a good example of this, just look at the thread about the violinist who's not allowed to defer to attend a prestigeous music college in the USA(which has said it is not willing to wait for him to finish his NS). Yea? Very good example of not allowing people to succeed except through their system. Worse still, there are many people willing to justify that decision with communist logic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I'm saying all these, as someone who know many of these scholars well, who has relatives who are some of these scholars, and as someone who has relations to the ruling party by family.

I fail to see why so many Singaporeans don't.</div></blockquote>Well if u're not even a citizen, and I'm assuming that means u weren't born here, its no surprise it seems so wonderful to u. If u're born here, its a curse. If u're not, hey Singapore loves foreign talent. No wonder u sing its praises. Try being born a citizen, and maybe u'll come to see why so many Singaporeans don't respect the system anymore.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kivichio:</div><div class="quote_body">Sidenote: Just out of curiousity if you don't mind, do you intend to return to Singapore from the UK or do you intend to work there.

I'm definately not returning to Singapore, both for career reasons and personal reasons.<br><br>Career-wise, there is no chance of employment in Singapore for anyone wishing to work in international motorsports. Even if they are now building a motorsport circuit, it would take years before truely international motorsports is sufficiently established in Singapore for employment to be viable. But in any case, that is fairly moot because UK is the home of international motorsport, and its wise to seek career opportunities there. Besides, I do have a list of companies I'd personally like to work for, and they're based in the UK.<br><br>Personal-wise, I do not like the conservative and discriminatory and detrimental attitude of society back home against people who are non-conformist, against the arts and the culture. If I ever choose to raise kids, its not the sort of place I'd want them to grow up in. I would gladly trade some safety for attitude and social open-ness. Besides, growing up in a place less "safe" would make one more street smart, and teach them to be more alert about their surroundings.<br></div>
