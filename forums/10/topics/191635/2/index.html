If we do, then we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from any democratic process, other than by ordinary law of the land, should be allowed. If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at naught. . .Â”</span><br><br>In a subsequent speech made when Singapore was part of the Malaysian federation, Lee articulated his feelings about freedom of the press and media. <span style="font-style: italic;">Â”Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open or a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideasÂ—the novel, unorthodox, heresies. . . where there is a constant contest for menÂ’s heats and minds on the basis of what is right, of what I just, or what is in the national interest? Or is it a closed society where the mass mediaÂ—the newspapers, journals, publications, TV, radio. . . feed menÂ’s minds with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox philosophy?Â”</span><br></div></blockquote>It would be indeed interesting if someone were to bring this up in parliament and watch the reaction from a 'sleepy' MM Lee, citing our current domestic affairs concerning so-called freedom of speech and the sorry state of our 'democratic' media.<br><br>I wonder whether it would be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: indigo;">robust</span> </strong></span></span>response or a complete <span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>denial.</strong></span></span></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

All I see is old man Lee and Mrs riding camels and choo choo trains around tourist attractions on their formal visits. Not a bad deal for a guy who gets to travel on taxpayers money and and have a good time travelling in comfort and sightseeing in his golden years all on the pretext of work related trips. As for the press, its a riff raff press! All they do is make money out of ads and followed by brainwashing the masses with their 1 sided riff raff articles.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's messy and noisy, and it has turmoil.<br>LEE:</strong> You must have contention, a clash of ideas. <span style="color: green;">If Galileo had not challenged the Pope, we would still believe the world is flat, right?</span> And Christopher Columbus might never have discovered America.<br><br><strong><span class="small">TIME: You don't allow much contention in Singapore.<br>LEE:</span></strong> [The lack of contention] here could be a problem. <span style="color: green;">But I do not believe you must have that degree of contention and political viciousness to be creative ... </span>The exaggerated exploitation of political positions, just to do the other side in, it's so counterproductive, unnecessary. Take Hurricane Katrina. The politicking was incredible. So George W. Bush was not quick off the mark when Katrina struck. But I don't think his adversaries were simply that worried about New Orleans; they just wanted to put Bush down.<br><br><strong>TIME: But you would concede that Singapore now needs more contention and turmoil?<br>LEE:</strong> Surely, surely. Ideally we should have Team A, Team B, equally balanced, so that we can have a swap and the system will run. <span style="color: green;">We have not been able to do this in Singapore because our population is only 4 million</span>, and the people at the top, with proven track recordsÂ—not just in ability, but in character, determination, commitmentÂ—will not be more than 2,000. You can put their biodata in a thumbdrive.<br><br>We also have a different culture, a different way of doing things. The individual is not the building block. It's the family, the extended family, the clan and the state. The five crucial relationships are: you and the prince or the ruler, you and your wife, you and your children, you and your parents, you and your friends. If those relationships are right, everything will work out well in society.</span> </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Was the creative political viciousness displayed by the Alternative Parties in the recent Singapore Election 2006, or was it a star display of the vicious trait that is characteristic of MM LKY himself ?<br><br>Is it not typical MM LKY brilliance in weaving a tall tale to an external audience - that knows nothing in depth of Singapore and Singaporeans - and attempt to  convince the world at large about the supposed paucity of Singaporean Talents and Righteous Characters ?<br><br>Surely, again, in the recent Singapore Election 2006, the Alternative Political Parties have proven his views wrong again ? </span><br><blockquote><br>As far as I know, other than his insistence on a strong central government (which pretty much has done right by us), he hasn't stumbled much yet.

Because we have fallen proverbially into the high wages-export market dilemma that Japan has fallen into and which Korea and Taiwan are now desperately trying to fend off also. Are those retrenched a majority? Do I see unemployment rocketing? No, its an adjustment and Singaporeans have to understand the government is not responsible for giving you a high paying job, a nice condo and a country club. Are the retrenched homeless? No, they live in cheap affordable government housing. Are they hungry? No, food prices have not been artificially inflated with protective tarriff policies and remain cheap for our income level. Do we all need cars? No, Singapore's public transport and relatively light jams are the envy of East Asia. <strong>Do we complain endlessly that not all of us have the good life, without endeavoring my own effort to make things better?

Its reached crisis proportions in Korea and Japan. Most rich, affluent (how did this come around huh?) countries find that as people become more educated and well-off, their tendencies are usually inclined to limiting the brood to one or two for a better quality of living.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, after all's said and done, there will always be those who complain about the PAP. My point in all of this is not to glorify the PAP as the best or anything like that, but rather to let those who constantly call for a change of leadership to reexamine their motivations<br><br>Have they done such a bad job looking at the current global situation?<br>Have Singaporeans <strong>as a whole</strong> suffered from gross negligence?<br>Do the opposition have a clear road map on how they can fix certain issues facing Singapore or are they just gaining popularity by ragging on the incumbent party?<br>Is the opposition a CREDIBLE Body to pass over leadership of a country like Singapore?<br><br>A lot of dissatisfaction seems to rise from the fact that MM LEE is a vicious bastard to those who cross him. That's not in dispute.

            <div class='col-md body'>I will not say how good or what great things the opposition will do for us, but here I am going to say what you will get when you vote the PXP into power again...<br><br>Vote for PXP means:<br><br>1) You accept their system of government, a system of trampling on the basic civil rights of the citizens. You have no right to free speech, and that means criticisms will be censored, or worse, interpreted as defamatory and be charged. Even when you criticize court cases or its sentencing, you will be treated as contmpt of court, and be fined or jailed. In other countries, when their govt deliver poor performance or overtax their citizens, they are allowed to demonstrate and protest. Not in this system we have - you talk and you will be in trouble.<br><br>2) You accept a system of stiff fiscal penalties, from paying ERP and COE, to buying and maintaining a public flat - either for reasons of "limited resource" to "market pricing" excuses. You will be so broke and in debt that in later life, retirement is something no longer availble to you. You will work until you drop dead.<br><br>3) You accept a system of totalitarian rule, with laws to tell you how many children you should have based on your academic attainment, to freezing your CPF money based on your inability to manage your own retirement.<br><br>4) You accept a system of state controlled media propaganda where only one side of the story is promoted, and television that shows monologues between the leaders and their citizens. Anything else will be censored.<br><br>5) You accept a system of non-functioning parliament - Members of Parliament, which you are going to elect as your voice in government, are not allowed to speak nor vote on your interest or welfare. No matter what the their party candidates promises you of "adding value in parliament" or to "help the poor and sick", they are prevented from doing so in parliament, for if they try to speak and vote on the peoples' behalf (that's their job, really) they will face party disciplinary action for not supporting all policy or law put forward by their party leader. What is the big deal, you ask. Well, it means in plain language, your voices are gagged in parliament, the nation's highest decision making assembly. It means you had been silenced by the government.<br><br>6) You accept a system of non accountability to the people - from absense of tansparency of the country's reserve, to details of how many citizens lost their jobs or were downgraded in salary or rank. Nor is there independent audited figures to tell us how many foreigners we let in took away mid- to senior positions from citizen workers. You may sacrifice your years doing National Service, but this govt system do not protect your jobs, do not really subsidize your healthcare or govt built homes, and leave you out in the cold with media silence and parliamentary gag. They can grab numbers from thin air and publish them for public consumption, and with transparency lacking, you never know if the govt took you for a ride.<br><br>7) You accept a system of unmoderated and excessive elitism in this govt system, where you get top posts from paper certificates and no measurement of their proficiency nor performance. In fact, these "elites" (some called them scholars) can get into parilament without a contest, get top public office positions without any relevant background, and continue to hold their posts without delivering any improvement to the public. Not only uou will be burdened with their generous financial rewards, you will also have to put up with their frequent cost increases that you, the public has to pay for.<br><br>You elect a govt who when it comes to writing laws, or finalizing policies, do not have the obligation to ask the people, even if such laws and policies affect every citizens' lives. You elect a big-brother-knows-all govt who speaks of public feedbacks but never take them into consideration nor acted on them. Faulty policies and unfair laws were passed and who will suffer? It's YOU. Not the govt, not the elites who makes the decisions. Did they listen to you? Acted for your interest? Or did they put you in debt by squeezing your hard earned money by way of taxes, levies, penalties, HDB flats, CPF distortions, and fines?<br><br>9) You accept a Party lacking in integrity - when the leader push his son into office, put his relative to manage our national reserves, put his buddies to administer the laws, use public money for their party interests, punish and prevent free speech and criticisms, disallow their MPs to speak and act for the citizens, maintains an army of mercenaries, allows citizen to be incarcerated into a mental institution at the president's pleasure, sue opposition leaders into bankruptcies, character assassinate political opponents, pretending to be whiter-than-white rascals, and remove any contest to the presidency election.<br><br>Get rid of the dictatorship.<br><br></div>

To some extent, the earnings that are due a person based on performance should be respected as such.<br><br>The issue of contention is the repeated insistence of MM Lee that a minister's salary is a non-discussion point. An OB marker so to speak. What kind of a leader whitewashes questions on ridiculously high salaries for ministers without offering even the slightest of explanations? MM Lee has long preached transparency as one of the hallmarks of his govt's integrity. So why does he demonstrate an action tangent to his words?<br><br>His son, as finance minister, claims that an 'undisclosed' formula is used to peg a minister's salary. Is there any dollar indication to prove each minister's worth? Does that account for the 'sudden' retirement of Yeo Cheow Tong as Transport Minister, who held an <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">eventful</span></strong> tenure in-charge of improving and reaching the 'world-class' target for transportation?<br><br>As for decision-making, keep in mind that decisions are made collectively as a cabinet team, and the Prime Minister only 'appears' to make the final decision on television or on paper, as leader of the govt. In the case of MM Lee who travels the world seeking foreign investment, he is left entirely to his own devices, as who would dare tap the old man on his shoulder and tell him he made a mistake? Even from elements within his own party?<br><br>'Family planning' was nudged along the way with plenty of sweeteners including cash incentives and school subsidies for those who 'stop at two'. At a time when the average Singaporean was struggling to make ends meet, who could resist such huge carrots? Did the govt (LKY) make the wrong decision back then? Undeniably. But back then, they were terrified of the population explosion and probably fumbled at a means to control it. Instituting a stop-gap option was perhaps the only choice available. What they truly failed to do was monitor the birth rates and nudge the country back in the right direction, abeit gradually.<br><br>60% is unequivocally a shameful result, regardless of whether it is a majority. It is obvious that in a face-saving campaign, the papers printed the best possible result for the people so that the Ruling Party could bask in some glory.  And hasn't the govt been trying, abeit meekly, to convince the people that there is no need for true opposition voices in parliament by offering their own party members as bait? Lifting of the party whip? etc etc?<br><br>Have you forgotten so quickly how the people threw out that ridiculous suggestion with their ballot by giving Venerable Chaim See Tong and Straight-talking Low Thia Khiang a STRONGER MANDATE in their wards, while all other contested grounds, save Bukit Panjang and Sembawang, finished with smaller margins for the Ruling Party?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Every JB they defeated, they win hundreds or even thousands of people like me who will hate PAP to the core for their bullying tactics and for that, I swear never ever to vote for PAP. Sometimes, battle victories are not easily recognized outright, but someday, people will look back and see how the efforts have been worth it. In all honesty, most of the people I know, I was surprised they are smart enough to understand how PAP has been monopolize the polictical scene and they don't like PAP either for that matter.
