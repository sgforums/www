And that very fight is what makes them disregard and even fear anyone who comes to the fore outside of the system. Its not even just the unconventionally talented. How often do u see someone who chooses not to take a scholarship be offered the same opportunities offered to a scholar? Academic results are but one aspect of talent. There are many brilliant people out there who simply have no interest in a purely academic pursuit to life. Britain's Head of Mensa is a lorry driver. Basically, in singapore, taking up a scholarship means signing your life away. So I really don't see why one shouldn't be allowed to "become" an elite simply because they're rising up outside the system.<br><br>anyways, marginalizing the bad is not necessary a good thing. i think it makes the people in charge and the system complacent. There are always improvements to the system which can be made.</div>

Some whisper that Lim, like other "old guard" leaders Toh Chin Chye, Ong Pang Boon, Jek Yeun Thong and Devan Nair, is sour toward Lee for the way he always insisted on being No. 1. The talk goes that Lee was lucky to catapult straight into the premiership since it suited <strong>his talent for oratory, vision, and strategic thinking.</strong> Had he needed to deal with the nuts and bolts of running a specific ministry, he might have come a <strong>cropper</strong>. If Lim shares this view, he keeps it to himself.

We are not a third world economy due to the vision of certain individuals [hint, hint]. And I doubt any company executive is reponsible for over 3 million individuals. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Are we not comparing the measurable aspects between leaders so as to justify the high wages paid ?<br><br>Based on your opinion, surely you are not suggesting that the high wages are justifiable due to the vast reserves and annual GDP ?<br><br>China today has a national reserves that is much larger than Singapore's, yet to the <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/english/200012/20/eng20001220_58344.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>credit of its leaders</strong></a>, they have refused to accept LKY's philosophy of high wages will prevent corruption.<br><br>If Singapore is to be compared to a First World Country, then <a href="http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25891" rel="nofollow"><strong>Finland</strong></a> - with her incorruptible and not so highly paid Civil Servants - will put the Singapore 'High Paying Civil Servants' to shame. </span><br><blockquote><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong> Our current lopsided ageing issue is due largely to the Family Policies of the 1960s and 1970s. </strong></span><br><br>Again as stated previously, you equate all blame to the government.

In the US tertiary institutes at least, you will find a much higher representation of Singaporean students rather than Malaysian students. RM50,000 is a real stretch for affording two kids overseas, unless you're talking about somewhere other than Australia, US, Canada, or the UK. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Can <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sn.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Singapore with a population of 4.5 Million</strong></a> send more students to overseas tertiary level of educations, when compared to <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/my.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Malaysia with a population of 24 Million</strong></a> ?<br><br>Perhaps the following site will settle your <a href="http://aei.dest.gov.au/AEI/PublicationsAndResearch/Snapshots/03SS05_pdf.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>statistical comparison</strong></a> of the number of Malaysian students going overseas for tertiary education - to overcome the discriminatory quota system that seems to favor one ethnic race over the others despite the poor qualification ?</span><br><br></div>
