            <div class='col-md body'>The Ruling PAP have slowly but finally destroyed JBJeyaretnam in 2001. This man have fought for us in Parliament, He speaks for the common Laymen. He is a True Opposition which needed to be destroyed by the PAP.<br><br>"He(JBJeyaretnam) has never crawled, nor begged for mercy...Jeyaretnam will leave the political scene with his head held high...<br><br>(CV Devan Nair,President of Singapore 1981 to 1985 in the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD - 5th April 1999)<br><br>1972:<br>Farrer Park - JBJeyaretnam(WP) 23.11% Lee Chiaw Meng(PAP) 73.82%<br><br>1976:<br>Kampong Chai Chee - JBJeyaretnam(WP) 40.08% Fong Sip Chee(PAP) 59.92%<br><br>1976- PAP transferred the incumbent candidate, a Malay and brought in a Chinese candidate who campaigned that JBJ was not able to speak Mandarin or any Chinese dialect, and Chinese voters would not be able to speak to him. Despite this campaign, JBJ obtained 40% of votes.<br><br>1980:<br>Telok Blangah - JBJeyaretnam(WP) 46.98% Rohan Bin Kamis(PAP) 53.02%<br><br>1980: Forced to sell his banglow property at Rebecca Road to pay for these LEE Dynasty lawsuits of 1976.<br><br>1981<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">By-Elections)<br>Anson - JBJeyaretnam(WP) 51.93% Pang Kim Hin(PAP) 47.10%<br>JBJ became the First Opposition Mp since Independence.<br><br>Elections was called within 4 Years, As LKY considered JBJ a threat to the system. LKY has said on numerous occasion that JBJ had to be destroyed.<br><br>1984:<br>Anson - JBJeyaretnam(WP) 56.81% Ng Pock Too(PAP) 43.19%<br><br>During the 84 Elections PAP was determined to unseat JBJ .The man chosen to fight JBJ was handpicked by LKY. The PAP so confident that JBJ will be unseated that his supporters had come to the counting centre with a banner congratulating the PAP Candidate for beating him. The Reality is JBJ won with a increase % of votes. The ruling PAP's share of national votes dropped by 12.5% after JBJ's 3 years in parliament.<br><br>1986: JBJeyaretnam was unseated from his beloved Anson from the ruling of the Singapore Courts. JBJ was Criminaly Charged with of Having Mis-Used party finances, barring him from his practice as an attorney.<br>The Privy Council noted that JBJ had suffered a serious "miscarriage of justice". The Singapore Government's response was to abolish the Privy Council as S'pore's Highest Court and to refuse to reinstate JBJ in Parliament. JBJ was thus unable to stand for the next two elections, due to his fine of S$5000 and 3Mths Jail Sentance.<br><br>1988- JBJ banned from standing in this Elections.<br>2nd defamation suit brought by Lee Kuan Yew over questions asked at a rally.LKY was awarded damages of $260,000-00. JBJ once again hit by another Defamation Lawsuit.Legal costs to over $500,000-00. Forced to sell his apartment property at Mount Sanai Rise to pay for 1988 lawsuits.<br><br>1988- LEE Dynasty also prevented The Privy Council to continue as Singapore's highest court of appeal, after Mr. JBJ's cases.<br><br>1988- The GRC was formed. GRC was formed because in 1984 JBJ retain his Anson with a increase % of votes while Potong Pasir was captured by Mr.Chiam See Tong, this triggered the panick button for the PAP. JBJeyaretnam was the major contributing factor of the formation of GRC. PAP were afraid that more seats would be lost, its simple as that.<br><br>1991- The Next Elections is supposed to be held in 1993 but PM GCT called the elections much earlier just two months before JBJ's disqualification ran out on the 10th Nov 1991. So Elections was called to prevent JBJ from standing in the 1991 GE.<br><br>1991- JBJ still was banned due to Elections being called earlier.<br><br>1995- One new suit brought by S JAYAKUMAR and four PAP MPs<br>Another suit brought by eleven Indian members of Tamil Language Week that they had organised.$200,000-00 awarded against JBJ and 12 other defendants for JAYAKUMAR .$265,000-00 awarded against JBJ and 2 other defendeants for the eleven Indian members.

In October 1966 Chia resigned his parliamentary seat to protest the detention of other Barisan legislators and was arrested three weeks later under SingaporeÂ’s Internal Security Act. Chia was held without formal charge or a trial for 22 years in Whitley Road Detention Centre. When the Internal Security Department (ISD) offered to release him on condition that he Â“give a public undertaking renouncing the use of force and terror to overthrow the government,Â” <strong>Chia refused on the grounds that he never advocated violence or been a member of the communist party.</strong><br><br>Chia was finally released from prison in 1989 under the condition that he remain confined on the tourist resort island of Sentosa, where he worked in a converted souvenir stand as assistant curator of the museum. Some say he his release from prison a few weeks before Nelson MandelaÂ’s release was timed so that Singapore could avoid the dubious distinction of having the worldÂ’s longest serving political prisoner. An unapologetic Chia was later sent home and now lives with his father but is forbidden to be employed, travel abroad, issue public statements, or associate with other former detainees without ISD approval.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/Conference/Sydney/jbjtranscript.html" rel="nofollow">J.B. Jeyaretnam</a></span></strong><br>SingaporeÂ’s most defiant opposition figure is Sri Lankan-born attorney Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam who, during the mid-1980s, claimed the citizens of Singapore suffered from the authoritarian and paternalistic behavior of Lee's government. Perhaps alarmed by the decline in PAP popularity and the election of J.B. Jeyaretnam to Parliament in 1981 as the first opposition candidate in over a decade, the government introduced a series of constitutional amendments and disciplinary measures aimed at troublesome politicians. Punitive lawsuits eventually bankrupted the cash-poor Workers Party and put Jeyaretnam on trial where he was denied legal council, convicted, stripped of his parliamentary position, banned from contesting future elections, and disbarred from legal practice.<br><br>Jeyaretnam's appeal to the Privy Council in London--a right generally granted all citizens of British Commonwealth nations--ruled that he and his co-accused had suffered Â“grievous injusticeÂ” and were Â“fined, imprisoned and publicly disgraced of offenses of which they were not guilty.Â” After another incident with Francis Seow, the government passed legislation which prohibited the right of appeal to the Privy Council, a British institution which the ruling party portrayed as an unnecessary legacy of colonialism.<br><br>Jeyaretnam later withdrew his appeal before the Singapore Court of Appeals for parliamentary reinstatement and lost a US$232,723 defamation suit to former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Jeyaretnam was later sued by the Straits Times which forced him back into bankruptcy court and threatened to end his colorful political career. He lost the case in late 1994 and was ordered to pay the Straits Times almost US$100,000.<br><br>Jeyaretnam and his WorkerÂ’s Party has lost ground to younger opposition parties such as the Singapore Democratic Party which won three parliamentary seats in the 1991 general elections. Although Jeyaretnam has returned to legal practice, he has lost all subsequent parliamentary elections after a 10-year forced hiatus from politics.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010521m2.htm" rel="nofollow">Vincent Cheng and the Marxist Conspiracy</a></span></strong><br>Although Vincent Cheng has never served in a political position, mention must be made of the 1987 arrest of 22 people involved in what the government called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Spectrum" rel="nofollow"><strong>Â“Marxist conspiracyÂ”</strong></a> to overthrow the government. Among the arrested were Catholic Church social workers, employees of Jeyaretnam's Workers Party newspaper, and members of a theatrical company called Third Stage. The government claimed the two leaders of the Marxist conspiracy were Vincent Cheng, a Catholic Church activist, and Tan Wah Piow, a former student leader who, according to the government, had been attempting to overthrow the Singapore government since attending law school in Oxford.<br><br>Reaction to the arrests was disbelief since few observers thought it possible that this loose collection of lawyers, Christian activists, and theatrical performers comprised some sort of Marxist conspiracy against the Singapore government. Thirty-nine members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter condemning the arrests and the subsequent detentions of the accused without trial.<br><br>Those arrested were interrogated and then paraded before the media in an orchestrated campaign to convince the public of their guilt, while the Straits Times presented accusations made by the Ministry of Home Affairs as fact rather than allegation. Amnesty International claimed that both psychological and physical torture were used to extract the confessions of the political detainees. All but one of the suspects were eventually set free, but eight were re-arrested after signing a statement saying that their confessions had been obtained after beatings, intimidation, and deceit.<br><br>Vincent Cheng remained under ISD house arrest until 1995 when restrictions were finally lifted.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continuation:<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Seow" rel="nofollow">Francis Seow</a></span></strong><br>Another sad case of government actions against political activists is Francis Seow, a former solicitor general and ex-president of Singapore's Law Society who harshly criticized the government while representing the suspects in Â“Marxist conspiracyÂ” described above. The government responded by arresting Seow as a threat to national security and placing him under the control of the Internal Security Department, a secret police agency which taps phones, searches mail, and has the power to detain suspects without trail under the terms of the Internal Security Act. Seow, accused of plotting with Americans to interfere in SingaporeÂ’s internal affairs, was held for 72 days while the ISD interrogated his about his political beliefs, sources of income, and possible financial support from the American government.<br><br>The crisis peaked when the Singapore government demanded that Mason Hendrickson, a U.S. Embassy employee, be removed from his Singapore post for interfering in domestic politics and secretly urging lawyers such as Seow to run in general elections. The U.S. government denied the charges and, in response, ordered the expulsion of a Singaporean envoy from Washington.<br><br>Soon after his release from ISA detention, Seow further infuriated the government by announcing his plans to run as an opposition candidate in the upcoming election. Seow won a non-constituency parliamentary seat. The government responded by filing six counts of tax evasion against Seow, who promptly fled the country for the United States. Seow was subsequently convicted of tax evasion in absentia and disqualified from his seat in Parliament. Fearing that Seow would appeal to the Privy Council and still angry with the earlier success of Jeyeratnam , the government abolished the defendant's right of habeas corpus and right of final appeal to the Privy Council.<br><br>Rather than returning to Singapore, Seow accepted a fellowship at Yale University and now resides in the United States. Seow authored an account of his experiences in <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3680/is_199510/ai_n8718946" rel="nofollow"><strong>To Catch a Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan YewÂ’s Prison</strong></a>. The book, as you might imagine, is not sold in Singapore but is widely available in Malaysia.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://www.sfdonline.org/Cheelink.html" rel="nofollow">Chee Soon Juan</a></span></strong><br>Dr. Chee, a neuropsychologist and former lecturer at the National University of Singapore, is one of the few individuals in Singapore who continues to challenge the ruling party in his position of head of the Singapore Democratic Party.<br><br>Chee was educated in the United States where he obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Georgia in 1990 before returning to Singapore to work in the Department of Social Work and Psychology at the National University of Singapore. In 1992, Chee joined the Singapore Democratic Party and ran for prime minister against Goh Chok Tong, the former prime minister and major figure within the ruling party. Chee even sought public assurances from Prime Minister Goh that there would be no hard feelings if he opposed him in the elections.<br><br>Just months after losing the election to Goh, Chee was fired by the university on charges that he had spent US$138 of university research funds to ship his wife's doctoral thesis to Pennsylvania State University. Chee insisted that the reimbursement voucher had been signed by Dr. Vasoo, the head of the department and a PAP member of Parliament. Vasoo presented an altered voucher but Chee was in a hopeless position. After he lost his job at the university, Chee continued to insist that his dismissal was politically motivated. For these remarks, Chee was sued for libel by Dr. Vasoo and two other senior members of the department.<br><br>Rather than settle out of court, Chee sold his house to finance his defense but lost the case and was forced to pay the almost $300,000 to the litigants.<br><br>His problems did not end there. Back in private psychology practice, Chee finds most doctors unwilling to refer patients and most of his friends have abandoned him out of fear of reprisal. Yet Chee continues to stand up to the government. His first book, Dare To Change, argues that authoritarian forms of government will ultimately fail as democracy, free speech, and individual rights spread across Asia. Chee later wrote Singapore My Home Too. Both books receive limited distribution in Singapore.<br><br>Chee stirred up more controversy in September 1995 when he delivered a message about the state of Singapore at Williams College in Massachusetts. Parliament censured Chee two months later on the grounds that he had allegedly failed to contradict attacks on the judiciary made by CheeÂ’s fellow panelists, dissident Francis Seow and academic Christopher Lingle.<br><br>Chee found himself in hot water again in August 1996 after he accepted an offer to debate the government on political issues and the rising costs of public health care. During the debate, Chee misquoted some statistics which infuriated the PAP and brought charges of parliamentary contempt from the Minister of Health.<br><br>Persecutor :<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Lee Kuan Yew Speaks</span></strong><br>Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, once one of the worldÂ’s most articulate voices of freedom, had this to say in 1956 as an opposition member of Parliament: <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“<strong>But either we believe in democracy or we do not. If we do, then we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from any democratic process, other than by ordinary law of the land, should be allowed. If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at naught</strong>. . .Â”</span><br><br>In a subsequent speech made when Singapore was part of the Malaysian federation, Lee articulated his feelings about freedom of the press and media. <span style="font-style: italic;">Â”<strong>Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open or a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideasÂ—the novel, unorthodox, heresies. . . where there is a constant contest for menÂ’s heats and minds on the basis of what is right, of what I just, or what is in the national interest? Or is it a closed society where the mass mediaÂ—the newspapers, journals, publications, TV, radio. . . feed menÂ’s minds with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox philosophy?Â”</strong></span><br><br></div>
