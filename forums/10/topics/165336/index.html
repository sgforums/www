In the construction industry, that someone highest up is the qualified person who endorses the structural plans and supervises the construction.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its unfair and silly to blame the minister for the accident.<br>The safety practices are already in place, if somebody ignores it, its his fault, not the one on top of him.<br>In the company I used to work for, there are 4 basic safety rules. Anyone who violated these rules can be fired immediately. Each person was made  responsible for his own actions. Accident rates are the lowest in the industry.<br><br>In the case of Japan, they have this silly and childish practice of resignations of ministers over some accident caused by somebody below him that is remotely controlled by him. Thats why they are mired in recession for more than a decade.<br><br>We certainly aren't stupid enough to follow this childish Japanese model to run our country. The person responsible gets punished. The innocent cannot be made responsible for the fault of others.</div>

It will be right for minister to say that the buck stops here at his desk and take suffcient action for tightening up of loopholes or grey areas in the structural planning and calculation submissions and approval.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Correct me if i am wrong, so you are suggesting that the minister implement something and if it fails he has to answer for it and step down? As you should know, the minister may not be trained in the field altogether, just like how the engineering CEO's may know the specifics of the things that a financial accountant does. At the end of the day, someone else has to do the job that they are trained in.</strong></blockquote>If by your reasoning minister not having engineering knowledge cannot be made answerable to what is going on in the engineering aspect of his ministry, then this is a very unsatisfactory arrangement as the public will be the loser.<br><br>The PM and his cabinet must not allow such a situation to arise at all in any of the ministry. For example if dengue is to break out a minister who has no medical or disease knowledge should still make himself answerable to prevent it at all costs but assembling a competent team to advise and assist him. If necessary, he ought to use his macro- and micro- management knowledge to get his various multi-skill and multi-functional team to put through a whole program to control the dengue.<br><br>If he cannot be made answerable then anyone can be a minister and then disclaim responsibility by saying that he is not qualified and he took no notice or fails to oversee the team. He can of course always take an easier way out by finding a scapegoat but if he is honourable and duty-conscious he would still despite the technical nature of his ministry take sufficient overall control based on the team he oversee to solve all problems.<br><br>quote:<br>It is not enough that as a minister he pushes the problem to his ministry, LTA or BCA as without someone higher to set direction, the lower rungs might be unable to do anything.<br><br><blockquote><strong>What do you mean by setting directions? The law basically states clear and simple that the qualified persons are responsible. In the construction industry, that someone highest up is the qualified person who endorses the structural plans and supervises the construction. The govt (in this case not just one ministry) would probably have to relook the whole set of laws that regulates the industry and its practices altogether since now that this has recurred after the hotel new world incident</strong></blockquote>As a minister, he should possess suffficient expertise and overall knowledge of all field to look at matters from the overall perspective. If necessary he should be able to examine details closely and even be entrepreneurial and creative to solve problems where his officers with all the technical expertise fail to see or preempt. Therefore our ministers should set this type of directions to ensure there is enough management excellence and corporate governance standards to live up to their constant world-class claim.<br><br>quote:<br>After all, the Hotel New World Colllapse inquiry, the minister in charge and the government has assured the public that everything possible will be done to protect the public from another collapse.<br><br>As a government our leaders have miserably failed to be accountable and transparent in implementing that Inquiry report to protect the public.<br><br><blockquote><strong>es there are always room for improvement when it comes to preventing unneccessary loss of lives..</strong></blockquote>Finally after admitting certain serious problems that need to be addressed you are still finding excuses for the minsiter by saying the same thing as they have always said - honest mistakes and rooms for improvements. It is so sad that our world class standard claim can drop so low sometime resulting in so many recent isasterous mismanagements.</div>

I m not shielding them (the ministers/ lta mgt) from disasterous mismanagements. more of why should you look at it as a case of mismanagement instead of a failure on the part of the qualified professional his technical field of expertise? And moreover, the whole set of laws governing the construction industry have to be re-written for you to go after the minister or the head honcho of other private developers..<br><br>My disagreement stems from the title in its very self.. Ng being the scape goat.. in my opinion he is not the scape goat, the law has placed the responsibility on him as well as other qualified persons to exercise due diligence in their term as the qualified persons.

            <div class='col-md body'>The minister in charge appears to get away with the negligence of his ministry again by conveniently punishing the lower rung without addressing underlying serious and fundamental inefficiency as has happened too often.<br><br>Some people would defend the minister by saying that he is not technically qualified and that the safety problem involved in too technical.<br><br>In my view, whether a matter is more technical or managerial, in this case the problems were the same as those encountered in the earlier Hotel New World collapse and since the problems were supposed to have been addressed then by overhaul of some sorts, why were not those recommendations fully implemented since then. It is wrong to concluded that this case is too technical for the minister to answer.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that the minister should have implemented the technical aspects of the Hotel New World Collapase Inquiry recommendations without any excuse be it technical or managerial.<br><br>In the Hotel New World case, groups of piles were found installed in haphazard manner compromising the design load bearing capacity. Load factor for the pile tested was found to be 2 instead of the usual 3. Structural plans were submitted 6 months late with no calculations verified by any qualified person.<br><br>What kind of lesson has he learned from Hotel New World collapse? Will he ever learn the worse management practice is to keep denying problems and pushing problems to others. Has he taken ownership of such a persistent problem in the construction industry where QPs and contractors continue to push the problem to one another.<br><br>The minister should have learned from the experiences found in Hotel New World collapse and implement the recommendations by overseeing his technical team members in his ministry many of whom are supposedly scholars paid more than peanuts ($600K) to look after specific worksite safety and structural safety of building works.<br><br>What is the use of employing scholars and talking about talents and leadership when they cannot attend to such safety problems resulting in more building and worksite collapses time and again.<br><br>Does the minister know his stuff and role and is duty-conscious, consistent and focused in looking after such portfolio. Is he competent taking into account his past performance, the way he oversees costs at hospital and denies information relating to persistent profiteering bus fare increases even during recession times.<br><br>Just imagine our so-called world class leadership and success story has dropped to such atrocious standards of corporate governance.</div>
