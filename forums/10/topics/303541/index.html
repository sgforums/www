It has many spheres of influence. The King, the military, the parties and the people each has its own sphere of influence.<br><br>If Thaksin's PPP is willing to help Thaksin clear his name, it will have to work with these parties. Thaksin will have to have enough clouts to convince all to reverse decisions made by the previous military government. May be Thaksin will play with time and clear only certain issues affecting him first which is easiest to clear. One by one, that is. He has many business interests of his own and definitely cannot be hundred percent sure that he does not make mistakes like corruptions.</div>
