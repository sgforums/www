            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i am not a Christian or Catholic. Secondly, i watched the show.<br><br>If we look at the religious side, the thing that i would thing edging towards blasphemy was that Jesus was just a mere man. All religions believe in the sanctity of their God/s.<br><br>i think beyond that, may have riled some people, is that the mention of certain issues pertaining the Church. If you have read Any Ho's recent most article, you would have caught the gist. Nonetheless, accusations hurled at the Church read like a standard political history. Namely, that the Church was misogynist and that a kabal sought to protect the legitmacy of their authority.<br><br>it riles people, i think, because it undermines their faith. that whatever they have suffered, practised, donated were for a group of "power hungry people". However, i can think of many things that have riled Christians. Galiliean Astronomy, Carbon dating, Darwinism, etc. Yet we must understand, or at least from what i understand, Faith must be put to the test and not evaded. furthermore, if the show really confuses/convinces you, you may need to relook at your facts. What does not kill your faith makes it stronger.<br><br>Why the quiet amongst our MPs? For the simple reason that the State must seperate itself from religion. Organised religion is a useful tool for the State to control the population. Yet any move by Christian MPs (seriously can we label them that?!!?) will alienate the majority non-Christian Chinese, and more so the Malay Muslim minority.<br><br>As we can see from daily lives and history, racial and religious issues are so senstive. Remember Cheng San, Tang Liang Hong was accused of being a Chinese chauvinist. And About 20 years ago, several Church members were accused of being Marxist Conspirators. And we need not be constantly reminded that we are yellow/red in a sea of green. Nothing internal can be immune to exploitation by external entities.<br><br>Apart from alienation, we may see that proverbial can of worms being opened. Members within each organized religion may make similar demands in future. The cartoon "Moses" was deemed blasphemous in Malaysia yet shown in Singapore.<br><br>Therefore silence can only show how prickly things are and have been. Like what i have heard on CNA, quote a Philipine woman say, " if you are not strong of faith, i suggest you don't watch it"</div>
