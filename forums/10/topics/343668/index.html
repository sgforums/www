              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The older Singaporeans with insufficient retirement funds should look to PAP for failing to create an effective retirement system.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Before 1999, CPF was not allowed to be used for investing in unit trusts.By then, It was clear significant portion of older  Singaporeans cannot retire with low CPF rates and they started to cover the leaking pail by liberalising the use of CPF for investments. In 1999 if Singaporean cant retire, they can blame PAP for preventing them from investing in unit trusts.10 years later in 2009, its your own problem.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Back then, there were not much avenues to grow their retirement funds. Singaporeans overinvested in HDB to grow their retirement fund resulting in a bubble for HDB flats eating up the portion left for pension/retirement income.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">If Singaporeans </span><span style="color: #3366ff;">cannot retire is it because we didnt save enough?<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></span><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporeans  already have among the highest savings rate in the world.</span> </span><span style="color: #3366ff;">Financial planners would  tell you that<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporeans cannot retire because we did not take enough risks to generate returns</span></strong>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">But yet we have a "kind" govt wanting to take all the risks for us by investing through GIC, Temasek and paying us <span style="color: #ff0000;">"riskfree"</span> CPF rate</span>.</span></span> <span style="color: #3366ff;">The consequence of earning these</span><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "riskfree"</span> returns could well be extra decades of working life.</span></p>

              <p>SINGAPOREANS are at the bottom of a ranking of retirement income
                                  from pensions in the Asia-Pacific region, says the Organisation for
                                  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>
              <p>And this is true at all income levels, according to the
                                  study, which covered 19 locations including Hong Kong, Taipei and
                                  Japan, The Business Times reported on Friday.</p>
              <p>The Pensions at a Glance study, which also involved the World
                                  Bank, found that <strong>Singapore's average gross replacement rate - the value
                                  of the pension as a percentage of earnings when working - is just 13.1
                                  per cent. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Taipei has the highest gross replacement rate of 70 per cent, the report said. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>'This means that the gross pension income for average earners
                                  in Taipei is over two-thirds of their previous earnings level, whereas
                                  pensioners in Singapore receive less than one-seventh the amount of
                                  their earnings,' says the study.</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's pension is provided by the Central Provident Fund (CPF).</p>
              <p>'The relatively low replacement rate for Singapore is because
                                  the calculations only consider the earmarked retirement account,' says
                                  the study. 'If an individual were to put the general account towards
                                  retirement-income provision as well, then the replacement rate would be
                                  82 per cent.'</p>
              <p>It points out that it would be foolish to say that one
                                  Singaporean who withdrew from the CPF to buy a house is worse off than
                                  another who built up a retirement income and then had to use some of it
                                  to pay for housing.</p>
              <p>'Nonetheless, there is a risk that older people find
                                  themselves asset-rich and income-poor in retirement and facing
                                  difficulty in unlocking the value of their housing assets to pay for
                                  essentials,' the study says.</p>
              <p>Replacement rates - the most familiar indicator for pension
                                  analysts - are not the only factor governments are concerned with. They
                                  also need to measure the value of the overall pension promise.</p>
              <p>'This is measured by the indicator of pension wealth which takes life expectancy into account,' the study says.</p>
              <p><strong>Again, Singapore has the lowest measurement - a retiree's
                                  pension here is worth just an average 2.2 times their earnings at
                                  retirement. The figure for China is 21.2 times - the highest in the
                                  region. </strong></p>

              <p>As our leaders have said, "Retirement is death". So it doesn't make a difference to Singaporeans if we get any pensions when we retire. That's because dead people have no need for pensions. That's why even if we have the lowest gross replacement rate for pensions that doesn't bother the average Singaporean. The CPF money accumulated could be better spent on other Govt investments, such as to attract talents to lead the country to greater heights.</p>
              <p>For example, we can use that CPF money to pay brilliant ministers generous pensions as a reward when they retire from politics at the age of 50 to 60. That would be a fantastic use of the billions saved from paying the average Singaporean a decent pension that they've saved over decades in their working life.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: Average Singaporeans don't need a decent pension to maintain their quality of life after retirement, while millionaire ministers need luxurious pensions pegged to their last drawn salary after they retire. And who pays for these luxurious pensions? Yup, it's you, the one who doesn't get much of a pension after contributing 30+% of your monthy salary to CPF till you're 65.</p>

              <p><br>What odds would you give for a misguided and ill-informed citizenry to embark on a cause of "<em>change we can believe in</em>" on the premise of the state-censored logic you just articulated (given that is what effectively entrenches and prolongs this regime's survival)? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong><span>Unhappy S'poreans haven't seen enough of world </span></strong></p>
              <p>THOUGH
                      I am not a Singaporean, I have grown to admire the city. This prompted
                      me to read the two volumes of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's
                      autobiography.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If Singaporeans were to read them, they would understand what it
                      took the country's founding fathers, led by Mr Lee, to build Singapore,
                      which has become the envy of its neighbours and a benchmark for
                      development to the rest of the world.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I am sad to note that a small segment of an otherwise-enlightened
                      society is constantly complaining and finding fault with the way things
                      are in Singapore.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After a chat with a well-informed taxi driver,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I learnt why some people are unhappy.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He said that some Singaporeans do not travel, and hence do not have the chance to compare Singapore with other countries.</strong></span></p>
              <p>On another note, I read with dismay reports on bringing young men and women together so that they will start families.</p>
              <p>When I read of children falling from high-rise apartments, newborns
                      being dumped in rubbish bins and young children suffering from neglect,
                      I wonder what is going to become of Singapore with more unwed teen
                      mothers, irresponsible young fathers and unprotected children roaming
                      the streets.</p>
              <p>Unless people are educated on responsible parenting, there will be
                      few gains to be had by encouraging Singaporeans to have more children.</p>
              <p>In this instance, quantity without quality does not make sense.</p>
              <p><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20090109-113437.html">http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I posted a story above criticising Singapore critics of PAP regime, I hope that this will end views that I am anti-PAP regime or anti-Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
