Even if it is, we cannot have any say on it because we are not their citizens. Malaysia shall rule their country as they deem fit.

By singleing out Malaysia Malays, you are indirectly saying that Malays are racists. Although you have very clearly stated that it happens in Malaysia, it still hurt the Malays.
