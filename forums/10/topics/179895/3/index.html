            <div class='col-md body'>Bumiputra privileges both enshrined in Article 153 and as set out by other acts of law, remain in force. Many opposition parties including, the DAP and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), have pledged themselves to undoing the NEP. The DAP has argued that it does not have anything against the special position of Bumiputras as set out in Article 153, but seeks to undo the government's policies such as the NEP that they believe discriminate unfairly against the non-Bumiputras. The PKR, which was founded to fight for the release of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who had been detained for charges of corruption and sodomy after he publicly opposed Mahathir's policies, also has criticised the NEP. After Anwar's release in 2004, he criticised the NEP as having failed the Malays and stated that he would seek its replacement by a more equitable policy.<br><br>The NEP and other privileges accorded to the Bumiputras or Malays under Article 153 have been noted for not explicitly seeking to eradicate poverty among the Malays, but instead largely aiming to improve the Malays' overall share of the economy, even if this share is held by a small number of Malays. However, the NEP has also been defended as having been largely successful in creating a Malay middle class and improving Malaysian standards of living without compromising the non-Bumiputra share of the economy in absolute terms; indeed, statistics indicate that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. It has also been contended that the NEP defused racial tensions by eradicating the perception of the Chinese as the mercantile class and the perception of the Malays as mere farmers.<br><br>Article 10 (4) of the Constitution permits Parliament to make it illegal to question, among others, Article 153 of the Constitution. Under the Sedition Act, questioning Article 153 is indeed illegal Â— even for Members of Parliament, who usually have the freedom to discuss anything without fear of external censure. The government can also arbitrarily detain anyone it desires theoretically for sixty days, but in reality for an undetermined length of time, under the Internal Security Act (ISA). In 1987 under Operation Lalang (literally "weeding operation"), several leaders of the DAP, including Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh, were held under the ISA. It is widely believed this was due to their calling for the NEP and other Malay privileges to be reviewed. Others have questioned the constitutionality of the NEP.<br><br>In 2005, the issue of the Constitution and its provisions were also brought up by several politicians within the government itself. Lim Keng Yaik of the Gerakan party, which by now had joined Barisan Nasional, the ruling coalition, asked for a re-examination of the social contract so that a Bangsa Malaysia (literally Malay for a Malaysian race or Malaysian nation) could be achieved. The social contract is a term used to describe the Constitution's provisions with regard to the different races' privileges Â— those who defend it and Article 153 often define the social contract as providing the Indians and Chinese with citizenship in exchange for the Malays' special rights or ketuanan Melayu.<br><br>Lim was severely criticised by many Malay politicians, including Khairy Jamaluddin, the Prime Minister's son-in-law and Deputy Chairman of the UMNO Youth wing, and Ahmad Shabery Cheek, a prominent Malay Member of Parliament from the state of Terengganu. The Malay press, most of which is owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim was adamant, asking in an interview "How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the 'Negaraku' (the national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart."<br><br>A year earlier, Abdullah had given a speech where he mentioned the most "significant aspect" of the social contract as "the agreement by the indigenous peoples to grant citizenship to the immigrant Chinese and Indians". Although Abdullah went on to state that the character of the nation changed to "one that Chinese and Indian citizens could also call their own," the speech went largely unremarked.<br><br>In the end, Lim stated that the Malay press had blown his comments out of proportion and misquoted him. The issue ended with UMNO Youth chief Hishamuddin Hussein warning people not to "bring up the issue again as it has been agreed upon, appreciated, understood and endorsed by the Constitution."<br><br>It should be noted that the social contract is not always used with regard to the provisions regarding rights and privileges of the different races; in the 2004 general election, the DAP ran on a platform of defending the social contract in the context of an Islamic theocracy, which they alleged was forbidden by the Constitution, but was endorsed by Mahathir, Lim Keng Yaik and by PAS, the second-largest Malay-based political party in the country.</div>

Compare just directly? Use your brain Salman. How can you compare directly?<br><br>You need a common ground. Chinese is already established as one. The next one is proportion. Saying that we don't top 4 million for the number of migrants is wrong. The next thing is how many percent of our population is Chinese. Compare that with Malaysia. About 75% of our population is Chinese and for Malaysia, it is about 30%. This number just don't tally if you just extract directly.<br><br>We have roughly that number of people, and comparing with Malaysia population, is a huge difference. Whatever way you want to use to compare, make sure it is proportionate. Don't be a laughing stock here.</div>

Singapore's attitude toward free-trade agreements makes a sharp contrast with other countries in the region. Singapore only seems to become more eager with time when it comes to inking FTAs with the rest of the world.<br><br>That ebullient mood surrounding the agreements was sufficient for Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to use the very auspicious and customary occasion of the Lunar New Year to ring in their benefits. According to Lee, FTAs had contributed handsomely to Singapore's economic growth over the past year. The trade initiatives had succeeded in their main intention, giving the republic a resounding 14% increase in external trade volume. When the multiplier effect - the phenomenon that always accompanies an investment-yielding enterprise - is applied, it would almost certainly have created jobs equaling or surpassing the percentage spike in those mentioned trade figures.<br><br>Such has been the dazzling performance of FTA agreements that the Singaporean media, since Lee's announcement, have missed few opportunities to trumpet news of the city-state's economic recovery and the creation of record numbers of jobs.<br><br>Apart from the proud boast that its macroeconomic policies have always worked, the announcement of the results and achievements of Singapore's FTA strategy also constitutes a message that what's needed for survival in the hurly-burly world of changing economic fortunes is nothing more than a heavy dose of hard-nosed pragmatism, along with a reliance on wits, brinkmanship and resourcefulness to stay and get ahead in life.<br><br>The move to FTAs arose because of the sheer necessity to retain the republic's enviable position as the world's 15th-largest producer of goods and services.<br><br>In addition, FTAs have the potential to augment Singapore's minuscule negotiating power in the world by associating the country with China. In theory, under free-trade agreements, contracting parties receive preferential treatment and exclusive exemption from tariffs and other import duties. This not only makes the free-trade partners' economic services more competitive relative to other nations, it creates an ancillary increase in demand for goods and services due to the economic boost provided by the new trade.<br><br>Given Singapore's reliance on manufacturing, coupled with the comparative lead it has in financial services, FTAs, which offer advantages in quotas, tariffs and other exemptions, are just the breathing space it needs when confronting the big boys of business. Given the win-win situation that free trade has thus far created for Singapore, is it any wonder that FTAs are becoming a buzzword in ASEAN.<br><br>Overall, for Singapore, the strategy of having FTAs is something like insurance with a minimal, or even non-existent, premium. With agreements granting reciprocal obligations, Singaporean companies can immediately relocate their businesses to China, improving their competitiveness and allowing the city-state to retain its comparative advantages.<br><br>The opening of new markets by FTAs has opened new horizons for small and medium-size firms, and particularly can spur the growth of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are seen by the Singaporean government as key to retaining its comparative advantage in the coming years.</div>
