            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm new to this forum. I am a Singaporean chinese.<br><br>Well, I have some stuff regarding the racial discrimination in Malaysia. My mum was born and raised in Malaysia before she came to Singapore to study. I have many malaysian friends who came to Singapore to study too. I myself have been to Malaysia several times. So I am no stranger to this issue.<br><br>Well, the Alliance party says the purpose of NEP is supposed to raise the living standards of the Malaysian Malays. Prior to independence, the British never really cared about economic welfare, they were concerned about earning money. Thus, when they left Malaysia they left behind the serious problem of economic disparity among the races, which could be a cause for social instability.<br><br>The cultural difference between the malays, chinese and indians put the malays at a natural disadvantage. Chinese/Indian migrants come from a more economic-concious society from the coastal regions of India and China, while most Malays prefer a less competitive and relaxed lifestyle. Their views on education, economic status differ from the Chinese and Indians. In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with this, because its their way of life and culture, and we should respect each other.<br><br>Thus, although racist and unfair, the NEP is kind of justified as a drastic measure to bring the Malaysian malays to the same level of economic ownership as the other races. However, the NEP, like Welfarism has proved to be <strong>double-edged sword</strong>, it can bring about short term economic improvement, it eventually sapped the motivational spirit of the Malays to bring about <strong>sustained growth</strong>. It is like certain drugs are used to cure an illness but one becomes too dependent on it after recovery. In my opinion, the Malaysian malays have to change this mindset and bring about more equality in their country, their overreliance on Malay rights policies will ultimately drag their country down. Who will benefit then?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by cheem-.-:<br><strong>Hi, I'm new to this forum. I am a Singaporean chinese.<br><br>Well, I have some stuff regarding the racial discrimination in Malaysia. My mum was born and raised in Malaysia before she came to Singapore to study. I have many malaysian friends who came to Singapore to study too. I myself have been to Malaysia several times. So I am no stranger to this issue.<br><br>Well, the Alliance party says the purpose of NEP is supposed to raise the living standards of the Malaysian Malays. Prior to independence, the British never really cared about economic welfare, they were concerned about earning money. Thus, when they left Malaysia they left behind the serious problem of economic disparity among the races, which could be a cause for social instability.<br><br>The cultural difference between the malays, chinese and indians put the malays at a natural disadvantage. Chinese/Indian migrants come from a more economic-concious society from the coastal regions of India and China, while most Malays prefer a less competitive and relaxed lifestyle. Their views on education, economic status differ from the Chinese and Indians. In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with this, because its their way of life and culture, and we should respect each other.<br><br>Thus, although racist and unfair, the NEP is kind of justified as a drastic measure to bring the Malaysian malays to the same level of economic ownership as the other races. However, the NEP, like Welfarism has proved to be [b]double-edged sword</strong>, it can bring about short term economic improvement, it eventually sapped the motivational spirit of the Malays to bring about <strong>sustained growth</strong>. It is like certain drugs are used to cure an illness but one becomes too dependent on it after recovery. In my opinion, the Malaysian malays have to change this mindset and bring about more equality in their country, their overreliance on Malay rights policies will ultimately drag their country down. Who will benefit then?[/b]</blockquote>They wanting a more relaxed and less competitive lifestyle shouldn't be a reason for them to implement this policy. The world is competitive. You cannot you don't want to compete so you implement policies that will benefit you and harm others along the way. Even animals compete with each other for food, much less humans. If they think they are right, then don't do business with others. Close their doors like North Korea and have a market to support their ownselves. Let the rulers rule as they deem fit. If they want to do business with others, then observe the rules. Don't do so for the sake of supporting the country and introducing policies that will harm the country in the long run. If this is called leadership, then go North Korea and see what is called leadership.<br><br>It is a double-edged like you said, but if they don't to change, then I suggest they close their doors and lead the country like North Korea.</div>
