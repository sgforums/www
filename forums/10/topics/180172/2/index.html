Not CHINA..<br>Singapore should just abolish the race on our ID cards.... an EYE SORE!!!<br>Why must there be difference and state indian, malays and chinese... Just put SINGAPOREANS&gt;&gt;&gt;!!!!<br>RACISM does exist in Sg... and to some extent its quite a big issue... just that it yet to really surface...<br>I have really good friends from all ethnic backgrounds... but the truth is..apart from personal friends, the general perceptions of other ethnic backgrounds are not that good for almost everyone isnt it? For those who been through army, Im sure there will be some very lazy people, or useless regulars or Nsf who are indians isnt it?( no offence to anyone, just stating what I experienced in STinking Army).</div>

But it can also be considered as some primitive behaviour of people who have yet to complete their process of evolution from beast to human.<br><br>Racism is all in the mind means that it can be unlearned!

However, from your post, I can see that you seem rather oblivious to the bleedingly obvious racial problems we have here in Singapore. I was once like you, believing "racism can be overcome, it's all in the mind". I am actually chuckling to myself as I was typing that. Imagine everyday, especially in camp, you see preferential treatment meted out and stereotypical racism coming to life right in front of you, affecting you.<br><br>Maybe then you'd see this issue in a different light. I can just imagine many others suffering the same predicament as my platoonmates and I are.</div></blockquote>I seriously don't think racial problems are "bleedingly obvious" in Singapore. The replies to this thread also don't testify to that, do they?<br><br>I'm sorry for the bad experience you're having in the army camp. This is actually the first time I heard of people being discriminated by the minority in the army camp.  I only heard that the army camp can be quite a torture chamber where people get persecuted mindlessly. Well, let hope things will be better once you get out of the mad house.<br><br>cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most replies in this thread do agree with me that racism in Singapore is bleedingly obvious, or is at least becoming alarmingly so. Just that most of the posters feel that it's more or less hushed up, which is also what I said.</div>
