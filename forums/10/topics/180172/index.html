Where I used to work as a waiter, the older chinese aunties would warn me about them (The largest minority) and I'd often tell them not to be so racist.

However, from your post, I can see that you seem rather oblivious to the bleedingly obvious racial problems we have here in Singapore. I was once like you, believing "racism can be overcome, it's all in the mind". I am actually chuckling to myself as I was typing that. Imagine everyday, especially in camp, you see preferential treatment meted out and stereotypical racism coming to life right in front of you, affecting you.<br><br>Maybe then you'd see this issue in a different light.

            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, it is accepted that the Chinese are dominant in every sector of society from politics to economics. To ensure racial harmony, I take the view that the dominant race should do everything in its power to protect and empower minority races. All things being equal, if there is some form of discrimination, I would rather that it is the dominant race that bears the brunt of it.<br><br>That is the reason I view with great concern the tendency of some Chinese employers not to employ non-Chinese employees under the guise of language abiliy, especially when most Singaporeans speak English anyway.</div>
