But be careful, make sure no ministers surfed this site. If not, you are in deep trouble.<br><br>About the question why they make a such a big fuss over the racist blog, it is a natural reaction. Singapore has too many races due to foreign talent. If someone just writes without thinking and causes a riot, it will be hard to settle the people down again. Remember how long we took to settle the Maria riot? If riots ever happen again, the citizens will be at the losing end. Foreign investors will not want to invest here because of the unstable climate, and we will lose our jobs.<br><br>Singapore can don't care everything, but they do care about the different races' feelings. That's why PAP can reign for so long. As long as Singapore is peaceful, she attract investments, we get to keep our jobs, we are happy, government also happy, can already.</div>
