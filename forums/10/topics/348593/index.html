              Chia Thye Poh: Sir, when the Prime Minister talks of defending our
              country, we find it hollow. This Government has betrayed all the vital
              interests of the people to the British. It has no right to talk of
              defending the nation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This Government is oppressing the people; more
              than 200 political leaders and trade unionists are in the jails of
              Singapore. Our Secretary- General, Mr Lim Chin Siong, is in Changi and
              political dwarfs like Mr Lee Kuan Yew can strut around and talk big
              only when giants like Mr Lim Chin Siong are kept out of the political
              arena (interruption).</strong></span><br><br>Mr Speaker: Do not disturb him.<br><br>Enche'
              Chia Thye Poh: The Prime Minister has spoken about the communal riots
              in Singapore. He says that the Indonesians and the Communists caused
              it. We are from Singapore and we know that this is just to cover up the
              real culprits. The Prime Minister of Singapore is telling, in Europe,
              that the UMNO politicians have caused it. The UMNO in Singapore says
              that the P.A.P. has caused it.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> We who are in Singapore know that the
              communal riots were the work of the UMNO and the P.A.P. who were
              indulging in a bitter fight for power. </strong></span>All this nonsense about the
              Indonesians and the Communists causing these riots is just to hide the
              truth that the main culprits belong to the ruling parties.<br><br>SOME HONOURABLE MEMBERS : Nonsense! Lies<br><br>Enche' Chia Thye Poh : We challenge the Government to have a public enquiry into this. When the riots started . . . .<br><br>Mr Speaker : Order, order! Your time is up—it is already one minute.<br><br>*****<br><br>2
              years later, at the age of 26, Member of Parliament for Jurong Mr Chia
              Thye Poh was arrested and detained without charge or trial. He spent a
              total of 23 years in prison and another 9 years under restrictive
              orders in Sentosa. Upon his release in 1998, he publicly called for the
              abolition of the ISA. He attained his phD recently, but his last known
              whereabouts are uncertain.</p>

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Except to my friends, I have not publicly mentioned this. Now I will say it. It is about my middle finger.<br><br>The trial which I attended in Singapore which got me into trouble, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew vs Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan before Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> Saw <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ean</span> took <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">place</span> in the Singapore High Court from May 26, 2008 to May 28, 2008. The
              courtroom is relatively small. The well of the court is separated from
              the public gallery by a full glass panel extending from the ground to
              the ceiling. There were about 5 rows of benches in it. On the 2<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">nd</span> day, May 27, 2008, I was seated on the 2<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">nd</span> row, slightly towards the end. The first row was reserved for newspapermen.<br><br>On May 27, 2008, about midday, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew strolled into the well of the court through the door, accompanied
              by about 15 men in civilian clothes each with a badge or identification
              hanging from his neck. The judge made no attempt to ask who the men
              accompanying Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew were, which we later found out were bodyguards. The judge, as I had said earlier was behaving as if Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew owned that courtroom and her as well. For the shameful manner in
              which this judge conducted the proceedings, please refer to my earlier
              blog <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang's</span> Kangaroo Court</a> of May 29, 2008.<br><br>Naturally Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan rose to protest at the judge's total neglect to question who
              all these 15 men accompanying Singapore's strongman, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew were, and what business they had in court, when only yesterday, this same judge took serious issue with Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan's assistants being present in court, namely Violet <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Netto</span> a lawyer, Gandhi <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ambalam</span>, Chairman of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">SDP</span> and John Tan, Assistant Secretary General of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">SDP</span>. Only after a prolonged questioning of Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan did the judge finally permit these assistants to be present
              for the purpose of taking notes and carrying out other errands.<br><br>Since Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's son was still being cross examined by Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan, Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Davinder</span> Singh, his counsel asked permission for Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew to remain <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">in</span> court while his son was testifying. This was wrong since these are
              separate plaintiffs; if one can listen to the testimony of the other,
              it is easy to tailor one's evidence to suit oneself. Common sense would
              tell you that the other plaintiff should not not be in court listening
              to the other's evidence. Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> objected of course, but you rightly guessed what this judge decided. Of course she permitted Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew to remain and listen to his son's testimony, before he himself testified.<br><br>Now I come to my middle finger. When Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew came in, he was directed to sit at the back, with these 15 men
              seated behind him. Sometime during the proceedings there was a break,
              when the 86 year old Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew got up and turned around to look at the people in the gallery. When
              he looked at me, I stuck up my right middle finger at him. For a
              moment, he appeared unsure of my action, but I kept my middle finger up
              at him, clearly mocking him. I am sure he saw it, but after a fleeting
              moment, pretended as if he never did.<br><br>True, lawyers, or anyone
              else for that matter, should not be going around sticking up their
              middle fingers at others. But that was an occasion when I had an
              irresistible impulse to do exactly that. I had to show the man what I
              thought of him.<br><br>Was I arrested because I wrote a blog post criticizing this Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> Saw <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ean</span> or was was it because I stuck up my middle finger at him?

              see, in Australia, if I had passed Kevin Rudd on the street and stuck
              my little finger at him, he probably would have done the same to me,
              and we would perhaps have had a drink of 4x beer together, or <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">whatever</span> else they drink in Australia. No big deal sticking the finger at anyone. But of course that is a democracy. In Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's Singapore, you are almost expected to prostrate and crawl at his
              feet if he sets eyes on you, which is not very often these days.<br><br>Well, I am a human being and I have my rights, and I will stick my finger when I want.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p><strong>A detainee remembers </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial;">BY Tang Fong Har, one of the 22 people
              held in 1987 for "communist conspiracy to overthrow the Singapore
              government." In April that year the author, a lawyer aged then 31,
              with eight other former detainees issued a declaration of innocence. All
              were at once rearrested, except Tang Fong Har, who was out of the country.</span></strong></p>
              <p>IT was Saturday, June 20, I had finished two office files in preparation
              for Monday. It was almost 12.30 am and Peter, my husband, was already asleep.</p>
              <p>We were saying in a semi-detached single-storey house that belonged
              to a friend. We were both very tired and tense. We had been since May 20
              when the first 16 people were arrested.</p>
              <p>I had met lawyer and opposition leader Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam for tea at
              the Subordinate Courts canteen on Wednesday, June 17. I had met two Amnesty
              Internal officials on Thursday evening, June 18, and I just had dinner
              with two friends on the night of 19 June.</p>
              <p>I went to bed at about 1 am. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At slightly before 2 am, very loud banging
              on the glass door woke me. </strong></span>Still half asleep, I thought the noise might
              go away, but I heard it again, and some noises outside the house. I woke
              Peter and he went to the door.</p>
              <p>I saw flashing lights and some people outside. One of them said that
              they were searching for illegal immigrants and showed his badge. He also
              said that he was from Joo Chiat Police Station.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I felt fear and knew that
              they were Internal Security Department (ISD) officers. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Peter opened the door and let in the four officers, three Chinese males
              and one female. He carried a sack. Once inside, a Chinese in his early
              40s asked whether I was Tang Fong Har. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I nodded yes, and he told me that
              I was under arrest under the Internal Security Act. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Though it was not totally unexpected, I was nevertheless stunned and
              speechless. He warned us not to move, and the others then systematically
              searched the house - the bedrooms, the bathrooms, the kitchen and the living
              room. I did not see them searching the garden.</p>
              <p>The man who had spoken to us stood near us all the while. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Peter asked
              him, "Doesn't she have any rights?" He looked at Peter in a funny
              way and the rest laughed cynically...</strong></span></p>

              <p>Oh dear.  This isn't the right way to approach things.  In my book a middle finger is an invitation to a punch in the mouth.  Sure it's freedom of expression, but come on, it's also an invitation to fight.  You'd be better off flipping a glass on the table in a Geylang coffee shop.  As for Kev, he surely as PM wouldn't return the gesture.  He'd possibly laugh, and I'd expect another witness to do the mouth-punching on his behalf.  Nair in really being naive in this instance.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-medium; font-family: Verdana;">In his memoirs, Lee wrote that "Lim Chin Siong wanted to eliminate the Internal Security Council because he knew that…if it ordered the arrest and detention of the communist leaders, the Singapore government could not be held responsible and be stigmatized a colonial stooge."<br><br>What the Minister Mentor did not say, but what Harper reveals in his chapter, is shockingly contradictory: <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"In mid-1961, therefore, to seek a way out, Lee suggested to the British that his government should order the release of all [the remaining] detainees, but then have that order countermanded in the ISC by Britain and Malaya."</span></em><br><br>Such a craven act was even rebuffed by the British. The acting Commissioner, Philip Moore, stated that <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the British <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should not</span> be</span></em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"party to a device for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>deliberate</strong> misrepresentation of responsibility</span> for continuing detentions in order to help the PAP government remain in power."</em> </span>(emphasis added)<br><br>Moore suggested that the best solution would be "to release all the detainees forthwith." Lee, however, "was unwilling to present the left with such a victory." <br><br>In a most damning indictment, Moore said that <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lee "has lived a lie about the detainees for too long</span></strong>, giving the Party the impression that he was pressing for their release while, in fact, agreeing in the ISC that they should remain in detention."<br><br><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And if one thought that Lee Kuan Yew could not sink any lower, he did</span></em>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-medium; font-family: Verdana;">He turned to his saviours and warned that should he lose in an upcoming by-election, he would call for a general election, which he fully expected to lose. <br><br>This was because <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">he was facing defections in the Legislative Assembly</span></span></em> on his refusal to release the remaining detainees. And should he lose the elections, he warned the colonial masters, David Marshall, Ong Eng Guan and Lim Chin Siong would form the next government. <br><br>This, he calculated, would be so distasteful to the British that it would rally them to his side. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>He presented the scheme</em></span></span> at a dinner with Commissioner Lord Selkirk, Philip Moore (Selkirk's deputy), and Goh Keng Swee: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-medium; font-family: Verdana;"><em>Lee would order the release of the prisoners</em>, <em>the British would stop it through the ISC, and he would then announce a referendum on merger with Malaya (the story behind merger is explained below).</em> </span></p>
