            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>THE PAST<br><br>It all started with a man who has been able to put his thoughts into action. His country has been asked to leave the Malaya Federation. His Â“painÂ” is to ensure that he would show the world what he is capable of. He put into motion the re-engineering of a country called Singapore.<br><br>He is brilliant, no doubt about it. He capitalized on the human resource as there are no natural resources found on that little red dot. He played on peopleÂ’s fears. He cajoled them, he built fear in them for not succeeding and he promised them a better tomorrow. Bit by bit the pieces fell into place. Some pieces are tough, and some are not. The people rallied around, hoping for a better future.<br><br>Unfortunately, he found a weakness in his fellow countrymen. He realized that as people get a taste of a Â“betterÂ” life, they are willing to forego their principles. So he started building good roads, nice flats, clean streets, crime-free environment and etc. The Economy is used as a backdrop to show the successes in terms of $$$. The emotional blackmail had begun. As with everything in life, it started off step by step.<br><br>THE PRESENT<br><br>The Singapore today is vibrant, clean and safe. I did not mention Â“successfulÂ” as how do you really measure success when the billions that are accumulated are frittered away investing in foreign lands on projects like Suzhou, Optus, Shin Corp and god knows how many more. The shortfall in the performance of the Govt. is clear for everyone to see. However, the emotional blackmail is now at a very advanced stage.<br><br>The people knows the failure of the government, from the Ah Soh in the kopi tiam to the Ah Chek who sells Chye Tow Kway. You could always overhear them saying Cheng Hu this! and Cheng Hu that!. But why do they still vote for them when the elections are called? This is not only restricted to the hawkers, it also plays in the minds of 66.6% of the population. ASK YOURSELF THIS! WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR IF YOUR VOTE IS GOING TO 1) AFFECT YOUR CHILDRENSÂ’ FUTURE 2) AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY FOR YOUR OWN FUTURE 3) AFFECT THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF YOUR LIFE eq. CLEAN STREETS, EFFICIENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT, CRIME FREE ETC. You throw out your principles! We have become a Â“drug addict Â“of the environment. How often do you hear Singaporeans complaining against many countries they have visited? How often do you hear things like so dirty! so inefficient! so corrupted! All these are exactly what the government wants to hear. If Singaporeans are so proud of these factors, they will never want to change it, and together with it; never change the establishment too.<br><br>The current unhappiness over the Increase in MinisterÂ’s Salary stems from every citizenÂ’s observation of the hardship that goes on around them. They see old people hardly making ends meet, neighborÂ’s electricity being cut, etc. The people are now willing to give their two centÂ’s worth of opinion as I believe many of them are now saying Â“enough is enough!Â” The emotional blackmail is still playing in the background; ensuring that they will not over protest.<br><br>So you see, the Singapore enigma is very interesting. I believe there are people out there who are following this development over the many years to see the conclusion.<br><br>THE FUTURE<br><br>It will be for another time and date.<br><br>Cheers!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean only have themselves to vote, rather believing PAP's garbage rhetorics than to take chances with the credible albeit inexperience oppositions. Look, last elections, the opposition fielded quite a number of credible candidates, but people still vote for Pay And Pay! Who else can Singaporean blame other than themselves.<br><br>The worst offense you guys did in the last elections were:<br>1. Did not vote for Worker's Party in the whole Adjunied GRC<br>2. Despised and ridiculed SDP regardless of what they kind of sacrifices they have given to the greater Singapore.<br>3. Did not vote Worker's Party for Ang Mo Kio GRC<br><br>Well, you poor sods in Singapore deserve what you ask for!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>To Both Reyes and Joe Black,<br><br>You are very right in your opinions. The fact is that many forumers both here and in SammyBoy kept "complaining" about the government. However, they forgot to realise that they are the ones that gave away their own freedom of choice at every elections. So if you feel that you are blameless, what are you going to do? Blame the government until the next elections where everything is repeated again.<br><br>However, the forumers cannot totally be accountable for 66.6% of the population. The Ah Sohs and Ah Cheks do play their part to form that 66.6% and I believe the emotional blackmail which I mentioned earlier in this thread is always in motion to swing the votes............cheers!<br><br></div>

So he started building good roads, nice flats, clean streets, crime-free environment and etc. The Economy is used as a backdrop to show the successes in terms of $$$. The emotional blackmail had begun. As with everything in life, it started off step by step.<br><br>THE PRESENT<br><br>The Singapore today is vibrant, clean and safe. I did not mention Â“successfulÂ” as how do you really measure success when the billions that are accumulated are frittered away investing in foreign lands on projects like Suzhou, Optus, Shin Corp and god knows how many more. The shortfall in the performance of the Govt. is clear for everyone to see. However, the emotional blackmail is now at a very advanced stage.<br><br>The people knows the failure of the government, from the Ah Soh in the kopi tiam to the Ah Chek who sells Chye Tow Kway. You could always overhear them saying Cheng Hu this! and Cheng Hu that!. But why do they still vote for them when the elections are called? This is not only restricted to the hawkers, it also plays in the minds of 66.6% of the population. ASK YOURSELF THIS! WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR IF YOUR VOTE IS GOING TO 1) AFFECT YOUR CHILDRENSÂ’ FUTURE 2) AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY FOR YOUR OWN FUTURE 3) AFFECT THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF YOUR LIFE eq. CLEAN STREETS, EFFICIENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT, CRIME FREE ETC. You throw out your principles! We have become a Â“drug addict Â“of the environment. How often do you hear Singaporeans complaining against many countries they have visited? How often do you hear things like so dirty! so inefficient! so corrupted! All these are exactly what the government wants to hear. If Singaporeans are so proud of these factors, they will never want to change it, and together with it; never change the establishment too.<br><br>The current unhappiness over the Increase in MinisterÂ’s Salary stems from every citizenÂ’s observation of the hardship that goes on around them. They see old people hardly making ends meet, neighborÂ’s electricity being cut, etc. The people are now willing to give their two centÂ’s worth of opinion as I believe many of them are now saying Â“enough is enough!Â” The emotional blackmail is still playing in the background; ensuring that they will not over protest.<br><br>So you see, the Singapore enigma is very interesting. I believe there are people out there who are following this development over the many years to see the conclusion.<br><br>THE FUTURE<br><br>It will be for another time and date.<br><br>Cheers!<br></div></blockquote>Very true. I see hardship all around. I think I saw an old man collecting cans. The other day, I also saw a beggar sia. Even though we have a population of 4.5 million and most people live in comfort, but because I see two people living in "hardship", I assume there is alot of hardship in Singapore. Therefore, the government should not be allowed to stand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yah, I also remember alot of people in hardships:<br><br>1) My friend is not very rich. He save and save his pocket money and still not enough to buy the latest MP3 player. The look on his face you can tell he is in alot of hardship.<br><br>2) I know this uncle who is a hawker selling noodles. He used to make about $5000 per month but only $4000 now because the electricity bills, public bus fares, erp, rent all go up. He feels that he cannot sustain his previous lifestyle nor save much money nowadays. Cheng hu lor. Cheng hu is the one causing all the hardships.<br><br>3) There is this guy I know, when young that time never study hard. Now only earn about $800 per month as a production worker. Can afford a small HDB flat and have just enough to eat. But cannot go out much or buy many things. Have to scrimp and save. Why? Because Cheng Hu lor. They cause the hardship.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true. We cannot blame Cheng Hu if we want to maintain a lifestyle which we cannot afford nor if some of us are too "dumb" to have higher qualifications.<br><br>But don't you think they have crossed the line when they constantly think of new and demeaning ways to get more money from the citizens. As with the Ministerial Salary Increase Debate, S'pore's foreign reserves stands at US$210 billion !!!!! A lot of money if you consider a country so small.<br><br>Why then do they need to keep increasing MRT/Bus Fares, ERP Charges etc. where it is so frequently used by the masses. Is it really a case of MONEY NO ENOUGH??? Why can't some of our older folks be given an allowance to ensure that they are at least given some peace of mind in their old age. Do you know that everytime they announce some packages/incentives to help the people, it is always flawed. Take for example the incentive to have more children. The money given out is measly, the children funds are tied to your own contribution and they will match dollar for dollar! If you are struggling to maintain your children's expenses, how much can you contribute to the fund, think about it. Now you know why a lot of couple are still reluctant to have children.<br><br>Don't just read about all those help schemes as advertised. Get right down to it to find out more; be it for the old people or the young couples having a child or for households earning $800 or less. <strong>You will understand when you find the real truth on your own. Else all of us will just only be a smart alec and post all kinds of comments here ..........................................Cheers! </strong></div>

Conservative is indeed the right word, because everyone's lifelong achievements are at stake, IF, a voted alternative party is incapable of stoking the furnace of Singapore's economy...all our earnings..down the drain... and it would take decades to rebuild everything again.. or ever...<br><br>SO, this is the crux of the matter. People are afraid of losing everything like in buying 4D...<br><br>But then again, even if there exists parties who are capable, do you think the ruling party will allow them a chance, to show and tell??? NO! All avenues are road-blocked! So, it's a vicious circle...<br><br></div>
