People are afraid of losing everything like in buying 4D...<br><br>But then again, even if there exists parties who are capable, do you think the ruling party will allow them a chance, to show and tell??? NO! All avenues are road-blocked! So, it's a vicious circle...<br><br></div></blockquote>lol your 1st part is quite true. Every1 wants a decent opposition voice in the parliament. theres no fun in letting PAP dominate the parliament totally. but whos willing to let their town get run by the opposition? every1 knows what happens to "rebellious" districts. Look at the crap hougang mall and lousy amenities potong pasir and hougang had.<br><br>So the typical singaporean would think<br><br>" hey! i dont like pap. i'd like workers party and SDP to have a strong voice in parliament. but i dun think i'll vote for them. so risky! what if they actually win and its good-game-noobs for my district... better not "<br><br>Then i think its not really because there arent no capable parties, rather,  i think its because all the smart people who are interested in politics would rather join PAP than any other opposition parties. seriously i would do that too ( not that im interested in politics ). while theres some policies i dont agree with, most of their policies are still economically and logically sound. Joining PAP would at least allow the person to fully utilise their talents. If you join the opposition party how much difference can u make? You'll have to wait for like decades just hoping that PAP loses their grip on power, then your party can sweep the general election. A smart person would rather join PAP, despite its flaws, so that he can make a difference, which is the whole purpose of politics isnt it?<br><br>So theres simply not enough credible and smart people in the opposition parties that people trust with their own livelihood, hence the dominating spree PAP has on the general elections.<br><br></div>

The money given out is measly, the children funds are tied to your own contribution and they will match dollar for dollar!

Then there are the charges that one has to pay for transportation - whether a privately owned car, or by public transport to earn our wages (and this is not tax deductible).<br><br>Any amount left from our wages will be used to pay for our HDB homes, as the bulk of the CPF will be written off when the Sales Price of the HDB unit is a few times more than the actual costs.<br><br>This is tantamount to rubbing salt into our wound, when the Government utilise our CPF monies for infrastructural development, and all we have is a CPF paper statement of the amount in the CPF.<br><br>While the Government has used our CPF funds to create the HDB estate at low costs, it will write off the loan taken from our CPF while still profiteering from the sale of the HDB unit.<br><br>All funds in our individual CPF account will not be sufficient to pay for the selling price of the basic HDB unit, and it will require at least another 10 years for the HDB unit to be paid from further deductions of our monthly CPF contributions, or top up further with Cash if the CPF amount is insufficient to cover the instalments.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, try to absorbing this - <a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlesgeconomy&amp;democracy3.html" rel="nofollow">Fiscal Finagling in Singapore</a>.<br></span><br><br></div>

Singapore already has the highest income tax in the world at 0 to 20%. The rest of the world all have 0% income tax. Moreover, the CPF is also considered a tax, even though we can use them to buy houses and they have a high rate of return. Even though we will be able to draw them out when we are old, nominate them to our children when we pass on or make investments with them, they are definitely still considered to be taxes.<br><br>Also, the goods and service tax is completely out of line with economics theory. Just ask any economist, they will tell you it is a gimmick for the government to make money. Worse still, you are right to say that we should never be made to pay for any of the services that the government provide us. Why should we pay for anything? All our money should be used to buy the goods that we want.</div>

At best, such measures will merely be perfunctory, because Singaporean wages to begin with have not deviated from market levels. What matters more are land, regulatory and transportation costs, which the Singaporean government exercises considerable control over.<br><br>According to Manu Bhaskaran, the head of Washington-based advisory firm Centennial Research,</span> <span style="color: red;">"Singapore's competitiveness problem is cumulatively due to distortions in land prices [and its effects on wages and rentals], high transportation costs resulting from the government's forceful anti-congestion policies [which drive up the cost of distribution and logistics] and high regulatory costs."</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Indeed, the prices of major inputs - land, labor and capital - in Singapore are substantially influenced by the government. This is because the government, through its Housing Development Authority, owns most of the land, effectively becoming the monopoly supplier.<br><br>The incremental supply of labor is controlled by the government through its grip on foreign-worker inflows. Singapore's financial capital is also heavily influenced by government, as the biggest players are all government-linked companies with ties that extend to the Lee family. Lee Hsien Loong's wife, Madam Ho Ching, for instance, is the chairperson of Temasek Holdings, Singapore's state-owned investment company, and his brother Lee Hsien Yang is the chief executive officer of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel). Lee Kuan Yew has also remained a key board member of various government-linked companies.<br><br>Hence, without adequate measures to retrench the role of the state, the economy under Lee Hsien Loong will restructure in the manner it always has, with companies laying off workers, cutting wages, squeezing subcontractors' margins and forcing landlords to cut rentals. </span><br><br></blockquote></span><br><br></div>

The ERP system is solely used to control traffic jams in the CBD area and not a money making scheme by the government. It is the only known effective system of controlling heavy city traffic jams.<br><br>The public transportation is run by corporations and not by the government. They increase prices because their bottom line is profitability. However, they need to submit price increases to the Public Transport Council for approval. It seems that they are approved because of rising costs due to increase in fuel prices, lower than projected ridership and other reasons. Please remember that they are private firms and they do not want to lose money for they are answerable to their shareholders.<br><br>The old folks have CPF and nursing homes to take care of them. If the government starts handing out money, people will take it for granted and will not save money by themselves. If old folks need help, they can approach the various government funded organizations. I do not know much about the children funds, though.</strong><br><br>no wonder kacang puteh coz you dont even think.<br><br>the greater foreign reserves are probably serve as a poltical tools for the PAP to win at every election. where in hell do the PAP get the money from to give out at every election? where to temasek get their money to keep buying politcally sensitive company from out neighbouring country? there are probably the investment gains.<br>ERP are use to control traffic? take a look at all expressway leading into the CBD are at every morning and evening peak hours. what the point of implementing ERP where the LTA are giving out more COE year after year.<br><br>yes our public transport are run by private company and infact most of them are listed company. why in the hell do we get these company privatise in the first place? the reason is simply. the govt simply want to wash their hands in these cost increament issues.<br><br>do you happen to think why CPF board are letting Banks into HDB housing loans? the probability of privatise town council? coz they see them as troubles in the coming years, privatise them is their helicopter view solution. and that is indeed planning 10 years ahead. that why we are paying them Millions dollars salary not for solving our problem but theirs.<br></div>

Of course, you can invest them in stocks or bonds, but I'm sure if you could, you would draw them out and put them all in the banks. </strong><br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">With your brilliance you will leave out the fact that the bank lend money at a basic <a href="http://www.dbs.com/sg/personal/loans/assetline/" rel="nofollow">prime rate</a> or PLUS a percentage to different borrowers.<br><br>The Government has admitted to using the CPF for infrastructural development - do you think that the Government will not use this large pool of accumulated CPF monies, and pay a flat interest of 2.5% per annum into all the CPF accounts ?<br><br>The alternative source of finance to the Government will be at a higher interest charge for loans that are received through the <a href="http://www.sgs.gov.sg/sgs_data/data_dailysgsprices.html" rel="nofollow">"sale" of Government Treasury Bills and Bonds</a> offered to the market place.<br><br>While paying us 2.5% for the CPF monies that we could have used for our immediate needs, the 2.5% payable interest is more then recovered by the Government from the high profit margins that they reap from the sale of HDB flats, and high priced hospital and medical fees that Singaporeans are forced to pay.<br><br>If you are smarter and more talented than we know , you should have a better avenue to invest the funds to earn a higher rate of return than the 2.5% that is paid for the large sums of monies that are locked until it is utilised for the approved purposes.<br><br>Judging by your remarks made so far, you seem to be too mediocre with independent thinking, and with little confidence shown in yourself.<br><br>This simply fit the Government often made remarks that there are few Singaporeans with the daring and imagination to take risks.<br><br>Hence, they have concluded that few Singaporeans are talented.<br><br>Why are you so keen to prove the Government right ?<br><br>BTW, how did you brilliantly look at 2.5% interest paid to CPF accounts to the Saving Rate of 0.75% paid by <a href="http://www.hsbc.com.sg/1/2/personal/deposits/singapore-dollar-deposit-rates" rel="nofollow">Commercial Banks</a> ?<br><br>Try looking at the 2.5% CPF interest rates as the borrowing rate that the Government is prepared to pay us, comparing it to the borrowing rate that it has to pay for alternative sources of financing their needs - then you will justify to be awarded bigger peanuts.<br></span><br><br></div>
