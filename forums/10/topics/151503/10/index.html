And if the reality is different, your message isnÂ’t getting out there to a sufficient degree."<br><br>Mr Goh: "YouÂ’ve got to be realistic. I think the reality is different from the word "boring" alone. But there are certain areas which foreigners would like to do which we would not allow at this stage. Those are the areas where as a government we are prepared to look into."<br><br>Q: "Like what?"<br><br>Mr Goh: "The question of gay rights is an example. We have told them itÂ’s an offence because itÂ’s in the criminal code and the Muslims too will be against gays. But the government is not going to chase you all over the place but donÂ’t flaunt your gay rights."<br><br>Q: "No gay parades."<br><br>Mr Goh: "No gay parades. So thatÂ’s a movement whereas had we been more strict we say no, youÂ’re committing an offence."<br><br>Q: "YouÂ’re excluding a certain proportion of foreign talent."<br><br>Mr Goh: "Correct, exactly and then we employ you."<br><br>Q: "Excuse me?"<br><br>Mr Goh: "We would employ you so long as you declare yourself, I mean, in certain positions in government. In the past, if we know youÂ’re gay, we would not employ you but we just changed this quietly. We know you are. WeÂ’ll employ you."<br><br>Q: "So you have a donÂ’t ask, donÂ’t tell."<br><br>Mr Goh: "No, in certain sensitive positions, you have to tell so that if you tell, you are open about this, you cannot be blackmailed. You follow what I mean? If you are working in a sensitive position and youÂ’re trying to hide your sexual preferences and instinct, I mean, you are born that way and of course, if youÂ’re discovered by somebody else, then he can blackmail you. You have to openly declare and people know youÂ’re gay. Then, you canÂ’t be blackmailed."<br><br>Q: "Is that a publicly announced policy? That must not go down too well for some."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Mr Goh: "So let it evolve and in time to come, the population will understand that some people are born that way. We are born this way and they are born that way but they are like you and me."</span><br><br>Q: "Why not just change the criminal code?"<br><br>Mr Goh: "ItÂ’s more than just the criminal code. ItÂ’s actually the values of the people. The heartlanders are still conservative. You can call it double-standard but sometimes itÂ’s double-standard. They are conservative and for the Muslims, itÂ’s religion, itÂ’s not the law. Islam openly says the religion is against gay practice."<br><br>Q: "So this is also part of the process of opening up."<br><br>Mr Goh: "ItÂ’s part of the process. This is a practical government and when you understand more about social trends, about people, of course, we are practical and we allow those things. Of course, if we're ignorant, we can be quite narrow in our point of view." </strong><br><br>I did not cross the border promoting that gay sex and community are fun and everyone should become gays, did I? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And using the criminal code to argue against gays is like putting the cart in front of the ox. Isn't it because of the misunderstanding towards gays that such a discrimination became widely accepted and form part of the criminal code?<br><br>And remember that these laws were inherited from UK, a country that has already move ahead to decriminise gays decades ago, allow civil partnership recently. Do why are we still stucked at where we are?<br><br>Remember Indignation? Publicity of Indignation was done almost entirely through the internet. There are newspaper reports on the event, post-event reports, etc... Did the police stop any of these activities? The police has moved from a extreme right position to a more neutral position these days.<br><br>I will post some of the local internet articles (major newspaper) that are gay-friendly tonight to illustrate that the society, media and police has started their move toward neutrality.<br><br>But I do accept that any statements to encourage gay activities, such as saunas, pubs and parties should be kept somewhere else (and hence, my reluctance to talk about such issues all along).<br></div>

And in the same way also the men abandoned the natural use of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts <strong>and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error </strong>. "<br><br><strong>Voltaire </strong>[/color]<br>[/b]</blockquote>I definitely wouldnt disagree with you on this quote from leviticus, but you have to take into consideration that abombination then is something very much different from abombination now. Abombination in hebrew refers to anything forbidden to the israelites.<br><br>For instance, Leviticus 11 says that eagles are an abomination, and so are owls, storks, various types of water creatures, "and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth," just to name a few.  Locusts, by the way, aren't abominations.<br><br>In addition, israelites are forbidden to shave (Lev:19:27),get tattoos ( Lev. 19:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> or wear mixed fabrics (Lev. 19:19).However it states nothing about about sex outside of marriage or having multiple sexual partners.<br><br>On the third quotation from the Romans<br><br>If you read the whole passage, it is clear that the whole point Paul was trying to say wasnt on homosexuality. A brief summary:<br><br>Paul talks about a group of people who "knew God" but "neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him."  Their hearts are darkened, and they begin worshipping idols.  As a direct result of this idol worship, they begin engaging in homosexual behaviors (which they previously were not doing).  Ultimately, they become depraved and God gives them over to a whole list of sins.<br><br>On the other hand, the passage is negative towards homosexual behaviour, but it is in a context where it is clearly sinful.Paul does say homosexuality is "shameful" and "unnatural," but he says the same thing (using the same Greek words) about men with long hair in 1 Corinthians 11:14. We all know that long hair is a cultural thing, now the question would be whether the part on long hair and homosexual behaviour is prohibited for all time, or just a matter of context. Either way, it tough to prove, and your blatant references have not accomplished anything.<br><br>On a final note, homosexual behaviour is not homosexuality but part of it. The bible never condemed homosexuality but homosexual behaviour, even the church in Singapore recognises that. Don't go around telling half truths.<br><br>Sorry for going off topic, but this was something i had to address.<br><br></div>

Just to address this issues above.<br><br>This is taken from American Psychological Association:</span><br><br><a href="http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html</a><br><br><strong>Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?</strong><br>No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed.<br><br><strong>Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation?</strong><br>No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.<br><br>However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals.<br><br><strong>What About So-Called "Conversion Therapies"?</strong><br>Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.<br><br>The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias.<br><br></div>

I've grown up as a boy, being told since I was a kid, I'm gonna grow up, marry a beautiful girl, and have lots of kids.  Perhaps, its the lack of such sexual orientation education that results in a confusion in sexual orientation.<br><br>Since the homosexual gene has already been debunked (cos there are perfectly straight ppl who carried the supposed homosexual gene.), sexual orientation cannot be "nature" already.<br><br>And since "nature" has been ruled out, there is only "nurture" that remains.<br><br>I will say again, I have nothing against homosexuals.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New updates from American Psychiatric Association:<br><br><a href="http://healthyminds.org/glbissues.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://healthyminds.org/glbissues.cfm</a><br><br><strong>What is Sexual Orientation?</strong><br>Â“Sexual orientationÂ” is a term frequently used to describe a personÂ’s romantic, emotional or sexual attraction to another person. A person attracted to another person of the same sex is said to have a homosexual orientation and may be called gay (both men and women) or<br>lesbian. Individuals attracted to persons of the other sex are said to have a heterosexual orientation. Sexual orientation falls along a continuum and individuals who are attracted to both men and women are said to be bisexual. Sexual orientation is different from gender<br>identity, which refers to the internal sense of whether one is male or female. Sexual orientation is a relatively new concept. In fact, although same sex behavior has always existed, the idea of a homosexual identity or a homosexual person is only about 100 years old.<br><br>The concept of sexual orientation refers to more than sexual behavior. It includes feelings as well as identity. Some individuals may identify themselves as gay lesbian or bisexual without engaging in any sexual activity. Some people believe that sexual orientation is innate and fixed; however, sexual orientation develops across a personÂ’s lifetime. Individuals maybe become aware at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual.<br><br><strong>Is Homosexuality A Mental Disorder?</strong><br>No. All major professional mental health organizations have gone on record to affirm that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. In 1973 the American Psychiatric AssociationÂ’s Board of Trustees removed homosexuality from its official diagnostic manual, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Second Edition (DSM II). The action was taken following a review of the scientific literature and consultation with experts in the field. The experts found that homosexuality does not meet the criteria to be considered a mental illness.<br><br><strong>What causes Homosexuality/Heterosexuality/Bisexuality?</strong><br><span style="color: darkred;">No one knows what causes heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Homosexuality was once thought to be the result of troubled family dynamics or faulty psychological development. Those assumptions are now understood to have been based on misinformation and prejudice. Currently there is a renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality. Similarly, no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse. Sexual abuse does not appear to be more prevalent in<br>children who grow up to identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, than in children who identify as heterosexual.</span><br><br><strong>What is Â“Coming OutÂ”?</strong><br>Â“Coming outÂ” is the term used to describe the experience in which a person identifies himself or herself as gay, lesbian or bisexual. Coming out is not a one-time event, but a lifelong process of identifying as gay, lesbian or bisexual to family friends and other significant members of oneÂ’s social world. Each personÂ’s experience in coming out is unique and the process always stimulates anxiety as well as provides challenging possibilities for personal empowerment and emotional growth. There are many resources available to people coming out. See below for some of these resources.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Does Stigma Still Exist About Homosexuality?</strong><br>Yes. Fears and misunderstandings about homosexuality are wide spread. They present daunting challenges to the development and maintenance of a positive self-image in gay, lesbian and bisexual persons and often to their families as well. Â“HomophobiaÂ” is a term that refers to the irrational fear and prejudice against homosexual persons. Public opinion polls in the United States show that in the past twenty years, feelings toward gay men, lesbians and bisexuals have moved in a significantly positive direction. Nevertheless, when compared to other social groups homosexuals are still among the most stigmatized groups in the nation. Hate crimes are prevalent. Gay men and lesbians are still banned from serving openly in the US military service. Child custody decisions still frequently view gay and lesbian people as unfit parents. Gay and lesbian adolescents are often taunted and humiliated in their school settings. Many professional persons and employees in all occupations are still fearful of identifying as gay or lesbians in their work settings. Gay relationships are not widely recognized in any legal way.<br><br><strong>What Position Has the American Psychiatric Association Taken Regarding This Stigma?</strong><br>In 1992, the American Psychiatric Association, recognizing the power of the stigma against homosexuality, issued the following statement:<br>Â“Whereas homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgement, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, the American Psychiatric Association calls on all international health organizations and individual psychiatrists in other countries, to urge the repeal in their own country of legislation that penalized homosexual acts by consenting adults in private. And further the APA calls on these organizations and individuals to do all that is possible to decrease the stigma related to homosexuality wherever and whenever it may occur.Â”<br>Such organizational recognition of homophobia has been important in changing attitudes about homosexuality.<br><br><strong>Is It Possible To Change OneÂ’s Sexual Orientation (Â“Reparative TherapyÂ”)?</strong><br>There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Â“reparative therapyÂ” as a treatment to change oneÂ’s sexual orientation, nor is it included in the APAÂ’s Task Force Report, Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders. More importantly, altering sexual orientation is not an appropriate goal of psychiatric treatment. Some may seek conversion to heterosexuality because of the difficulties that they encounter as a member of a stigmatized group. Clinical experience indicates that those who have integrated their sexual orientation into a positive sense of self-function at a healthier psychological level than those who have not. Â“Gay affirmative psychotherapyÂ” may be helpful in the coming out process, fostering a positive psychological development and overcoming the effects of stigmatization. A position statement adopted by the Board in December 1998 said:<br><br>The American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as Â“reparativeÂ” or Â“conversionÂ” therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder, or based upon a prior assumption that the patient should change his/ her homosexual orientation.Â”<br><br><strong>What Do the Parents of Gay Men/Lesbian/Bisexuals experience?</strong><br>When a person Â“comes out Â“ to their parents, it can be a very emotionally trying experience for all involved. Most parents are concerned for the welfare of their children, recognizing the difficulties posed by being a member of a stigmatized group. Often parents also fear rejection by their own family, friends, religious, or social groups. Fortunately, support exists for parents who are struggling to come to terms with their childÂ’s homosexuality. PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) is an organization comprised of the families of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals that provides information and assistance to parents and families. Family or individual psychotherapy can be very helpful in dealing with questions and concerns about a gay child.<br><br><strong>How Do the Children of Gay/Lesbians Parents Fare?</strong><br>Many gay men and women are parents. For example, estimates of the numbers of lesbian mothers range from 1 to 5 million and with the number of children ranging from 6 to 14 million. Most gay parents conceived their children in prior heterosexual marriages. Recently an increasing number of gay parents have conceived children and raised them from birth either as single parents or in committed relationships. Often this is done through alternative insemination, adoption or through foster parenting. Numerous studies have shown that the children of gay parents are as likely to be healthy and well adjusted as children raised in heterosexual households. Children raised in gay or lesbian households do not show any greater incidence of homosexuality or gender identity issues than other children. Children raised in nontraditional homes with gay/lesbian parents can encounter some special challenges related to the ongoing stigma against homosexuality, but most children surmount these problems.<br></div>
