There are many males who want to have SRS even though they are sexually attracted to females. The problem I feel is that there are some men who are actually gay and not transgender, but they get confused about that and think they are TG, which results in them going thru SRS when they are not absolutely sure that is what they want. SRS is a serious option that shouldn't be undertaken lightly, but instead of discouragement, what should be done is to ensure that a person seeking SRS is absolutely sure he or she wants it. In any case, John Hopkins is not the best place or only place to get SRS. There are many other places that are better place to offer SRS and their opinion are just one small drop in a sea of opposite opinions.<br><br>Im curious actually. I get the feeling u, honeybunz would really just want the whole world to conform to your views based on your religion to prove yourself right?</div>

I do not wish to comment cause I have not done too much research in this area.. Maybe others might want to give it a try..<br><br>3) However, thanks for citing another credible source that human sexuality is determined by 1) Genetics and 2) Embryogenesis.. Both factors belong to the "nature" camp! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Which coincide with all other scientific research to date..</div>

Experts Call That a Prescription for Harm<br><br>By Sandra G. Boodman<br>Washington Post Staff Writer<br>Tuesday, August 16, 2005; HE01<br><br>Nicholas Cavnar said he tried everything he could think of in his 30-<br>year quest to become heterosexual. He spent years in therapy, paying<br>thousands of dollars for treatment designed to overcome his<br>homosexuality. He faithfully attended meetings of Christian self-help<br>groups for "strugglers." He married and fathered three children, a<br>metamorphosis featured on the cover of a Catholic magazine.<br><br>Yet every day, the 54-year-old Washington publishing executive<br>recalled, he had to suppress his deepest feelings about who he really<br>was -- emotions he thought he had left behind at 20 when, to the<br>delight of his devout family, he abruptly renounced his openly gay<br>life in San Francisco.<br><br>Three years ago, Cavnar said, after soul-searching prompted by the<br>Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he decided his days of "white-knuckling<br>it" were over. "I told my wife I couldn't not be gay anymore,"<br>recalled Cavnar. His biggest regret, he said, was the devastating<br>impact ending their 26-year marriage had on the woman who had<br>struggled with him.<br><br>Cavnar's odyssey -- from gay to ex-gay to ex-ex-gay -- is<br>inextricably linked to his long involvement in reparative therapy, a<br>controversial form of psychotherapy aimed at making gays straight.<br><br>While its supporters cite success stories from their clinical<br>practices as well as a recent and much debated study showing that<br>conversion therapy can work, the treatment is opposed by virtually<br>every medical and mental health organization, including the American<br>Medical Association, the U.S. Surgeon General and the American<br>Psychiatric Association (APA), which removed homosexuality from its<br>list of mental disorders in 1973.<br><br>Until the early 1990s the treatment, also known as reorientation<br>therapy, was largely relegated to religious groups or to the fringes<br>of mental health. Mainstream therapists have been taught to help<br>patients distressed about their homosexuality work toward self-<br>acceptance, to overcome the internalized homophobia thought to be the<br>cause of much emotional turmoil.<br><br>Reparative therapists reject the views held by an overwhelming<br>majority of mental health practitioners. They regard homosexuality as<br>a pathological preference forged in the crucible of a troubled<br>childhood and not, as most scientists believe, an inborn orientation<br>significantly influenced by biological factors such as genetics and<br>exposure to hormones in the womb.<br><br>"I don't think sexual orientation is genetically determined, but like<br>a lot of preferences we have in life is a complicated and<br>idiosyncratic mix of temperament and experience," said Warren<br>Throckmorton, a supporter of reparative therapy who is an associate<br>professor of psychology at Grove City College in Pennsylvania and<br>former president of the American Mental Health Counselors<br>Association. "The other reason I think change is possible is that<br>I've worked with a lot of clients who've done it."<br><br>In the past decade, the growing influence of religious conservatives<br>and the national debate over gay rights, especially gay marriage, has<br>revived interest in the therapy, significantly raising its public<br>profile, spawning new practitioners and igniting debate about a<br>matter that had been considered settled, supporters and critics agree.<br><br>"Reparative therapy is the laetrile of mental health," said New York<br>psychiatrist Jack Drescher, referring to the quack cancer cure banned<br>in the United States in the 1970s.<br><br>To gay rights activist Wayne R. Besen, the author of "Anything But<br>Straight," a 2003 book that tracks the history of ex-gay groups, the<br>therapy is "a kinder, gentler form of homophobia. The argument has<br>shifted from 'You're harming society' to 'You're harming<br>yourselves.' "<br></div>

Central to the dispute was<br>the way homosexuality would be taught.<br><br>As a result of a lawsuit, PFOX has won a seat on the board that will<br>help rewrite the health curriculum, and its officials say they plan<br>to push for inclusion of reparative therapy.<br><br>Reparative therapists have their own organization, the 1,000-member<br>California-based National Association for Research and Therapy of<br>Homosexuality (NARTH), founded in 1992. Its leaders often appear<br>at "Love Won Out" workshops that draw more than 1,000 participants<br>and are sponsored by Focus on the Family, a group founded by<br>conservative psychologist James Dobson, a staunch opponent of gay<br>rights who has ties to the Bush administration.<br><br>Mental health experts are alarmed by the resurgence of a treatment<br>they say has been discredited.<br><br>In the view of Drescher, chair of the APA's committee on gay, lesbian<br>and bisexual issues, reparative therapy's ascendance resembles the<br>resurrection of creationism, a religious belief at odds with science<br>that has been rechristened with the more scientific-sounding<br>name "intelligent design."<br><br>"Many people who try this treatment tend to be desperate, very<br>unhappy and don't know other gay people," said Drescher, who has<br>treated about a dozen men who previously underwent conversion<br>therapy. (Men are far more likely than women to receive the<br>treatment.)<br><br>"I see people who've been very hurt by this," said Drescher, who said<br>some people do manage to temporarily change their behavior, often by<br>becoming celibate, but not their sexual orientation. "They spend<br>years trying to change and are told they aren't trying hard enough."<br><br>Catherine Wulfensmith, 46, a family therapist in Monrovia, Calif.,<br>said she attempted suicide several times after reparative therapy<br>failed to alter her attraction to women. "I bought it hook, line and<br>sinker," she said. "If you don't change, what are you left with?"<br><br>The 'Fix'<br><br>Reparative therapy typically involves once- or twice-weekly<br>psychotherapy sessions lasting a minimum of two years; it may be<br>covered by insurance if it is listed as being for a "sexual disorder<br>not otherwise specified." Patients are encouraged to delve into their<br>childhood relationships, especially with the same-sex parent; to<br>cultivate straight friends and "gender-appropriate" activities such<br>as sports or sewing; and to avoid anything, or anyone, gay. Prayer is<br>often recommended.<br><br>NARTH co-founder Joseph Nicolosi, a clinical psychologist in Encino,<br>Calif., who coined the term reparative therapy and is one of its<br>leading practitioners, emphatically rejects the view that it is<br>ineffective and potentially damaging. He points to a study published<br>in 2003 by Columbia University psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer which<br>found that therapy seemed to work for some highly motivated patients.<br><br>"It can only be damaging if the agenda of the therapist supersedes<br>that of the patient," said Nicolosi, who added that it should never<br>be forced on unwilling participants.<br><br>Although no rigorous outcome studies have been published, Nicolosi<br>estimates that one-third of patients treated at the Thomas Aquinas<br>Psychological Clinic, of which he is founding director,<br>experience "significant improvement -- they understand their<br>homosexuality and have some sense of control" but may still have gay<br>sex. Another third, he said, are "cured": They don't have gay sex and<br>the intensity and frequency of their same-sex desires is diminished,<br>but not necessarily gone. The other third fail to change.<br><br>Hector Roybal, a 52-year-old financial consultant in Los Angeles,<br>spent four years in intensive treatment with Nicolosi, who considers<br>him to be cured. Roybal concurs, but said he still sometimes<br>struggles with sexual feelings for men, although he has remained<br>faithful to his wife, the only woman to whom he says he feels<br>physically attracted.<br><br>"I saw myself as someone who had a problem with homosexuality but was<br>meant to be straight," said Roybal, who, like Nicolosi, is a<br>conservative Catholic. "This is about making a choice."<br><br>Although reparative therapists sometimes differ about the causes of<br>homosexuality, they are united in saying it is not inborn and it is<br>never normal.<br><br>Nicolosi maintains it is the result of a defective bond with the same-<br>sex parent. Boys who feel rejected by their fathers develop<br>a "defensive detachment" -- they reject them and identify with their<br>mothers and other females. Because opposites attract, he theorizes,<br>they are sexually drawn to men, even though what they are searching<br>for is their lost masculinity. Once they find it, he said, their<br>attraction to women will follow, although lifetime vigilance is<br>required to avoid slipping.<br><br>Even though reparative therapists say they support "free choice,"<br>they see nothing contradictory in their view that homosexuality is<br>pathological. Nor do they regard as incongruent their refusal to work<br>with a straight or bisexual client who thinks he or she might be gay.<br>In their view, homosexuals are doomed to miserable, unhealthy lives.<br><br>"We say to patients, 'Your true self is heterosexual,' " Nicolosi<br>said. He said he tells male patients, "Look at your body: It was<br>designed to fit a woman, not a man."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Study<br><br>Robert Spitzer sounds weary when discussing the study published two<br>years ago in the Archives of Sexual Behavior that earned him the<br>enmity of many of his colleagues and the admiration of reparative<br>therapists.<br><br>Spitzer's study has special resonance: In 1973 he was the driving<br>force behind the removal of homosexuality from psychiatry's<br>diagnostic manual.<br><br>Thirty years later, he said, he decided to test the widespread<br>hypothesis that reparative therapy never worked. "I like to challenge<br>conventional notions," he explained.<br><br>Despite the active cooperation of NARTH and ex-gay religious groups,<br>Spitzer said it took him more than 16 months to recruit 200 people<br>who had undergone treatment. He conducted 45-minute telephone<br>interviews and found that 66 percent of 143 men and 44 percent of 57<br>women, all of whom Spitzer described as "highly motivated" and almost<br>all of whom were "extraordinarily religious," had achieved "good<br>heterosexual function" lasting at least five years. They were in a<br>committed relationship, had satisfying heterosexual sex at least<br>monthly and said they were rarely or never bothered by homosexual<br>feelings.<br><br>In an accompanying commentary, former APA president Lawrence<br>Hartmann, a professor at Harvard Medical School, called Spitzer's<br>study "too flawed to publish." Hartmann noted the study was<br>retrospective, that it lacked controls or independent measurements,<br>and was based entirely on self-reports by people who were motivated<br>to say they had changed because of their affiliation with ex-gay or<br>anti-gay groups.<br><br>While Nicolosi and others frequently cite the study as proof<br>reparative therapy works, Spitzer said his results have been<br>misrepresented. "It bothers me to be their knight in shining armor<br>because on every social issue I totally disagree with the Christian<br>right," he said.<br><br>"What they don't mention is that change is pretty rare," he added,<br>noting that the subjects of his study were not representative of the<br>general population because they were considerably more religious.<br><br>And Spitzer calls "totally absurd" the twin hypotheses that everyone<br>is born straight and that homosexuality is a choice.<br><br>Drescher agrees. "There are probably a small number of people with<br>some flexibility in their sexual identity who can change," he<br>said. "Out of the hundreds of gay men I've treated, I've had one." Â·<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">What I hope to highlight is this paragraph: </span><br>Although no rigorous outcome studies have been published, Nicolosi<br>estimates that one-third of patients treated at the Thomas Aquinas<br>Psychological Clinic, of which he is founding director,<br>experience "significant improvement -- they understand their<br>homosexuality and have some sense of control" but may still have gay<br>sex. Another third, he said, are "cured": They don't have gay sex and<br>the intensity and frequency of their same-sex desires is diminished,<br>but not necessarily gone. The other third fail to change.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Even for someone who had huge beliefs in reparative studies. He can have only:<br><br>1) 33.3% totally unchanged<br>2) 33.3% "significant improvement but still have gay sex" I find this statement hilarious. It's an oxymoron.<br>3) 33.3% diminishes in same-sex desires. Err, due to the fall in sex drive as one ages? We all know that 25 year-old is the peak in sex drive when testesterone level is the highest. But then, these people do not change in the gender category in which they feel attracted to. So is this a real change? Can you change from sexually aroused by one gender to the other? NO! </span></div>

Right to Treatment</span><br>NARTH respects each client's dignity, autonomy and free agency.<br>We believe that clients have the right to claim a gay identity, or to diminish their homosexuality and to develop their heterosexual potential.<br><br>The right to seek therapy to change one's sexual adaptation should be considered self-evident and inalienable.<br><br>We call on our fellow mental-health association to stop falsely claiming to have "scientific knowledge" that settles the issue of homosexuality. Instead, our mental-health associations must leave room for diverse understandings of the family, of core human identity, and the meaning and purpose of human sexuality.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Gay Advocacy in Public Schools</span><br>When schools offer information on sexual orientation, the facts should be presented in a fair and balanced manner.<br>Groups such as the American Psychological Association currently recommend that schools censor all "ex-gay" materials, and prohibit discussion about those who have chosen to change their orientation. Respect for diversity, however, requires teaching about all principled positions. We live in a multi-cultural society where tolerance for differences is essential.<br><br>And when homosexuality is discussed, it must not cross the line into lifestyle advocacy. Ultimately, sexual lifestyle decisions hinge on matters of deeply held values. Schools should respect the right of families to convey their own social values to their children.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Pedophilia</span><br>Early sexual experiences with an older, same-sex person are commonly reported by our homosexual clients. And some studies do suggest that such experiences may be more common among homosexuals than heterosexuals; in proportion to their numbers, that is, homosexuals may be more likely to sexually abuse a same-sex minor.<br>However, the data remains inconclusive for several reasons.<br><br>Studies have not always been able to determine the sexual orientation of the same-sex molester (was he a heterosexual man crossing over into same-sex behavior? a bisexual? or a homosexual?) Also, clinical reports suggest that a very substantial proportion of homosexual molestation is not reported to adults or legal authorities because the child was ashamed, fearful or considered the same-sex contact with an older person to have been "consensual."<br><br>For these and other reasons, it is difficult to come to a conclusive answer on the basis of the evidence now available.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Homophobia</span><br>The term "homophobia" is often used inaccurately to describe any person who objects to homosexual behavior on either moral, psychological or medical grounds. Technically, however, the terms actually denotes a person who has a phobia--or irrational fear--of homosexuality. Principled disagreement, therefore, cannot be labeled "homophobia."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Same-Sex Marriage</span><br>Social science evidence supports the traditional model of man-woman marriage as the ideal family form for fostering a child's healthy development.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. On the Meaning of Tolerance and Diversity</span><br>"Tolerance and diversity" means nothing if it is extended to activists and not traditionalists on the homosexual issue.<br>Tolerance must also be extended to those people who take the principled, scientifically supportable view that homosexuality works against our human nature.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. On the Causes of Homosexuality</span><br>NARTH agrees with the American Psychological Association that "biological, psychological and social factors" shape sexual identity at an early age for most people.<br>But the difference is one of emphasis. We place more emphasis on the psychological (family, peer and social) influences, while the American Psychological Association emphasizes biological influences--and has shown no interest in (indeed, a hostility toward) investigating those same psychological and social influences.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="large"><strong>There is no such thing as a "gay gene" and there is no evidence to support the idea that homosexuality is genetic or unchangeable.</strong></span></span><br><br>Numerous examples exist of people who have successfully modified their sexual behavior, identity, and arousal or fantasies.<br><br>---------------------------------<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>The above msg should be authoritative &amp; scientific explanation on issue of homosexuality.</div>

Experts Call That a Prescription for Harm<br><br>By Sandra G. Boodman<br>Washington Post Staff Writer<br>Tuesday, August 16, 2005; HE01<br><br>Nicholas Cavnar said he tried everything he could think of in his 30-<br>year quest to become heterosexual. He spent years in therapy, paying<br>thousands of dollars for treatment designed to overcome his<br>homosexuality. He faithfully attended meetings of Christian self-help<br>groups for "strugglers." He married and fathered three children, a<br>metamorphosis featured on the cover of a Catholic magazine.<br><br>Yet every day, the 54-year-old Washington publishing executive<br>recalled, he had to suppress his deepest feelings about who he really<br>was -- emotions he thought he had left behind at 20 when, to the<br>delight of his devout family, he abruptly renounced his openly gay<br>life in San Francisco.<br><br>Three years ago, Cavnar said, after soul-searching prompted by the<br>Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he decided his days of "white-knuckling<br>it" were over. "I told my wife I couldn't not be gay anymore,"<br>recalled Cavnar. His biggest regret, he said, was the devastating<br>impact ending their 26-year marriage had on the woman who had<br>struggled with him.<br><br>Cavnar's odyssey -- from gay to ex-gay to ex-ex-gay -- is<br>inextricably linked to his long involvement in reparative therapy, a<br>controversial form of psychotherapy aimed at making gays straight.<br><br>While its supporters cite success stories from their clinical<br>practices as well as a recent and much debated study showing that<br>conversion therapy can work, the treatment is opposed by virtually<br>every medical and mental health organization, including the American<br>Medical Association, the U.S. Surgeon General and the American<br>Psychiatric Association (APA), which removed homosexuality from its<br>list of mental disorders in 1973.<br><br>Until the early 1990s the treatment, also known as reorientation<br>therapy, was largely relegated to religious groups or to the fringes<br>of mental health. Mainstream therapists have been taught to help<br>patients distressed about their homosexuality work toward self-<br>acceptance, to overcome the internalized homophobia thought to be the<br>cause of much emotional turmoil.<br><br>Reparative therapists reject the views held by an overwhelming<br>majority of mental health practitioners. They regard homosexuality as<br>a pathological preference forged in the crucible of a troubled<br>childhood and not, as most scientists believe, an inborn orientation<br>significantly influenced by biological factors such as genetics and<br>exposure to hormones in the womb.<br><br>"I don't think sexual orientation is genetically determined, but like<br>a lot of preferences we have in life is a complicated and<br>idiosyncratic mix of temperament and experience," said Warren<br>Throckmorton, a supporter of reparative therapy who is an associate<br>professor of psychology at Grove City College in Pennsylvania and<br>former president of the American Mental Health Counselors<br>Association. "The other reason I think change is possible is that<br>I've worked with a lot of clients who've done it."<br><br>In the past decade, the growing influence of religious conservatives<br>and the national debate over gay rights, especially gay marriage, has<br>revived interest in the therapy, significantly raising its public<br>profile, spawning new practitioners and igniting debate about a<br>matter that had been considered settled, supporters and critics agree.<br><br>"Reparative therapy is the laetrile of mental health," said New York<br>psychiatrist Jack Drescher, referring to the quack cancer cure banned<br>in the United States in the 1970s.<br><br>To gay rights activist Wayne R. Besen, the author of "Anything But<br>Straight," a 2003 book that tracks the history of ex-gay groups, the<br>therapy is "a kinder, gentler form of homophobia. The argument has<br>shifted from 'You're harming society' to 'You're harming<br>yourselves.' "<br></div></blockquote></div>

(Men are far more likely than women to receive the<br>treatment.)<br><br>"I see people who've been very hurt by this," said Drescher, who said<br>some people do manage to temporarily change their behavior, often by<br>becoming celibate, but not their sexual orientation. "They spend<br>years trying to change and are told they aren't trying hard enough."<br><br>Catherine Wulfensmith, 46, a family therapist in Monrovia, Calif.,<br>said she attempted suicide several times after reparative therapy<br>failed to alter her attraction to women.

Patients are encouraged to delve into their<br>childhood relationships, especially with the same-sex parent; to<br>cultivate straight friends and "gender-appropriate" activities such<br>as sports or sewing; and to avoid anything, or anyone, gay. Prayer is<br>often recommended.<br><br>NARTH co-founder Joseph Nicolosi, a clinical psychologist in Encino,<br>Calif., who coined the term reparative therapy and is one of its<br>leading practitioners, emphatically rejects the view that it is<br>ineffective and potentially damaging. He points to a study published<br>in 2003 by Columbia University psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer which<br>found that therapy seemed to work for some highly motivated patients.<br><br>"It can only be damaging if the agenda of the therapist supersedes<br>that of the patient," said Nicolosi, who added that it should never<br>be forced on unwilling participants.<br><br>Although no rigorous outcome studies have been published, Nicolosi<br>estimates that one-third of patients treated at the Thomas Aquinas<br>Psychological Clinic, of which he is founding director,<br>experience "significant improvement -- they understand their<br>homosexuality and have some sense of control" but may still have gay<br>sex. Another third, he said, are "cured": They don't have gay sex and<br>the intensity and frequency of their same-sex desires is diminished,<br>but not necessarily gone. The other third fail to change.<br><br>Hector Roybal, a 52-year-old financial consultant in Los Angeles,<br>spent four years in intensive treatment with Nicolosi, who considers<br>him to be cured. Roybal concurs, but said he still sometimes<br>struggles with sexual feelings for men, although he has remained<br>faithful to his wife, the only woman to whom he says he feels<br>physically attracted.<br><br>"I saw myself as someone who had a problem with homosexuality but was<br>meant to be straight," said Roybal, who, like Nicolosi, is a<br>conservative Catholic. "This is about making a choice."<br><br>Although reparative therapists sometimes differ about the causes of<br>homosexuality, they are united in saying it is not inborn and it is<br>never normal.<br><br>Nicolosi maintains it is the result of a defective bond with the same-<br>sex parent. Boys who feel rejected by their fathers develop<br>a "defensive detachment" -- they reject them and identify with their<br>mothers and other females. Because opposites attract, he theorizes,<br>they are sexually drawn to men, even though what they are searching<br>for is their lost masculinity. Once they find it, he said, their<br>attraction to women will follow, although lifetime vigilance is<br>required to avoid slipping.<br><br>Even though reparative therapists say they support "free choice,"<br>they see nothing contradictory in their view that homosexuality is<br>pathological. Nor do they regard as incongruent their refusal to work<br>with a straight or bisexual client who thinks he or she might be gay.<br>In their view, homosexuals are doomed to miserable, unhealthy lives.<br><br>"We say to patients, 'Your true self is heterosexual,' " Nicolosi<br>said. He said he tells male patients, "Look at your body: It was<br>designed to fit a woman, not a man."<br></div></blockquote></div>

"I like to challenge<br>conventional notions," he explained.<br><br>Despite the active cooperation of NARTH and ex-gay religious groups,<br>Spitzer said it took him more than 16 months to recruit 200 people<br>who had undergone treatment. He conducted 45-minute telephone<br>interviews and found that 66 percent of 143 men and 44 percent of 57<br>women, all of whom Spitzer described as "highly motivated" and almost<br>all of whom were "extraordinarily religious," had achieved "good<br>heterosexual function" lasting at least five years.

            <div class='col-md body'>More about NARTH, this time from the Religious Tolerance website:<br><br><a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_nart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_nart.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>Overview:<br>In the past, researchers attempted to change sexual orientation through psychotherapy, aversion therapy, nausea producing drugs, prayer, castration, electric shock, brain surgery, breast amputations, etc. All failed. These methods were largely abandoned by the mid-1970's. However, Outrage!, a British support group for lesbians and gays, recently found it necessary to ask the Royal College of Psychiatrists to renounce aversion therapy and instruct its members to halt "the use of all therapies that attempt to cure homosexuality." 1<br><br>Reparative Therapy emerged in the early 1980's as a new method of "curing" homosexuals. It was spearheaded by Elizabeth Moberly, a British, conservative Christian theologian. She based her theories on the findings of a few psychiatrists in the past whose conclusions had long been abandoned by almost all mental health professionals. Her belief is that homosexuality is caused by incompetence by the same-gender parent. Moberly determined...that the homosexual men in the studies were suffering from what she termed  'defensive detachment' and 'same sex ambivalence.' The theory presumes that the young boy, for any of a variety of reasons, did not bond with his father in a meaningful way." 2 Her book, published in the 1980s, has been recently reprinted and is still in print. 3 Her theory led to a treatment method in which a gay or lesbian develops a close but non-sexual relationship with a person of the same gender. This is expected to replace the close parental bond that was missing in childhood. According to her theory, heterosexual feelings would emerge during therapy, and homosexual feelings would fade over time. More details.<br><br><span style="color: red;">No peer-reviewed study has ever been published on reparative therapy. No longitudinal study has ever been conducted into its long-term effectiveness and hazards. Sufficient anecdotal evidence has surfaced to convince the large mental health professional societies, like the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, etc. to condemn reparative therapy as ineffective, and warn of potentially dangerous side-effects. 8 The one exception is the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) - the topic of this essay. They strongly advocate the use of reparative therapy, believing it to be very effective and safe.</span></blockquote>NARTH did not manage to produce any evidences that reparative therapy works. Never... On the contrary, large mental health professional societies did find the harmfulness of such efforts to dehumanise gays. In fact, NARTH acted almost like the only "pseudo"-psychological outfit that encourages the use of a therapy that's not endorsed by anyone else in the profession.<br><br>And remember, most reparative therapies are based on psychoanalytical theories, if ben's ard, could you kindly explain why such approaches are shunned by modern psychologists these days? (can be bothered to explain and it's better if this explanation comes from someone more neutral in this debate)<br><br></div>

These are believed to be psychiatrists, psychologists, other therapists, social workers, and behavioral scientists. 4,5 (This number represents a small percentage of mental health professionals; the American Psychological Association alone has over <span style="color: red;">132,000 members</span>.)

            <div class='col-md body'>NARTH used to collaborate with APsaA.. However, Socarides (NARTH president) misrepresent APsaA's position on gay issues (to spread further discrimination against homosexuals) to the point that he was asked to leave.. How credible can such an organisation be?<br><br><strong>NARTH/APsaA conflict:<br>The Human Rights Campaign reported in 1999 that NARTH President, Charles Socarides, had "run into trouble with the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), of which he is a member. According to a letter from Dr. Ralph Roughton of the APsaA, Socarides misrepresented the position of the APsaA in a published paper and a court affidavit. Socarides attempted to make it appear that the APsaA agrees with his positions on homosexuality. He did this by quoting an APsaA document written in 1968, which supported his views and which he called the 'official position' of the APsaA, while ignoring a 1990 revised statement that drastically contradicted his views. The Executive Committee of the APsaA instructed the organization's attorney to write a letter to Socarides asking him to cease this misrepresentation and threatening legal action if he continued. Additionally, the APsaA newsletter decided to stop printing advertisements for NARTH meetings because the organization does not adhere to APsaA's policy of non-discrimination 'and because their activities are demeaning to our members who are gay and lesbian,' according to Roughton." </strong><br><br></div>
