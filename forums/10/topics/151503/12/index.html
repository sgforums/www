            <div class='col-md body'><br>Heh, woke up and was supposed to be studying.<br><br>Anyways, much research has been poured into mental illnesses.  And research has shown that mental illnesses such as schizo, hyperactivity, autism etc do have a genetic component.  Though its much a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors that leads to their onset.<br><br>It doesn't link or debunk my views on homosexuality being more of a "nurture" factor since mental illnesses actually HAS genetic causes.  Because it HAS genetic causes, it can onset at any point in life given depending on what I suppose, external stimuli.<br><br>Homosexuality is not a mental illness as I believe.  I don't believe homosexuals to be mentally ill people.<br><br>That is exactly what I mean when i said, the "LACK" of sexual identity reinforcement, and sex education.  As kids are growing up, and as they hit puberty, all of the sudden, all those hormones are turned on.  If they have not been properly "educated," there are good chances that their sexual orientation might be confused.  Like you mentioned, when a kid suddenly feels aroused for the first time in his/her life, he's probably searching for answers to why it's happening.  Thats a problem with our asian families too I suppose... everybody's too shy to teach their kids.  So they just use the birds and the bees as excuse.<br><br>So finally during their puberty, when their sexual senses are being turned on, and without, or lack of adequate sexual identity reinforcement, as well as orientation guidance, they may get confused.<br><br>In today's world, its even more worrying as liberal western influence is permeating into our society.  The amount of western influence we pick up from the media, internet etc, is overwhelming.  Its really a challenge for kids to grow up today.<br><br>Society is slowly changing from discriminating against gays, to slowly accepting them.  And as time goes, people are slowly believing that homosexuals are indeed born homosexuals.  Hence, there is a even greater lack of sexual identity reinforcement and sexual orientation guidance.  People are slowly "resigning to fate" and not teaching their kids.  (That is of course, a worst case scenario)<br><br>Now why are siblings of the same sex, (Gay bros exampler)  more likely to be both homosexual?  Researchers are trying to prove that genetics hold the key to it.  Now, that is what I call looking for a complicated answer when a simple one is available.<br><br>Some of us who grew up with brothers can probably understand this better.  Being siblings, we are likely to do the same silly things as our siblings.  Being it setting fire to the carpet, or play the same silly games.  Brothers are just meant to be very close.  Siblings like to mimic each other too.  No surprise if one brother is accepted as a gay, chances are the other might become gay too.  To give a simple example, 1 brother brings back a copy of penthouse or playboy, next thing u know, both of them suscribes to them.  1 for playboy, 1 for penthouse!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>No offense.  But despite the articles on supposed research that was done to pinpoint homosexuality to "nature" than to nurture, I've not been convinced.  I try to look at it with an open mind, but it seems that in all the articles I've seen, i see nurture or lack of nurture to be the key culprit.<br><br>It appears that "nature" factors contribute much much more than nurture simply because a lot more research has gone into trying to prove that it is nature instead of nurture.<br><br>Why isn't there as much research into "nurture" one might ask?  To prove something scientifically, u keep everything else constant (in this case the subjects), u manipulate the variable to prove that the variable is the cause for a certain reaction.  Its its not possible to make such a research without actual human cloning.  Twins are in the end, not clones.  They are individually unique beings, despite sharing largely similar genetic make up.  Each individual's human mind works differently.<br><br>Finally, ppl tell me that some girls at an early age, just wish they were boys, and boys wish they were girls.  I've seen a fair share of those while growing up.  Some tell me its because they were actually meant to be boy/girls, but born with wrong set of "equipment."  Is that really true?  I don't believe so.  There can be a large variety of factors that causes this.  Perhaps for the case of a tomboy, her family may favor boys more... hence she wishes she was a boy... cos she wants to be loved more by the family.  Likewise for boys who wish they were girls?  Maybe at one point of time, an unpopular boy realises that girls get more attention from friends in school, hence he tries to be one.<br><br>There lots of factors that may affect a child's sexual identity and orientation, especially psychologically.  So much that we won't know exactly what stimuli causes what reaction since every human mind reacts differently.<br><br>It is almost ironic, that IF "nature" is indeed the cause of homosexuality, why is there so much research being poured into proving it?  Because it has been unproven, and hence not true (as yet).<br><br>Good arguements from you too earthling73.  Some of the articles you've shown me has further entrenched me in my belief that nurture plays the critical component when it comes to issues regarding homosexuality.   However, I accept that we are 2 different people, looking thru 2 differently tinted windows.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>saying that homosexuality is because of a lack of sexual reinforcement by society is just as conclusive as saying that it is a result of genetic factors.They're both unproven.<br><br>Its does sound reasonable that a lack of sexual reinforcement might lead to a confusion of sexual orientation. But lets analyse this on a different point of view, say sexual reinforcement were very much part and parcel of life during the 60s,by you reasoning then, there should be little or no homosexuals then.How would you explain then the sudden appearance of closeted individuals during the marches of the gay rights movement (Stonewall) ? People didnt suddenly become gay, gay people suddenly came out.<br><br>Another question would be how does a person reinforce sexuality? The very action of reinforcing sexuality would be on the basis that a only a certain sexuality is correct, hence someone would reinforce that sexual orientation.On its  seemingly reasonable exterior, its seems that it conceals a deeply rooted idea that homosexuality is wrong.And we all know that whether something is wrong or right is clearly specific to the individual.<br><br>Another point to raise would be the acceptance of homosexuals by society, you state that accepting homosexuals would lead to more people becoming homosexual.Frankly, i don't see the link, homosexuality is still very much condemned in society although tolerated to a certain extent, homosexuals in the mass media are object of ridicule and the umbrella term of gay has an extremely negative connotation to is, it is often also used to describe stupid actions.<br><br>Becoming a homosexual is still very much undesirable than becoming a heterosexual.Thats means to say that there is already a certain form of sexual repression, then why then are there homosexuals?<br><br>It might be something innate, or something nutured. Most probably it is a combination of the two. The blurring of sexual roles ,not the lack of sexual orientation reinforecent, might help facillitate feminism and more effeminate males, but i do not believe it is the single cause of homosexuality.<br><br>thanks for tolerating my long post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Homosexuality is not a mental illness, it's a mental/psychological diversity. Other examples include hypertension (onset of 30+ but with a high biological factor) which is a physical ailment and left-handedness (one will discover whether one's left-handed or not when he starts to use cutlery, or pen) which is a physical diversity (used to be seen as an anomaly in medieval Europe). My argument is simply: The convention wisdom of "homosexuality not observed upon birth and hence must be due to nurture" has its flaws. But I am not arguing that it's totally biological too. I will return to this point later.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">So finally during their puberty, when their sexual senses are being turned on, and without, or lack of adequate sexual identity reinforcement, as well as orientation guidance, they may get confused.<br><br>In today's world, its even more worrying as liberal western influence is permeating into our society.

People are slowly "resigning to fate" and not teaching their kids.  (That is of course, a worst case scenario)<br></div></blockquote><strong>2) Parents' influence</strong><br>This is a deviance from the traditional argument of "weak father and dominant mother" position. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Again, kids are brought up in a heterosexual environment, with very minimal exposure to sexual information. Gay content are almost fully censored from the media. If this hypothesis is true, where do kids learn homosexuality from? A kid will start to mature around the age of 10. And at this age, they have very little knowledge of sex. However, there is a development in their body and mind allow them to experience sexual arousal. It's true this sexual arousal that they will know who they like, what they like.<br><br>Hence, if homosexual attractions appeared late in life (let's say around 20) when people understand what homosexuality is all about before they decide to be gay, you argument might stand. However, this is hardly the case.<br><br>Moreover, sexual arousal comes naturally without the need for parents to teach the kids what the arousal is all about. Just remember the first time you had an arousal, did it come naturally or is it a conscious decision to feel aroused?<br><br><strong>3) Societal influence</strong><br>As for societal influence, it might impact on whether there are more gays who are willing to lead an openly gay life or pretend to be straight and get married. The reason again being that kids before puberty do not get exposure to gay content or role model.<br><br>A more relevant question might then be: Should gays try to lead a straight's life? This is something which I can't stand simply because there will be deceit in such marriages. And it usually ends up in failure because there's no sexual attraction to begin with. And if you look at the MOH data I've highlighted earlier, the category "bisexual" might refer to these people. Married on the surface to please the society but still fool ard with other men to satisfy their sexual needs.<br></div>

If you read the ending, you will realise that the seemingly "gay" brother became less "gayish" even though the mother was rather open-minded and allow both brothers to do what they want. If just serves to remind us that sometimes, when someone appears to be gay, he might not in fact be gay (a point which I tried to articulate earlier). Furthermore, until the brothers enter puberty, the mother will not know whether her seemingly "gay" son is in fact gay or not.<br><br>What is more important to take note is the studies they had summarised in this article. Such studies were the impetus to help the society accept gays. If such issues are not resolved through well-constructed studies, there will be no basis for the anti-gays sentiments to continue. If I have time, I will do a summary of these articles. However, let's just look at the twin studies for the time being.<br><br><strong>5) Twin studies</strong><br>Even when everything else is kept constant (same environment), it is twice more likely for identical twins (who share 100% of genes) to share similar orientation than for fracternal twins (who share 50% of the genes). Since each pair of these twins grew up in the same social environment, the only difference between identical twins and fracternal twins is the difference in terms of the % of genes they share.<br><br>A pure environmental theory will not be able to explain the above observation. Another study done in Italy last year found that aunties of gays have a tendency to give more offsprings and hence, might be the mechanism in which the gay genes (not a single gay gene but a composite of genes) were passed down through the generations. Again, in that study, they managed to find at least 20% (this is one of the lower estimation) were contributed by genetic factors (there are other biological factors which were not studied in that experiment). All in all, even though we still do not know how much is contributed by "nature", a statement like "gays are made, it's a choice" has little support.<br><br></div>

But most of the studies were obsolete (mostly from 60s-80s) and poorly replicated. All these studies were based, most likely from the psychoanalysis tradition. If you do a search of these articles, you should be able to find many online.<br><br>There are some problems with the psychoanalysis tradition since:<br><br>a. It has been downgraded as pseudo-science as modern psychology continue to develop. And especially problematic is the inability to test the theories predicted by psychoanalytic tradition.<br><br>b. There's no well constructed framework to explain the environment factors.<br><br>c. It's descriptive more than presciptive. You cannot predict whether someone will definitely become gay if you observe a distant father and a dorminant mother.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Finally, ppl tell me that some girls at an early age, just wish they were boys, and boys wish they were girls.

Homosexuality describes the sexual orientation. Transgenders describes those whose mental gender differ from physical gender. I'm not an expert in this, maybe Jenn can provide more info on this.<br><br>Cross-dressing (tranvetitite) is another phenomenum that people might confuse with transexuality or transgender. They might be straight men who will get sexual arousal by cross-dressing. But they might not necessarily be gay or transgender.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dressing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dressing</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Good arguements from you too earthling73.

I would in fact encourage you to search for those environmental studies (less religious ones) for a discussion.. At the end of the day, I don't think we will be able to have a clarity in this issue since the research in this area has been inconclusive anyway.. But then, it's good to know arguments from both camps.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Massachusetts is one of the earliest state in US to permit gay marriages..<br><br><strong>The normality of gay marriages<br>New York Times<br>Editorial<br>September 17, 2005</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/17/opinion/20sat2.html" rel="nofollow">www.nytimes.com/2005/09/17/opinion/20sat2.html</a><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">There's nothing like a touch of real-world experience to inject some reason into the inflammatory national debate over gay marriages. Take Massachusetts, where the state's highest court held in late 2003 that under the State Constitution, same-sex couples have a right to marry. The State Legislature moved to undo that decision last year by approving a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages and create civil unions as an alternative. But this year, when precisely the same measure came up for a required second vote, it was defeated by a thumping margin of 157 to 39.<br><br>The main reason for the flip-flop is that some 6,600 same-sex couples have married over the past year with nary a sign of adverse effects. The sanctity of heterosexual marriages has not been destroyed. Public morals have not gone into a tailspin. Legislators who supported gay marriage in last year's vote have been re-elected. Gay couples, many of whom had been living together monogamously for years, have rejoiced at official recognition of their commitment.<br><br>As a Republican leader explained in justifying his vote switch: "Gay marriage has begun, and life has not changed for the citizens of the commonwealth, with the exception of those who can now marry who could not before." A Democrat attributed his change of heart to the beneficial effects he saw "when I looked in the eyes of the children living with these couples." Gay marriage, it turned out, is good for family values.<br><br>Some legislators who strongly oppose gay marriages also switched their votes this year for tactical reasons. They realized that the original measure was headed for defeat, and they had never really liked the part that created civil unions anyway. They are now pinning their hopes on an even harsher proposal, endorsed by Gov. Mitt Romney, that would ban gay marriages without allowing civil unions.<br><br>We can only hope that this new appeal to fear and bigotry will stumble over the reality, already apparent, that gay marriage is no threat to the larger community. States that rushed to ban same-sex marriages after the Massachusetts court ruling were succumbing to misplaced hysteria.</span></div>
