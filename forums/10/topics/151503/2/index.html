            <div class='col-md body'>Johns Hopkins Psychiatrist Urges<br>End To Sexual Reassignment Surgery<br><br>December 2, 2004 - Dr. Paul McHugh, University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, urges that psychiatrists put an end to sexual reassignment surgery (SRS) for individuals with gender identity confusion.<br>McHugh's remarks were published in the November, 2004, issue of First Things. Writing in "Surgical Sex," the professor notes that Johns Hopkins University was a pioneer in SRS beginning in the early 1970s. The prevailing theory at the time was that while sex was genetically determined at birth, the concept of gender was culturally shaped and malleable and that being female or male were interchangeable.<br><br>Dr. McHugh became psychiatrist-in-chief at the university in 1975 and decided that it would be useful to have follow-up studies on individuals who had undergone SRS at the facility. He wanted to test the claim that men who had undergone SRS had found a resolution for their general psychological problems and wanted to see if male infants with ambiguous genitalia who were raised as girls could easily settle into the female identity chosen for them by the surgeons.<br><br>To accomplish these two goals, he encouraged a fellow psychiatrist, Jon Meyer, to follow up on those having sex change operations. He found that most of the patients were content and only a few regretted it, but their psychological condition was little changed.<br><br>A study of similar subjects at Clark Institute in Toronto had found that many of these men described themselves as lesbians to psychiatrists because they were sexually attracted to women. "... I concluded that to provide a surgical alteration to the body of these unfortunate people was to collaborate with a mental disorder rather than to treat it," said McHugh.<br><br>Another psychiatrist, William G. Reiner, conducted follow-up studies on boys who were raised as girls. Reiner found that these re-engineered males were almost universally uncomfortable with the female role assigned them and many wished to revert to male status once they discovered the truth about themselves. Reiner's findings were published in the January 22, 2004 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.<br><br>Dr. McHugh says that his research led Johns Hopkins to stop offering SRS for its patients, "... much, I'm glad to say, to the relief of several of our plastic surgeons who had previously been commandeered to carry out the procedures." He observes: "Having looked at the Reiner and Meyer studies, we in the Johns Hopkins Psychiatry Department eventually concluded that human sexual identity is mostly built into our constitution by the genes we inherit and the embryogenesis we undergo."<br><br>McHugh says "I have witnessed a great deal of damage from sex-reassignment. The children transformed from their male constitution into female roles suffered prolonged distress and misery as they sensed their natural attitudes. ... We have wasted scientific and technical resources and damaged our professional credibility by collaborating with madness rather than trying to study, cure, and ultimately prevent it."<br><br>He urges that psychiatrists discourage individuals from seeking sexual reassignment surgery.<br><br></div>

Right to Treatment</span><br>NARTH respects each client's dignity, autonomy and free agency.<br>We believe that clients have the right to claim a gay identity, or to diminish their homosexuality and to develop their heterosexual potential.<br><br>The right to seek therapy to change one's sexual adaptation should be considered self-evident and inalienable.<br><br>We call on our fellow mental-health association to stop falsely claiming to have "scientific knowledge" that settles the issue of homosexuality. Instead, our mental-health associations must leave room for diverse understandings of the family, of core human identity, and the meaning and purpose of human sexuality.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Gay Advocacy in Public Schools</span><br>When schools offer information on sexual orientation, the facts should be presented in a fair and balanced manner.<br>Groups such as the American Psychological Association currently recommend that schools censor all "ex-gay" materials, and prohibit discussion about those who have chosen to change their orientation. Respect for diversity, however, requires teaching about all principled positions. We live in a multi-cultural society where tolerance for differences is essential.<br><br>And when homosexuality is discussed, it must not cross the line into lifestyle advocacy. Ultimately, sexual lifestyle decisions hinge on matters of deeply held values. Schools should respect the right of families to convey their own social values to their children.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Pedophilia</span><br>Early sexual experiences with an older, same-sex person are commonly reported by our homosexual clients. And some studies do suggest that such experiences may be more common among homosexuals than heterosexuals; in proportion to their numbers, that is, homosexuals may be more likely to sexually abuse a same-sex minor.<br>However, the data remains inconclusive for several reasons.<br><br>Studies have not always been able to determine the sexual orientation of the same-sex molester (was he a heterosexual man crossing over into same-sex behavior? a bisexual? or a homosexual?) Also, clinical reports suggest that a very substantial proportion of homosexual molestation is not reported to adults or legal authorities because the child was ashamed, fearful or considered the same-sex contact with an older person to have been "consensual."<br><br>For these and other reasons, it is difficult to come to a conclusive answer on the basis of the evidence now available.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Homophobia</span><br>The term "homophobia" is often used inaccurately to describe any person who objects to homosexual behavior on either moral, psychological or medical grounds. Technically, however, the terms actually denotes a person who has a phobia--or irrational fear--of homosexuality. Principled disagreement, therefore, cannot be labeled "homophobia."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Same-Sex Marriage</span><br>Social science evidence supports the traditional model of man-woman marriage as the ideal family form for fostering a child's healthy development.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. On the Meaning of Tolerance and Diversity</span><br>"Tolerance and diversity" means nothing if it is extended to activists and not traditionalists on the homosexual issue.<br>Tolerance must also be extended to those people who take the principled, scientifically supportable view that homosexuality works against our human nature.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. On the Causes of Homosexuality</span><br>NARTH agrees with the American Psychological Association that "biological, psychological and social factors" shape sexual identity at an early age for most people.<br>But the difference is one of emphasis. We place more emphasis on the psychological (family, peer and social) influences, while the American Psychological Association emphasizes biological influences--and has shown no interest in (indeed, a hostility toward) investigating those same psychological and social influences.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="large"><strong>There is no such thing as a "gay gene" and there is no evidence to support the idea that homosexuality is genetic or unchangeable.</strong></span></span><br><br>Numerous examples exist of people who have successfully modified their sexual behavior, identity, and arousal or fantasies.<br><br>---------------------------------<br><br></div>
