            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Atobe:<br><strong><br><br>Honeybunz - you want an HONEST and STRAIGHT answer to your statement?<br><br>This was posted 14 September 2005 at 1:38 P.M. on Page 4 of this thread:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">[b]ORAL SEX</span></strong><br>Homosexuals fellate almost all of their sexual contacts (and ingest semen from about half of these). Semen contains many of the germs carried in the blood. <strong>Because of this, gays who practice oral sex verge on consuming raw human blood, with all its medical risks</strong>.<br><br><strong>Since the penis often has tiny lesions (and often will have been in unsanitary places such as a rectum), individuals so involved may become infected with hepatitis A or gonorrhea (and even HIV and hepatitis B). </strong><br><br>Since many contacts occur between strangers (70% of gays estimated that they had had sex only once with over half of their partners 17,27 ), and gays average somewhere between 106 and 1105 different partners/year, the potential for infection is considerable.<br><br><strong>RECTAL SEX</strong><br>Surveys indicate that about 90% of gays have engaged in rectal intercourse, and about two-thirds do it regularly. In a 6-month long study of daily sexual diaries,3 gays averaged 110 sex partners and 68 rectal encounters a year.<br><br>Rectal sex is dangerous. During rectal intercourse the rectum becomes a mixing bowl for 1) saliva and its germs and/or an artificial lubricant, 2) the recipient's own feces, 3) whatever germs, infections or substances the penis has on it, and 4) the seminal fluid of the inserter.<br><br><strong>Since sperm readily penetrate the rectal wall (which is only one cell thick) causing immunologic damage, and tearing or bruising of the anal wall is very common during anal/penile sex, these substances gain almost direct access to the blood stream.</strong><br><br>Unlike heterosexual intercourse (in which sperm cannot penetrate the multilayered vagina and no feces are present),7 rectal intercourse is probably the most sexually efficient way to spread hepatitis B, HIV syphilis and a host of other blood-borne diseases.<br><br>Tearing or ripping of the anal wall is especially likely with "fisting," where the hand and arm is inserted into the rectum. It is also common when "toys" are employed (homosexual lingo for objects which are inserted into the rectum--bottles, carrots, even gerbils 8 ).<br><br>The risk of contamination and/or having to wear a colostomy bag from such "sport" is very real. Fisting was apparently so rare in Kinsey's time that he didn't think to talk about it. By 1977, well over a third of gays admitted to doing it.<br><br>The rectum was not designed to accommodate the fist, and those who do so can find themselves consigned to diapers for life.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I agree with you, Atobe.  hehe.   Just that someone said to me that the rectal is for having sex.   eeewwww  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   (see earlier post)<br><br>Wow, I didn't know rectal sex is that harmful.  Thanks for your input.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In addition to my replies earlier on our physical body, our rectal and anus is designed for purging waste from the body.  It is never for sexual intercourse.<br><br>And I really want to see how the pro-homosexual party individual going to defend that.  Will they say that heterosexuality is more harmful and risky?<br><br>hmm...<br><br>As for the next generation, how will kids feel having two fathers or two mothers?  Just because the gays choose to be together in a very selfish way.  Why?  Because they keep forcing their own govt or even religion to accept gay marriage.  They choose to have their own kids, they make the poor kids grow up in an adnormal family.  Again it's a selfish choice.<br><br>We have to look at the feelings of the community as a whole and the welfare of the next generation, instead of looking at the needs of individual gays.  They choose to live like this by not getting treatment.<br><br>About the ex ex gay who got married and then went back to gayhood, it is definitely his choice.  He being a gay by nature is just an excuse.  He is being bored with a normal marriage life and decided to leave.  This is no difference from a man who leaves his wife and children for his mistress.  Why?  Is it thrill?  Something newer and fresher to him?  The only diffence is now we are talking about gays.<br><br>There is no such thing as gays cannot be treated.  Gays can distort all kinds of science research to support their way of life after which they will petition for legalised gay marriage.</div>

Most likely from gay bars, saunas, etc..<br><br>There's such a sub-culture within the gay comm (and a rather vibrant one but not unique to gays though) but it does not mean that these people represent all gays in the population.. If you are going to find someone who's more risky in sex to begin with, you will of course come up with the conclusion that gays practice more risky sex..<br><br>In short, there are many gays who do not patronise gay bars, saunas etc..

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">Honeybunz - you want an HONEST and STRAIGHT answer to your statement?<br><br>This was posted 14 September 2005 at 1:38 P.M. on Page 4 of this thread:<br><br></div></blockquote>How can this be a STRAIGHT answer without talking about the yuckiness of heterosex..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><strong>The passing of any bodily fluid or material from one individual to another<br>This first and most basic practice includes virtually all sexual activity, therefore, in order to engage in a normal sex life, one must use circumspect caution about what activities are acceptable and with whom.<br><br>If you have a lover and have known this person for a protracted period and both of you have reasonable assurances that neither of you have strayed to assignations with outsiders, and if you both take HIV tests regularly (twice a year), then the liklihood that that either of you will infect the other is virtually nil. But, even in this very cautious hypothetical example you still could contract type C hepatitis if your sexplay includes ingestion of feces or vomit. Or, in a less extreme variant, a long dormant herpetic infection might appear and transfer without notice.<br><br>The question naturally arises: "What are safe sexual practices?" This is a tricky question to answer. The problem comes from the mounds of legal liability that return to haunt anyone who has the chutzpah to step forward and declare some practice to be safe. There are many lists of do's and dont's that are so specific that they can never address the plethora of human sexual experiences. In practice, safety becomes a matter of common sense.<br><br>While oral sex, including the swallowing of semen, has lately been considered by some authorities not to be a vehicle for HIV, urine and blood may still cause infection.<br><br>[edit]<br>Engaging in sexual contact with multiple partners and with unknown partners<br>The numbers will eventually get you. It's a lottery and you stand a better chance of winning (losing really) if you have 365 entries a year instead of 3 or 4. You need to pick your partners carefully, and what you find out over cocktails in two hours will simply not be enough information. Offering yourself as a Bukkake target in a bath house may sound thrilling as a fantasy, but it brings real dangers along for the reality ride. Of course, you might do stuff like this for years with no adverse results. Some people buy lottery tickets every week and never win either, but odds playing is a form of gambling, and at least in Lotto, you are only out a buck.<br><br>Next to masturbation, frottage (rubbing someones genitals through the clothing) is the least dangerous activity. Manipulating another person's genitals may not cause infection, but pre-ejaculate and vaginal fluid may still be introduced into a partner's body. This may not be a problem unless one has a cut or rash on the skin. This can then become an access point to the circulatory system. Licking and sucking are a major part of sex, and for the most part, healthy saliva and a generous dose of stomach acid will act as a bar to most viruses. However, activities such as flossing or brushing the teeth can cause cuts in the gums, leaving a more direct route for viruses to follow.<br><br>Everything discussed to this point simply requires your judicious screening of the candidate for your sexual fun. It would not be smart to tempt fate by giving head to a guy you just met on the day you had a wisdom tooth extracted. However, most people get to play at least to the oral stage without having to face death, if they are careful.<br><br>After this, things get a bit dicey. Deposits into the vagina and into the anal cavity are like injections into your body. These areas are rich in blood vessels and are uniquely equipped to engage in chemical transfers into the bloodstream. The penis is also a blood filled organ that easily suffers friction injuries. Ergo:<br><br>[edit]<br>Penetrating the vagina or anus without a condom<br>This is a premier way to transfer any STD. Latex and poly condoms protect against HIV, genital herpes, and pregnancy. Natural lambskin condoms (like Fourex Brand) are good only against conception. Their membranes, however, may allow disease to be passed. Many people engage in the practice of barebacking. It is generally unsafe unless one knows the history of their partner. Taking anything into your body, by mouth or other orifice, compromises the integrity of your person. We take it so for granted by breathing, drinking, eating all the time, that we are not focused on the idea that we may be poisoned.</strong><br><br></div>

Two years later, lawmakers did not pass the measure, but asked voters to decide.
