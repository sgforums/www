It is against my religious belief and I reserve the right to teach my children what I consider to be moral and godly.<br><br>Further discussion on this issue is quite pointless. The gay community does not view this as a moral issue but an innate, immutable trait. Therefore their agenda is to convince society that homosexuality is not immoral as the Bible teaches, but that message directly contradicts the religious teachings of Christians, Jews and Muslims alike.<br><br>Whilst some Christians like myself would have been content to let them hold to whatever views they want amongst themselves, homosexuals have gone on the offensive and attacked my religious values. In so doing they have forced me to see the danger they pose to my children, who could be drawn to the amoral, anti-Christian diatribe of the libertines.<br><br>As long as homosexuals continue this line of argument there can never be common ground with Christians and Muslims in our society. Not unless people abandon the Word of God and adopt an ever-changing set of quasi-Christian doctrines that homosexuals can edit to suit their purpose. God forbid.<br><br></div></blockquote>1) Hey, that's not even the intention of my post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> My only intention is to show that the assumption of "homosexuality can be cured" and it's easily available is only...

DIGGS, JR. M.D.</span><br><br>Executive Summary<br><br>Sexual relationships between members of the same sex expose gays, lesbians and bisexuals to extreme risks of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), physical injuries, mental disorders and even a shortened life span. There are five major distinctions between gay and heterosexual relationships, with specific medical consequences. They are:<br><br>Levels of Promiscuity<br><br>Prior to the AIDS epidemic, a 1978 study found that 75 percent of white, gay males claimed to have had more than 100 lifetime male sex partners: 15 percent claimed 100-249 sex partners; 17 percent claimed 250-499; 15 percent claimed 500- 999; and 28 percent claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners. Levels of promiscuity subsequently declined, but some observers are concerned that promiscuity is again approaching the levels of the 1970s. The medical consequence of this promiscuity is that gays have a greatly increased likelihood of contracting HIV/AIDS, syphilis and other STDs.<br><br>Similar extremes of promiscuity have not been documented among lesbians. However, an Australian study found that 93 percent of lesbians reported having had sex with men, and lesbians were 4.5 times more likely than heterosexual women to have had more than 50 lifetime male sex partners. Any degree of sexual promiscuity carries the risk of contracting STDs.<br><br>Physical Health<br>Common sexual practices among gay men lead to numerous STDs and physical injuries, some of which are virtually unknown in the heterosexual population. Lesbians are also at higher risk for STDs. In addition to diseases that may be transmitted during lesbian sex, a study at an Australian STD clinic found that lesbians were three to four times more likely than heterosexual women to have sex with men who were high-risk for HIV.<br><br>Mental Health<br>It is well established that there are high rates of psychiatric illnesses, including depression, drug abuse, and suicide attempts, among gays and lesbians. This is true even in the Netherlands, where gay, lesbian and bisexual (GLB) relationships are far more socially acceptable than in the U.S. Depression and drug abuse are strongly associated with risky sexual practices that lead to serious medical problems.<br><br>Life Span<br>The only epidemiological study to date on the life span of gay men concluded that gay and bisexual men lose up to 20 years of life expectancy.<br><br>Monogamy<br>Monogamy, meaning long-term sexual fidelity, is rare in GLB relationships, particularly among gay men. One study reported that 66 percent of gay couples reported sex outside the relationship within the first year, and nearly 90 percent if the relationship lasted five years.<br><br>Encouraging people to engage in risky sexual behavior undermines good health and can result in a shortened life span. Yet that is exactly what employers and governmental entities are doing when they grant GLB couples benefits or status that make GLB relationships appear more socially acceptable.<br><br>The Health Risks of Gay Sex<br><br>Introduction<br><br>Back in the early 1980s, while working at Beth Israel Hospital, I vividly remember seeing healthy young gay men dying of a mysterious disease that researchers only later identified as a sexually transmitted disease Â— AIDS. Over the years, I've seen many patients with that diagnosis die.<br><br>As a physician, it is my duty to assess behaviors for their impact on health and wellbeing. When something is beneficial, such as exercise, good nutrition, or adequate sleep, it is my duty to recommend it. Likewise, when something is harmful, such as smoking, overeating, alcohol or drug abuse, it is my duty to discourage it.<br><br>When sexual activity is practiced outside of marriage, the consequences can be quite serious. Without question, sexual promiscuity frequently spreads diseases, from trivial to serious to deadly. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 65 million Americans have an incurable sexually transmitted disease (STD).1<br><br>There are differences between men and women in the consequences of same-sex activity. But most importantly, the consequences of homosexual activity are distinct from the consequences of heterosexual activity. As a physician, it is my duty to inform patients of the health risks of gay sex, and to discourage them from indulging in harmful behavior.<br><br>I. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOMOSEXUAL AND HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS<br><br>The current media portrayal of gay and lesbian relationships is that they are as healthy, stable and loving as heterosexual marriages Â— or even more so.2 Medical associations are promoting somewhat similar messages.3 Nevertheless, there are at least five major areas of differences between gay and heterosexual relationships, each with specific medical consequences. Those differences include:<br><br>A. Levels of promiscuity<br>B. Physical health<br>C. Mental health<br>D. Life span<br>E. Definition of "monogamy"<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>health risks also apply to straight sex.

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, I think ultimately we don't have to worry. Bigots like the ones we find here will slowly die out, and civilisation will flower even more magnificantly as we gain a newer level of social enlightenment, and the nethandrals of our current society will slowly become extinct. And contary to their expectations, the widespread acceptance of homosexuality will not cause mankind to become extinct. On the contary, people will have a stronger defination and understanding of their own sexuality earlier in their lives, and this will lead to relationships being stronger when both parties are fully aware of their own sexualities, and perhaps we'll see less of the tragedies and heartbreak of today when one partner in a relationship realises that he or she is gay. Social enlightenment must be pushed ahead in spite of all the bigotry trying to send us back into the dark ages. It is the creed of humanity.</div>

DIGGS, JR. M.D.</span><br><br>Executive Summary<br><br>Sexual relationships between members of the same sex expose gays, lesbians and bisexuals to extreme risks of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), physical injuries, mental disorders and even a shortened life span. There are five major distinctions between gay and heterosexual relationships, with specific medical consequences. They are:<br><br>Levels of Promiscuity<br><br>Prior to the AIDS epidemic, a 1978 study found that 75 percent of white, gay males claimed to have had more than 100 lifetime male sex partners: 15 percent claimed 100-249 sex partners; 17 percent claimed 250-499; 15 percent claimed 500- 999; and 28 percent claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners. Levels of promiscuity subsequently declined, but some observers are concerned that promiscuity is again approaching the levels of the 1970s. The medical consequence of this promiscuity is that gays have a greatly increased likelihood of contracting HIV/AIDS, syphilis and other STDs.<br><br>Similar extremes of promiscuity have not been documented among lesbians. However, an Australian study found that 93 percent of lesbians reported having had sex with men, and lesbians were 4.5 times more likely than heterosexual women to have had more than 50 lifetime male sex partners. Any degree of sexual promiscuity carries the risk of contracting STDs.<br><br>Physical Health<br>Common sexual practices among gay men lead to numerous STDs and physical injuries, some of which are virtually unknown in the heterosexual population. Lesbians are also at higher risk for STDs. In addition to diseases that may be transmitted during lesbian sex, a study at an Australian STD clinic found that lesbians were three to four times more likely than heterosexual women to have sex with men who were high-risk for HIV.<br><br>Mental Health<br>It is well established that there are high rates of psychiatric illnesses, including depression, drug abuse, and suicide attempts, among gays and lesbians. This is true even in the Netherlands, where gay, lesbian and bisexual (GLB) relationships are far more socially acceptable than in the U.S. Depression and drug abuse are strongly associated with risky sexual practices that lead to serious medical problems.<br><br>Life Span<br>The only epidemiological study to date on the life span of gay men concluded that gay and bisexual men lose up to 20 years of life expectancy.<br><br>Monogamy<br>Monogamy, meaning long-term sexual fidelity, is rare in GLB relationships, particularly among gay men. One study reported that 66 percent of gay couples reported sex outside the relationship within the first year, and nearly 90 percent if the relationship lasted five years.<br><br>Encouraging people to engage in risky sexual behavior undermines good health and can result in a shortened life span. Yet that is exactly what employers and governmental entities are doing when they grant GLB couples benefits or status that make GLB relationships appear more socially acceptable.<br><br>The Health Risks of Gay Sex<br><br>Introduction<br>Back in the early 1980s, while working at Beth Israel Hospital, I vividly remember seeing healthy young gay men dying of a mysterious disease that researchers only later identified as a sexually transmitted disease Â— AIDS. Over the years, I've seen many patients with that diagnosis die.<br><br>As a physician, it is my duty to assess behaviors for their impact on health and wellbeing. When something is beneficial, such as exercise, good nutrition, or adequate sleep, it is my duty to recommend it. Likewise, when something is harmful, such as smoking, overeating, alcohol or drug abuse, it is my duty to discourage it.<br><br>When sexual activity is practiced outside of marriage, the consequences can be quite serious. Without question, sexual promiscuity frequently spreads diseases, from trivial to serious to deadly. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 65 million Americans have an incurable sexually transmitted disease (STD).1<br><br>There are differences between men and women in the consequences of same-sex activity. But most importantly, the consequences of homosexual activity are distinct from the consequences of heterosexual activity. As a physician, it is my duty to inform patients of the health risks of gay sex, and to discourage them from indulging in harmful behavior.<br><br>I. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOMOSEXUAL AND HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS<br><br>The current media portrayal of gay and lesbian relationships is that they are as healthy, stable and loving as heterosexual marriages Â— or even more so.2 Medical associations are promoting somewhat similar messages.3 Nevertheless, there are at least five major areas of differences between gay and heterosexual relationships, each with specific medical consequences. Those differences include:<br><br>A. Levels of promiscuity<br>B. Physical health<br>C. Mental health<br>D. Life span<br>E. Definition of "monogamy" [/b]<br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>health risks also apply to straight sex. I guess u'll be becoming a monk then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  [/b]</blockquote>It is unfortunate that you did not continue with the quote of the entire posted referenced article, otherwise you will have found the answer in the continuing sections of this article.<br><br>Nothing was mentioned that straight sex do not encounter health risks, but it is clear that HOMOSEXUAL behavior will result in HIGHER HEALTH RISKS.<br><br>No, I do not need to be a monk, neither do you need to be a nun - (if you are a female ) .<br><br>You can be quite well assured that if you will be a faithful companion to a member of your opposite sex, and learn to enjoy a positive normal sexual relationship enjoyed by NORMAL HOMOSAPIENS - through the use of the normal reproductive organs - it is unlikely that you will suffer from those Health Risks inflicted on the HOMOSEXUAL community.<br><br></div>
