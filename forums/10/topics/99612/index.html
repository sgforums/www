This is to ensure that we have enough cheap labour for local and foreign companies to exploit, and enough people contributing to their cpf accounts.

            <div class='col-md body'>This was what i had posted in another topic for reference :<br><br><blockquote><br>Let me share a cruel hard fact gathered that can be seen in singapore irregardless of individual opinion of being proud or not proud to be a singaporean.<br><br>The number of foreign talent in most company are growing relative to the local. Reason, most company especially mnc are employing cheap labour from oversea especially india to do project. They employ a fresh graduate from india which cost them only around SGD 800 per month compared to a fresh graduate from local university at around SGD 2k+. So for the pay of one local fresh graduate, they can get 3 indian to do the same jobs. Once these indian came over and learned all the required skill to replace singaporean. The project will be outsource to the indian team setup in india. Operation like call center, administrative, IT work, many more etc all shifted to india leaving singaporean jobless. That's why you hear retrenchment here and there. Furthermore, the foreign talent also came over to singapore to compete with the local for jobs that has not or cannot be shifted. They are hardworking, less demanding, no NS liability, willing to take a lower salary compared to singaporean. So why these pple are willing to take on such a lower salary?<br><br>Let's see some statistical comparison.<br>Comparison between indian and singaporean fresh engineering graduate.<br>Indian Fresh Grad<br>Expected salary range : SGD 800 - 2000<br>Total Education cost until Tertiary Pre-U Level : SGD 200+<br>Total 4 year University Fee in india (Gov Subsidized) : SGD 900+<br>Total 4 year University Fee in india (Private) : SGD 1400+<br>Cost of living in India : Low<br>Cost of Meal in India : SGD 0.20 per decent meal<br>Housing in India : SGD 20,000 for a landed property<br>NS Liability : No<br>Hardworking : Yes work days and night<br><br>Note : Their one month pay plus allowance in singapore will cover their 4 year tertiary education fee. It is no wonder these indian dare not spend too much in singapore while working in singapore.<br><br>Singaporean Fresh Grad<br>Expected salary range : SGD 2000 - 2500<br>Total 4 year University Fee in Singapore (Gov Subsidized) : SGD 20,000 +<br>Cost of living in Singapore : High<br>Cost of Meal in Singapore : SGD 2 per decent meal<br>Housing in Singapore: SGD 150k for a HDB Flat Leasing<br>NS Liability : Yes<br>Hardworking : Depend<br><br>How long will it take for a singaporean fresh grad to pay off his university fee?<br><br>Why be a singaporean?</blockquote>[/quote][/code]</div>
