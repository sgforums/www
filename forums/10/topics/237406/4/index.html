            <div class='col-md body'>it surely sounds great that the govt's offset package for a family is more than what that family pays due to the extra 2% GST.<br><br>However, there's a problem. Let's assume that the average family spends an extra $40/month on the 2% GST rise. The govt then gives this family a GST offest amount of $600, which is $120 more than what the family would have spent. However, the govt would disperse this to the family in 1 or 2 payments, and I find this problematic.<br><br>By right, this family would have to save this lumpsum, and then use it monthly to offset their higher GST spendings. But because of our greedy human nature, this lumpsum would be inevitable seen as a 'windfall', and the family might blow the $600 on a holiday, or seafood dinner, or a new sofa (i.e. the lumpsum amount is spent NOT for making up their expenditure shaortfall caused by the GST).<br><br>So, at the end of the day, the family has a nice holiday, but they would still have to fork out more of their own money on GST.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the revenue portion of the budget was grossly under estimated.<br><br>In FY 2006 the budgeted revenue for GST at 5% was SGD3.75 billion, the actual (what was collected at the end of the year) was SGD3.93 billion, a difference in excess of SGD180 million.<br><br>In FY2007 when GST is to be increased to 7%, they budgeted for the GST revenue to be collected as SGD4.1 billion.<br><br>I think it's more like (7% / 5%) X SGD3.93 billion = SGD5.502 billion<br><br>As the GST will only be raised in 1st July, only half of the increase is attributable to the year.<br><br>(SGD5.502 billion - SGD3.93 billion) X 0.5 = SGD0.786 billion (due to 2% GST)<br><br>Therefore the GST revenue estimates for FY 2007 should be in the region of:<br><br>SGD 3.93 billion (FY 2006 actual) + SGD 0.786 billion = SGD4.716 billion <strong>NOT</strong> SGD4.1 billion as budgeted.<br><br><strong>The government budgeted SGD4.1 billion which is a gross under estimation of SGD616 millions. I don't understand with a 40% [(7% / 5% X 100%) - 100%]increase in relation to the old GST. How can the GST increase by a mere SGD0.17 billion, the increase should be SGD0.786 billion.</strong><br><br><strong>Maybe the accountants that produced the figures are all incompetent, either that or, they are made to produce those figures, so as lead the serfs to think that the government is doing all it can to help the populace even at the expense of running a budget deficit.</strong><br><br><img src="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/7267/revenueestimatespage1gq3.png"></div>
