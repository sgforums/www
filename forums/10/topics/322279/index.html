              <p>The market is violatile now. The best and safest thing to do now is to adopt a waiting strategy and hold liquid assets as its hard to predict the movement of stocks in current market.</p>
              <p>However, what is being mentioned is not entirely wrong. In this violatile market, not every single stock and industry are being affected. There are stocks and companies who are well hedged against current risks, this mean that the impact to their share price is minimal. Furthermore, alot of stocks underweight or outperforming. This means that while it is a high growth potential company, because of the general market condition,the share price is temporarily lower. Some people sees it as bad but alot of people sees that is the best time to accumulate because if the foundation of the company is good, the only way for the price in time to come is up. So what better opportunity than now to stock up?</p>
              <p>As for which stocks to look out for in this current market, I wun give names, i have invested quite a bit in those stocks. The risks are high so I wun name them just in case anyone took my suggestions and plunge in haha. But yeah, do some research and look at their performances and numbers, you may just hit a mini jackpot for some kopi money haha in the current market situations.</p>
