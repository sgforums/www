            <div class='col-md body'>The Workers' Party has made a serious tactical blunder in their haste to issue their anti-casino statement before 18th April. By releasing their statement on 7th April, it has given the PAP more than 10 days to refined their positions to counter the concerns raised by it's political opponents. The political naivety of the new WP members has caused the party to lose a rare opportunity to dent the armour of the ruling party and gain considerable political mileage from this divisive issue. On the other hand, Singapore Democratic Party displayed their political shrewdness by issuing their statement immediately after the government's annoucement on 18th April. In such a move, it has the opportunity to digest the government's stand and form their statement to raise doubts on the government's decision. The difference between WP's statement and SDP's statement has not gone unnoticed with the pro-government media. It is telling that only the WP's statement is reported in the papers, and not SDP's statement. Mr Low Thia Khiang should not take this blunder lightly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether or not the Workers' Party's move was a blunder is a matter of perception.<br><br>To some observers, the Singapore Democratic Party's statement was something like what the Chinese would call "ma hou pao" (cannon behind horse) -- ineffectual harping over a decision that has already been announced and is irrevocable.<br><br>Anyway, now that things have been set in stone, it is better to focus on the future and prepare ourselves for whatever it may bring.</div>
