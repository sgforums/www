              <p>This is an insightful article by Hugo Restall of FEER. Think he's been sued by LKY before. Though lengthy, please do the article justice by reading all of it. It reflects many truths in our Singapore today. And this begs the question: What would happen to Singapore if we continue under the PAP till 2050?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>For one, it would surely be severe stagflation of the middle and lower income classes if the policy of attracting foreign investment were to persist, couple that with a lack of entreprenerial desire among Singaporeans. Think also the foreign workers from India and China whose presence suppress local wages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For eg, a delivery driver in Sg earned say $1400/mth ten years ago. Today, it hasn't changed much. An SIA Captain earned at least $15,000/mth the same period ago, today it is at least $20,000/mth.</p>

              <h1>Pressure Builds on Singapore’s System</h1>
              <h2>by Hugo Restall</h2>
              <p><em>Posted on Sept. 5, 2008</em></p>
              <p>During the National Day festivities last month,
              Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s gloomy prognosis for the
              economy—a “bumpy year” ahead—was overshadowed by even more dire
              warnings that the city state is about to start running low on its main
              resource, people. With an aging society and one of the lowest fertility
              rates in the world at 1.29, the government is pulling out all the
              stops, doubling the budget of baby-making incentives to $1.13 billion.
              Meanwhile, in order to make Singapore a more tolerant and pluralistic
              place, political videos will be allowed, as well as protests in a
              downtown park.<br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It’s all straight from the ruling People’s Action Party’s standard
              playbook.</span> Play up the anxiety of a small nation beset on all sides, in
              need of a strong government to take positive action to avert disaster.
              Individual citizens who are failing to live up to the expectations of
              society need to be brought back into line. At the same time, leaders
              are willing to give those citizens a few of their rights back, as long
              as they are not used to undermine harmony.<br> <br> Since Mr. Lee took over the premiership in 2004, Singaporeans have been
              watching for any sign he plans to reform substantially the
              authoritarian state created by his father, Singapore’s founding Prime
              Minister Lee Kuan Yew. So far there has been little indication that in
              his heart the prime minister is a liberal democrat. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But the system of
              control is coming under increasing stress</span> due to the changing structure
              of society. A process of subtle change will continue to be driven by
              pressure from below, rather than a change of heart at the top.<br> <br> Last month’s gestures far fall short of lifting what the opposition
              calls the climate of fear—past experience, such as the detention of
              former Solicitor General Francis Seow in 1988, suggests that
              retribution for challenging the PAP can come in many forms, from
              bureaucratic harassment to detention without trial under the Internal
              Security Act. The government is making a virtue out of necessity by
              lifting the 10-year-old ban on making or showing political films, and
              allowing political podcasts during election campaigns. Oppositionists
              were successfully skirting the restrictions, so that they only served
              to hamstring the PAP's own efforts to utilize online media. The opening
              of a protest area is a token gesture, which no doubt will be raised to
              deflect international criticism the next time police arrest dissident
              politician Chee Soon Juan for illegal assembly. In that sense, the move
              suggested that Mr. Chee’s campaign of civil disobedience is causing
              some heartburn within the regime.<br> <br> But the real problem is not Mr. Chee—the stressors on Singapore’s
              political machine lie elsewhere. The PAP’s legitimacy has always rested
              on its performance, backed by trust in the party. Given its chaotic
              past and neighbors, Lee Kuan Yew argued, the tiny country could not
              afford the risks associated with liberal democracy. In the past that
              argument was largely taken at face value by the Chinese working class,
              despite the experiences of other Asian nations that contradicted it.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today, however, there is more apathy than agreement. No one seriously
              questions the PAP’s track record of governance or probity of its top
              leaders, yet trust is giving way to resentment at the party’s arrogance.</span><br> <br> The main proof is in the erosion of the party’s share of the popular
              vote in elections. In 2006, it hit 66.6%, down from 75% in 2001, and
              75.6% in 1980. In the past, opposition parties deliberately refrained
              from contesting more than half of the seats, since they found that
              while some Singaporeans wanted to cast a protest vote, they would not
              vote for the opposition if there was any chance the PAP would be thrown
              out of office. But in 2006, the opposition contest 47 of 84 seats,
              suggesting that the PAP’s hold on voters’ loyalty is not as fearsome as
              before.<br> <br> Why is this?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> For one thing, Singaporeans are better versed in critical
              thinking. During the 1980s and '90s, people may have grown wealthy, but
              they remained politically unsophisticated. </span>Development happened so
              quickly that it took decades for education levels to catch up.
              According to the government statistics, between 1990 and 2005 the
              percentage of the population with a university degree grew to 17% from
              4.5%. That is matched by an even more dramatic shift in individual age
              cohorts—in 2005, 32.1% of 30-34 year olds had a university degree, as
              compared to just 6.6% of 50-54 year olds. The language spoken at home
              is now predominantly English, meaning that Singaporeans are
              increasingly able to learn about and interact with the outside world.<br> <br> Moreover, the PAP has pushed the economic structure of the country in a
              direction that is no longer win-win for all classes. A certain amount
              of economic inequality is tolerable as long as there is a sense that
              everyone’s lives are improving. But inequality and real hardship are on
              the rise, as inflation running at 6.5% erases the 3.3% wage gains that
              the poorest tenth of the population enjoyed last year, even as the top
              tenth picked up an 11.1% increase in income. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAP loyalists control a
              lucrative web of government-linked companies, while ministers have also
              picked up big pay rises, since their salaries are indexed to the
              private sector, making them some of the world’s highest paid
              politicians.</span> As for social mobility, the top scholarships, which are a
              ticket into the elite, increasingly go to students from wealthy
              families that live in private apartments, rather than public housing.<br> <br> Despite this trend, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the PAP is unwilling to dismantle its policies of
              holding wages low in order to attract multinational companies to
              invest.</span> This was a strategy born of necessity in the 1960s, when
              Singapore was short of capital and struggling to catch up with Hong
              Kong’s model of creating an export-oriented growth. Today it is
              economically obsolete, yet it suits the government politically because
              the combination of state-owned companies and politically quiescent
              multinationals prevents the emergence of an independent commercial
              class that might push for political change.<br> <br> The result is a top-down economy which is running up against the limits
              of its capacity to drive growth. Without an entrepreneurial class and
              successful home-grown companies, Singapore’s productivity growth has
              historically lagged behind that of its laissez-faire twin, Hong Kong.
              As University of Chicago economist Alwyn Young showed in a 1992 paper,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore had one of the lowest returns on physical capital in the
              world.</span> Its growth has been fueled by forced savings programs shoveling
              ever increasing amounts of capital into the furnace, rather than by
              innovation or managerial efficiency.<br> <br> Mr. Lee’s administration has found that the only way to defuse public
              dissatisfaction is to do something the PAP consistently condemned as
              the hallmark of Western democracies: Give away money. The government
              used to damn welfare as a dirty word, yet transfer spending is on the
              rise. This year, $2.1 billion in giveaways were planned. Then last
              month Mr. Lee announced a 50% increase, totaling $179.8 million, in
              utility rebates and “growth dividends”—cash payments to households that
              started in 2006. The new prime minister has brought in other social
              spending programs for the poor. For instance in the 2008 budget, the
              Ministry of Manpower’s expenditure rose by 184%, almost entirely due to
              a new scheme of workfare, the $306 million Income Security Policy
              Programme.<br> <br> The pressure for more entitlements will only grow as retirees find that
              their savings do not provide enough of a cushion. The compulsory
              government-run Central Provident Fund sucked up a huge percentage of
              income to finance the state’s development goals, but offered dismally
              low returns. As a result, many of the generation that built the
              Singapore miracle now finds itself eking out a retirement in public
              housing while the government surpluses remain under the management of
              the PAP.<br> <br> Beside the carrot, there is also a stick. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Starting in 1985, the PAP
              began to warn voters that if they supported the opposition, their
              government-built apartment buildings would not get priority for
              maintenance. </span>This was gradually refined to the point that in 1997, then
              Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong explicitly campaigned on the promise that
              individual precincts would get housing renovation spending according to
              their votes. When the U.S. State Department condemned this as
              undemocratic, the interference of foreigners was used as another
              rallying cry.<br> <br> Indeed, it seems that Singapore is increasingly cursed with the
              shortcomings of a democracy without enjoying the benefits. During the
              2006 campaign, Prime Minister Lee inadvertently blurted out his fears
              of what would happen if there were more opposition members of
              parliament: “Instead of spending my time thinking what is the right
              policy for Singapore, I’m going to spend all my time thinking what’s
              the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters’ votes….” Putting aside
              the ominous sound of “fixing” opponents, the remark was ironic because
              the PAP now expends so much effort to buy the support of the populace
              with giveaways, all in order to avoid the transparency and
              accountability that a vibrant opposition would bring.<br> <br> Some younger Singaporeans with skills respond to this by voting with
              their feet, moving abroad to find greater freedom and a higher standard
              of living working with the kind of entrepreneurial companies that
              Singapore has yet to create. In order to eventually win some of them
              back, the possibility of recognizing dual nationality is increasingly
              discussed, a move that would represent a huge concession for a
              nation-building party that demands self-reliance and sacrifice of its
              citizenry.<br> <br> In the place of the émigrés, foreign workers are flooding in to man the
              factories, docks and construction sites, as the government steadily
              opens the doors wider. Foreign workers already account for more than
              one million of the total population of 4.6 million. Among the
              immigrants are talented individuals like the Chinese table tennis
              players who provided the country with its first Olympic medal last
              month. But they lack the loyalty to the country that the PAP has put a
              premium on.<br> <br> If Singapore were a plural democracy, it would no doubt have developed
              an independent civil society capable of binding together the
              native-born and immigrants, providing mutual support. But the PAP and
              Lee Kuan Yew are like the African baobab tree, whose spreading canopy
              hogs the sun and prevents other trees from growing up underneath. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such
              a society may be easier to control, but it is also alienated and
              rootless, jealous of others’ gains—the oft-quoted national
              characteristic, <em>kiasu</em>,
              literally means “fear of losing.”</span> In a developed economy that depends
              on attracting and retaining creative individuals, this has become a
              significant handicap.<br> <br> The arrogance of the winners in society is becoming a major issue. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
              elder Mr. Lee’s ego is legendary</span>, but given his accomplishments it is
              perhaps understandable. When his minions take on similar airs, however,
              it is a different story. In one extreme example two years ago, a furor
              erupted after the daughter of MP Wee Siew Kim used her blog to berate a
              man afraid of losing his job as “one of many wretched, undermotivated,
              overassuming leeches in our country” who should “get out of my elite
              uncaring face.” To make matters worse, Mr. Wee tried to defend her
              remarks.<br> <br> Naturally the PAP is aware of these trends and that its monopoly on
              power has become an important issue in itself. Over the years it has
              tried to come up with mechanisms for citizens to register their
              complaints and blow off steam. The government no longer seeks to
              destroy all opposition, leaving alone and even praising those tame MPs
              who focus on constituents’ issues rather than the PAP’s system of
              social control.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Yet ultimately there is no solution to this problem,
              since the party is unwilling to share power in any meaningful sense.</span><br> <br> A siege mentality has been the hallmark of Singaporean politics for
              four decades, often with good justification given hostile neighboring
              governments to the north and south. Yet it is increasingly hard today
              to see how that anxiety can be justified and maintained. The generation
              now coming onto the political scene grew up in at least moderate
              prosperity,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and may not be so easily bullied into voting for the PAP.</span> It is eager to put down roots and create a civil society. So far the
              PAP has finessed this aspiration without compromising its control.<br> <br> Prime Minister Lee can afford to be sanguine for now, with the security
              apparatus, corporatist economy and civil service all at his command.
              Yet if this economic downturn worsens, he will be confronted with a
              more difficult choice of whether to accede to demands for greater
              pluralism. As academic Michael Haas once wrote, “Whenever the public
              exercises the independence of thought that better education brings, ‘a
              danger to be nipped in the bud’ or some similar cliché is articulated
              as the basis for repression.” It bears remembering that the laws like
              the Internal Security Act that have been used in past such exercises
