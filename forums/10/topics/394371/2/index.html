              <p>singapore isnt stuck in techno jams it never was stuck...........its complacent as like  most of the people  in spore.unfortunately u would be lucky in spore who even knows how to even program stuff in any code even.as all humans are.....i know  machinery programmin both maschine code and in software.</p>
              <p>its the kind of people each country  was made out of.....unfortunately singaporeans are not americans or are one of thosae who dedicates the entire life and every moment in pursuit of robotics////those who live and breathe of the future and what it brings to mankind.....in so doing of that pursuit one uprooted his past ,parents,present and future to another land with better chance of accomplishing his goal.</p>

              <p><br>Amazing that one can begin with a sweeping statement that claims - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore is stuck in massive techno-economical jam</span></em>" - and that the causes are (1) - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">it doen't got guts to implement new tech</span></em>"; and (2) - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the people expects spoon-feeding in learning new tech</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Firstly, who is in charge of Singapore to have caused this "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">massive techno-economical jam</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, does it takes any "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">guts to implement new tech</span></em>" - or does it take entrepreneurial vision and business acumen to chart new directions ?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, how did the stupendous conclusion come about that it is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the people expects spoon-feeding in learning new tech</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Was it not due to the lack of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">guts to implement new tech</span></em>" to cause the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">massive techno-economical jam</span></em>" in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Should the people make the first move to learn new tech - when there is no "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">guts to implement new tech</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the economic downturn or crash of 1987, 1997, and again during 2002 through 2004 - a total of three Economic Review Committees were formed, and each of this Committee had made recommendations to reduce the huge amounts of contributions to the personal accounts in the CPF, so as to release the entrepreneurial energy to make Singapore less dependent on the big corporations, and have a second tier economic-industrial network that will provide employment for the majority.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy although seemingly a capitalist model - is no better then a modified form of 'command economy' with direct government policy interference in determining national economic directions - that see the government hand moving resources into directions that it sees as the future.</p>
              <p>The government involvement get even deeper when it participate in direct competition in the market place of entrepreneurs, by using public money to set up Government-Linked Companies to compete with private entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>Can the government be successful entrepreneurs ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans unwilling to learn new tech ?</p>
              <p>Or has it not been a fact that the PAP Government treat Singaporeans as human resource - to be manipulated and directed into directions that will meet with the vision and goals set up by the Government ?</p>
              <p>How often has it been said by applicants to the various tertiary institutions that the course that they applied for had insufficient seats available, but there was an unusual large number in another faculty to produce "<em>the manpower needed by industry</em>" ?</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans need spoon-feeding - does the commentator count itself to be a Singaporean - and similarly need to be spoon fed to see the situation that is so clearly obvious ?</p>
