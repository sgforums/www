              <p>Govt promoting Total Defence in 2010 again:</p>
              <p>MILITARY DEFENCE</p>
              <p><strong>"Singaporeans keeping Singapore secure"<br><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Deterring aggression</span></strong><br>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is a strong defence force that is able to deter anyone from thinking of attacking the country. The SAF draws its strength from the support of every Singaporean - national servicemen, families, friends, colleagues and employers.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong class="redText">Staying operationally ready</strong><br></span>National Service is the only workable option to ensure our security. When National Servicemen (NSmen) and full-time NSmen (NSFs) take their training seriously, they help keep the SAF strong and operationally ready. Our operational readiness is also maintained by ensuring that all equipment is in good working order all the time, and keeping up with the latest advancements in technology to meet new challenges in the battlefield.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong class="redText">Able to meet all kinds of challenges</strong><br></span>The SAF has widened its capabilities to deal with non-conventional threats such as terrorist bombings, hijackings, and chemical, biological and radiological attacks. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the SAF will continue to work with other security agencies to deal with such threats.</p>
              <p>CIVIL DEFENCE</p>
              <p><strong>"Taking care of your family, friends, and people around you in times of crisis"<br><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Knowing what to do during civil emergencies</span></strong><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) recruits and trains civil defence volunteers in first aid, rescue and evacuation procedures, and shelter management. The SCDF also conducts talks and exercises to familiarise the public with basic first aid, the nearest bomb shelters and emergency arrangements like relief supply of critical items such as blood, water and food. Participating in such exercises helps us to be prepared. When we know what to do, we can help to save lives and property, and ensure that life goes on as normally as possible in times of crisis.<br><strong class="redText"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Alert at all times</span></strong> <br>The threat of global terrorism will be around for some time. Much has already been done to ensure that Singapore is well protected against terrorist attacks, but security personnel cannot be everywhere. Singaporeans can help by looking out for, and reporting, anything suspicious.</p>
              <p>ECONOMIC DEFENCE</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000; font-size: x-small;">"</span>Working and saving to achieve a better life for everyone"</strong><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong class="redText">Staying relevant and competitive through rapid change and development</strong><br></span>When we upgrade our skills and knowledge, it helps us to stay relevant and employable in this rapidly changing world. Our ability to embrace lifelong learning and re-training is vital to keeping our economy competitive.<br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong class="redText">Putting in place robust economic systems that can continue to function in times of crisis</strong><br></span>When the foundation of our economy is strong, our economy will not break down so easily in times of war or crisis. Sound policies and practices help us withstand external shocks. Putting in place measures to keep businesses running and maintaining stockpiles of essential items also help to keep our economy going.<br><strong class="redText"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Making Singapore livable for future generations</span></strong> <br>By saving electricity and water, and by adopting environment-friendly practices as a way of daily life, we are helping to conserve energy and to protect our environment. As a result, Singapore will continue to be livable for future generations.</p>
              <p>SOCIAL DEFENCE</p>
              <p><strong>"Living in harmony, looking out for one another"</strong><br><strong class="redText"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Singaporeans of all races and religions living and working together in harmony</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> <br></span>Maintaining racial and religious harmony is critical to ensuring peace and stability in Singapore. When Singaporeans understand and are sensitive to the cultures and traditions of one another, and build strong bonds across different ethnic groups, we help strengthen social cohesion.<br><strong class="redText"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Looking out for one another</span></strong><br>As one people, we have a duty to contribute to the community by helping the less fortunate and underprivileged among us, regardless of their race, language, religion, age or nationality. By doing so, we can further strengthen social cohesion, and build a gracious, compassionate society.</p>
              <p>PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFENCE</p>
              <p><strong>"Singaporean and proud of it"<br><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Loyal and committed to our country</span></strong><br>When Singaporeans are united in pride and passion for our country, we will stand up to defend what is ours and protect our independence as a nation.<br><strong class="redText"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Having the will and resilience to overcome challenges</span></strong> <br>Whatever the crisis or challenge, our ability to overcome challenges depends on how mentally strong we are. It is this will and the commitment of our people that will decide how strong we are as a nation.</p>

Many ppl will argue that we are only an island full of ppl and who the hell want to take this country?Â  I went through 1997 when Indonesia is in crisis and I saw with my own eye how they rape and kill the local Chinese. I saw thousands of Indonesian Chinese crowding our ports and were allowed entry to Spore without visa or even passports. This is the first time I realise we can be so vulnerable if we are unable to protect ourself.</p></div>
