              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br>Amazing that one can begin with a sweeping statement that claims - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore is stuck in massive techno-economical jam</span></em>" - and that the causes are (1) - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">it doen't got guts to implement new tech</span></em>"; and (2) - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the people expects spoon-feeding in learning new tech</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Firstly, who is in charge of Singapore to have caused this "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">massive techno-economical jam</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, does it takes any "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">guts to implement new tech</span></em>" - or does it take entrepreneurial vision and business acumen to chart new directions ?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, how did the stupendous conclusion come about that it is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the people expects spoon-feeding in learning new tech</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Was it not due to the lack of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">guts to implement new tech</span></em>" to cause the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">massive techno-economical jam</span></em>" in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Should the people make the first move to learn new tech - when there is no "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">guts to implement new tech</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the economic downturn or crash of 1987, 1997, and again during 2002 through 2004 - a total of three Economic Review Committees were formed, and each of this Committee had made recommendations to reduce the huge amounts of contributions to the personal accounts in the CPF, so as to release the entrepreneurial energy to make Singapore less dependent on the big corporations, and have a second tier economic-industrial network that will provide employment for the majority.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy although seemingly a capitalist model - is no better then a modified form of 'command economy' with direct government policy interference in determining national economic directions - that see the government hand moving resources into directions that it sees as the future.</p>
              <p>The government involvement get even deeper when it participate in direct competition in the market place of entrepreneurs, by using public money to set up Government-Linked Companies to compete with private entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>Can the government be successful entrepreneurs ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans unwilling to learn new tech ?</p>
              <p>Or has it not been a fact that the PAP Government treat Singaporeans as human resource - to be manipulated and directed into directions that will meet with the vision and goals set up by the Government ?</p>
              <p>How often has it been said by applicants to the various tertiary institutions that the course that they applied for had insufficient seats available, but there was an unusual large number in another faculty to produce "<em>the manpower needed by industry</em>" ?</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans need spoon-feeding - does the commentator count itself to be a Singaporean - and similarly need to be spoon fed to see the situation that is so clearly obvious ?</p>

              <p>Hey A Turdie from Turdistan, what do you know about Singapore?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are afraid of new technology? How we know? Simple, anything we talk about genetics and cloning, religious groups that tries to represent all singaporeans make known their complaints.</p>
              <p>Yes, Singapore is a command economy, in part due to government control and fear of religious groups.</p>

              <p>Brilliant "zwei-siao-ness" at its best can only be seen in the claim by the "zwei-siao-Hog" that Singapore is a <strong>Command Economy</strong>.</p>
              <p>How did the "zwei-siao-Hog" arrive at its position that a "<strong>Command Economy</strong>" state is due to the PAP "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">government control and fear of religious groups</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Does the PAP government need to fear any religious groups ?</p>
              <p>Does its fear of religious groups drive the PAP government to have total control and dictate a "<strong>Command Economy</strong>" ?</p>
              <p>The laughable political views of the resident "zwei-siao-Hog" is made more comical as it struts around to hawk its pseudo-knowledge and to continue with its "zwei-siao" bankrupt acts of plagiarism.</p>
              <p>Is "new technology" only about "genetics and cloning" ?</p>
              <p>Surely, the "zwei-siao-Hog" with its limited knowledge about "new technology" can only know best with its own effort to clone itself from the genetical ashes of Hitler - as it struts around with a pseudo-Bavarian moniker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spoon feeding ?</p>
              <p>The bankrupt mind of a "zwei-siao-Hog" can only plagiarize words and ideas in its vain effort to turn the tables on others - when it cannot substantiate its hollow "zwei-siao" derogatory claim that Singaporean "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>people expects spoon-feeding</em></span>".</p>
