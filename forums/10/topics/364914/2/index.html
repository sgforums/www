              <p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><strong>Politics of
              Fear</strong><br> <br> 15 June 2009<br> <br> TOC, Out of the Box<br> <br> Singaporeans, in general, are a fearful people. They are afraid to
              express their views and do not have any opinion. They are afraid to
              take any risk or face the consequences. They prefer other people to
              decide for them.<br> <br> For several decades, they are afraid that their vote in a general
              election is not secret. They are afraid that they will lose their
              job or will get into trouble with government officials, if they are
              found to have voted for a party other than the party in
              power.<br> <br> They are afraid to be sued for defamation, if they were to make any
              statement that is unfavourable to people in power. They are quite
              naïve about their rights to free and honest expression.<br> <br>  Withdrawal<br> <br> After many years of living in fear, they learn to withdraw from
              society. They do not wish to express any opinion publicly, but they
              will vent their anger in the coffee shops or in anonymous internet
              forums.<br> <br> They learn not to get involved in any issue of public interest.
              They learned to take care only of their personal interest. If they
              are adversely affected, they will shout and expect other people to
              help them. But, they will not come forward to help other
              people.<br> <br> Extreme views<br> <br> Many people are unhappy with the high cost of living and the
              quality of life. They have to work hard and for long hours, just to
              earn enough to get by. If they fall sick or face with some
              financial hardship, life will become more difficult and
              unbearable.<br> <br> Those who are adversely affected by misfortune will harbour a
              strong resentment about life in Singapore. But they are afraid to
              voice their grievances using the proper channel, or find that the
              people in power are not listening, or do not really care.<br> <br> They use the anonymous internet forums to express their hatred in
              quite extreme ways. They find that as long as they are anonymous
              and cannot be traced, they can express their views safely, and why
              not exaggerate or dramatise them?<br> <br> Stages of fear<br> <br> Psychologists have identified the different stages of fear.<br> <br> Fear is an emotional response to threats and danger. It is a basic
              survival mechanism occurring in response to a specific stimulus,
              such as pain or the threat of pain. It is possible to escape or
              avoid the specific threat.<br> <br> Fear is different from anxiety, which typically occurs without any
              specific threat. Anxiety is the result of perceived threats that
              are uncontrollable or unavoidable.<br> <br> There are various degrees of fear, from mild caution to extreme
              phobia or paranoia. I am quite worried that the fearful behaviour
              of some Singaporeans has reached the extreme form of
              paranoia.<br> <br> Personal experiences<br> <br> I wish to share some of my personal experiences.<br> <br> I have expressed my views under my real personal name in my blog
              and in The Online Citizen. Many people have asked me if I have
              received any threats or warnings from the people in power, for
              these views, which may be uncomfortable to them. Did I get any call
              at midnight or any knock on the door?<br> <br> I did not. I believe that the people in power have been rather fair
              in dealing with me and my views. Or, some cynics say, perhaps they
              are too busy dealing with the economic crisis?<br> <br> But I did receive many “friendly advices” from relatives and
              friends, asking me “to be careful”. It seems that their views are
              worse, in creating fear, than the real threats from the people in
              power. Perhaps, the people in power approach these proxies to
              express their threats?<br> <br> The worst kind is from people who made the “friendly advices”
              through my wife or children.  If they are fearful, they should
              keep to themselves and not spread the unfounded fear.<br> <br> Initially, many people came forward to volunteer their help to get
              signatures for me. After a few weeks, most of them dropped out and
              became unreachable. It seemed that they have received some advice
              or warnings, and decided not to get involved. Perhaps, they face
              the same kind of pressures and subtle threats?<br> <br> Negative Traits<br> <br> The years of fear and paranoia have led to the following negative
              traits of Singaporeans:<br> <br> a)             
              Not willing to express any opinion<br> <br> b)             
              Take care only of personal interest<br> <br> c)             
              Not willing to speak for other people<br> <br> d)             
              Not willing to stand for what is right and fair<br> <br> e)             
              Express extreme views, if protected by anonymity<br> <br> f)             
              Irresponsible behaviour<br> <br> Change for the better<br> <br> Is it possible to change behaviour for the better? It will take a
              long time, as the current negative traits have been ingrained after
              many years of fear and education.<br> <br> A good starting point is to adopt the following values:<br> a)             
              honesty;<br> <br> b)             
              fairness;<br> <br> c)             
              public interest;<br> <br> d)             
              positive;<br> <br> e)             
              courage.<br> <br> If one is expressing an honest and fair view, one does not need to
              be afraid of being sued for defamation.<br> <br> If one is exercising the right as a citizen to vote for the future,
              one does not need to worry about losing one’s job or being
              victimised by government officials. Anyone, the government
              officials do not have the time to go about victimising large
              numbers of ordinary people, which would be against their own values
              of decency.<br> <br> It is best to express your views in a positive way. You can point
              what is right for society or your wishes for the values that guide
              our society, without having to point out that someone is wrong or
              dishonest.<br> <br> I adopt a positive approach because it is only fair to the other
              person, rather than to avoid being sued.<br> <br> One needs courage to be able to express an alternative view. But
              the values of honest, fairness and a positive attitude help to give
              the courage.<br> <br> Conclusion<br> <br> It is time for Singaporeans to get away from the politics of fear
              and be willing to step forward to express what is right for our
              country and our future. We can rebuild a nation to be proud
              of.<br> <br> Tan Kin Lian</p>

              I've found too that some or many of my friends retract from me because of what I stand for and my views on the Singapore regime. Even I found that my own family would not support me and even went against me by saying personally hurting words and actions. Even the people who are from my church added to my wound. Of course insults coming from forum members are pretty common. Haha. Well life goes on I will carry on and will not be put down by these. And one thing I've learned in the hard way is that when you're under persecution and abuse speak up don't be silent. Silence will not make these people to stop hurting you. As long as I stand in the right and do not tell lies I don't see why I have to fear anyone or anything. Even if they made a law against speaking up I see myself free from any obligation to conform to any law that serves no justice.

              <p>However, the point I am trying to state is, there is no "OBVIOUS" politics of fear nowadays in Singapore especially with LKY not that fit as before. Now the government realises that fear will not work with the modern-age Singaporean, and has thus turned to new ways of influencing people to their cause.</p>

              <p><br>Whenever you see a battle plan of war in modern era, one of the key point of attack and control is the media station, once they got hold of it, half the battle had won. Control of media is part of a political science subject you will learn if you study politics. So dun tell me the PAP allow the media to spew all the bad nonsense about them, and still happily remain quiet. ?? The communist are best in controlling of media so are those under military rules.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Globalisation and the explosion of internet had in a way causes panic among govt all over the world, some are ready to censor it, some play a cat and mouse game, some warns their citizens of responsibility in their posting and some like Mr. Obama make full use of it to win votes. The line draw here is still very vague, our opposition supporters had critised so much about PAP, but where are their leaders?? You need to walk the talk, the PAP is keeping just a view of internet here because they knew very well that these few supporters are just guinea pigs who are no different from kopitiam stubborn uncles and aunties grumbling about govt. No damage done.</p>

And one thing I've learned in the hard way is that when you're under persecution and abuse speak up don't be silent. Silence will not make these people to stop hurting you. As long as I stand in the right and do not tell lies I don't see why I have to fear anyone or anything. Even if they made a law against speaking up I see myself free from any obligation to conform to any law that serves no justice.</p>

               South East Asia is a new born independent region filled with newborn countries.
                It's natural that during its few decades of nationhood that these countries be ruled by some sort of dictatorship or strong man. It's only natural because usually the first few decades are the most politically unstable period in any country and this means that the leaders may need to act quick despite being thought of being harsh. Any newborn country will find the first few decades to be the most turbulent and may spell the country's 50-70 year future.
                                <br><br>
              However South East Asia countries now face a whole new breed of population of young idealistic people who are better educated, informed than their parents and grandparents were. They now see themselves as part of the international community and demand their government to give what has been rightfully theirs that is their dignity as free people. They don't see their leaders as rulers but as their government which is expected more to govern for their sake and less to rule over them.
                                <br><br>
              The regimes in South East Asia have been enjoying relatively repressed political environment on the ground that stability is needed to enjoy economic growth. However these regimes have also become more corrupted and self serving in these few decades that they merely want to stay in power because losing it would mean losing the privileges both economic and political that they have been enjoying for decades. In other words these regimes are not willing to pass on staff and when they do they make sure the staff is only handed to those who would not bring about real change that would rip them off their privileges. 
                                <br><br>
              Any change to freer political climate and reform can only be brought by their own population and cannot be expected to come from the ruling regime as this will spell the end to their privileges. South East Asia people have been taken hostage by their own corrupt regimes.
              And when reform took place there's even tendency to go back to the old authoritarian regime since the elite find that they would benefit the most from such a system. Anyway democracy is not a well known quality in South East Asia and is not rooted to its largely timid population. Though the younger people now are clamoring for reform and change in these countries. They've had enough of the arrogance of their own elite.

              <p>What do you know about ingratitude and greed ?</p>
              <p>Is this all about a storm in a teacup ?</p>
              <p>How about a storm that had been brewing for 52 years and culminate in a loss of US$100 Billion amongst a list of destruction along the way ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that you are ignorant to the many leading lights in Singapore politics that have been destroyed for the personal ambition of ONE Man and his carpet begging cronies.</p>
              <p>Similarly, you are oblivious to the lives of those generations that have been stunted by the skewed flip-flop policies that have been driven by the vanity of ONE Man's vision of his own supreme talent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only a loser who cannot present any cogent arguments will call for Singaporeans to migrate, when those who stay are the ones who contribute to the good life that you are enjoying without contributing your equal share.</p>
              <p>Like those who have never known the better things in life, you only grab as much as you can at the Buffet Table prepared by the PAP - with just enough to keep your interest, you are too afraid to complain and also too afraid to miss the last piece.</p>
              <p>Like the greed of the ONE Man and His idea of paying himself market rates, when he will not subject himself to the Rules of the Market - of transparency and accountability.</p>

              now i really understand what ignorance is bliss means.
              
              politicians do not matter in individual's life? 
              
              when miw impose gst, the individual's disposable income is instantly reduced. 
              
              when they raise the utilities and transportation rates, hospital charges and prices of hdb flats, the individual's savings get eroded away if he/she is not reduced to struggling to make ends meet or worst still becomes mired in debt.
              
              on the contrary, csj and people like him do not matter in individual's life as they don't have any power to pass laws and regulations that affect his/her life. if the individual finds them offensive he/she can don't give a shit about them.
              
              so can the individual don't give a shit to the miw? can by all means, if that makes him/her happy but the truth is, it is the miw who can don't give a shit to the individual!</i>
