              <p>I agree that Ah Bear shouldn't be using such insult, as it is obviously Slander. And by doing so .. he discredits himself.</p>
              <p>CSJ .. in my personal opinion is a brave man.. willing to be a sacrificial lamb. A martyr no doubt.. but obviously not a very good politician.</p>
              <p>Ah Bear.. on the one hand is receiving government salary.. but on the other .. hates his own employer... a confused soul perhaps.</p>
              <p>But as long as CSJ continues his reckless ways... he becomes a liability as an opposition leader .</p>
              <p>Perhaps.. it would be better for CSJ to position himself as the fighter/warrior , and put someone else who is more politically savvy to front the SDP.</p>
              <p>But is he willing to give up the leadership role to ensure success for SDP ?</p>

              <p><br>Yes, of course LTK and CST - have each got one foot into the door.</p>
              <p>What else could they do with their individual foot inside the door ?</p>
              <p>They could not even wriggle their toes, let alone making any attempt to present their own plans at show casing their manicured nails.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did they use the opportunity in Parliament to confront the failed PAP policies in Parliament in the same manner as JBJ had vigorously hold the PAP to account ?</p>
              <p>There was not even a squeak to the loss of the US$100 Billion lost by GIC and Temasek, nor was there a serious debate with Finance Minister Tharman's excuses given in defense of the loss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Respect is given for the results that can be seen to be achieved, and even as much as the PAP will not respond immediately to the demands and demonstrations from CSJ and the SDP - so as not to give any credit to CSJ or the SDP, there are already small steps being made by the PAP to respond to the issues that CSJ and SDP has placed the spotlight on to embarrass the PAP.</p>
              <p>The PAP has been forced to confront the issues that CSJ and the SDP has raised and cannot possibly avoid.</p>
              <p>With the activist approach to change the set of rules that the PAP insist in having a firm grip at playing political football, the PAP has to approach each economic and social policies carefully.</p>
              <p>CSJ will play a better role outside of Parliament then inside, as the PAP dominated parliament will ignore even having a serious debate on any issues raised by the Members of Parliament from the alternative parties.</p>
              <p>With a Speaker of Parliament that is partisan by deferring to his own party leaders, and who cannot even stay neutral to moderate parliamentary debate, how effective can the MPs from the alternative parties be in Parliament.</p>
              <p>When JBJ was in Parliament, every debate that he had vigorously pursued in Parliament - had ended up in Parliamentary persecution for abuse of privilege, and enquiries were formed by Parliamentary Committees consisting largely of MPs from the PAP that naturally execute the dictates of the PAP executives.</p>
              <p>It was the PAP style of parliamentary gangsterism in its worst form, when the milder acts of parliamentary gangsterism included PAP MPs booing and jeering JBJ efforts at having serious debate.</p>
