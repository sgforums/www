Please elaborate, that statement seems strange especially in the light of Rafales running rings around Tomcats and Hornets during recent DACT exercises over the Indian Ocean. And thats the most basic Rafale F1 version<br><br>As for BVR, MICA/Mirage 2000 combi slaughtered NATO F-16s F-18s MiG-29s in BVR DACT. How do you think the Rafale with its newer and more advanced systems will perform, first with MICA, and the evetually Meteor?<br><br>This topic has been discussed extensively in the "Singapore at War" thread, this is an excerpt from one of my posts on why the Typhoon is a BAD choice for Singapore<br><br>===========<br><br>Dated 26 July 2002, Page 43 of thread "Singapore at War"<br><br>Once again, the problem with the Typhoon is not even whether Tranche 3 will solve the problems of the Typhoon(too geared towards A2A, insufficient range/combat radius). It is as Joe Black has pointed out, whether it will reach that stage or not. Looking at previous multinational designs, its unlikely, everyone will get the Typhoons ordered, the countries involved will hail it as a fantastic example of multinational cooperation, then promptly each go their own way as to customising the aircraft for their own need, each heaving a sigh of relief at the sight of each others backs.<br><br>Also, development time comes into play, as I've often said before, I am impressed(very much so) by the Typhoons specs, but I've also said we must put things into perspective and realise that much of the claimed specs are just that, claims, very little exists beyond the papers and the harddrives of the consortiums offices. The basic fact is that the program is lagging, and severely so, compared to equivalent fighters of the same generation. 4 Typhoons, 3 from UK and 1 German, flew together for the 1st time recently at Farnborough. Some see it as an achievement. I say, "about damn time"<br><br>Back to integration. US has already told RoK no AMRAAM integration if it chooses non-US equipment. No doubt, they will use the same arm-twisting tactics on other nations, us included when it comes to picking our fighters. As I've asked before, what then for the non-US contenders? Skyflash/Sparrow for Typhoon until Meteor is available at the end of the decade(and that if and only if the damn Krauts stop trying to screw around with the program). Hardly cutting edge is it?<br><br>I've said this before and I'll say it again. While the Typhoon is a very impressive aircraft with a very impressive set of specs, there are too many what-ifs concerned with the state and schedule to the program for us to gamble our new fighter program on</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with ur way of analysis of the typhoon program.

And the US has already shown the world its willing to do that duing RoK's F-X selection. Which brings us back to the original point, would you prefer Rafale with MICA, or Typhoon with Sparrows/Skyflash?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Somemore, although the rafale has indded involve in the afgan war in their charles de gualle carrie in their F1 config( AA now) and the demo of the mk2 version in paris air show, but still france cannot impresse most of the countries F-x replacements .

Rafale lost to Gripen because the countries had<br><br>- Cost considerations<br>- They were looking at lightweight mainly A-A fighters in the first place. Singapore is looking for a heavier mulit-role aircraft. Comparing Rafales loss to Gripen is like comparing apples with oranges. Rafales loss to Typhoon in the Greek/Austrian contract is due mainly to politics, not capabilites. And anyway Greece has postponed its final decision to purchase the Typhoon to 2004. so Typhoon has not got that one wrapped up yet, which is why I did not include Greece as a customer.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;I am impress of the rafale aesa radar n the irst and mica combi, but the current F1 version of rafale armaments is still not a veri gd integrate with those tt have NATO standards of armaments( commonality so as to save maintainence).  even if sg wans a rafale, i think the best is with mk2 version or F-3 version onwards.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Not a problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>I put my money on Rafale as the choice for the RSAF as it one of the better planes around.

No doubts about that. On paper, everything in its specs would make it almost Rafales equal, or even surpass it slightly. However, if we look a little deeper, here's where the problems start stacking up against Typhoon for Singapore.<br><br>1)<br>Everythings on paper. The program has faced numerous delays and problems, brought about in part by having to sort out the kinks in the working relationships between the partners. Almost every aspect of the scheduling so far has been pushed back, again and again. The latest high profile delay is German delays over the Typhoons main armament, the Meteor BVRAAM. The CFT program only exists on paper(pretty much like everything else). The multirole version is still a few years off. Compare this to the Rafale development. It is in squadron service, has already undertaken combat missions over Afghanistan, the CFT program is on track with aircraft having already flown with CFTs, the multirole versions are ready for production once the French frees up the funding<br><br>2) Weapons<br>Both Rafale and Typhoon are scheduled to receive the Meteor BVRAAM. But its only scheduled to arrive in the later part of this decade(even before the Germans started their old tricks again). So whats in the interim? The American AMRAAM for Typhoon and the French MICA for Rafale. Both radar versions of the missiles are rough equivalents of each other, little to choose between each other. Which is fine and good if you're an EU/NATO operator of the Typhoon. But, as has already been demonstrated in the Korean F-X program, the US will not allow integration of AMRAAM to countries which buy non-US products, effectively relegating non-NATO/EU users of Typhoon to Skyflash and Sparrows until Meteor is ready, which are only semi-active radar homing, and at least a full generation behind AMRAAM/MICA. Of course MICA will have no such export restrictions to the Rafale.<br><br>3) Timetable.<br>Eurofighters order book is 600+ machines. Rafales is 200+/300. While some have taken this to mean that the Rafale is an export failure, things must be put into perspective. All except 12 Typhoons for Austria will go the the development countries. And export order of 12 units hardly makes Typhoon a roaring export success. Where the advantage of Rafale is that if Singapore does order it, we will be assured of receiving our aircraft according to OUR timetable, and not having to wait till other countries who've ordered earlier receive theirs before we get ours.<br><br>4) Training<br>Singapore has a training detachment set up already in France. A training detachment for Rafales in France will also make things simpler in terms to logistics, and theres no need to set up a new detachment in another country<br><br>I've heard a lot of denigrating comments about the Rafale; M88-2 engine poor in hot and high ops, RBE2 A/G modes being a joke, incompatible with American weapons etc.<br><br>Well, heres my rebuttal to these points:<br>M88-2: It is a non-factor. The M88-3 is already cleared for export, and it offers vastly improved thrust for almost no trade off in weight.<br>RBE2: Again a non-factor. This applied to the original RBE2. The A/G modes are being debugged as we speak, and export Rafale get the AESA radar anyway.<br>Yank weapons: Rafale has carried and dropped GBU-12s with combat load of 4 GBUs, 3 tanks, 2 Magic and 2 MICA(4 MICAs in operational service). And if US refuses weapon sales because we didn't buy American jets, whats the use of integrating American weapons anyway. And to be honest, I'd take SCALP/Apache over JSOW any day.<br><br>The link Joe Black posted in the "Singapore announcing fighter acqusition soon" is a fantastic guide to everything you need to know about the Rafale, read it. But you need Acrobat Reader though...<br><br></div>
