This would give us a significant strike capability without endangering the lives of our pilots. Also, when the Surface to Surface version is developed. It could be integrated into our new frigates and even the future singapore Subs giving us a secondary strike capability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">I think it is hard to pit Typhoon against Rafale in terms of technology. They are equally matched if not Rafale actually beats Typhoon in terms of the following:<br><br>1. AESA radar (typhoon still on steered pulse-Doppler radar)<br><br>2. Rafale avionics are currently more advanced. Typhoon will catch up eventually though.  Rafale will introduce integration of HMS before Typhoon. Other systems are comparable though, eg. MFDs, Voice Data Input, touch screen (only on Rafale I think),  ECM/ESM (I believe Typhoon may be slightly ahead, but it really depends on if you are talking about the German or the British version), etc<br><br>3. Conformal Fuel Tank - flight tested on operational Rafales.<br><br>4. Engines - about the same. Rafale engines have gone through 3 round or 4th roung of uprating, to the current M88-3. Whereas the Typoons only got their EJ200 engines not too long ago. Most of the prototypes were running on RB199  or the GE F404s.<br><br>5. Stealth. The RCS of Rafale is debatably better than that of Typhoon. In fact, Dassault did a study to indicate that Rafale is second to Raptors in terms of RCS. Of course, one can counter claim that the study is done by Dassault and not the EADS consortium.<br><br>So, I think they pretty much match up well. No one should claim which plane is more advanced. The simple fact is that Typhoon is designed as air superiority fighter, well Rafale was designed as a multirole fighter. The whole design difference was the root reason for France to leave the ECP/EF2000 project.<br><br>If RSAF wants a dedicated Air Superiority fighter, by all means, go for Typhoon (provided we can be assured of Amraam integration and delievery when the Typhoons are delivered, what is the chances of that happening - anybody's guesses) . But if we a multirole or deep peneration strike aircraft, I think Rafales or the Super Bugs present better options. Even the Strike Eagles look better than Typhoon (pre Trenche3 of course).<br><br></div></blockquote>Rafale for A-4s and Typhoons for F-5s?</div>
