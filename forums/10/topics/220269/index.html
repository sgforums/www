            <div class='col-md body'>The key issue of LHL government is how to lessen the cost burdens imposed by GCT and his father.<br><br>Solution actually is quite simple. Singapore has now achieved through people's past sacrifices a certain surplus level far exceeding than what is needed for stabilising the currency etc.<br><br>He can set up endowment funds from these surpluses to produce interest incomes which can be used to cover some subsistence costs for people who are unemployed. Many people are willing to find works but there is no jobs due to relentless tax-and-recovering policy of the government which caused the whole economy to lose its competitiveness.<br><br>This people's problem in finding jobs was caused by ministers' lack of talents as demonstrated by recent recessions when they conveniently blamed it on the people for lack of skills.<br><br>Let's say we consider helping people only on the basic i.e. utility and food for three months at reducing quantum over two years at the maximum after which further assistance needs certification.<br><br>If we do it like Japanese prime minister Mr. Abe, sacrifice 20% of his own pay and 10% of ministers' pay and do away with uncalled for life-long annuities to all his MPs and ministers who are quite rich and set up a endowment fund for this purpose, I am sure this will amount to hundreds of millions sufficient to help prevent desperate unemployed citizens from jumping the MRT track.<br><br>How much do we need to spend on such subsistences for those who are dying and starving. I am sure the whole society will not become a welfare state just because of such a gesture.<br><br>So I do not understand the elitist MPs who kept insisting this subsistence from cut-backs on over-generous salaries of ministers will lead to whole economy slipping down the slippery slope of welfare.<br><br>With the above-stated returns of repatriation of over-generous salaries packages from ministers and MPs to the people who are dying there will be sufficient fund to save some lives and no one needs to be left behind. There will be no need to increase the GST to cause more suicides.<br><br>Ministers and MPs who got lesser pays will not complain because in the first place they were over-generously paid and what is 10% of pay cut compared with people's support for their good deeds.</div>

This is a good example for Singapore political leaders.<br><br>In such a true leadership by example, staff were not asked to sacrifice because their pays are not that high. Even if staff want to follow the leaders to sacrifice their pays such leaders might not agree.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO the 7% GST could go in place. However, what needs to be called for in our Government is Transparency and Accountability.<br><br>So far, there is little information on how the Government's funds fare in its investments. Further, there is little accountability these ministers have to their citizens.<br><br>If Singapore goes into depression, do they apologise and say that some level of punitives will be applied to the ministers? No, instead they like to blame the citizens for being non-competitive, not doing enough. And even say that Singaporeans are full of complaints. Everything that evolves is from a function of government policy.<br><br>Now that Singapore is aiming for one gold for the olympics, will the minister in charge take responsiblity and suffer a pay cut if we do not gain so? All empty words and air.<br><br>I think we should start giving ministers firm targets to achieve and not just immeasurable, arbitary goals. Like if we don't grow by a certain percent or if unemployment not reduced, then a proportional paycut is order. You don't see a CEO enjoying a pay rise when his company doesn't register growth.<br><br>You have to start taking the government as a business entity, subject to shareholder scrutiny, especially since all their policies are driving towards 'Singapore Inc'.</div>
