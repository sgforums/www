              <p>Recently, after many complaints (including one letter of mine published
              in the ST forum) about unfairness in acquiring lands for public use or
              freezing of development potential of conservation projects at
              ridiculous prices like $1.00 the government finally relented and
              announced in March 07 that henceforth it will pay FULL MARKET PRICE
              compensation for lands acquired for public use.<br> <br> Does anyone know what the government means by market value compensation
              ? Is it based on willing buyer and willing seller basis as stated in
              URA tender?<br> <br> In recent land acquisition for public use it would seem that the
              collector would simply use his own concealed table of some kind of
              values not disclosed and say at the inquiry to the people affected by
              acquisition : "give us your claim" without revealing market values or
              being bothered to prove their tables contain market values and give
              people about 3 weeks to accept such values and after this if there is
              no answer the collector will simply consider his offer of compensation
              usually about 10-15% of latest transacted land prices as full market
              value.<br> <br> Such collector's offer would be far below the land values computed in
              their own development charge revision table published in URA website
              after the minister's announcement in order to collect higher
              enhancement for any change of use.<br> <br> Just imagine when charging the people for Development Charge the
              collector knows what is market value but in paying compensation for
              acquisition of people's land the collector does not know what is market
              value.<br> <br> Even though the minister has already announced market value as basis of
              compensation of lands kept sometimes for more than 20 years without
              being put to public use under section (8) of LAA, the collector is
              still using his old table of concealed values for compensation
              inconveniencing people in having to appeal and test out his
              compensation in court.<br> <br> In other words either the minister is lying or the collector does not
              know what is market value when paying for acquisition but when it comes
              to collecting change-of-use enhancement of values he simply is too good
              in coming up with the latest transacted land prices to charge at the
              full market values.<br> <br> Which basis is correct - the development charge table to collect more
              monies from citizens for change of use or collector's own concealed
              copy of "market values".</p>

              <p>nay. That was a passing comment. I leave the casting of aspersions to you. You do so seem to enjoy doing it after all.</p>

              <p>Deathbait,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am pointing out a malpractice for your own good. If minister announced change in compensation to full market value, then the civil servants should stop all the past practices of using their own values which are unsubstantiated by latest land transactions to force people affected to accept below-market compensation by power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we want a clean and corruption-free government we the people must be the party to stop any such malpractices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the meantime it would put the minister to shame for telling lies about giving market-value compensation.</p>
