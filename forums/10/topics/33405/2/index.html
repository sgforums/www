Isn't passion an essential component of patriotism ?<br><br>And pardon me if I may add, you certainly don't need to pass  other's comment as "moronic" when this Malaysian student isn't a Singaporean !Does that explain why "Malaysia Boleh" had failed and KL gov decides to implement its quick-solution NS also ?<br><br>In fact, his  so-called "Malaysian at heart" only serves to  amplify  HIS moronic attitude in placing priority for self-serving interests.<br><br>Why self-serving ? You'll understand what I meant if you had served National Service in the 1st place. If you haven't or don't intend to, that I'd forgive your apparent naiveness in your outlook.<br><br>Dr Tony Tan has issued a 2nd warning to Malaysian gov on the Malaysian vessels intrusion into  Pedra Branca water. They should know the repucussion if they do not heed his statements.<br>His statements are made not just from patriotic POV, but also in accordance with the principle of self-restraint in international diplomacy.<br><br>No, there is not hate here. <span class="large"><strong>FEDUP</strong></span> is a more appropriate word when comes to discribing my view about the Malaysian gov atitude towards Singapore.<br><br>The Singapore gov seldom used such words and if bullets does fly, I'd suggest that he better make up his mind with his half-baked attitudes rather than getting stranded in no-mans land, where I say again, will get anyone killed very quickly .</span><br><br></div>

They did have shown self-restrain (many times - its a fact) when these can still be resolved thru diplomatic channel. No damages have been done so far. Unlike the Michael Fay case whereby vandalism had been committed and punishment have to be met. Does not matter if we are facing neighbors or stronger country. Singapore Govt govern our country based on Singapore law in conjunction with the UN standard.<br><br>On the comment of "Moron" should have been conveted as "Hot-Headed" instead. These statement is an invitation to treat, for flaming post. Doesn't do you any good. Of course, I agree that hot-headed person can rule the country by their heart.<br><br>Tks.</div>
