            <div class='col-md body'>thank you all of you for expressing your opinions. they are much appreciated. all are right no one is wrong and i am sure my current post will definitely have critics slamming it once more. at least it means all of you do believe in their ownselves. i have enjoyed myself reading all the responses to my out of the blue views. most interesting and i believe we have finally cleared the air.<br><br>1.we do not hate each other. Merely each other's govt.<br>2.we are at the mercy of the media who controls wat we need to know and supposed to know. (propaganda)<br>3.... ( to be figured in deeper perspective)<br><br>i just have one final question ..... it impresses me how childish people are able to bring about so much confusion and slamming bout each other. ponder bout it... why do we respond if we believe ourselves to be mature ,thoughtful insightful beings?</div>
