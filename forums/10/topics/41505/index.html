            <div class='col-md body'>The situation just gives me an impression that China is being irresponsible. They just don't seem to care about the virus spreading to other countries. Here the Singapore Government, and indeed other countries are urging people not to travel if they have the symptoms, and over at China they just don't give a damn. So much for morals there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol... read Coming Collapse of China for a comprehensive explanation of why China always tries to cover everything up whenever something like this happens. Apparently, the CCP is covering this up to prevent the people from panicking, and somehow they've forgotten that the people in China is part of the immensely-growing community of the Internet. CCP just doesn't want the people to start another "revolution" or just afraid of an uprising.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, this has something to do with the chinese culture. It is called "face". The most likely reason for their feet-dragging is probably to save face, they are too embarassed by their inability to control the outbreak in GuangDong. Don't be too surprised if the real figure of infected people is much higher than reported. China has a HUGE population, much more denser than HK, and definitely less hygenic. They may hushed up the real truth even now. FYI, I am Chinese (in race), so don't label me as rascist/discriminating!!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
