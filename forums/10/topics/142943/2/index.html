            <div class='col-md body'>I got one query:<br><br>Understand that the utilisation of the donation to help each suffering patient is low while there is more than $200 million in reserves, which can last for approx. 30 years??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Most ppl will not donate until there is full transparency of the usage of donation/fund in reserves.<br><br>It is such a ill-fortune that those patients got such kidney illness. I am surprised that they have to worry about their co-payment, even while there is more than $200 million reserves. Instead, part of the donation is spent unwisely by the CEO... and lie bravely towards all whole donors and Sg ppl.

            <div class='col-md body'>The SPH/NKF court hearing that led to public outcry over NKF and Durai is not one concerning worthiness of charity or its its raising of large reserve per se. It is not about whether Durai has or has not done a good job or whether he should be paid proper salaries to get professional managers.<br><br>Ms. Ho Ching has missed the main issue here which is one of accountability and transparency over excessive pay packages, 12-months' bonuses, first-class air travels and refusals over 13 years on the part of NKF and Durai to disclose vital information to the public.<br><br>I would suggest that before Mrs. Goh, Mrs. Lee and any more government officers or ministers give any further comments on this matter they read the Straits Times' account of the court hearing and judge's comments.<br><br>As long as the main issue is not understood there will be a great deal of unnecessary comments which failed to look at the real issues and find proper cures to the underlying problems. All the comments from government sources so far seem to be to soften the impact or protect its own stand regarding its own practices. In this way government comments will be regarded as politically calculated to protect the status quo - misuse of donation monies for golden taps or commercial contracts with board members. It looks like the senior government sources involved are barking up the wrong trees so far.<br><br>I trust that our leaders will be objective and transparent and have the talents and abilities to be morally upright to stay above the fray and will take appropriate steps at the highest level to admit their own shortcomings that lead to NKF problems. If ministers cannot conduct themselves with such high standards of accountability and transparency and are seen to be protective of wrongs discovered after 13 years of fudging denials, it will lead to loss of confidence in the whole government. They should take this opportunity to re-examine their own actions on promoting their own packages and bonuses so that there will be no perpetuations to justify incorrect pro-elites protective packages seen happening over the past 20 years.<br><br>This kind of admission by the top leaders will not be easy. Mistakes have been made. The best is to do some soul searching. It will be realized from the overwhelming evidences from this court case that people are not wrong in outcry or comments. They have waited for NKF to come clean and be open and transparent for 13 years to learn of the suspected problems which I am sure the leaders will understand is a long time.<br><br>It is only when NKF decided to sue a powerful organization like SPH that the whole case of transparency problem gets blown up. If not for the fact that Mr. Durai has sued SPH the horrendous over-spending of donation funds for private personal purposes might end up being covered up or ignored for a long long time.<br><br>I would suggest Ms Ho or ministers who are speaking on this matter read the whole case again before commenting further or giving more supports to protect NKF or Durai which itself is not an issue here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"> NKF AND DURAI<br><br>NKF mission will be here to stay and supported by everybody who has a heart. So let us all agree that we believe in and support the ends and will not use them as a tool to justify the means.<br><br>By linking the ex NKF CEO with NKF so intimately, we are accusing people of attacking NKF when they attack the man. The average man in the street now finds that he is talking about the Â“devilÂ” and the angel at the same time and people are telling him they are the same. He is very confused. He does not know whether to part with his hard earned money in the name of charity.<br><br>The majority of Singaporeans did not know this man until a week ago. They only know about him through newspaper reports on the court proceeding. And the reports have been bitter, shameful and shocking. Unless they are told not to believe what is mentioned in court, can we blame them for drawing ugly conclusions about this man, and those he once reported to?<br><br>On the other hand there are people who know Durai very well. They must have seen him put in great efforts to build NKF and they certainly admire him for what he has had done for the needy patients. Without him, many patients would have died and there wouldnÂ’t be so much reserve in the NKF coffer so, explicitly or otherwise, they support the perks and remunerations rendered to the man.<br><br>Herein lies the problem - platform and perception. I donÂ’t know which is more difficult Â– putting the first group of people on the shoes of the second to look at this man or vice versa. In any case we can argue until the cow comes home and there is no conclusion because each is standing on a different platform trying to justify the means to a very noble end.<br><br>Talking and writing are subject to various interpretations. If we really want to move on and let the new team continue the good work of NKF, albeit by different means, then all of us should be wise enough to shut up. Nobody shall attempt to impose his or her views on others because like I said, we are on different platforms. Only the relevant authorities should do their official investigations and duly report to all concerned.</span></strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by crazy monkey:<br><strong>The NKF has wisely built up strong reserves over the years. It is a sensible and responsible approach. The NKF's fears are understandable. No one likes to have the dreadful responsibility of deciding which patients should live when money dries up in an economic downturn.<br><br>What if 10 per cent or 20 per cent of their patients or their patients' breadwinners lose their jobs in an extended downturn? Surely, you hope to continue dialysis for them even if they cannot co-pay their part?</strong><br><br></blockquote>I have not thought about all these words all these years and Ho Ching's words just stuck me like a lightning bolt that wisen me up. I will follow Ho Ching's wise advice from now on. I am going to build up strong reserves for my future, thus I will stop donating to any charity organisations from today onwards.<br><br>Special thanks to Ho Ching's for her advice.</div>
