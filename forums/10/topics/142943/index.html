            <div class='col-md body'>NKF deserves continued support<br>Monday Â• July 18, 2005<br>Ho Ching<br><br>I write in my personal capacity.<br><br>I have been a long-time admirer of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF).<br><br>The NKF has been outstanding in supporting kidney and other patients. They and their supporters have been tireless not just in raising funds. They have played a key role in providing life saving dialysis services for kidney patients and more.<br><br>They also counsel and sometimes cajole or even berate patients and their families to take responsibility for themselves and make an effort to live.<br><br>Patients and their families, including their children, are encouraged to work together to contribute to their own support, and not give up.<br><br>This helps them retain their self-respect and live their lives confidently as full members of society. I cheer the NKF for this enlightened philosophy.<br><br>Taking on a dialysis patient is almost like adopting a chronically and critically ill child. You take responsibility not just to give money at the spur of the moment in a flash of sympathy, or to organise dialysis sessions for the week in a spurt of enthusiasm.<br><br>You know that it is a serious life-long commitment of support. You know that any interruption of that support means fear, a loss of hope, and a death sentence of sorts. Many long-time Giro donors understand this.<br><br>The NKF has wisely built up strong reserves over the years. It is a sensible and responsible approach. The NKF's fears are understandable. No one likes to have the dreadful responsibility of deciding which patients should live when money dries up in an economic downturn.<br><br>What if 10 per cent or 20 per cent of their patients or their patients' breadwinners lose their jobs in an extended downturn? Surely, you hope to continue dialysis for them even if they cannot co-pay their part?<br><br>I would like to recommend that the NKF consider building and managing its reserves as an endowment. It also needs a sufficient buffer to weather a deep recession.<br><br>Perhaps this was what it had been trying to do. Perhaps the prolonged years of difficulties during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and the earlier brink of the 1985 recession have spurred the frenetic pace of fund raising in recent years.<br><br>But this funding model needs to be properly modelled, analysed and communicated.<br><br>When the NKF completes its review and puts together its plans, do share them. I am sure Singaporeans and many others share a chord of sympathy for your cause.<br><br>On the issue of CEO pay, I believe that even charities ought to be managed professionally. How else can we extend high quality and impactful services including specialist educational and therapy support to those in need? After all, we do not expect CEOs of publicly-funded hospitals to be poorly paid, do we?<br><br>Indeed, the NKF is more like a community hospital with multiple centres for high-quality, life-long critical care. It operates and manages dialysis centres to provide vital life-saving services at the highest safety levels. It does this with a heart, looking after the emotional and psychological well--being of its patients, too. Taken as a whole, the NKF has certainly done very well for its patients.<br><br>True, there will be volunteers, much admired and respected, with independent means who could help charities without having to take a single cent in salary.<br><br>There are also others Â— much loved and lauded Â— who for religious reasons or perhaps in memory of a parent, child or friend, would give selfless service to others. Society owes them all a debt of gratitude and applauds their spirit of charity.<br><br>But we should not then believe that all those involved in charitable causes should in turn be charitable cases themselves.<br><br>Skilled specialists and experienced managers would soon turn to other careers and job opportunities if they cannot earn a living commensurate with their skills and ability. And we would all be the poorer for it as services drop in quality or wither away.<br><br>Sometimes, in a life-threatening illness, all the money in the world will not be able to bring a loved one back.<br><br>Mr Durai has helped make a difference in the NKF where medical science has offered a lifeline, though at a cost of tireless fund raising for life time dialysis support. I would not begrudge Mr Durai a proper and well-earned compensation and bonus. He probably earned less than what he would have earned if he had continued in his profession as a lawyer.<br><br>Yes, some of the things that Mr Durai has allegedly done rather raise a questioning eyebrow or two. Some may have crossed the line of proper conduct in respect of conflicts of interest as well. If so, they should be corrected.<br><br>It is also important to put in place a set of practical governance guidelines to minimise conflicts of interest, especially for an institution of public trust.<br><br>While the leadership of a CEO is critical to shape and drive any organisation, it is equally important that the board balances its support and guidance for its CEO, with its fiduciary duty. It has to serve as an impartial guardian of stakeholder interest in a public institution.<br><br>As a civilised society, we should not lightly condemn anyone in the court of public opinion without the benefit of due process and the right to a fair hearing. Even murderers have that right.<br><br>If there has been corruption or misuse of funds, then let the relevant authorities investigate and take the case through due process for a fair and proper judgment. There may have been errors of judgment. Most of us can accept and forgive this.<br><br>On the other hand, we should resolutely guard against those with serious faults of character and not put them into positions of trust. But let's be fair and keep an open mind, and give the benefit of doubt until the full facts are known.<br><br>These deliberations and decisions have important long-term considerations and impact. They should be taken calmly and steadily, away from the acid of hate and anger of betrayal.<br><br>Understandably, many feel betrayed. They feel they have been deceived into making donations of hard-earned money. However, this is no excuse for vandalising the NKF facilities, or heaping abuse on NKF staff. Two wrongs won't make a right.<br><br>Let us not forget there are real patients who continue to need dialysis support. I urge the staff of NKF to continue to support them well, and not let this wave of fury shake them from their mission and professionalism to serve their patients well.<br><br>I am sure it would be a tremendous comfort to both the patients and their caregivers if the rest of us can keep calm and give them our moral support.<br><br>Finally, whatever the transgressions or shortcomings, I want to put on record my deep gratitude for Mr Durai and the NKF and their supporters, including numerous donors, media artistes and volunteers as well as board members and patron.<br><br>Together, they have been tireless in their efforts and contributions all these years to make a difference in the lives of many kidney patients in need.<br><br></div>

How else can we extend high quality and impactful services including specialist educational and therapy support to those in need? After all, we do not expect CEOs of publicly-funded hospitals to be poorly paid, do we?<br>...<br><br>These deliberations and decisions have important long-term considerations and impact. They should be taken calmly and steadily, away from the acid of hate and anger of betrayal.<br><br>Understandably, many feel betrayed. They feel they have been deceived into making donations of hard-earned money. However, this is no excuse for vandalising the NKF facilities, or heaping abuse on NKF staff. Two wrongs won't make a right.<br><br>....<br>Finally, whatever the transgressions or shortcomings, I want to put on record my deep gratitude for Mr Durai and the NKF and their supporters, including numerous donors, media artistes and volunteers as well as board members and patron.<br><br>Together, they have been tireless in their efforts and contributions all these years to make a difference in the lives of many kidney patients in need.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hey!!! Wake up!! Wake Up!! You are still in bed is it?? Deep gratitude for Durai.. NKF cheated the money from million of Singaporean lead by Durai. 1800 patients benefited from NKF each year. Simple calculation Durai have taken from the fund $333 every year from each patient . Call him to cough out all  the money taken and all benefit from NKF and we will all respect him. Maybe you can pester him to cough out the money for charity...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ho Ching, why dont you ask Durai to join Temasek Investment, since you think that this man is worth more than $600K a year. If he can build $250+ million of reserve for NKF, I am sure he will be able to do 10 times that amount for Singapore reserve. Right?<br><br>As for NKF reserve, I think any tom dick and harry will be able to do that, all you need is the run NKF like Singapore Pool. Give out million dollar condo as lucky draw, Singaporeans will sure go for it.<br><br>And to say that Durai deserve to be paid 600K, you are indirectly implying that all the LEEs working in PAP are only there for the money, not the love for their country and its people. Am I right to say that if we reduce PM Lee salary by 50%, is he going to throw in the towel and call it a day?<br></div>
