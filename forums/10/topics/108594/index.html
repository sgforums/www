At least, even if CPF balance may be low, they could downgrade from their property say from a four-room flats to three-room and retire on S$300 pm.<br><br>Younger generations cannot hope to catch another property boom by the look of things and must accumulate enough CPF to do so. How many of them are earning high salaries to save S$200 per month for future retirement?<br><br>On the other hand, Utility bill, HDB flat price, double-taxed vehicle and land charges in every government service are sucking up more than S$200 per month.<br><br>High government fees and charges (in the name of practising non-welfarism) are actually people's retirement monies but are accumulated to billions by statutory boards and government departments at the rate of S$14 billions over past 15 years from which the government is able to give out S$200 per citizen during election time to continue getting election support.<br><br>The correct government policy should be to relax or go slow on any more fee increases. Do not recover all costs but only the consumption category. Do not charge land cost again into HDB flat price and not to double tax on vehicle (import then road usage).<br><br>If DPM Lee recognizes the retirement problem as caused by government over-surplus charging policy, and will change the formula on fee charging, all citizens can solve the retirement problem at 55 or 62 without MM Lee having to think of extending retirement age without assurance of jobs. This will then be the EM3 or non-scholar solution to governance problem in Singapore. No need to have scholars and then have to pay higher and higher costs to accumulate surpluses only to make government's job easier.<br><br>But it is also sad to note that many Singaporeans are already sharing the same propanganda languages used by government pointing out often in this forum that other countries like Philippines or Africans are worse off or democracy is not for Singapore. They do not realize that they actually have been subtly brain-washed.<br><br>Many forumers are happy with the present high cost policies as stated above and want the government to continue doing the job in the same way. Look at their postings. I am saddened. Quite impossible to expect government to change anything due to successful newspaper's non-publishing of true picture or problems and continuing brain washing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
