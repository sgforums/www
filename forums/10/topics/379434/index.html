              <p>Artic 1: Aust tourist writing to ST, complains abt 'wasting water'<br>Artic 2: "Fires rage in Aust".<br>Artic 3: 'Green roofs' could cool warming cities by '<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12710">evapotranspiration</a>'.</p>
              <p>My contention is tt watering plants on hot day is a <span style="color: #008080;">good
                  thing</span> to keep atm temp down so that less air-con power used
                  will mean less green house gas, so fuel saved and n less global
                  warming.</p>
              <p>If the Aussie guy cannot even spare some H2O to cool surroundings
                  down (saving electricity), then I think he's in <span style="color: #ff0000;">big
                  big trouble</span> cos burning fuel (&gt;electricity generation&gt;
                  to power one's air-con unit) to cool oneself down is a <span style="color: #f0320e;">terrible</span> thing to do as it only accelerates <span style="color: #ff0000;">green house
                  warming</span> for a <span style="color: #ff0000;">temporary</span> personal
                  comfort. It causes those who are too poor to have air-con access to
                  suffer more because it's hot air that's blowing out of the air-con
                  condenser units, heating up the surroundings. It's thus such an
                  anti-social thing to do, just depending on air-cons to cool oneself
                  down without thoughts about the actual environmental/ future impact
                  of one's other actions.</p>
              <p>Acc Artic 3,: <span style="color: #008080;">more trees should be planted
                  and watered</span><span style="color: #008000;"> </span>to cool the
                  environment down.</p>
              <p>Dear Mr Burke, if U dun allow evaporation, then U cannot expect
                  much rain&gt;</p>
              <p>If U use air-con because day is hot n trees have wilted, then U
                  are only accelerating the green house effect of fossil fuel use.</p>
              <p>Then U will be <span style="color: #008080;">ALWAYS short of H2O</span> n
                  U (n your future generations) will <span style="color: #ff0000;">burn burn
                  burn</span>... rite?</p>
              <p>Thank you for your concerns and we'd welcome U back after U have
                  solved your own problems back home. Don't forget to offset your
                  carbon emissions on your next trip here. Plant a tree n have a nice
                  day, g'day mate.</p>

However I found a most unusual phenomenon: <span style="color: #00ff00;"><span style="color: #008000;">For a city so dependent on water, it was sad to see trees, flowers and grass being hosed in the middle of the day, in the blistering heat.</span> </span>The evaporation factor is at its greatest at this time. Sydney also has a water problem so we are told to water before 10am and after 4pm. If Singapore had the same rules, billions of litres of this precious commodity would not be lost through evaporation.'<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Story/STIStory_433158.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Story/STIStory_433158.html </a><br><br>Copyright © 2007 Singapore Press Holdings.

              <div style="font-size: 10pt;">Firefighters continued to struggle Saturday against wildfires in two states in eastern Australia.<br> <br> Two fires threatened homes in central Queensland, while <span style="color: #ff0000;">more than 20
                              fires </span>were reported in New South Wales, the Australian Broadcasting
                              Corp. reported. <br> <br> A member of the New South Wales Fire Brigade died Friday after
                              collapsing. He was part of a crew that had just put out a grass fire on
                              Fingal Head, on the state's north coast. <br> <br> Earlier this year, as the Australian summer ended, explosive bush fires
                              in Victoria<span style="color: #ff0000;"> killed 200 people and destroyed several communities.</span> Many
                              of those who died were overtaken as they tried to flee.<br> <br> In Queensland, about 50 fires burned Friday, and the pace picked up
                              Saturday as wind speeds increased. In Mount Archer National Park,
                              residents were told to be ready to leave at a moment's notice, while
                              some residents of communities near Rockhampton were told their homes
                              might be threatened within hours.<br> <br> In New South Wales, the Fire Service warned the Brooms Head fire might spread to threaten property. Other blazes closed roads.</div>

                              city buildings in vegetation - creating "green roofs" and walls - could
                              substantially save energy by reducing the need for air conditioning on
                              hot days, say researchers.</p>
              <p class="infuse">Green roofs and walls can <span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #00ff00;">cool local temperatures by between 3.6°C and 11.3°C</span></span>, depending on the city, suggests their new study.</p>

                              Alexandri and Phil Jones at the Welsh School of Architecture, at the
                              University of Cardiff in the UK, mimicked the microclimate around and
                              inside buildings using computer modelling. They compared local
                              temperatures when buildings were made of bare concrete with when the
                              concrete was covered in vegetation.</p>
              <p class="infuse">Such
                              green surfaces are already in use - roofs that are strong enough to
                              take the additional load can be covered with mosses, turf and even
                              trees. In Switzerland, roofs covered in alpine plants that require
                              little soil are becoming increasingly common. Walls can also be
                              greened, often by climbing plants planted at ground level.</p>
