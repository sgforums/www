            <div class='col-md body'>The following article talks about conducting exercise for MRT and or bus bombings by terrorists. But don't they know that terrorists may instead use germ or bacterial agents (as in germ warfare/biological warfare) which is harder to detect?<br><br>Furthermore, what's stopping terrorists from bombing ordinary HDB flats instead of the heavily guarded MRT stations?<br><br>What they are doing is like fully focusing on the front door security while the backdoor is wide open.<br><br>=================================================<br>Singapore plans emergency exercise for MRT, bus bombings<br>By S Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : Singapore's civil emergency agencies are going to test their readiness to respond to multiple bomb attacks at MRT stations and bus interchanges.<br><br>A major exercise will be held over the weekend in the first two weeks of January next year, but the public will not be told in advance of the exact date, time and the venues.<br><br>Terrorist attacks on public transport networks in Madrid and London are a grim reminder that Singapore's transport network is just as vulnerable.<br><br>In fact, since the attacks, security has been beefed up at the train stations and bus interchanges.<br><br>January's exercise, involving more than 20 agencies, will test how quickly and effectively they can respond and get the public to cooperate should simultaneous bomb attacks occur on Singapore's train and bus networks.<br><br>Said Eric Yap, director of operations at SCDF, "It is important for the public to understand the kind of instructions that will be shared with them at the point when the service is disrupted and also the instruction for them to evacuate themselves to safety."<br><br>Among the scenarios to be tested are an explosion inside the train in a tunnel, an explosion at the train platform, a chemical attack at the train station and an explosion on a double-decker bus.<br><br>Civil Defence Commissioner James Tan said, "For the commuters involved in the trains and tunnels, they may experience momentarily some blackout situations, but they don't have to worry. We will have guides; we will have officials to guide them out of the tunnels."<br><br>A sense of realism will be injected into the civil emergency exercise, which will simulate a series of bomb attacks at four MRT stations and a bus interchange.<br><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force says when that happens, some MRT stations may have to be closed for a while.<br><br>There will also be MRT train disruptions which will extend beyond the affected stations.<br><br>And there will be ample announcements both within the stations over the broadcast media to inform the public of these inconveniences.<br><br>Both SMRT and SBS Transit will be deploying their staff to assist in the evacuation and to direct commuters to alternative transport services like shuttle buses.<br><br>Said Kang Huey Ling, deputy director (station operations) at SMRT Corporation, "Our staff are all first-aid trained. If there are any passengers who are not well, we will assist them immediately."<br><br>Civil Defence Commissioner Tan stressed that while commuters would face some inconveniences during the exercise, there is nothing like being prepared and well-honed for an actual event. - CNA /ct<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not sure if announcing such exercises are a good thing, sure in some ways it demonstrates our capability to the public and instills confidence.<br><br>but what if those sleeper cells decide to act on that day? They could use the legitamacy of the situation to really blow something up and get away with it since the law enforcement focus will be directed on the exercise on that day and the public will be "expecting it to happen" anyway.<br><br>And if really such an attack were to coincide with the exercise the public at large will be totally unaware and ignorant of the real danger and think "oh it's just another exercise" so nothing to worry.<br><br>And I find those spot checks at the MRT stations control station area to be a  security sham and work of total stupidity. Shouldn't these checks be conducted before the exits of the stations? By the time a potential bomber with a harversack full of explosives reaches the control station he would have achieved his aim already what is to stop him from pressing the button at the ticket gentry gates.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, there are many good reasons to focus on the transport system.<br><br>They are practising their transport and comms SOP during a terr attack.<br><br>IE say tehre is an attack on a HDB block. Many casualties. Can they get the casualties to safety out quickly and how many can they get out? Can they cope if the roads are clogged up with debris etc?<br><br>What about the people who will be using the Mobile networks? The networks will be jammed, etc.<br><br>These are also issues that will be faced by them when there is an attack on the MRT. Except that if the attack caused eg the collapse of the stattion and people are trapped underground, then their task is even more difficult. The MRT system will also effectively be down, eliminating one means of evacuation. This also means that the roads will be under a greater burden.<br><br>Let's not criticise for the sake of criticising.</div>

This is one of the kind which involve public awareness and participations and feedback in progressive stages.   There still alot of problems to solve out between inter agencies as the ops procedure revolves.<br><br></div>
