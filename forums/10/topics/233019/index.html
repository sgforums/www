In gist - it is a father who wanted to know if his son was liable for NS if he migrated. Most unfortunately , his son has touched the items which obligated him to be included into NS enlistment  so we will read of the unusual challenge from this father. It is not meant to say that his son should not do NS. His son is liable since he touched the 'fringe benefits' .<br><br><blockquote> This is just an excerpt:<br>Dear Madam,<br><br>1. Thank you for your reply below.<br><br>2. I have copied and pasted your reply to me (below) and used your email address found within your reply to address this email to you.<br><br>3. I have also pasted a news article that indicates the depth of a problem found in Singapore, that has cost young lives and blighted almost the entire school-going generation/s.<br><br>4. If you people consider the situation serious enough to desire a solution, I have one that will most likely work.<br><br>5. However, I have stopped giving free ideas, especially to people still engaged in hostilities towards me.<br><br>6. If you want this idea, which will greatly reduce school stress WITHOUT LOWERING THE PRESENT PRESSURE-COOKER STANDARD OF EDUCATION, OR REQUIRING A REDUCTION IN CONTENT OF SCHOOLWORK, then my son must not be liable for national service.<br><br>7. I am not interested how this is achieved; whether by allowing a renunciation of citizenship, changing the law on NS as it affects my son, or even changing the Constitution. Just do it.<br><br>8. After I get what I want, then I will give you what you want.<br><br>9. If you are interested, you know what to do.<br><br>10. If not, then you and the entire present and future school-going generations will just have to live with your choice.<br><br>Regards,<br>Robert Ho<br>26 Sep 01<br><br>(Below is your reply to me):<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>1. Please refer to your e-mail dated 10 Sep 2001.<br><br>2. This is to inform you that as a Singapore citizen, your son is liable for National Service under the Enlistment Act.Â Â  The holding of foreign citizenship does not absolve him from the liabilities under the Enlistment Act.<br><br>3. Under the Enlistment Act, he is required to register for National Service and apply for an Exit Permit to remain overseas at the age of 16Â½ years.Â  He is also required for National Service Enlistment at the first opportunity after turning 18 years, unless he is deferred from National Service.<br><br>4. Since your son is between the age of 11 and 16Â½ years, he is affected by the Immigration Bonding Scheme if you are applying for a Singapore passport to enable him to stay overseas.Â  Under the scheme, the parents are required to furnish a bond in the form of a bank guarantee to the Singapore Immigration &amp; Registration.Â  The quantum of the bank guarantee is a minimum of $75,000 or 50% of the total combined annual income of the parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher.<br><br>5. At the age the 16Â½ years, he is required to register for National Service and apply for an exit permit to remain overseas.Â  He can be granted deferment to complete his present course of full-time overseas study provided the required Bank Guarantee is furnished to MINDEF.Â  No further extension of deferment will be granted to him to pursue tertiary education unless he can commence the full-time University course before 17Â½ years old. The quantum of the Bank Guarantee is as stated above.Â  Once the Bank Guarantee has been furnished to MINDEF, the Bank Guarantee which has been furnished to Singapore Immigration will be released.<br><br>6. We hope the above information is useful to you.Â  You could contact Mdm<br>Tan at Tel no. 3733132 if your have any further enquiries.<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br><br>Leow Sui Lee (Ms)<br>Officer Commanding eServices Branch<br>Central Manpower Base<br>e-mail: lsuilee@starnet.gov.sg<br>http://www.cmpb.com.sg/<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: MINDEF Feedback Unit To: cmpb Cc: ho3@pacific.net.sg Date: 11 September 2001 08:57<br>Subject: Fw: Feedback via Gov.sg<br><br>Dear Officer-in-charge (Central Manpower Base),<br><br>Please refer to the email below and kindly assist Mr Ho accordingly.<br><br>Thank you and regards<br><br>Judy Tan (Ms)<br>MINDEF Feedback Unit<br><br>----- Original Message -----<br>From: To: Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 8:58 PM<br>Subject: Feedback via Gov.sg<br><br>On 2001-09-10 at 20:57:25,<br>The following information was submitted:<br>From Host: 202.156.208.236<br>name = Robert Ho<br>country = Singapore<br>submit_by = ho3@pacific.net.sg<br>message = Dear Sir/Madam,<br><br>1. We are a family of three consisting of myself, my wife and a 15 year-old son.<br><br>2. We are thinking of migrating to Australia.<br><br>3. My son was born on 4 Apr 1986 and is currently in Secondary 3.<br><br>4. If we leave after he has completed his 'O' Levels, ie. after Dec 2002, what are his liabilities with regards to national service?<br><br>5. Is he allowed to leave and if so, under what conditions?<br><br>6. Does he need to obtain Australian Permanent Residence first before he can leave?<br><br>7. If so, how does that change the conditions?<br><br>8. If he leaves for Australia and obtains PR, is he still bound by law to come back to serve national service?<br><br>9. What if he does not or is unable to come back to serve? Does that make him a criminal in Singapore?<br><br>10. What if, he becomes a Singapore criminal by not coming back to serve but subsequently obtains Australian citizenship, does he still remain a criminal liable to be charged any time he sets foot in Singapore even though he may now be an Australian citizenship?<br><br>11. Is there any monetary bond/guaranty/surety before he can leave? How much is it? How is it executed?<br><br>12. Under what circumstances will it be forfeited?<br><br>13. Please answer completely to every point I have enumerated point by point. Please feel free to elaborate.<br><br>Regards,<br>Robert Ho<br>10 Sep 01 </blockquote>I wondered what happened in the end...<br><br></div>

If the man in the letter decides to let his son defaults on NS. His son will have difficulty in the future if should his son wants to study in Singapore or work in Singapore because he could get rejected or even worse jailed for defaulting on NS.<br><br>I do know one person who bonded his son into NS while his son was an infant , migrated to Australia and then let his son default. So his son and him cannot step inside Singapore at all . The most they can do is take Malaysian airlines - go to johor and wait for relatives to go over the causeway for reunion dinner. They cannot take airlines which land in Singapore even for transit.</div>

He will not even touch the fringe benefits of Singapore which obligates him to serve NS.<br><br>Just like the son of my family friend.

If regulars in the army don't know how to be kind to people, they are creating more internal enemies than a soldier to fight for country.

Men in the Haredi community may choose to be exempt while enrolled in Yeshivas, a practice that is a source of tension,[1] though some yeshiva programs like Hesder provide opportunities for service, while Mechinot provide a one year course designed specifically to prepare students for their service period. - from wikipedia</div>
