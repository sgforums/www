How about elaborating to us what this so-called 'evidence' is that is lying 'all over this forum'? I don't see you doing that.<br><br>If that's not enough, you seek to aggrandize yourself by claiming that you're better than us 'whiners' by solving problems instead of adding to them.

These critics may not necessary be able to help even if they really want to.<br><br>I truly admire people with strong views and have strong convictions in holding on to what he or she believes in. Each person has his own right to his own judgment, but attacking others while stating your stand is not something ethical and appropriate.
