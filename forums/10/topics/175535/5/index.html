I left when I realised that Singapore was going to the dogs politically, socially and economically. Stuff is more expensive in Australia but if you know your way around you can still get things cheap and save a lot of $$$.<br><br>For the same price of a 5 room HDB flat in Singapore I bought a freehold house here with my own pool and backyard. Cars are cheap here but my BMW is even cheaper (free - paid by company) and yes, it's really shiok to drive down to the coast on weekends, wind down the windows and drive really fast down endless roads. What do my peers in Singapore do on weekends? Let me see, hang out in shopping centres, the same old cinemas, artificial beaches and stuck in traffic.<br><br>Some people complain about racism but I think those complainers have a part to play in it. If you refuse to assimilate into the system here, be prepared to stand out. Don't have to change your accent though. I still speak with Singapore accent. Just drop the lahs and lohs and speak slower and clearly. They have no problems understanding us.<br><br>After moving here and going back for holidays in Singapore, I realised that Singaporeans are sibeh CB one. Don't hold lifts, don't smile, no social skills, don't greet people. Everyone acts like they have a cactus stuffed up their bums.</div></blockquote>Australia is good, but too many frigging Singaporeans is moving over. Soon, it will be flooded with Singaporeans, especially your favorite cactus-stuffed-up-their-arse types.<br><br>Try north pole. It's colder out there, you don't have to pay for the plot of land and the fish is all yours.....<br><br>As long as you survive. (I don't think any Singaporeans can withstand the cold.)<br><br>The magic word is 'survive'.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
