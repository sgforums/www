More than leveling 4 hills and reclaiming the sea? </div></blockquote>What is so difficult to excavate the soil or leveling the ground ? What talents do we have to carry out land reclaiming ? To me it is a matter of simple commonsense issuing a tender inviting contractors to carry out the works planned on standard contract documents and engineering designs that our scholars do not even have to bother to design or originate.<br><br>The scholars don't even bother and let some Nishimatsus or Toa Habours do all the necessary ground works and at the end did not try to claim they are the ones who excavate and tunnel and reclaim the lands. I don't see the scholars have the talents to realise some marine clay without the relevant cofferdam will cause the surrounding to subside and eventually the whole highway to collapse.<br><br>This is how Singapore is run - claim credit for works done by agents and others but not the scholars who could not solve simple problems. No wonder when other Asian tigers are recovering we are still deep in recessions. When finally recessions are over scholars quicky claim and reclaim credits.<br><br>So don't bother to try to kid anyone or to impress Chiam See Tong to build HDB flats when it is on record that our scholars cannot handle simple safety measures not even after all the recommendations in the Hotel New World collapse inquiry when ministers solemnly told packed house of parliament that everything will be done to prevent another collapse.<br><br>So all the salmanisation will not impress anyone that we have all the leadership  talents in our scholars who are beyond emulation and one class above anyone.</div>

How did HDB charge the land costs?<br><br>Is not HDB charging flat prices at full market prices and then give a bit of discount to make it look like giving a subsidy.<br><br>In doing so, and forgetting to mention to parliament in reply to Chiam See Tong is not HDB practising creative accounting forgeting to mention that HDB had originally acquired lands at dirt cheap compensation and even paid for them with taxpayers' monies.<br><br>Had not HDB after acquiring the dirt cheap lands using power of state and transfered the acquired lands to state land office and let the state land office make the windfall profits and pretended to buy the lands at full market prices so that by giving a bit of discount it could say based on creatively given discount it is indeed subsidising flat prices or making a loss. (In any case no one knows given this creative part of the account as it is not shown to public)<br><br>If Chiam See Tong picks up the land at such creatively transacted market price, (as assigned to projects) then how do you expect him to compete with HDB who already made one ton of profit and passed such windfall over to state land.<br><br>Since you are so sure in all your salmanising denials of such creative profiteering by HDB, why don't you answer this question asked by all flat purchases of HDB in the first place.<br><br>It is not Chiam See Tong's fault for he is in the opposition who is not managing HDB. It is the duty of HDB to tell the truths and not hide the truths from the public. The flat purchasers I am sure are dying to know whether HDB has the right to charge them again after selling the flat the resale levies based on HDB claim to have given them subsidy based on market sale price e.g. $150,000 for a 3-rm flat or $200,000 for a 4-rm flat.</div>
