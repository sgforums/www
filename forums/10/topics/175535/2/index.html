The survey also found that Singaporeans were the most tolerant and Thais the most irritable.<br><br>Several Singaporeans that Today spoke to found the results bewildering. Ms Jody Lim, a 29-year-old marketing assistant, said: "It's a bit bizarre. I was always sure we were an island of complainers."<br><br>Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, from the National University of Singapore's Department of Sociology, suggested a possible explanation: "Internally, we tend to think of Singaporeans as easily annoyed. But in relative terms we may not be so bad. We tend to judge ourselves more harshly than we judge other people.<br><br>"For example, we wouldn't know if the Koreans or the Chinese are intolerant (in their own countries). We are confronted with Singaporeans all the time so we tend to think that Singaporeans are the worst kind. But when we compare ourselves across countries, we may be quite all right."<br><br>Another associate professor from the same department, Ms Paulin Straughan, suggested the response may be due to the possibility that Singaporeans face fewer irritations.<br><br>She said: "We have campaigns educating the public on social graces, such as the Keep Singapore Clean campaign. It may well be that these campaigns have worked."<br><br>For respondent Jonathan Siow, many questions simply did not apply to Singapore.<br><br>"The survey just asked the wrong questions. Public spitting doesn't irritate me because I don't see it," the 24-year-old student said.<br><br>"Ask how irritated I get when I meet the lift-user who lets the lift door shut in my face even as I wave my arms like a drowning rat. This must have happened five times this month. Ask me how irritated I get when Chinese New Year songs start playing everywhere next month."<br><br>But perhaps the last word should go to the Singaporean who, when asked to name an irritation, said that what was really irritating was filling out survey forms.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/92351print.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/92351print.asp</a></div>
