Tell me why not we are whinning here?  The greedy govt kept saying heavily subsidy to singaporeans; I don't think so.....We are born here, a pure singaporean, don't you think that we deserved a place stand here on this land? The donkey years of housing loan that is killing all of us.

Was able to pay in full after a few yrs. of working. Now all 5-rm are at least $300K (furthermore smaller even!).<br>Most couples now have to work till very old cos they are  struggling to pay housing loan. Also unable to downgrade cos the mkt. is still depressed. In fact a lot of pple lose money if they sell now cos they pay too high price.</div>

If I am not wrong, things in Australia are generally more expensive too. What is the cost of a CD in Australia now?<br><br></div></blockquote>Those going in there are using money to get in . Not easier - they hold bridging visas and their business must profit within 3 years for a certain amount.  Either that or they go study nursing or social work- because Australia requires nurses and social workers.<br><br>Australia has tighten controls on migration though .<br><br>My tax rate is 27% ( for holding one job and declaring my tax file number)  + 3.5% ( because I used a government subsidised place in university - 8k per annum for a masters but it will be paid off by next year )  . All in all 30% . After tax , I get back around 3.5k which is ok for part time work ( 3days per week)  and it is enough to let me live comfortably with money to spare since I have a mortgage tied to me there - but I am going to do another job now so I won't know how that works out . Tax rate is adjusted at each bracket - current bracket above 27% is 55k bracket last year if I am not wrong. I went up to 52k plus so I slipped under.<br>Best of all free stay in hospital last year for 3 days  because I was having pneumonia plus free treatment . They put me in a ward with air conditioning , feed me and let me use it like a hotel .   Only need to pay 23.95 for my inhaler , steroids and antibiotics<br><br>What CD? Compact discman? Made in China one - u can get for 69bucks from big w .</div>

She was a constant babbler of govt policy and really an excellent example of a yes-man, or rather yes-woman; (we must not be gender-biased.) She slimed all government critics as "whiners", "useless fools" and "imbecile traitors", such that some of the members, me included, got pretty infuriated.<br><br>1) It appears that you are beginning to stir the same stuff here. You claim that we people "don't lift a finger to help". How would you know that? Do you know the exact amount of money each critic donates to charity? Perhaps you don't donate any money, but who si to say the rest of us don't?<br><br>2) What problems have you solved?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it is not called whining . It is called  giving feedback .<br><br>How would the government know if something is not right if no one EVER gives feedback? I am sure some government servants surf the forums .<br><br>Secondly some of the feedback are also constructive criticisms . By whining that people are whining about policies - who is the far worse off one?  The whiner who complains that Singaporeans complain too much .<br><br>Thirdly , those who squash constructive criticisms can be likened  to  stagnant water - it breeds dengue mosquitoes and poison the population with dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever.<br><br>Therefore I say let people say what they want - even a negative comment can help with improvements in the system. No change means stagnancy and I don't think Singapore can afford to be stagnant at all .<br><br>If one person would worship any policy the government puts forth , therefore creating a standstill  ,as well as calling others whiners when they try to bring forth feedback - then I say that worshipper is not helping anyone at all and  he should remember the national anthem - Majulah Singapura (Onward Singapore) .<br><br>I think that person can equate to what I call sheep or cattle . Sheep/cattle  just go on mindlessly grazing . They don't think much - they mate and have lambs - they eat and sleep  and THEY WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SHEPHERD Whether they like it or not because of the dogs who they are afraid of . THEY ARE THE SCOURGE OF THE COUNTRY and are worse than complainers with no valid complaints  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relevant excerps of Khaw Boon Wan's speech to Feedback Unit's Annual Conference on 21.1.2006:-<br><br>QUOTE:<br><br>It is not possible for a person or a group of people to know all, hence the value of public consultation.  This way, we tap on the experiences and views of the people who will ultimately be impacted by the policies; good comments and suggestions can then be incorporated and implementation details can be refined.<br><br>I have already scheduled a meeting with the Health Feedback Group to pick their brains on this.<br><br>But feedback is not just for my Ministry.  Feedback and public consultation are now part and parcel of all major policy formulation.  They are important parts of our political landscape.<br><br>Some public consultations are more successful than others.  My own experience suggests that there are 4 important ingredients for a successful public consultation exercise.<br><br>First, keep the idea focused and simple.  What is the problem and what is the policy objective?  Try not to complicate the idea with multiple objectives and secondary concerns.  Mass communication is never easy, and mass communication of a complicated idea is unlikely to succeed.<br><br>Second, the best policy option is often the simplest.  Resist complicated policy options, but also avoid a purist or academic approach.  Keep the policy simple, but allow the implementation to be flexible and responsive.<br><br>Third, do not brush off criticisms or suggestions.  Probe deeper for the motivation behind such feedback.  If the motive is sincere, try to understand why the person is making the comment.  If the concern is valid and the suggestion practical, incorporate it even if you did not originally think of it yourself.  Consultation is a mutual learning experience, and we must resist the "Not Invented Here" syndrome.<br><br>Fourth, spend time and be patient.  Public consultation is not a chore.  It is in fact an opportunity to build strong community bonds and enhance mutual understanding among people.  We will not always achieve consensus of opinions.  But even when we end up agreeing to disagree, a good public consultation exercise should still end up bonding us as one community, one people.<br><br>In closing, let me commend the eight Feedback Groups for your hard work and commitment.  Your diligent efforts will not go to waste.  They will be carefully considered by the relevant Ministries.  I am sure you will not be disappointed.  We hope that more Singaporeans will come forward to join you, to offer their views and suggestions, and help make Singapore a better place for all.          UNQUOTE<br></div>
