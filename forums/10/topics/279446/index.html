            <div class='col-md body'>In Thursday's edition of The New Paper, the cover story was about a gay male teacher coming out of the closet on his blog. He removed the post after his students stumbled across it, even though he did not give them the address. It was rather naive of him to think that it'd work as planned, even though I applaud his coming out.<br><br>The spokesperson from his school contradicted himself. He was quoted as saying that the school was "mindful of the views of stakeholders, especially parents who would not be placing their children under the charge of <span style="font-style: italic;">a teacher who advocates homosexuality</span>", and then added that "he has clarified that <span style="font-style: italic;">he had no intention of advocating homosexuality to students</span>".<br><br>What was more disturbing was the Ministry's response. It "does not condone any open espousal of homosexuality by a teacher through any form" as "(teachers) are often seen as role models by their students". Doesn't anyone find this ironic? Is MOE preaching tolerance only in the areas of race and religion? What about the idea of being true to oneself, which I probably wouldn't find in any of their textbooks?<br><br>No teacher should be found guilty of impressing homosexuality on students simply on the basis of his orientation until it is proven so. Besides, I presume that no-one is preaching that heterosexuality is wrong (while the opposite is true), but rather acceptance and tolerance. (There are a few things happening in other countries that go beyond this that I don't agree with, but let's stick to the topic of this thread)<br><br>P.S. Turns out that he took down the post for other reasons.</div>

Gays are supposed to be normal. By coming out of the closet and letting the world know, whats the point ? "I'm gay" ! Big deal. Glorification of Gays or telling people that he is abnormal ? Then again maybe he just wants to write down his thoughts on his blog and sincerely thought that his students don't visit his blog at all.</div>
