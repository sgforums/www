I would be confused and surprised, how come now the education sector already changed so drastically?<br><br>Will you be surprised too? You will be, right?<br><br>The response by MoE, and the school, is just a common, expected response from one of main institutions of our society. As long as our wider society cannot fully accept homosexuality, then this main pillar will reflect this view.<br><br>Education is very 'pure'  and conservative sector. Everything concerning kids is 'conservative'. You see even violent movies are supposed to be moved to midnight because kids are supposed to sleep already and not watch TV by that time. We as a society want to protect our kids.<br><br>The response by MoE is very telling:  "...does not condone any open espousal of homosexuality by a teacher through any form" as "(teachers) are often seen as role models by their students"<br><br>From there it already captures the whole essence, the position and the idea, the whole notion that education is 'conservative' , teachers are 'role models' , and kids are to be 'protected', and this is true everywhere in the world.<br><br>I would be very concerned, the day MoE reversed this position. But it will never happen.<br><br>As to the debate about the nature of homosexuality, lets just say.....its irrelevant. It's not what the scientists say, and it's not whether it is right or wrong, acceptable or not acceptable, but rather, it is what the neighbourhood uncle, aunty, your next-door neighbour say. What is the perception in society. People still think homosexuality is a 'deviation'. This is what matters. As long as the wider view of the society remains like this, the education sector, as a bulwark, will reflect this view, for sure. And that is what they are supposed to do.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not think that homosexuality in teachers would eventually lead the students to become homosexual as well. It would depends on the sexual preferences of each indiviual although there is no doubt that the parents would push the blame to that teacher if their shild so happen to be homosexual... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
