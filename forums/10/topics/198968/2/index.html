The more locals go into our public hospitals, the more the government has to subsidize. A recent change in funding policy has seen the budget given to public hospitals fixed at a certain amount each year. That means the best way to earn money in a public hospital is not to have any patients at all and not to do any operations. As KBW said, if our public hospitals have no patients, he will jump up and clap hands.<br><br>Administrators run the hospitals now, not doctors who are just employees. The CEOs of hospitals are MBAs and the few who are doctors haven't practised medicine for years. Consultants do not 'blindly follow' the administrators, they are required to do so....<br><br>Hospital administrators have to bring in private patients to balance the hospital's finances. What choice do administrators have? The subsidy from the givernment is fixed. If more subsidized patients come to you (and you cannot refuse them), when patients demand to have more attentive service (in comparison you can easily wait up to 12 hours in a British NHS hospital on weekends...I have seen it), how are you going to balance the books and meet patient demands? Staff are overworked...do you increase staff? Where's the money coming from? You cannot increase charges or patients will kpkb. You cannot employ more staff because the government won't give you more money and anyway, there is a directive to cut manpower by 2% each year. So staff becomes disillusioned, unhappy and leave, which exacerbates the problem for remaining staff.<br><br>Hospitals like TTSH with a vast majority of local subsidized patients have a big challenge to remain in the black. Remember that if your hospital loses money, doctors will not have salary increase. Keep doctors' salaries low, they will leave for the private sector or overseas hospitals. Talk is cheap, what would you do differently in their shoes?<br><br>Everyone is looking for a better life, a higher salary. Doctors are the same...If you can earn more in the private sector with less work and more autonomy, being your own boss...why not move out?<br><br>If local patients who can afford it go to private hospitals instead of public hospitals, that would be <strong>very welcomed </strong>by hospital administrators, the Minister and staff of public hospitals. With fewer patients, they can finally offer the better care that they want to provide but are unable to due to lack of resources.<br><br>If you can afford to go private, perhaps it is more ethical for you to go, so that poor patients can get better care in public hospitals.<br><br></div>

The problem is that if Singapore wants to earn money from foreign patients, you need all these forms of accreditation. And we do need the money now...foreign patients pay full rates and subsidize our local patients in subsidized classes. If Thailand's hospitals have a certainb accreditation standard, we cannot afford not to have it or we will lose out to them.<br><br>But it is true that these accreditation programs take up too much of our time and reduce the resources available for patients.

You cannot employ more staff because the government won't give you more money and anyway, there is a directive to cut manpower by 2% each year. So staff becomes disillusioned, unhappy and leave, which exacerbates the problem for remaining staff.<br><br>Hospitals like TTSH with a vast majority of local subsidized patients have a big challenge to remain in the black. Remember that if your hospital loses money, doctors will not have salary increase. Keep doctors' salaries low, they will leave for the private sector or overseas hospitals. Talk is cheap, what would you do differently in their shoes?<br><br>Everyone is looking for a better life, a higher salary. Doctors are the same...If you can earn more in the private sector with less work and more autonomy, being your own boss...why not move out?<br><br>If local patients who can afford it go to private hospitals instead of public hospitals, that would be [b]very welcomed </strong>by hospital administrators, the Minister and staff of public hospitals. With fewer patients, they can finally offer the better care that they want to provide but are unable to due to lack of resources.<br><br>If you can afford to go private, perhaps it is more ethical for you to go, so that poor patients can get better care in public hospitals.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>"As Khaw said if govt hosp have no patient ......."<br><br>Can the quote be true?If there is no patient,the govt has to close shop.All the staff would lose their jobs.The minister would be in trouble!<br><br><strong>One solution to the problems is means testing.</strong></div>
