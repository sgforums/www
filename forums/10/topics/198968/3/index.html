So USA certainly does not respect human rights then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The Institute of Medicine (IOM) says the American emergency medical system is in crisis - it is seriously short of resources, fragmented and splitting at the seams. Ambulances are commonly turned away from emergency departments, it is not unusual for patients to have to wait for hours and/or days for a bed. The whole system would fall apart if it had to deal with disasters or outbreaks.<br><br>According to Dr. Rick Blum, President, American College of Emergency Physicians, the IOM report stresses issues which have been around for a long time. The main problem facing emergency medicine in the USA is reimbursement, overcrowding, ambulance diversion and lack of on-call specialists.<br><br>For 40 years there has not been an in-depth study of America's emergency medical system, said Gail Warden, head of the Hospital Based Emergency Care Committee, IOM.<br><br>Among the list of problems in the report, are:<br><br>-- Emegency rooms are seriously overcrowded<br>-- Patients have to wait for a long time to be admitted<br>-- Ambulances are often turned away from emergency departments<br>-- A chronic shortage of specialists to provide care many emergency rooms<br>-- Ambulance transport to emergency medical services is generally fragmented, chaotic and inconsistent<br>-- Emergency rooms are badly prepared for children<br><br>The report stresses that money has to be allocated for emergency departments so that the number of specialists can be boosted and overcrowding reduced. It also says emergency medical services need to cooperate more so that the whole system operates more like a team.<br><br>As the number of cases attended rises, the number of hospitals with emergency departments has been falling. In 2003 emergency departments received 114 million patients, 26% more than in 1993. However, in 1993 there were 703 hospitals and 425 emergency departments which were closed down by 2003.<br><br>Emergency departments have become the safety net for the growing number of America's uninsured. Emergency departments are often not paid for treatment carried out on uninsured people.<br><br>Although emergency departments do and are expected to play a major role in dealing with disasters, they only received 4% of the Â£3.3 billion the Dept of Homeland Security awarded in 2002.<br><br>As the number of uninsured people in the USA approaches the 50 million mark, emergency departments are having to care for a disproportionate number of uninsured cases. About 50% of emergency care is uncompensated. No other developed country has such a large percentage of its population without any medical cover at all. In the UK, for example, the number of people without medical cover is zero - the same in most of the European Union and Canada.<br><br>The situation in emergency departments has become so dire that health professionals and administrators are no longer concerned about long term issues and planning - all the focus is on coping with the day-at-hand as resources dwindle and patient number rise.<br><br>It is not uncommon in America today for hospitals to simply close down their emergency department - not to have one at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>WASHINGTON Â— The nation's emergency medical system Â— from the 911 centers that take phone calls for help to the emergency rooms that have become primary treatment centers for millions of Americans Â— is in a dangerous state of crisis, says a new series of landmark reports.<br>The Institute of Medicine on Wednesday released the Future of Emergency Care reports, which were prepared by a 40-member board after a two-year investigation. The IOM advises the government on science, medical and health issues.<br><br>The reports warn that the U.S. lifesaving system is not only failing to handle daily emergencies but also could break down in the face of national disasters, including hurricanes, disease outbreaks or terrorist attacks.<br><br>"We are not prepared," says Brent Eastman, a board member and chief medical officer at Scripps Health in San Diego. "We struggle to survive day-to-day."<br><br>Nels Sanddal, board member and president of the Critical Illness and Trauma Foundation in Bozeman, Mont., agrees. "To ramp up" to treat high numbers of patients, he says, "we have to have backbone."<br><br>The reports say that, on average, in every minute of every day an ambulance carrying a patient is turned away from a hospital on "diversion," when an emergency room says it's too full to take more patients.<br><br>That must end, says Arthur Kellermann, director of the Center for Injury Control at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. "We cannot let the most time-sensitive portal in the hospital get gridlocked."<br><br>The IOM reports detail how hundreds of thousands of lives are affected every year by EMS deficiencies that are not obvious. "What the public perceives and what is real, in many cases, there is a disconnect," says Gail Warden, president emeritus of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who chaired the panel. "In most communities, there is a crisis under the surface."<br><br>Many emergency rooms barely can handle their daily patient loads, children don't always get good care, and the quality of rescue services is erratic, the reports say.<br><br>And geography determines survival.<br><br>"There is a wide disparity," says Shirley Gamble, a United Way board member in Austin. She cited a 2003 USA TODAY probe that found a 10-fold difference between major cities in cardiac arrest survival rates.<br><br>The reports say that by following the lead of those cities that save more lives, entire regions can raise the quality of their care.<br><br>Improvements to emergency medical services, Eastman says, "should be built on islands of excellence that exist today."<br><br>(http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-06-14-er-care-report_x.htm)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Almost a quarter of patients waiting for diagnostic tests, such as CT scans, have been left waiting for more than 13 weeks. The Department of Health has published waiting times for the 15 tests for the first time and said three quarters of them were carried out within 13 weeks from referral. But nearly a quarter of patients - 203,114 out of 799,594 tests - were waiting longer than 13 weeks.<br><br>The average wait for a non-emergency patient is seven and a half weeks for an MRI scan and two and a half weeks for a CT scan.<br><br>The NHS carries out 12 million diagnostic tests every week, said the department.<br><br>Health Minister Andy Burnham said: "The NHS is at last identifying and tackling these waiting lists.<br><br>"By revealing them, we have also identified the progress that NHS staff have already made in reducing waiting times for the 630 million tests they carry out every year."<br><br>Later Tony Blair will meet NHS bosses to discuss progress being made towards the Government's goal of a maximum 18-week waiting time for hospital treatment.<br><br>The diagnostic tests are seen as a key part of that target as delays can cause a major hold-up between referral by a GP and hospital treatment.<br><br>(http://uk.news.yahoo.com/12072006/140/pressure-nhs-waiting-times.html)<br><br></div>

There is no compromise of medical care. Drugs can be injected to control the seizures and there is no difference to the patient whether he is in a bed or lying on a gurney. If necessary, oxygen can also be given on a gurney.<br><br>In the Emergency Room of top hospitals in the UK and US, I have seen patients waiting for a bed for hours as well. The problem is not unique, if there is a spike in demand for hospital beds for whatever reasons, patients will have to wait for a bed.<br><br>In a national crisis, eg. avian flu epidemic, it is possible to create more beds by postponing all surgical operations apart from those that are needed for life-threatening conditions. Patients who are stable can be transferred to convalescent homes to create bed space in acute hospitals.<br><br>But apart from such national crisis, it is difficult for hospitals to ask patients who are recovering to go home earlier because others have a greater need for their beds.<br><br>Khaw Boon Wan made an interesting observation during the SARS crisis. At that time, TTSH was the SARS hospital and no operations were done. After the SARS crisis, he was expecting a sudden increase in cases due to the backlog of operations. However, they did not come. People were so afraid of SARS and going to TTSH that they carefully considered if they really needed to see a doctor and have that operation. Many decided against it. Khaw Boon Wan thinks that we are over-servicing our patients ie. many operations done were not really necessary and many patients could be treated outside of the hospital.<br><br>Singaporeans must recognize that resouces are limited and doctors have to do what they can given the resources. If we expect more, we must be prepared to pay more, but Singaporeans have made it clear they do not want to pay more for healthcare.</div>
