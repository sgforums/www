            <div class='col-md body'>True, and may I remind all that it was LHL who removed the free medical benefits for healthcare workers even though we are exposed to higher risk of infections, because (in his words) 'just because you are a gynaecologist doesn't make you pregnant'. Pity the poor doctors and nurses who came down with SARS...<br><br>Since the government treats doctors like any other workers, why should doctors be expected to accept any less in terms of remuneration? If you want first rate medical treatment, you must be prepared to pay for it too.<br><br>Doctors and nurses can move around and sell their skills to whoever pays more. Similarly, patients can shop around for whoever charges least. As long as you remember, 'yi fen qian, yi fen huo'. That unfortunately, is the name of the game now. As I said, you cannot expect to pay $25 and want your hair to look as good as the TCS actress who went to David Gan.</div>

That is debatable, to say the least. But it does definitely result in lots of paperwork(to "prove" that the necessary steps demanded have been taken), which eats into time and effort that could have gone into proper care of patients.</div></blockquote>Correct - the assumption is that accreditation results in better care.<br><br>Let's break this down into several aspects of hospital accreditation.<br><br>1. Care itself - some are eveidence-based medical care and are standards heaped onto hospitals so that they can compare themselves with one another - eg. if you came in through the ER and was diagnosed as having penumonia -----&gt; the standard will be expected to receive IV antibiotics within a certain time period, I think it's 4 hours - I forget 'cos Docs precribe as soon as they make a diagnosis. It is the hospital "process" of translating that management decision into action, ie. pharmacy gets order, process it correctly, sends the right drug to the right patient in the right location, have the nurse set the patient up for IV antiobiotics and then actually delivering it to the patient ......<br><br>So - accreditation also measures and improves care - when you have to report how many percent of patients presenting to ER with pneumonia receive antibiotics within 4 hours of arrival/diagnosis. If you suck - you will try to improve the process.<br><br>2. Documentation - things that get done or not done - no documentation means not done, right? Can argue until the cows come home but no proof - accreditation is done on hospital procedures.<br><br>3. Ethical aspects - how the hospital handles patient information, protect the patient from medical research studies, etc. So improves the patients' rights for care, not from exploitation.<br><br>4.  Recommendations for standardized short-forms: many docs and ancillary staff use a lot of shortforms and these cause errors. Medical mistakes hurt or kill patients - these clerical errors also monitored by accreditation agencies. They have proscribed standard shortforms to avoid these erros and hospitals get ding on it because of personnel habit - thus training and education is needed. Things will change over time when newer docs/personnel are imbued with the right attitude and right training for this.<br><br>5. Training/accreditation - eg. CPR - BCLS/ACLS certification for essential personnel. Prior to accreditation many docs did not have routine Basic/Advanced Cardiac Life Support Training but I heard that JCHAO (or JCI for Singapore) monitors that so training invariably is conducted to satisfy the criteria for accreditation. Of course this does not mean that care improves but logically it should. Why if you don't know what you are doing then you don't know. If you were taught it before - at least if you encounter it the first time - you will have a basis to act and to know where to find the solutions to problems.<br><br>Accreditation is not the solution for all hospital ills but allows standards to be established for comparisons.<br><br>Some are evidence-based changes in hospital proceudures. I think inevitably some good comes off. Documentation is time-consuming, so costs will definitely go up. But is there any other way of moving into the next phase of development??</div>

The increased presence of foreigners and resentment against them for various reasons is also tearing our social fabric apart. If I ever have kids I will not want to raise them here nor want them to be Singaporeans even because I do not want them to serve national service. Not for this hotel. Even myself, I won't be very motivated to answer any mobilisation because nearly half the country is made up of foreigners. And most of these foreigners are not going to stick around long enough for their offspring to serve national service. Heck, national service is just one more reason why they do not want to stay.  There is a ticking time bomb in the midst of all these and god help us when it finally goes off. I'm relatively happy with my lot but am not blind to these issues that our government is trying to ignore by burying its head into the sand.</div>
