            <div class='col-md body'>NOL and SIA have reported recently their lower earnings due to the higher fuel costs despite turning in better performance all round. The local transport companies should also be facing the same problems but should they be allowed to increase the fares again?<br><br>Last year, they chose to increase the bus fares despite an increase in profits. This year, with the fuel prices skyrocketing and facing a loss in earnings, what are the chances of these corporations absorbing the cost? For sure, they are going to submit their application and the PTC (public transport council) will approve it.<br><br>What i am trying to say is, in times of gloom and pressures from global conditions, we understand the need to increase fares to cope and sustain the business. But they have used up the goodwill by asking citizens to pay during good times for the purpose of profitability. This is PUBLIC transport, we are talking about, not a private-run enterprise.<br><br>By the way, just do away with all the extravaganza and useless additions to cut down the operating expenses. What we need are just the basics, getting from point A to B in a timely and safe manner. The extra comforts are good if free but we never ask for it in the first place.<br><br>By the way, will the PTC readjust the fares downward if the fuel cost goes down? Sadly, i don't think so. There is only one way for prices to go and that is up, Up, UP!!</div>

I see the term "extravaganza and useless additions" may be too strong and have eclipsed the main thrust of my post. But you are right in saying that the mobileTV generates revenue for the bus company.<br><br>I am more concerned with the EZLink system. When it was first implemented, SBS touted it as the state of the art technology and is supposed to weed out cheaters which were so prevalent during the era of TransitLink.<br><br>However, just in case people have forgotten, after spending the millions of dollars implementing this technology, SBS is still complaining of cheaters in the system and being drained off immense profits yearly. They have put on bus conductors to come up once in a while to check on passengers EZLink cards and told their drivers to be vigilant (but hey, isnt it going back to square one and is the same as TransitLink).<br><br>The EZLink system does not come cheap and the cost must have been passed on to passengers. Do you all think it is a successful system? Surely you all must have read of EZLink system overcharging passengers (many more did not bother to check, me included, and SBS should actually study how much more it has pocketed instead of complaining).<br><br>As for the air-conditioning, it is good but seriously, if i have to make a choice between air-con and non air-con, i would choose the latter if it can reduce the entire household transportation expense by $200-$300 (assuming non air-con is 40% cheaper). May not seem a lot but to lower income groups, the money can come in handy.<br><br>So we have to determine what is a need and a desirable. The blind pursuit of "world class, first class" will push the standard of living but our salary cannot keep up with it.<br><br>There is also the VLS system which SBS use to track its buses but has it improved the efficiency, waiting times, buses bunching together? Traffic jams, not SBS fault, but if it is not effective, why implement it?<br><br>All these things cost money and failed exercises will simply mean passengers pick up the bills as they have to recoup losses and make profits. Hence the term "extravaganza and useless additions".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oxford mushroom,<br><br>just tell me something. Are you for or against the increase in bus fares for the purpose of profitability? As i have said in the first post that because high oil prices is a global condition and if we need to raise fares, go ahead. But don't squander away the good will from us by increasing fares during the profit years. SBS is a listed company and that is where there is a conflict of interest between<br>looking out for the public and shareholders.<br><br>As for air-conditioning, it is a matter of preference. Some people cannot do away with it, but some people can forsake it if it means paying less. So it is up to individual if air-con is a luxury or not (twenty years ago, aircon IS a luxury but now, i don't know).<br><br>I agree with shutterbug that any increase in fares should be for a better service, in terms of waiting times and more frequent buses so we don't end up packed like sardines or not able to get on the bus during peak hours. If the service or satisfaction level remains the same, there is no cause for increase, period.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>just tell me something. Are you for or against the increase in bus fares for the purpose of profitability? As i have said in the first post that because high oil prices is a global condition and if we need to raise fares, go ahead. But don't squander away the good will from us by increasing fares during the profit years. SBS is a listed company and that is where there is a conflict of interest between<br>looking out for the public and shareholders.<br></blockquote>Profitability is the goal of all commercial companies. As I said, the alternative is to nationalize it and run it as a not-for-profit organisation. If that is what you want, then you should call for nationalization of transport companies.<br><br>As a commercial entity with a responsibility to account to shareholders who have invested in its shares, any bus company would want to increase its profits year on year, if not at least maintain it.<br><br>You cannot blame a lion for eating lambs if you want to keep lions as pets.<br><br></div>

The example you have given is correct but just to add on a bit more, take note that transfers to each bus service must be made within 45mins.<br><br>Say, Sv154 has taken 30 mins journey time and the last trip Sv97 arrives within 15 mins waiting time, you are eligible for the cap. But if say Sv 154 takes 35 mins and Sv97 arrives in 20 mins, you still got to pay.<br><br>Whatever it is, i understand the fact that SBS is a listed company and should be concerned with answering to its shareholders. But it is still a PUBLIC transport.<br><br>The idea of us chipping in with the extra 0.5 cents or 1 cents for each trip so that SBS can turn in a rosy report and ANSWER to shareholders doesn't go down well with most people, esp. heartlanders.<br><br>The purpose of us making a huckus is to make known our displeasure of such an event. I do not advocate anybody staging demonstrations, boycott or putting up white elephants (PM Lee says it is ok but Home Minister say cannot). The government wants feedback and participations from Singaporeans and through forums and newspapers, i believe Singaporeans have given a lot of feedback.<br><br>Hopefully, by applying the appropriate pressure, we can have a say in some of the policies being implemented. SBS is free to look after the corporate side of things but ultimately, it has to be sensitive to the hardships of passengers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry I didn't read every topic. Yes, oil prices will rise and affect the profit of transport companies. But by how much? Here we are talking about public transport which operate within singapore. If SMRT have other businesses in other countries affected by oil price. We the workers in Singapore have to bear the cost?<br><br>Singapore is small, so how much OIL is used for the *distance we travel daily to our work place, is it justify? The low income group are already suffering &amp; every cents counts. I can save 10 cents on coffee, tea or food, but I can't stop going to work. Public transport is not luxury.<br><br>Maybe I should buy a bicycle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
