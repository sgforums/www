The example you have given is correct but just to add on a bit more, take note that transfers to each bus service must be made within 45mins.<br><br>Say, Sv154 has taken 30 mins journey time and the last trip Sv97 arrives within 15 mins waiting time, you are eligible for the cap. But if say Sv 154 takes 35 mins and Sv97 arrives in 20 mins, you still got to pay.<br><br>Whatever it is, i understand the fact that SBS is a listed company and should be concerned with answering to its shareholders. But it is still a PUBLIC transport.<br><br>The idea of us chipping in with the extra 0.5 cents or 1 cents for each trip so that SBS can turn in a rosy report and ANSWER to shareholders doesn't go down well with most people, esp. heartlanders.<br><br>The purpose of us making a huckus is to make known our displeasure of such an event. I do not advocate anybody staging demonstrations, boycott or putting up white elephants (PM Lee says it is ok but Home Minister say cannot). The government wants feedback and participations from Singaporeans and through forums and newspapers, i believe Singaporeans have given a lot of feedback.<br><br>Hopefully, by applying the appropriate pressure, we can have a say in some of the policies being implemented. SBS is free to look after the corporate side of things but ultimately, it has to be sensitive to the hardships of passengers.</div></blockquote>Dun come and create unecessary unhappiness<br><br>Be it within 45 mins or whatever, SBS has the fare cap $1.90 regardless of travelling time<br><br>I can take Sv 154 to Macpherson Rd from Clementi and transfer to Sv 23 at Jln Kolam Ayer to Tampines, the 154 fare is $1.35 and Sv 23's fare is $1.00 (Aft rebate)... But instead of deducting $1.00, SBS just deducts $0.55<br><br>That 45 mins time period is no more, aft ez-link card was implemented which can track the exact time you alighted the bus, you are given 30 mins to transfer with rebates from the time you alight.. Meaning if I alight from 154 and transfer to 97, I'm given another 30 mins</div>

"....And that may not be fair to transport operators, whose shareholders are not necessarily wealthy"<br><br>2. "....If commuters want lower fare, they may have to manage their expectations - meaning they will have to make do with lower standards of service."<br><br>My take on point 1. Rubbish. Who are the majority shareholders who own millions of shares? Do they care about the poor chaps who dont own any shares but depend very much on public transport ? Are we not "robbing" the poor to feed the rich???<br><br>My take on point 2. Blackmail. This stupid statement is always repeated whenever they want to raise the fare. What service are we talking about when we take a bus or MRT ?? We are quite happy now. Are they saying they will make it worse if the price does not go up ?<br><br>It is time the PAP MPs come out and speak for us.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Quote Ms Irene Ng, ST 13 May<br><br>Â“PAP MPs will continue to speak up boldly on behalf of our residents, address their needs and help refine government policies so as to achieve a better life and a better futureÂ” </span></strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As someone who uses public transport, I do not want bus fares to rise too. However, it is true that our bus and train fares are very low compared to those in the west, whilst the level of comfort we enjoy is as good as, if not better, than those in western nations.<br><br>Assuming that the requested fare hike falls within the formula used by the government, the only alternative to a rise in fares is to tax car owners more to subsidize public transport.
