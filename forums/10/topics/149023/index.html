            <div class='col-md body'>As a country progress, it should experience a wholesome developement in both technologies, services, banking and other sectors. However, our country likes to use the tactic of putting all eggs in a basket in the past. Just look at the industry policy in 1990s, gov insisted that we should not spare any effort in semiconductor sectors and property / construction sector. We poured in so much money and open so much courses in Poly and Uni to crater for these star industries; as a result we experienced a sudden over supply of "skilled labour" when the semicon industries moved out, construction / property market crashed after 1998.<br><br>Today, our gov is again pushing for Biomedical and Service sectors. Well, let just hope that the history would not repeat itself again.</div>
