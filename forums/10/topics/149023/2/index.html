            <div class='col-md body'>I have made numerous trips to USA and Australia over 10 years. It is interesting to note that public toilets (i.e. parks, theme parks, rest stops and shopping malls, etc.) over there are far much cleaner than those in Singapore. Despite boasting having world class facilities and number one positions, we cannot even keep basic amenities like toilets clean and in working order. So much for having a world class education system. Maybe we focused too much attention and resources on big items to inflate our egos and massage our insecurity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Basically, degree holders are (What i call) "Society Pass" nowadays.<br><br>In fact, we cannot say if a degree holder is useful or not because it really lies on individual degree course of studies and the individual knowledge a person and realise out of a course. If the course is useless, it produce useless people. If a course is useful, it still can produce useless people who are walking on the streets jobless or being too unlucky enough to be there. Of course there are still some which are the more high end ones doing well out there.<br><br>There's simply no "Too many degree holders" now becoz like i said, its a Society Pass where people will one recognise you when u're a graduate. Juz like the guy who mention above, saying about the plump Malay lady who ask them to remove the application of those are are not degree holders.<br><br>People are too qualification orientated now. Whether or not the employee can work or not, it muz be judged through whether u can *pass* you exams in degree or not. It's actually also becoz of the "Boss saying rights" it has in the economic now where employers are choosing A class diamonds out of the bag.<br><br>Now if we turn around and look back in the 80s, unemployment rate were high but ones the MNCs came into Singapore, WE the empolyees has the rights to CHOOSE our job becoz we hve demands power thru the lack of skilled workers.
