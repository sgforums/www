Hence why I used to have a bunk mate from Chengdu and why a Malaysian friend of mine who grew up in Singapore since young had to give up his PR status and return to Malaysia.</div>

Some more its not just between 2 countries when u consider all the possible source countries people wanting to apply for sg cert. Like this, which new immigrant can assure singapore that they will be citizen and work like a citizen in many singapore companies and stay loyal to singapore when conflict of interest can arise when their mother-countries are involved in a situation with singapore?<br><br>virtually impossible to rule out conflict of interest in this respect by giving dou-citizenship unless we so so so no other way already.<br><br>roots with a person's mother country can not be cut so easily as humans are beings of the sentiments.

If 5 I may consider all 5.<br><br>As long as Malaysia dun make it difficult for people to become PR I think IDR can be promising.  A home with not a longkang but a real view.<br><br>I am interested to explore more options for PR and what it really takes to get that PR and if there are any hidden costs.  I need not be loyal to Malaysia. I also need not be unloyal to malaysia. I just use PR as a form of membership. I promise to contribute nonetheless to Malaysia. I will promise to buy property in Malaysia , spend money there as I stay there more and spend money there. That to me is the benefit to Malaysia.  I hope Malaysia focus on the money and investment angle and welcome singaporeans to be PR there so that I can also apply and have a fallback, backup plan. As my Malaysian colleague cum singapore PR said, Sg is tiny and if anything happens in future, got a backup plan. Having said this, I must iterate that my views are merely what-if scenario based. As HP said, Anything is possible. Thus I must learn from our sg PRs to own as many PR as possible where members have his privileges.<br><br>Friends, to be PR of IDR, must I own any property  there? how much for processing and admin fees and how to the turnaround to get that cert?<br><br>Please advise. I am totally serious about this.  I kiasu and see how my PR colleagues have enjoyed being PR and benefitting from the system and giving competition to our ricebowls, I wan to enjoy the same also.<br><br>Any sg'rean now a Malaysia PR? I wan to learn more from you. Please enlighten me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to add,<br><br>here are my all time favorite memberships I am  considering to apply:<br><br>1. IDR PR.<br>2. Australia PR.<br>3. Taiwan PR but not sure if this is possible since TW is not really a country or is it just a republic of china???? I ignorant leh. But if can, I can be as vocal as TW ppl and take part in their mass ppl activities. I no mean protest. I mean mass activities like mass wash backside activity.<br><br>4. Thailand .<br>5. Vietnam.  Maybe can profit from being PR and do business there.<br><br>To me, PR is just for personal gains. But I will also contribute to the economy. So, fair game. Even tho I may compete with their rice bowls. But I can use the reason called globalisation to silence them.</div>
