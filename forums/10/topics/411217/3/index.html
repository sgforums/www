              <p>By uprooting the trees, you need to remove the whole govt out of it, and plant a new seed on it, this need the whole citizens of Singapore to do it, you think all think like you?? We are indeed lucky that our govt create campaigns to stablise our country and improve on it, if you look around other countries around our region, where got help to build up a campaign by pouring money into it, all goes into their left and right pocket, if too much, they still got the lower left and right pockets. Now you understand why these countries politicians like to wear 4 pocketed shirts, batiks or whatever brand</p>

              <p>Now,as in modern days,ppl say it takes courage to admit ones mistake or apologise.I started to wonder are these ppl simply a bunch of cowards,thats why they dont apologize even if they do make mistakes?Or are they still living in their "good old days" n cannot catch up with times?</p>
