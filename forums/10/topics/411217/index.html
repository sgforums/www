              <p>I do agree that government is not up to standards in different areas. But they are ethical unlike other governments. They are smarter than other countries but not that smart also.</p>
              <p>But government comes from the public so if government is corked up, so is the public.</p>
              <p>The poor in singapore is too poor to complain in internet because they cannot afford internet access.</p>
              <p>The middle income, and the below middle income, and those who are earning alot but they also spend alot are those who will likely to be in the internet and hurling scoldings towards the government.</p>
              <p>I say these groups of people they earn their tough situation for themselves. They are more than enough resources for Singapore, from poor to rich, to handle problems in their life. They are too used to good things that good things become taken for granted and they chase higher and higher demands. Patience is no longer a virtue anymore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans do have a few capable people who is able to wake up the whole stupid Singaporeans, hence I am not worried about Singapore future at all. But frankly speaking, these few people have not really put their best effort yet, that is why Singapore today is still in corked up state, not comapred to other countries. Other countries are even more corked up than us with their violent stories and corrupting system.</p>
              <p>As I said, Singapore will surely be able to get rid of its stupidity that is still occuring rampantly in bits and pieces here and there. THe public need to wake up its ignorances first and see that all the solutions are already laid bared in front of them. The problem is not so much with the government.</p>
              <p>A good government will is a emergent property of a good public. A lousy government therefore also come from a corked up public.</p>
              <p>To see if a government is good or not. One just have to walked into a local forum like the speaker corner and see the standards of netizens in their talking and debating skills. One also listen to what people are talking in the coffee shops and public spaces to know what kind of the government will emerge from these people.</p>
              <p>Singapore is quite corked up now, but it has enough few talented people to spearhead the rest of us into realm of reality. If a model happy country can ever be achieved, Singapore will be one of the 1st 4 to become.</p>

              <p><br>US leaders can canvass great vast of sponsorship from their big corporation and the rich, the influence the power generated is completely different, there is two kinds of thing that a man or woman need inorder to be fully success, one is money, the other is power, being a politician can enjoy both of it, just like the US president, he holds big power and get respected all over the world, he got big US corporation sponsorship in his projects and achievements, during any US presidential election, the senator can canvass over multi millions of dollars in their coffer, now you know why Obama do not want to take those wall st guys head on, cos he still need their support and certainly, he knows his present position can be fulfil without them.</p>
              <p>Our is different, Govt do not canvass for anything from corporations, they have to prudent in their way of governing, as some said, running singapore is like running a business, in way, i do not oppose to that, cos without sponsorship, you need a business and yet politician mind to keep this place in good shape and to improve on it, and to do that, you got to get good and smart people, and therefore you have to pay them well. And no doubt they got power, but certainly, cannot match what the US got. A MD can only show his power in the company, out of it, he is just a layman, but govt is different, anywhere he goes, he still hold power, that is what induce man to take up politics, to have money and power, once this is reached, hopefully they can govern well, and so far, Singapore govt is not bad.</p>
