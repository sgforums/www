            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Singapore is looking at increasing the number of university places to cater to 25 percent of its cohort by 2009 a year earlier than the original target.<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Among the key issues discussed at the first meeting of the Steering Committee that is looking into the expansion of the university sector here, is how to grow the university enrolment by another 8,000 to 9,000 students.<br><br>This means an additional 2,400 university places for each intake, in order to hit the next target of catering to 30 percent of each cohort by 2015.<br><br>Currently, the university cohort participation rate is 23.5 percent.<br><br>RearÂ—Admiral (NS) Lui Tuck Yew, Minister of State for Education, said: "We have been working with the universities to make sure that we are able to gradually increase these numbers without affecting the quality of education, without impinging on the quality of the university experience.<br><br>"So in terms of facilities and manpower in the universities; longer and mediumÂ—term manpower needs of the economy, all these (factors) point towards meeting the target in 2009, instead of 2010."<br><br>In deciding the universityÂ’s landscape, RADM Lui said the Committee would consider three guiding principles: To sustain the longÂ—term economic and manpower needs of Singapore, to enhance the highÂ—quality and reputation of the universities, and to ensure the new institutions add richness and diversity.<br><br>But he added Singapore would not convert any of its polytechnics into a publicÂ—funded fourth university.<br><br>He said: "We looked at the UK example, the transition of a polytechnic to a fullÂ—fledged university was indeed a very difficult one. Fifteen years after they started, none of the polyÂ—universities have made it into the top 50. Most of them are in the bottom half of their own university ranking.<br><br>"Our polyÂ’s a distinct feature of our education system, a source of our strength in our economy, painstakingly built up over many years and thatÂ’s something that we should retain and enhance. But having said that, the polys are also attracting better quality students more students who could make their way into JCs are now opting for the polys. And so to hit the 30 percent participation rate, I think we can look into ways at how we can proportionately increase the number of places for these poly students, compared to what is the case today."<br><br>Adviser to the Steering Committee, Dr Tony Tan, said the revamp is fundamental for SingaporeÂ’s progress as it will enhance economic activity and enable aboveÂ—average growth rate.<br><br>He said: "In a knowledgeÂ—based economy, the production of skilled manpower, particularly university graduates is fundamental. In fact, if you look at cities around the world, whether in Boston or whether in Zurich or San Diego, youÂ’ll find that in such places with adequate number of universities, adequate number of trained manpower, these (people) are very attractive to companies.<br><br>"In this modern world, Â’economic activity follows talentÂ’ and so the expansion of the university sector is to fulfil the role of the universities as a driver of the Singapore economy, and thatÂ’s a major change from a paradigm which we have followed in the last 20 years... (In) 15, 20 yearsÂ’ time, I am, myself, much more worried that the lack of university graduates will be an impediment and a drag on our economy.<br><br>"The whole world, every country in the world, is searching for talent and if we develop our university sector well, we will not only be able to provide enough places to satisfy the aspirations of Singaporean students and their parents, it will be an attraction for students from around the region, from other parts of the world. You will create a livelier Singapore; you will enhance our economic activity and in general, enable us to grow at aboveÂ—average rate."<br><br>Over the next few months, members of the Steering Committee will study this issue carefully and more details are expected to be released early next year.<br><br>Â— CNA/so<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

I myself have applied for Masters in Engineering (next jan intake). I heard from a friend of mine (he used to work @ NUS) that studying Masters full-time is better than studying part-time as full time is more recognized in the industry. what do you feel?<br><br>Btw, whats your opinion on the job scope for Masters Holders? Any significant advantage (financial as well as others) over degree holders?<br><br></div>
