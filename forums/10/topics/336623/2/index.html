              <p>recently, along joo chiat and geyland 3 uncles died standing and 4 get into stroke becos of PRC XMM. ya, they get what they needed. Also recently, 1 uncle 71yo, lost 200,000 to a prc gal of only 26yo, sold his 3 rooms flat, separate from his wife and children just to be with her, but she had long gone after taking the money. And along the way, some lost 20k, 50k, 80k, etc etc...if u lost in share is understandable, cos you may gain too, but this is one way of no return just because of one hole. Why not just spend and forget on many holes to pick from!!!</p>

Per month will be 31 x $70 = $2170, all registered person are Singaporean Unkers, damn all unkers still very rich hor...why they dun give their childrens, wife or grandchildren leh??? $2170+meals+gift+paid this and that may come up to $4k to 5k per month. All just becos of a hole and two mountains. Damn wasted.</p>

When i kpoh asked them why they keep PRC mistress here??? they told me got LOVE between them, WTH!!!, when uncle not around, PRC gals also bring men to her room.

              <p>To be fair, i think Aunty Gong Li is a good woman, she just quietly come and go, she dun mess up thing here and there too. It is her private life, she has her choice. She dun bother us and make silly remarks or unpopular news. I  welcome her to be a Singaporean. At 40+, she still hv a good complexation and nice figure that me xiao mei mei also envy, not to mention many singapore werewolve's unkers, most will be dripping saliva.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She herself is a multi- millionaire, so i dun think money is an issue to her, but of course the more the merrier, unlike those pennyless who are here on social pass conning away our Unkers' CPF money until unkers really need CPR to survive. Last month alone, near my place, got 1 uncle died and 3 seriously stroked for overdose of sex drugs.</p>

              <p>Was getting on the bus at parkway, there was this very fat, and kinda rich looking Singaporean Auntie with make up. She shoved everyone out of the way just to get on the bus first.Then she stood at the doorway and refused to budge. And she act like she own the bus and lean against the pole blocked the whole path.  I had to tell her excuses me 3 times, and she pretended she did not understand and stood there blocking all the passengers. Finally someone else moved to let me through otherwise no one else can board the bus. And the bus was empty behind. Lately there are a lot of Singaporean wo behave worse than the Indian bangala working here. PRC and local Chinese are equally bad and low class in behaviour. And Locals have that entitlement attitude and that's really low class</p>
