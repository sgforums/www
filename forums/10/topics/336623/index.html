              <p>THREE months after her no-show at a citizenship ceremony here kicked up a storm, Chinese actress Gong Li showed up at one on Saturday to collect her Singapore identity card.</p>
              <p>The 43-year-old got her citizenship certificate from Member of Parliament Lee Bee Wah at a ceremony held at the Teck Ghee Community Club along with 149 other new citizens. She stood, with her right fist on her chest, and recited the pledge.</p>
              <p>The actress, who was born in east China's Shandong province, had applied for Singapore citizenship earlier this year and was supposed to collect her pink IC in August.</p>
              <p>However, she was not in Singapore at the time as she was filming a movie overseas, said her close Singaporean friend and celebrity hairstylist David Gan.</p>
              <p>She raised the ire of some Singaporeans over her no-show at the ceremony in August, with some questioning whether she was showing disrespect to her new country.</p>
              <p>In 1996, she married Singaporean tobacco businessman Ooi Hoe Seong, 57.</p>

              <p>To be fair, i think Aunty Gong Li is a good woman, she just quietly come and go, she dun mess up thing here and there too. It is her private life, she has her choice. She dun bother us and make silly remarks or unpopular news. I  welcome her to be a Singaporean. At 40+, she still hv a good complexation and nice figure that me xiao mei mei also envy, not to mention many singapore werewolve's unkers, most will be dripping saliva.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She herself is a multi- millionaire, so i dun think money is an issue to her, but of course the more the merrier, unlike those pennyless who are here on social pass conning away our Unkers' CPF money until unkers really need CPR to survive. Last month alone, near my place, got 1 uncle died and 3 seriously stroked for overdose of sex drugs.</p>

              <p>the most stupid thing is that all had redemption coupons.. and there was more than enough to go around because not all coupons were bought.. the people knew it, yet it was like a mad rush not unlike those surges you see at disaster areas when NGOs try to distribute food to desperate victims...</p>
              <p>and the same people almost rioted when a booth wanted to give out little face towels...</p>

              <p>Looking at the papers yesterday .. about foreign workers murdering each other. And out of the 11 recent cases, about 5-6 are due to PRC. And even among the PRC, they cannot stand each other for those own gross habits.The other aspect is that the Peidu Mothers are coming here with the "excuse" to give their children "better" education but actually is here to con stupid local. Its absurd to think that a country as big as china have an education system that is not 1000times better than Singapore? Only a stupid local will think Singapore is better than China.</p>
              <p>So the PRC should learn to reflect more and stop blaming other people. They can jolly well stay in their own country.</p>

              <p>With foreigner services and products, i hv no doubt feel the qualites hv dropped. Things dun last nor taste good than last time. Sooner or later, Companies will still move out as Running a company will not base entirely on labour cost, the cost of operating in term of utilities and taxes will burden the companies, and in their calculation, it is still worthwhile to shift to a third world countries. Then as a dependent of Foreign investment, without natural resources, we got nothing left except maybe open up the red light districts with array of international gals and gays. Then maybe I will be richer.</p>

              <p>recently, along joo chiat and geyland 3 uncles died standing and 4 get into stroke becos of PRC XMM. ya, they get what they needed. Also recently, 1 uncle 71yo, lost 200,000 to a prc gal of only 26yo, sold his 3 rooms flat, separate from his wife and children just to be with her, but she had long gone after taking the money. And along the way, some lost 20k, 50k, 80k, etc etc...if u lost in share is understandable, cos you may gain too, but this is one way of no return just because of one hole. Why not just spend and forget on many holes to pick from!!!</p>
