              <p>At this point in time, the PAP Parliament has not made a squeak about this matter, and both Chiam and Low have not table questions demanding an independent inquiry to this disgraceful situation from a leadership team that pride itself as having THE Talents and THE Foresight to protect OUR  money.</p>

              <p>The US Goverment needs the Congress to approve the stimulus package. Here, a prata seller and a bunch of so called "advisors" readily approve the money in what? 11 days? Who they work for? And what are their political leanings? PAP. Might as well do away with a prata man guard and a bunch of nobodies to guard our reserves so that at least we save a few mil in wages rather than install a yes-man who readily agrees everything the PAP Govt wants him to do.</p>
              <p>At least in the US, the oppos readily questions every part of any bill proposed by the President and will not hesitate to vote against if its goes against the interest of the nation. Here, we got 3 idiots who sit in Parliament and make some polite noises, but when push come to shove, they kept quiet, suddenly unable to speak. With this kind of opposition MPs in Singapore, we might as well have an all PAP parliament.</p>

              <p>history so far seems to be written by the ministry of education lol<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> and from that i can see a heroic president who "forged bravely ahead" despite public concerns</p>
              <p>as for failing the people, he did at least did what 66% wanted didn't he?</p>

              <p>OTC will probably question LKY and HC about the $100 BILLION

              <p>At this point in time, the PAP Parliament has not made a squeak
              about this matter, and both Chiam and Low have not table questions
              demanding an independent inquiry to this disgraceful situation from
              a leadership team that pride itself as having THE Talents and THE
