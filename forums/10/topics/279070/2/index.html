How many times have you heard this? When it comes to ability, it doesn't matter which school you come from.<br><br>The problem is some people just cannot accept that others are from so and so school. My question is... why not?! At the end of the day, everyone comes out with a university degree and come out slogging while paying all the high taxes. At the end of the day, we are all Singaporeans.<br><br>Seriously, it doesn't mean anything even if you graduate from any top JCs, or from any top Unis. Life is much more than that, yet some people just do not have the necessary EQ to understand this simple reasoning.<br><br>I have never given disrespect to anyone from a different school, nor extra respect for someone from a better school.

RJC students are the academic elites. Sports School students are the athletic elites. Arts School students will be the arts elite.<br><br>We are a meritocratic society. These students got good grades by their own merit. If you work hard at what you're good at, you can be an elite too. If you just can't take it that somebody will be better than you are, then you are a loser, like that ex-RJC student who couldn't take the pressure.</div>
