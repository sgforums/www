            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO...<br><br>We are looking at a better standard of living.  Therefore we should be looking at either increasing the salary or reducing the cost of living.  Either way should work.<br><br>Both got it pros and cons and to reduce the scope of the discussion, let's limit it to domestic issues and leave out the foreign balance of of payment or competitiveness etc.<br><br>High paying salary may not be a good thing as it may lead to a high inflation rate.  If everyone got higher pay... then all the standard of living will still be the same.  The ultimate aim is to have a better standard of living.... ie to put it bluntly, a bigger bang for the buck.<br><br>The major items tat SGP are not competitive in are the land cost and the hosuing cost.  Both are hold up artificially... however, a gradual reduction is avocate.  as reduction will have other impact.<br><br>Another area is going into niche markets.  It is either u r the lowest cost producer, or u have a niche.  no where in between.  We are out of the low cost producer arena.... therefore we should go for the niche.  We need to built up the knowledge base and the branding in the specific areas that we wanted to develop in.  For example, SGP has be known of oil refinery, Swiss are known for their watch making.<br><br>This is the view that the govt has put up for the next few yrs and it is from 10,000 ft above.  Speed of execution and implementation is the key and we are lagging in this area.<br><br></div>
