            <div class='col-md body'>All investment are only business decision. For a businessman to commit a investment decision, there must be a high degree of confidence that his investment will give the target yield. Sadly, all these confidence in Sg seems to be evaporating off overnight after 2000 the dot.com bubble burst.<br><br>It is evident that even Sg gov investment firm are reallocating their investment weightage in Sg. They had even stated that more investment will be going towards Europe, jap and china... the weightage for Sg investment in their portfolio will dropped from 49% in 2005 to 33% in 20xx in their annual report. How can we expect our potential foreign investor to throw in their $$$ when our own Sg gov investement firm is trimming the investment at home?<br><br>Just take some examples;<br><br>1. Korea had managed to emerage as a come-back kid after the 1997 Asia Crisis. A lot of korean MNCs are investing heavily on their home turf to support the local economy growth. Samsung had committed USD19Biliion to bulid a large wafer / LCD manufacturing park just outside Seoul by 2010.<br><br>2. Taiwanese are not far behind. A taiwanese companies lead by Acer, AU and few other giants are committed to spend SGD56billion to open up a high tech industrial park in Taichung just in October 2005. It is projected that the first factory will open its door by late Aug 2006 (barely 10 mths down the road), and expected to ramp up to full production by mid 2007.<br><br>3. Jap companies are joining hands to build mega fab projects in mainland Jap despite of the rising manpower cost.<br><br>4. Even Intel has been investing back in States for their newly upgraded 65nm Fab.<br><br>So what are our action plan??<br><br></div>

They also have a huge knock-on effect in that the number of resturants/pubs/shops/supermarkets have increase.  However the cost of living has gone up (rental increase) plus those ppl working in the old traditional industry suffers as they are obsoleted and got to move out.  You can literally see it... the bulding of the high tech industry park on the right hand side of the road and simultaneously the demolition of the "old tech" factory.<br><br>These are the co-lateral demage that they have to take to reinvent themselves constantly.  The way to avoid this is to move to a peaceful country or trained urself in the art of warfare.<br></div>

I think these industries will still be hot after 20 years but the subject may change. So IT professionals who used to do COBOL will be outdated if they don't keep up with the times. Right now there is alot of competition with cheap IT people from India but there is a great demand for a new niche of IT: that of bioinformatics.<br><br>I agree with you totally....individuals have to put in effort to look for a niche but in addition, they will have to keep looking even when they have found one, as technology and needs change with time.<br><br>As for aunties, I thought of your idea a long while back. It will not work as long as Singaporeans have access to cheap foreign maids who work 7 days a week without leave or off hours.

Some may not want a live-in maid with nothing to do.  Also singles who share a condo... will not want a maid around.<br><br>Overall cost is lower, 3 times a wk @ 20 = 240.
