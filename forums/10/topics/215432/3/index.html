            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i14.tinypic.com/2vs43v6.jpg"><br><img src="http://i14.tinypic.com/48d3kon.jpg"><br><br>in terms of Purchasing Power Parity [what is produced] China has already passed Japan and is well on its way to equaling the U.S.A.<br><br>During the past five years America has accounted for only 13% of global real GDP growth, using purchasing-power parity (PPP) weights.   The real driver of the world economy has been Asia, which has accounted for over half of the world's growth since 2001.   Even in current $ terms, rather than PPP, Asia's 21% contribution to the increase in world G.D.P. exceeded America's 19%.    But current $ figures understate Asia's weight in the world, because in China and other poor countries things like housing and domestic services are much cheaper than in rich countries, so a $ of spending buys a lot more.   If you want to compare consumer spending across countries, it therefore makes more sense to convert local currency spending into the $ using P.P.P.Â¡Â¦ rather than market exchange rates.<br><br>Asia is running a combined current-account surplus of over $400 billion, implying that it is contributing much more to world supply than to demand. If America's demand stumbles, the growth in Asia's exports and output would also plunge, so the story goes, but is this true?<br><br>Since 2001 the increase in emerging Asia's trade surplus has added less than 1% a year on average to the region's average growth rate of almost 7%.    Contrary to the perceived view, the bulk of Asia's growth has been domestically driven.<br><br>It is true that domestic demand (investment and consumption) has grown more slowly than G.D.P. over the past year everywhere except in Malaysia (see chart 1). But in most cases the gap has been small, especially in China, India, Japan and Indonesia.<br><br>It is true that exports account for 40% of China's GDP, but those exports have a large import component; only a quarter of the value of China's exports is added locally. The impact of a slowdown in export growth would therefore be partially offset by a slowdown in imports.<br><br>It is therefore true that China's GDP growth has come mainly from domestic demand, which has been growing by an annual 9% in recent years!<br><br>Is China's consumer spending feeble?   Several recent reports highlight that according to official figures spending has fallen from 50% of nominal G.D.P. in 1990 to 42% today. But this partly reflects an even stronger boom in capital spending.   Real consumer spending has been growing at an average annual pace of 10% over the past decadeÂ¡Xthe fastest in the world and much faster than in America (see chart 2).<br><br>There is also good reason to believe that official figures understate consumer spending in China because of their inadequate coverage of services ChinaÂ¡Â¦s GDP was re-evaluated.   Purchases of homes by the Chinese have risen rapidly since they were first allowed in 1998, but these are also excluded from the figures.   If they are added in total household spending has not fallen as a share of GDP.<br><br>Is Chinese savings as high as we all believed?  The savings of Chinese households has in fact fallen from 20% to 16% of G.D.P. over the past decade. The main reason why China's total national saving rate looks so high (at close to 50%) is that Chinese companies have been saving a much bigger slice of their profits.<br><br>The I.M.F. estimates that in Asia as a whole (including Japan as well as the emerging economies) real growth in consumer spending has averaged a healthy 6.3% a year in 2005 and 2006. This suggests that Asian consumers can help sustain fairly robust GDP growth in Asia even if America's economy takes a dive.<br><br>Not only is growth in China and the rest of Asia chiefly domestically led but America's share of Asia's total exports has fallen from 25% to 20% over the past five years.   Regional trade links within Asia have also deepened thanks partly to growing Chinese demand.   Goldman Sachs reports that five years ago China's imports for domestic use were only half as big as those for the assembly and re-export of products, but now they are roughly the same size.   So strong domestic demand in China sucks in more imports.<br><br>China's exports to America have fallen from 34% of its total exports in 1999 to 25% now (adjusting for the re-exports which are made through Hong Kong).   Chinese exports to the European Union are now almost as big as those to America and are growing faster.<br><br>H.S.B.C. estimates that slower American growth will hurt China, India and Japan much less than it will the smaller Asian economies, such as Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, that are more dependent on foreign demand. China, India and Japan account for three-quarters of Asia's GDP and so, given the deeper regional trade links, they should help to support demand in the whole region. If America's GDP growth slows next year to 1.9%, from 3.5% in 2006, as HSBC expects, then Asia's growth is tipped to slow from just above 7% this year to just below 6% in 2007. Weaker exports will badly hurt some industries, but overall, the region will continue to grow at a reasonable pace.<br><br>Could Asia withstand a sharper American slowdown? Goldman Sachs estimates that if America's G.D.P. growth drops to zero by the end of 2007 then China's annual export growth could plummet from 26% in early 2006 to a decline of 2% by late 2007.   After taking account of the impact of slower export growth on imports and domestic demand (i.e. slower growth in investment), Goldman Sachs estimates that China's G.D.P. would still expand by 8%.  That is significantly down from this year's growth rate of over 10%.<br><br>China is today tightening policy so as to slow down its runaway economy: weaker external demand could be partly offset by reversing these measures.<br><br>if America suffers a slump, the economies of China and the rest of Asia would slow, but they are unlikely to be derailed.   More importantly, the steady shift of wealth to the East has moved to the point where it is not only unstoppable, it can be self-sustaining.   Therefore, the East has moved from dependence on the West to independence from the West, already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has arrived in the southwestern Chinese city of Nanning in Guangxi, a day ahead of the ASEAN-China Commemorative Summit.<br><br>He said ASEAN-China cooperation is of strategic importance and has opened up many opportunities.<br><br>Mr Lee is also optimistic about expanding Singapore-Guangxi collaboration.<br><br>Arriving on Sunday on his first visit to Guangxi, Mr Lee was given a red-carpet welcome at Nanning airport.<br><br>Guangxi's Vice-Governor Li Jinzao was there to receive Mr Lee.<br><br>Mr Lee then met Guangxi's Party Secretary Liu Qibao, who asked for Singapore's support to develop what he termed the "One Axis, Two Wings" strategy - a proposal which Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is expected to elaborate on in the next few days.<br><br>One of the wings would involve setting up the Pan-Beibu Gulf Economic Cooperation Zone, stretching from Chinese Beibu Gulf south of Guangxi to several countries in Southeast Asia.<br><br>The other wing is the Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperative which includes China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand.<br><br>As for the axis, the Party Secretary spoke of setting up an economic corridor from Nanning to Singapore with road and rail links.<br><br>Mr Lee said the proposal makes strategic sense and will be something Singapore will fully support.<br><br>But he pointed out that it will require effort as it involves a wide area.<br><br>Still, he said, it is something that can be progressed upon year by year.<br><br>As for the development of Guangxi's ports, Mr Lee said Singapore firms like Temasek Holdings are interested.<br><br>And, Singapore would like to explore how it can work with Guangxi to expand its port facilities.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee also met Yunnan Governor Xu Rongkai.<br><br>China hopes that investment and opportunities will come to Yunnan province and Guangxi, through Guangxi's links with ASEAN.<br><br>On Monday, leaders from the 10 ASEAN countries and China will meet for the first time in a commemorative summit.<br><br>They will take stock of developments and chart the course for future development, including the set-up of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area.<br><br>When that is established in 2010, it will become one of the world's biggest free trade areas, with a combined market of 1.7 billion people.<br><br>China-ASEAN bilateral trade grew 20 percent annually over the past 15 years, reaching 130 billion U.S. dollars last year, 15 times the figure in 1991. China is now ASEAN's fourth largest trading partner and ASEAN is China's fourth largest as well.<br><br>The trade volume is expected to reach 200 billion US dollars by 2008, two years ahead of schedule, as construction of the China- ASEAN free trade area is surging ahead.<br><br>Under a free trade framework agreement, by 2010, China and six old ASEAN member nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- will impose zero tariffs on most normal products, while China and the other four new ASEAN members -- Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam -- will do the same in 2015.<br><br>The World Bank has predicted that China-ASEAN free trade area, upon completion, will turn to be one of the most influential powers in the Asia-Pacific economic rim.<br><br>China and ASEAN leaders are gathering in Nanning for a high-level summit meeting on Monday, with the aim to pursue regional free trade and enhance political mutual trust.<br><br>Chinese experts on international studies believe that the summit to mark the 15th China-ASEAN Dialogue Relations will push the China-ASEAN strategic partnership to a new level.<br><br>Six of the 10 ASEAN country leaders have already flown to the city by the press time for the summit include prime ministers of Cambodian, Singapore, the Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia and president of the Philippines. Leaders of the remaining ASEAN members are expected to arrive here late Sunday or Monday.<br><br>This is the first time leaders from China and the ten ASEAN member countries to convene in China. They are widely expected to chart a future direction of China-ASEAN relations in the coming years.<br><br>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will hold bilateral meetings with the ASEAN countries leaders respectively on the sidelines of the summit.<br><br>The third China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit are to kick off on Tuesday.<br><br>By 1991, China established diplomatic ties with all members of ASEAN. It became ASEAN's all-around dialogue-partnership country in 1996. Currently, China and ASEAN are bent on cementing the " strategic partnership oriented to peace and prosperity".</div>

"<br><br>"The China Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Company (CSSD) is a S$75-million joint venture between the Singapore consortium, SSTD (65%), and their Chinese counterpart, China Suzhou Industrial Park Company (CSIPC) comprising 11 state-owned enterprises mainly from Suzhou (35%). It is commissioned to develop an industrial township covering an area of approximately 70 square kilometres. The total cost of the township is estimated to be S$30 billion and it takes about 20-30 years to complete. When fully developed, the township will be able to support a population of 600,000 and provide employment for more than 360,000 people. In November 1994, three consortia led by Keppel Group were set up to develop utility plants in the township. It included a massive S$4.5 billion power plant with a generating capacity equal to almost all the electricity consumed in Singapore in 1993.<br><br>By June 1998, four years after the initial launch of the Suzhou township project, it became clear that the loss-making developer CSSD could not expect to make money in the near future (The Straits Times, 18 April 1998; 19 June 1998 ). The Singapore consortium invested about US$155 million into the CSSD (The Straits Times, 10 July 1999).
