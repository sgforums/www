              <p>Gao Ning deserves his coach but to lose a first round against a mediocre player and then result in Lee's sacking. I cannot agree.

              <p>Granted that a coach would have been helpful in battle analysis but mind you, this was the FIRST round. Opponent was mediocre at best and Gao Ning was supposed to be the "Republic's top player". If Gao's loss was attributed to the absence of a coach and resultantly in Lee's sacking; way too harsh.</p>

              <p>Ridiculous! Oughta crucify the guy responsible and hang him in public! But he whomever is responsible, should be grateful it was not me in charge, but MP Lee who stood up for the player, hid nothing, and showed her displeasure courageously on our citizen's behalf.</p>

              <p>Get your facts right, I implore you :D. Antony's fate was not decided before the games as explained by LBW. That was just some lame excuse concocted to appease the mass outrage at her decision. You didn't catch that?</p>

              <p>I agree with you the need for accountability but for Antony and Lee to know of their plight from a 3rd party and no discussion with them initiated by LBW before that......u second that? Not even discussion with table tennis offcials. U agree with that?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems LBW doesn't need any reasons or excuse to do anything. She can close down any organisation or sack anyone. I am impressed. She closed down a school owned by STTA just barely 2 days into her role as President of STTA and dismissed the whole team in the school overnight - without any explanations or compassion for the staff. No thoughts spared for the staff and other stakeholders, nor the amount of resources that went into setting up the school to provide academic opportunity for the elite athletes. The dismissal was executed in a similarly distasteful and unprofessional manner. Now one month into the job, she is sacking key staff in STTA.

              <p>his role, amongst others, is to ensure that every player/coach/team member's needs are taken care of. if he did not do that, more so for a player, then the consequence is more serious.</p>
              <p>whether GN plays the world #232 or #23 is immaterial. he must have the best support he needs, and be in the right frame of mind to compete. he did not get it.</p>
              <p>when he is asked to reapply for the job, it is not sacking. my company, whenever they undergo (major) reorganization, routinely ask us to reapply for the job. the objective is to get the best person for the job. it happen twice in the last 4 years already. one only worries when he is not the best person for the job becos of the various shortcomings he has, or becos he skive a lot. otherwise, he shouldn't worry.</p>

              <h1>Ms Lee Bee Wah: A new broom sweeps indiscriminately</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Monday, 25 August 2008, 8:20 am |</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">TOC Op-Ed</span><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Choo Zheng Xi / Editor in Chief</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Mr
              Ng Ser Miang, Singapore’s only representative on the International
              Olympic Committee, highlighted the arrogance of Member of Parliament
              (Nee Soon South, Ang Mo Kio GRC) Lee Bee Wah’s decision to fire
              Singapore table tennis team manager Antony Lee succinctly: “I’m quite
              puzzled as to how a decision like that can be made by the Singapore
              Table Tennis Association (STTA) president, who has been in office for
              just over a month.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">That Ms Lee, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">who took over as STTA president only last month,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> feels that she has personal ownership over the table tennis team is
              undoubted. Using the personal pronoun in her interview with the Straits
              Times, she said: “I have a new team and will have a new CEO and
              technical director”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Ms
              Lee’s transposition of the authoritarian instincts of the People’s
              Action Party (PAP) into the sporting arena highlights the ugliest
              characteristics of the party. She has in one fell swoop turned the mood
              over Singapore’s first Olympic silver sour, putting personal pique over
              national interest, running roughshod over people far more qualified
              than herself to impose a unilateral decision that very obviously lacks
              the support of those with a deep stake in Singapore’s sporting success.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Ms Lee was right to ask for accountability in the fiasco that left </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">’s
              top men’s player Gao Ning on courtside alone, without a coach, during
              his match with unfancied Croatian Tan Ruiwu. Gao lost the match 0-4. It
              is unfortunate that Ms Lee has chosen to overreact and create a larger
              fiasco by making a public example of Antony Lee without consulting
              table tennis officials. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Integrity, accountability</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">More
              damningly, this incident speaks poorly of her integrity. She did not
              have the courage to admit that the Gao Ning fiasco was the reason she
              fired Mr Lee. Asked by the Straits Times if this was the reason she
              fired Mr Lee, she said it was not and added that “</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">she just wanted to ‘let the matter rest’.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">If
              we take Ms Lee for her word, she has to explain to the country why she
              fired the Singaporean manager of our only team to win an Olympic silver
              – and this after a 48-year drought. The only other conclusion to draw
              is that she is cravenly trying to damage control the fallout of her
              rash action. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Mr
              Ng’s criticisms of Ms Lee’s rash actions carry great weight. Unlike Ms
              Lee, Mr Ng has devoted much of his life to the development of
              Singaporean sport. He was a former national sailor, and is currently
              the patron of the Singapore Sailing Federation. As the vice-president
              of the Singapore National Olympic Council, he was a key player in
              securing </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">’s bid to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Highhandedness</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Having
              been the president of the STTA for only a month, Ms Lee can have
              minimal understanding of the team’s dynamic at best. More
              realistically, she is completely ignorant of the efforts put in by Mr
              Lee, and the rapport he has built with the team. To add insult to
              injury, she chose to fire Mr Lee without telling him to his face. Mr
              Lee had to find out about his dismissal from a ‘third party’, as he
              himself described it. “I’m surprised she did not tell me directly. That
              would be the courteous thing to do. I have to hear this from third
              parties. After doing so much for </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">,” Mr Lee told the Straits Times, “I deserve a little respect.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Ms Lee, however, said that “</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Antony</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> is welcome to apply for the position when we ask for applications.” (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/News/Home/Story/STIStory_271371.html">Straits Times</a>). It is ironic that in her “bold” public act, what has been foregrounded is her personal cowardice and highhandedness. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Perhaps
              Ms Lee did not want to follow the example of how her PAP colleague,
              Minister for Home Affairs Mr Wong Kan Seng, bungled the Mas Selamat
              fallout with a half baked apology. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">It
              is sad that she did not perceive the real lesson behind the public’s
              low estimation of Mr Wong’s insincerity. Mr Wong chose to exonerate the
              head of the Internal Security Department (ISD) without subjecting him
              to a disciplinary inquiry. Ms Lee has fallen on the other extreme of
              the same fundamental problem. By not subjecting the team manager’s
              oversight to a disciplinary inquiry of sporting officials with a
              clearer understanding of the sporting arena, she has shown a similar
              disdain for due process. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The
              lesson for our political leaders is this: due process in ascertaining
              guilt or exoneration matters more than well-publicized fist thumping.
              In Ms Lee’s case, that fist thumping is all the more galling for her
              inexperience and arrogance. </span></p>

              <p>Well, depends to whom you give the glory for the medal. Singapore worked for 48 years, STTA have been working for don't know how many years, then come this Silver medal. and the players, come here one year and get silver medal in olympics, they must be good, but even they don't take the whole credit for themselves.</p>
              <p>Yes, some of the players are new in our team, but they have taken the decision to fulfil the dream even to the extent of migrating to the country who accept their dream. They have gone a long way in fulfilling their dream. Many players work their whole life but win nothing, guess they had wasted their time lah... this is not sporting spirit.</p>
              <p>Tiger Woods started playing golf at 2 yrs old, Michael Phelps started swimming at 7...what they went through, lost time for social life, studies, vigourous training, overcoming injuries....if they don't make it, you won't know they exist. Now you know there is a Li Jia Wei, Feng Tian Wei, Wang Yue Gu, and Tan Hao Liang, at least in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Somebody wrote in the papers today, "In olympic, big countries look for results, small countries value their participation; The real Olympic spirit values involvement more than winning medals; in life, how you live your life matters more than what you achieve." and being involved is more than just going there, join in the opening and closing ceremony .</p>
              <p>The singapore table tennis team, the STTA have shown Singaporean that we have the facilities, we have the world standard training, world class coaches and everything you need to be a world class table tennis players, are singaporean inspired, motivated, enough to do your own part for the game, especially those true blue Singaporean, born in Singapore? If somebody can do it with just one year as Singaporean, what more can you do, having born and grow up in Singapore?  </p>
              <p>If these people can't, then they can argue against FT, call it fake medals, blah blah blah, until their face turned green, nobody will remember who they are, true blue singaporean with green face, hahaha.</p>
              <p>In the mean time, the three paddlers will be remembered, together with Tan Hao Liang, as Singapore's olympic medalists, in the new history of Singapore, and Singaporean, born here or otherwise, will continue to rejoice with them. </p>
