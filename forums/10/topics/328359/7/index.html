            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am very disappointed by how the top handle the matter. Any mistakes by them, they can easily get away and they will issue statement on National TV that the matter is resolved and closed. The citizens feelings are not taken into account. What is the use of blogging our grievances and the ultimate result is to their advantage. We have feelings and we have the right to voice our opinions. If this happens to somebody not under the "gamen" wings, that so called person will be removed without much thoughts. So what are we?. We are just small people, when the top say sit we have to sit, shut up you  have to shut, move on then u have to move on. We are being controlled and led by the nose. LBW says."Our action has dampened ........." .  She simply does not admit that she is the one who cause the miseries but still says "OUR". Who is this "OUR". MR Vivian says "LBW will stay" . So looks like we have no say in this matter,  because LBW has a strong backer.  If it is you, what will happen to you. Head rolls ????????? Please do not publish her pictures anymore. I want to get on with life.</p></div>

              <p>look on the bright side.  this is the first time in a long while that a "Lee" in the government ever came out and apologised to anyone, no? Haha. </p>
              <p>seriously, since the incident is more or less over and the minister has made his speech, we can more or less move on, and the important thing would be to learn from this.  in Singapore, the ends always justify the means, but maybe after this ppl will know that even the biggest success means nothing if we have not done things the right way from the start. </p>
              <p>STTA may be the most successful sports organization here, but this incident has shown them to have one of the weakest foundations.  they should start learning from sailing, swimming, and some of the others that regularly send large teams to competitions and yet can still manage and run them well.  with its success, STTA should have no problems in securing money for what they need as compared to other sports, and they should be able to do a good job if the right foundations are laid. </p>
              <p>Lee Bee Wah might be a loudmouth but lets see if some of her ideas might not be as dumb as what comes out of her mouth.  Her intentions to promote the sport to more young people here is important. </p>
              <p>This issue, just like the Mas Selamat issue is never going to resolve itself in the way that each and every one of us believes it should be.  at the end of it all, maybe we should not forget that all parties involved had Singapore's interests at heart, and move on to seek a better way of doing things. </p>
              <p>i've long stopped celebrating our olympic medal, seriously.  maybe its cos of this incident, maybe its still the fact that are athletes had only been Singapore citizens for a few months.  but what i do look forward to is to the next Olympics to see how our sports have grown. </p>

              <p>what have you found out so far that you think she was WRONG in making that decision? maybe she is guilty of being insensitive or untimely, but is her decision totally wrong? What's going on inside? There are some players who felt that AL and LGD are bias and unfair, and they have been unfairly treated. I'm just saying maybe LBW's decision is not totally wrong.</p>

              <p>What she has done COULD be right. Whatever did happen, she has apologised. Why should she if she has not done anything wrong.</p>
              <p>Also, why should VB and TSL convene a media briefing if the matter is not that serious?</p>
              <p>LBW's mistake was the way she handled the case and blurting it out to the press and the timing was stupid. She could be right but what she failed to foresee is the the repercussion of her outburst and the public's reaction.</p>
              <p>It is criminal to dampen the celebration of our first medal after 48 years. She could have kept her mouth shut and handle the matter discreetly after the Olympics. Remove who she wants to remove after the euphoria.</p>
              <p>By the way, I am still wondering why VB has to reiterate that AL is not sacked. I am also wondering why TSL had to say LBW is new to her job as head of STTA and should give her more time?</p>

              making that decision? maybe she is guilty of being insensitive or
              untimely, but is her decision totally wrong? What's going on
              inside? There are some players who felt that AL and LGD are bias
              and unfair, and they have been unfairly treated. I'm just saying
              maybe LBW's decision is not totally wrong.</p>

              <p>Fully agree. I watched aghast as she responded to media queries on the Gao Ning incident. She sound like an auntie complaining about her son not getting fair treatment. I was so ashamed that she represented Singapore and yet she behaved in such an ungracious and rash manner for the whole world to see. She needs to take some lessons on EQ and public relations. I also think she lacks the finesse to handle media queries.</p>
