              <p>Its a silly to think the Tennis players relied only on one or half a year here to improve. These atheletes came this year and another mid year and they spent  their whole life training outside Singapore. It only shows how good china is at training Table Tennis Players, or at best how goos Singapore is at buying Table Tennis player. Can Singapore produce atheletes and export them like China?</p>

              <p>I had always enjoyed TOC's articles now and then when i want some off-beat amusements. It's articles are filled with fantasizes and delusions akin to UK tabloids of elvis sightings, UFOs, alien abduction and the what nots.</p>
              <p>But the latest article on the MP Lee sarga irks me much in their deluded attempts to portray themselves as serious alternative voices, which every serious alternative political parties and supporters should avoid and distance themselves away from. In their hate for the ruling party, they had allow that hatred to consume them and forgotten what alternative views are about - the Nation, our country.</p>
              <p>To spare all reading the delusional diatribe from TOC, here's a summary of what that article posted  on Page 3 is all about:-</p>
              <p>a.)  MP Lee BW has no integrity nor any accountability</p>
              <p>b.)  MP Lee BW had been high-handed in her approach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In their hatred of the ruling party, they once again as often, ignored facts.</p>
              <p>a.) Gao Ning battled ALONE a 'so-called' mediocre opponent whom won.</p>
              <p>b.) Out of 5 coaches. not even 1 was present for a running match to provide analysis and support, at an Olympic level and not a friendly neighbourhood competition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a neutral political person, take no sides, but I certainly would and had made a stand on MP Lee's decisions. I am glad she stood up for our player, wearing our flag, first as a citizen, then the President of the player's association, and finally, an accountable public figure as an MP.</p>
              <p>She had shown her courage and mettle, to stand up for the common guy represented by the player under her charge, and based on irrefutable facts of negligence under public eyes, to chastisize those responsible for the unforgivable negligence.</p>
              <p>She did it without a care or wit who it was, what they had contributed, without fear or favour, or hiding anything. as should we all, being a nation of equals, proves her integrity to her oath as an MP.</p>
              <p>That she decided to let the matter rest, shows her accountability as the President of her Association. She had that power as a President to hire and fire, and rather than to hang the team manager in public, the response was the manager would not have his contract renewed, but allowed to reapply again, under the responsibility of the new CEO. Her compassion showed.</p>
              <p> Thus TOC had been blind to call her actions high handed. A wrong had been committed and her response was swift. To call her high handed would mean TOC, supposedly an alternative voice,is advocating making decisions behind close doors. kissing butts, sweeping mistakes under the carpet. This is not democracy. This is worse than N.Korean authoritarian methods.</p>
              <p>The writer ought to be sacked for advocating such means.</p>
              <p>I for one, am glad there are people like MP Lee BW around, without fear and favour to denounce what is so obviously wrong and clear cut. </p>
              <p>We want medals and success, but we will not compromise our principles for it. We may fudge a little, for it is not written on stone, with the concepts, but it's core remains, had done so and been guided by this doctrine for the past 43 years, from nothing to something of today. </p>

              <p>Well, depends to whom you give the glory for the medal. Singapore worked for 48 years, STTA have been working for don't know how many years, then come this Silver medal. and the players, come here one year and get silver medal in olympics, they must be good, but even they don't take the whole credit for themselves.</p>
              <p>Yes, some of the players are new in our team, but they have taken the decision to fulfil the dream even to the extent of migrating to the country who accept their dream. They have gone a long way in fulfilling their dream. Many players work their whole life but win nothing, guess they had wasted their time lah... this is not sporting spirit.</p>
              <p>Tiger Woods started playing golf at 2 yrs old, Michael Phelps started swimming at 7...what they went through, lost time for social life, studies, vigourous training, overcoming injuries....if they don't make it, you won't know they exist. Now you know there is a Li Jia Wei, Feng Tian Wei, Wang Yue Gu, and Tan Hao Liang, at least in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Somebody wrote in the papers today, "In olympic, big countries look for results, small countries value their participation; The real Olympic spirit values involvement more than winning medals; in life, how you live your life matters more than what you achieve." and being involved is more than just going there, join in the opening and closing ceremony .</p>
              <p>The singapore table tennis team, the STTA have shown Singaporean that we have the facilities, we have the world standard training, world class coaches and everything you need to be a world class table tennis players, are singaporean inspired, motivated, enough to do your own part for the game, especially those true blue Singaporean, born in Singapore? If somebody can do it with just one year as Singaporean, what more can you do, having born and grow up in Singapore?  </p>
              <p>If these people can't, then they can argue against FT, call it fake medals, blah blah blah, until their face turned green, nobody will remember who they are, true blue singaporean with green face, hahaha.</p>
              <p>In the mean time, the three paddlers will be remembered, together with Tan Hao Liang, as Singapore's olympic medalists, in the new history of Singapore, and Singaporean, born here or otherwise, will continue to rejoice with them. </p>

              <p>you write much but says little.</p>
              <p>1. "singapore worked for 48yrs to get a olympic medal". you claim to be living in singapore all these while? singapore, until is last 8 years or so, literally `bo hiu' sports. the  "sports for all" motto  says it all.</p>
              <p>2. "<em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Many players work their whole life but win nothing, guess they had wasted their time lah... this is not sporting spirit."</strong></span></em> with this kind of comment, i take it that you don't do sports at all. that much is revealed about you.</p>
              <p>3. players train their whole life. you write it well. singapore got them over, at least the 2 of them, and in less than 12 months, claim credit for its success. that goes against what you said. this is a (BIG) loophole in the rules. the international table tennis association should at least impose a 12months stay period for eligibility. singapore did well to spot this loophole.</p>
              <p>4. correction, tan howe liang is remembered only once every 4 years.</p>
              <p>rogue trader, jordan belfort once wrote something to this effect, " when i first cross the line (committed the crime), i was a little vary of it. but after a while, i was so far out from the line that my instinct tells me to heck it and go all the way". btw, jordon got caught; wrote an amazingly funny, tell all book called the "wolf of wall street". singapore is in a similar predicament. it cross the line (though not illegally) by getting all foreigners, 2 of which are literally newly minted citizens to help her win an olympic silver. after a while, these sports policy maker will think that it is not so bad at all, since glories is what is the end state. when the mojority of singapore sports then start to rain in the medals, all but using foreigners, then singapore will be numbed to all these `quick fixes'. personally, i won't celebrate such success. </p>

              <p>I had always enjoyed TOC's articles now and then when i want some off-beat amusements. It's articles are filled with fantasizes and delusions akin to UK tabloids of elvis sightings, UFOs, alien abduction and the what nots.</p>
              <p>But the latest article on the MP Lee sarga irks me much in their deluded attempts to portray themselves as serious alternative voices, which every serious alternative political parties and supporters should avoid and distance themselves away from. In their hate for the ruling party, they had allow that hatred to consume them and forgotten what alternative views are about - the Nation, our country.</p>
              <p>To spare all reading the delusional diatribe from TOC, here's a summary of what that article posted  on Page 3 is all about:-</p>
              <p>a.)  MP Lee BW has no integrity nor any accountability</p>
              <p>b.)  MP Lee BW had been high-handed in her approach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In their hatred of the ruling party, they once again as often, ignored facts.</p>
              <p>a.) Gao Ning battled ALONE a 'so-called' mediocre opponent whom won.</p>
              <p>b.) Out of 5 coaches. not even 1 was present for a running match to provide analysis and support, at an Olympic level and not a friendly neighbourhood competition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a neutral political person, take no sides, but I certainly would and had made a stand on MP Lee's decisions. I am glad she stood up for our player, wearing our flag, first as a citizen, then the President of the player's association, and finally, an accountable public figure as an MP.</p>
              <p>She had shown her courage and mettle, to stand up for the common guy represented by the player under her charge, and based on irrefutable facts of negligence under public eyes, to chastisize those responsible for the unforgivable negligence.</p>
              <p>She did it without a care or wit who it was, what they had contributed, without fear or favour, or hiding anything. as should we all, being a nation of equals, proves her integrity to her oath as an MP.</p>
              <p>That she decided to let the matter rest, shows her accountability as the President of her Association. She had that power as a President to hire and fire, and rather than to hang the team manager in public, the response was the manager would not have his contract renewed, but allowed to reapply again, under the responsibility of the new CEO. Her compassion showed.</p>
              <p> Thus TOC had been blind to call her actions high handed. A wrong had been committed and her response was swift. To call her high handed would mean TOC, supposedly an alternative voice,is advocating making decisions behind close doors. kissing butts, sweeping mistakes under the carpet. This is not democracy. This is worse than N.Korean authoritarian methods.</p>
              <p>The writer ought to be sacked for advocating such means.</p>
              <p>I for one, am glad there are people like MP Lee BW around, without fear and favour to denounce what is so obviously wrong and clear cut. </p>
              <p>We want medals and success, but we will not compromise our principles for it. We may fudge a little, for it is not written on stone, with the concepts, but it's core remains, had done so and been guided by this doctrine for the past 43 years, from nothing to something of today. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1. Singapore 'bo hiu' sports in the past and only 'hiu' since 8 years ago?</p>
              <p>Singapore's focus on sport was mainly in soccer, swimming, and probably water polo... because of what we could do in Seap games, SEA games, then Asian games, these were where we could compete a little. we had great atheletes like Patricia Chan, Junie Sng, Joceslin Yeo, Ang Peng Siong. Never had the standard to talk about Olympic. Tan How Liang's photo is on the wall of Singapore Sport Council, the Weight Lifting Association... what you don't see doesn't mean they never exist. you live in Singapore all these while? probably too young to know, or simply never hiu? I don't care if you are in any sports or just play computer games, with your kind of attitude towards sports and sportsmen, it is no wonder singapore sports could go far in the past.</p>
              <p>2. We follow International Olympic Committee rulings, and other international bodies on who are qualified to represent us in such international meets. and we are only interested in their games and their rulings.</p>
              <p>You can set your own ruling and play with yourself.</p>

              <p>Its a silly to think the Tennis players relied only on one or half a year here to improve. These atheletes came this year and another mid year and they spent  their whole life training outside Singapore. It only shows how good china is at training Table Tennis Players, or at best how goos Singapore is at buying Table Tennis player. Can Singapore produce atheletes and export them like China?</p>

              <p>your mind is prejudiced with the little you know. anything else you don't agree means nothing to you. Typical.</p>
              <p>1. Singapore 'bo hiu' sports in the past and only 'hiu' since 8 years ago?</p>
              <p>Singapore's focus on sport was mainly in soccer, swimming, and probably water polo... because of what we could do in Seap games, SEA games, then Asian games, these were where we could compete a little. we had great atheletes like Patricia Chan, Junie Sng, Joceslin Yeo, Ang Peng Siong. Never had the standard to talk about Olympic. Tan How Liang's photo is on the wall of Singapore Sport Council, the Weight Lifting Association... what you don't see doesn't mean they never exist. you live in Singapore all these while? probably too young to know, or simply never hiu? I don't care if you are in any sports or just play computer games, with your kind of attitude towards sports and sportsmen, it is no wonder singapore sports could go far in the past.</p>
              <p>2. We follow International Olympic Committee rulings, and other international bodies on who are qualified to represent us in such international meets. and we are only interested in their games and their rulings.</p>
              <p>You can set your own ruling and play with yourself.</p>
              <p>We never miss people like you in our celebration.</p>

              <p>ahh......such graceful reply...</p>
              <p>1. i am not denying that we have good athletes. i am saying that it is not the gahmen's policy to promote sports excellence until recently. there is distinct difference between the 2. do you even know when you type this reply? we win waterpolo in sea, so what (with due respect to the w/polo team)? outside of sea, we are minnows. duh, put photos of athletes in ssc office means something? how about something more tangible? i hope at least you got a photo of your mum in at your home. it sure means something to you. but your mum might be slighted becos maybe that's all you do, nothing much else.</p>
              <p>have you spoken to these athletes in person to ask them what kind of support they get as they pursue their dreams? i have, including some of the luminaries you named above. </p>
              <p>2. again, i am not saying we broke the rules to win. so, what's your point, really? write just for the sake of writing?</p>

              <p>again, sports exellence has nothing to do with size of population.</p>
              <p>it is the system and the `software' that makes the difference, amongst others.</p>
              <p>jamaica has a population of just under 3m. how do you explain their recent success?</p>
              <p>what about croatia? 4.4m and a soccer powerhouse.</p>

              <p>I had always enjoyed TOC's articles now and then when i want some off-beat amusements. It's articles are filled with fantasizes and delusions akin to UK tabloids of elvis sightings, UFOs, alien abduction and the what nots.</p>
              <p>But the latest article on the MP Lee sarga irks me much in their deluded attempts to portray themselves as serious alternative voices, which every serious alternative political parties and supporters should avoid and distance themselves away from. In their hate for the ruling party, they had allow that hatred to consume them and forgotten what alternative views are about - the Nation, our country.</p>
              <p>To spare all reading the delusional diatribe from TOC, here's a summary of what that article posted  on Page 3 is all about:-</p>
              <p>a.)  MP Lee BW has no integrity nor any accountability</p>
              <p>b.)  MP Lee BW had been high-handed in her approach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In their hatred of the ruling party, they once again as often, ignored facts.</p>
              <p>a.) Gao Ning battled ALONE a 'so-called' mediocre opponent whom won.</p>
              <p>b.) Out of 5 coaches. not even 1 was present for a running match to provide analysis and support, at an Olympic level and not a friendly neighbourhood competition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a neutral political person, take no sides, but I certainly would and had made a stand on MP Lee's decisions. I am glad she stood up for our player, wearing our flag, first as a citizen, then the President of the player's association, and finally, an accountable public figure as an MP.</p>
              <p>She had shown her courage and mettle, to stand up for the common guy represented by the player under her charge, and based on irrefutable facts of negligence under public eyes, to chastisize those responsible for the unforgivable negligence.</p>
              <p>She did it without a care or wit who it was, what they had contributed, without fear or favour, or hiding anything. as should we all, being a nation of equals, proves her integrity to her oath as an MP.</p>
              <p>That she decided to let the matter rest, shows her accountability as the President of her Association. She had that power as a President to hire and fire, and rather than to hang the team manager in public, the response was the manager would not have his contract renewed, but allowed to reapply again, under the responsibility of the new CEO. Her compassion showed.</p>
              <p> Thus TOC had been blind to call her actions high handed. A wrong had been committed and her response was swift. To call her high handed would mean TOC, supposedly an alternative voice,is advocating making decisions behind close doors. kissing butts, sweeping mistakes under the carpet. This is not democracy. This is worse than N.Korean authoritarian methods.</p>
              <p>The writer ought to be sacked for advocating such means.</p>
              <p>I for one, am glad there are people like MP Lee BW around, without fear and favour to denounce what is so obviously wrong and clear cut. </p>
              <p>We want medals and success, but we will not compromise our principles for it. We may fudge a little, for it is not written on stone, with the concepts, but it's core remains, had done so and been guided by this doctrine for the past 43 years, from nothing to something of today. </p>
