              <p>Personally, every sportsmen must depend on themselves in any competition to win.  They should act in a Professional manner and behave in good sporting spirit.  I empathise with Gao Ning that his coach could not be with him during his crucial match.... but life goes on...what is the point of "crying" over spill-milk?</p>
              <p>But for Lee Bee Wah to conduct an interview to journalists immediately after this incident is really un-called for.  Goes to show that she is someone that is not considerate and does not think through with her head in a calm manner.  What she has said to the journalists also hurt the morale of the entire Table Tennis players, coaches, etc.... when she knows that the game is still going on!</p>
              <p>Agreed that investigations should be conducted but until a formal inquiry has been conducted and concluded, her decision to dismiss Anthony Lee is really un-called for. What is she proving? If there is any wrong with the Management team, as the President of the Association, she should also bear some responsibility... not just blaming and letting her management take the chop!</p>
              <p>Then we also have to ask ourseleves some questions.  Is there sufficient coaches being sent to the Olympics? If 5 is not enough, can we consider contingency of having the 6th or 7th?  Are there contingency plans being put in-place?  Are our players coached that in such event (unforseen or unfortunate, whichever you called it), do not panic. They must act professionally and calmly and fight like a warrior?</p>
              <p>All the more that Coach Liu should not be harm.  Unless Lee Bee Wah is so good that she should represent Singapore in the 2012 Olympics herself or be the coach, both options of which I do not believe she is competent enough to do.</p>
              <p>I have never seen any PAP MP behave in such an unprofessional manner... She is so hard ball and really will turn voters away.  Why vote for someone that behaves in this manner?  Can't Teo Ser Luck or Dr Vivian or even PM Lee do something about it?  Why so quiet?  Perhaps PAP is trying to close-their ranks and be seen as being united!  But, I am very disappointed with Ser Luck and Vivian for not standing up to this issue and let this rather irrational lady take charge.  It is a complete disgrace to Singapore. Something which I cannot take lying down!</p>
              <p>I do not give a damn if she is the PAP MP or President of STTA.  As MP, she is to serve the citizens and NOT be worshipped! As President of STTA, she is to provide help, guidance and support for the sportsmen and NOT there to disgrace, play politics, throw her weight around and demoralised everyone else.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, marked my word, she is definitely not well liked by lots of people and certainly does not deserve any respect from me!  It is high time for the Authority to reflect upon themselves and for someone to do the necessary to replace her role as President of STTA.  Singapore need more supportive and compassionate people.</p>

              <p>There is absolutely no reason for the coaches to neglect our taxpayers investment in the tennis player. This is the highest match and it is absolutely inconceivable for not even a single coach being avaliable on hand to assess, moral support and guide. It is not like all the tennis players were playing same time matches all the time. And the venue is not that far like one match in Tuas and the other in Changi.</p>
              <p>The coaches may feign sickness, and may squeal excuses, but they are what they really are - excuses. Why was the chain of command not informed earlier?</p>
              <p>Singapore takes systemic operations seriously. It is no point if we have the best system, answerable to tax payers, if those below the chain of command do not play their part or offer excuses for lapses.</p>
              <p>Spore MPs are the most compassionate singaporeans amongst us all. Those who had appealed for help will know how caring and how much they had tried to explain or help us all.</p>
              <p>And no one should or can fault MP Lee BW for being pissed. She is pissed, on behalf of us taxpayers who had contributed our hard earned funds for the establishment of enhancement in sports. How could the coaches failed in something so simple as even attendance? It's not like they are the ones playing the match and lost! Thus it was in excusable for their lapse.</p>
              <p>The ejection of their status is a very good example of 'no one being above the law', no matter how good you are. Regardless of you being a gold medallist achieving Sporean or PR. Start behaving like Spore owes you a living, then face the music. We are an equal society. We would rather forsake the gold in sports than to have chaos and unfairness in our system of governance. Let those PR be aware. No one is indispensible in our society of equals.</p>
              <p>However, as tough as we are, we are not without compassion. The coach can reapply again if they so want. If they acknowledge their mistake, they will be recieved back with open arms. If we can take care of ex-convicts, how more compassionate towards those who are willing and capable to help further our national goals. </p>
              <p>In my book, MP Lee did right and should be applauded by all citizens.</p>

              <p><br>MP should not be applauded, the non present of a coach during a crucial match a major lapse in communication within their hierrachy system, as the chief management there, she can do whatever clean up to align the system better within her organisation, she can dismiss anyone she deems fit to the organisation, that is her problem of clearing up the house. But we, as Taxpayers as you rightly put it, do you think she should get sack for such a big mess up?? or rather cock up??? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our system tend to protect the top and slain the mid when things goes wrong, same as Mas Selamat cases, why the home minister is still around after a big cork up that affect the whole world.</p>

              <p>as for this woman, she has only been on the job for a few months, she is in Singapore and not beijing where the incident happened, she has not conducted any investigation, neither has she consulted any staff on site or in STTS, her remark was uncalled for, her outburst was untimely, her way of handling the matter is high handed.</p>
              <p>The Chinese newspapers was completely silent on the matters, I think nobody in Lianhezhaobao takes what she said as official. Everybody involved in our table tennis team, in Beijing and in Singapore, including ng ser miang, either disagree with her, or refuse to comment.</p>
