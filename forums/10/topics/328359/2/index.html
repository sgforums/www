              <p>as for this woman, she has only been on the job for a few months, she is in Singapore and not beijing where the incident happened, she has not conducted any investigation, neither has she consulted any staff on site or in STTS, her remark was uncalled for, her outburst was untimely, her way of handling the matter is high handed.</p>
              <p>The Chinese newspapers was completely silent on the matters, I think nobody in Lianhezhaobao takes what she said as official. Everybody involved in our table tennis team, in Beijing and in Singapore, including ng ser miang, either disagree with her, or refuse to comment.</p>

              <p>(again), i support the decision. it's just the timing.</p>
              <p>at a top level game, there is <strong>absolutely</strong> no room for such lapse. did this anthony guy found himself `floating on cloud 9' after singapore won the silver? and ease off?</p>
              <p>mp lee did not act rashly, imo. in a month, i think she saw the set-up of stta and what needed to change. she could have chosen a better time to announce the changes. however, she could see it as an opportunity to make the announcement after the `slip up'.</p>
              <p>singapore table tennis is not going anywhere....singapore will still cream the competition at the regional level here, even at the commonwealth level. but dun fool ourselves that becos singapore got a silver, she should deliver silver or better everytime at world class meet. after all, we have an amatuerish nsa running singapore sports.  </p>

              <p>in the other words, r  u trying to say whoever are new in a organisation are nobody? regardless he or she are the chairman, CEO or MD. also have to respect &amp; listen to the "OLDER" people?</p>

              <p>it is not to say that a new person is a nobody. it also does not mean that a new CEO is already a somebody....</p>
              <p>it is about how one handles potentially difficult situation. in this case ms lim obviously has no EQ.</p>
              <p>even if she is correct, which may I state, is yet to be proved, she could have waited a week or so after the team has returned and the proper celebration has taken place. In every high and fire situation there is always a process.</p>
              <p>in this case, she not only jumped the gun, she has grossly mishandled the situation.</p>

              <p>A Lee firing a Lee? lol This incident somehow reminds me of those illogical women bosses having their periods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's see...the story goes like this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gao Ning's coach, Zu Haining was with another player, Yang Zi because that player's coach (Chen Jian) had taken ill. Zu had thought after he had finished with Yang, he would go over to join Gao. Misfortune has it that Yang's match started 1 hour late and thereby leaving Gao with no coach for his match. Tragedy indeed. The other 2 coaches (including Head coach Liu Guodong), were tending to Li Jiawei and Feng Tianwei for another upcoming match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So how now? Scapegoat search in the form of Antony Lee. But who can one really blame in this situation? Accountability is a must but a sacking? Surely unwarranted given that Antony Lee had put in so much effort facilitating the team. And Lee had to find out from a third party that his services were no longer required. Surely everyone in his shoes would have appreciated a closed door talk with Lee Bee Wah? And no consultation with table tennis officials whatsoever, just a meeting with the players. And when pressed for a reason why Antony Lee as sacked, she simply said "let's move on" and the decision was made even before the Olympics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even Head coach Liu's future hangs in the balance. It was him who scouted these talents. Wow, such kind treatment after all that toil and she has hardly even warmed her president's seat. A slap on the wrist and strong words of encouragement would have been better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Granted that a coach would have been helpful in battle analysis but mind you, this was the FIRST round. Opponent was mediocre at best and Gao Ning was supposed to be the "Republic's top player". If Gao's loss was attributed to the absence of a coach and resultantly in Lee's sacking; way too harsh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope LBW doesn't handle constituents in such high-handedness lol. Clown of AMK.</p>

              <p>if it is essential that a coach accompany a player for a match, then nothing else can over-ride that, even if LJW is playing in the finals.</p>

              <p>Speculation is as good as anyone's half-baked guess. LBW shd have discussed with Liu and Antony first instead of letting one know he is sacked and another that his fate hangs in the balance....both thru a 3rd party.</p>

              <p>Accountability first and foremost but sacking in such a fashion and u second it?</p>
