            <div class='col-md body'>REGARDLESS of what our MPs actually say in parliament, they will vote FOR a bill with or without the Party whip in place. For eg, during the Trasport fare hike debate a few years back (when Tan Soo Khoon was so passionately critical of it), the Party whip was lifted so that MPs could vote according to conscience. Even then, ALL the PAP MPs voted FOR the bill to pass.<br><br>So in this case, why should an MP stick his neck out and speak from his/her heart, if at the end of the day, s/he has to vote according party-lines? That's why our MPs can't really speak from their conscience....</div>

Baclay Bank's boss Bob Diamond earned [b]Â£22m (S$65m) </strong>in just one year...in 2006 alone! If you can do his job, paying you S$2.2 m a year is peanuts in comparison.<br><br>Here's the BBC Business editor's take on the widening gap between the rich and poor:<br><br>"Diamond has turned Barclays' investment banking arm from an also-ran into a contender. No one in his game doubts that his contribution to BarclaysÂ’ highly profitable global debt business has been significant. And he's probably being paid more-or-less the market-price for his kind of talent.<br><br>But it's arguable that the market itself doesn't work terribly effectively, that it tends to over-value certain sorts of people - investment bankers, hedge-fund managers, chat-show hosts, former residents of the Big Brother house, Premier League footballers - while undervaluing the contribution made by millions of others.<br><br>However, some (but not all) investment bankers and footballers can point to the substantial incremental profits they've generated for their businesses, and they can claim with some credibility that their personal remuneration represents value-for-money in that context (actually, it's pretty difficult to make that claim of Chelsea superstars, in view of the huge financial losses incurred by the club).<br><br><strong>We live in an era when financial capital is staggeringly cheap and the profit-generating skills of humans are relatively scarce and highly prized. It's why the gap between the wealthiest and the vast majority is widening in a way we haven't experienced for a hundred years.</strong><br><br>There may be social and moral arguments against the widening in that gap.<br><br>But itÂ’s hard to make an economic case against it, unless you believe that the prevailing global version of capitalism that rules almost everywhere (barring Cuba and Venezuela) is inefficient, unsustainable and will whither.
