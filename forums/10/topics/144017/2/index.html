Otherwise the updated numbers may well be much larger)<br><br>1. Singapore President's Basic Salary US$1,483,000 (SGD$2,373,100)*a year<br>Singapore Prime Minister's Basic Salary US$1,100,000 (SGD1,958,000) a year<br>Minister's Basic: US$655,530 to US$819,124 (SGD1,166,844 to SGD1,458,040) a year<br><br>2. United States of America President: US$200,000 Vice President: US$181,400 Cabinet Secretaries: US$157,000<br><br>3. United Kingdom Prime Minister: US$170,556 Ministers: US$146,299 Senior Civil Servants: US$262,438<br><br>4. Australia Prime Minister: US$137,060 Deputy Prime Minister: US$111,439 Treasurer: US$102,682<br><br>5. Hong Kong Chief Executive : US$416,615 Top Civil Servant: US$278,538 Financial Sec: US$315,077<br><br>Source: Asian Wall Street Journal July 10 2000 *Singapore President's salary which was updated in 2005 from the Singapore Straits Times<br><br>In relative terms, less then 20% of Singaporeans here have take home salaries<br>exceeding SGD100,000/- A YEAR.<br><br>In stark contrast, BASIC SALARY FOR A MINISTER STARTS AT SGD1,166,844 A YEAR,OR JUST UNDER SGD100,000 A MONTH.<br><br>What these ministers earns in just ONE MONTH exceeds the ANNUAL TAKE HOME<br>salary of 80% of Singapore's income earning population. Lets not even begin to compare annual packages which will exceed SGD1 million easily.<br><br>With the above numbers and figures now in perspective, it is easier to give substance to the words "leading by example". Several facts are noteworthy here;<br><br>a) That the ministerial salaries are grossly out of proportion, even when compared with their counterparts in much larger countries (US and UK) who have far heavier responsibilities.<br><br>b) That these salary reductions were long overdue. In the past, such handsome remuneration were "justified" on the back of resounding performance. However, Singapore's economy has been in the doldrums of a recession for several years now (with beginnings reaching as far back as the 1997 Asian economic crisis). This economic barometer is a rough measure of performance and implies that ministerial salaries were due for review at least 3-4 years ago.<br><br>c) That adjustments should be made to bring them back within the industry benchmarks. Taking the salary of US vice president as a rule of thumb, the percentage for reductions should start at 50% of current pay. Even if a Singapore minister takes a 50% pay-cut, he would still be earning much more then the US vice president.<br><br>d) The percentage reductions should greater then 50% if the intent is to bring the salaries within the perspective of Singapore's domestic scene.<br><br>With such inflated figures, it is understandable why the local government controlled media (Singapore Press Holdings) have taken pains to exclude mention of actual numbers for the world to see. The numbers would be too glaring and no amount of window dressing or creative writing could have reconciled these numbers with a sane figure and restored credibility.<br>[/b]</blockquote>If the above figure is true,then this is what the public have been discussing,"openly corrupted"!!!</div>

They will surely modify the GRC format some more such that it is very difficult for opposition to enter new or even maintain their GRC.<br><br>If you look at how many households are hanging the national flag in the old estates like Queenstown, AMK, etc you will notice that even the ah peks aunties don't hang their flags any more. So I don't mind the gov giving them 2 votes cos they will not vote for the current party.<br><br>From Atobe's website:<br>"On barring election surveys and exit polls, the minister said these gave the illusion of reflecting public opinion but were often based on small sample sizes, bad question design and improper sampling, which led to inaccurate and slanted results." True. Most netizens are well educated and skeptics. But no wind gives no wave. The ruling party must be really afraid of the internet, esp after the NKF Durai incident.<br><br>But I guess a non Singaporean citizen can start up a survey website right? And I think there are some used-to-be-Singaporeans in Sgforums.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Gahmen has decided to raise MinistersÂ’ salaries in order to help citizens get accustomed to widening income gaps due to globalization.<br><br>The move was made after Labour Minister Lim Boh Heng said that Singaporeans cannot avoid seeing the wage gap widen because of global economic conditions.<br><br>The latest Gahmen household expenditure survey reported that between 1998 and 2003, the income of the poorest 20 percent of Singaporeans fell by 3.2 percent, while the richest saw their income rise by 1.1 percent. Last week, it was also reported by the StateÂ’s Times that both bankruptcy and the growth in number of local millionaires were at an all time high.<br><br>Â“We canÂ’t hold back globalization,Â” said Mr. Hang Cheng Pai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Manpowerlessness. Â“Neither can we practice protectionism. So people must just get used to this. The Gahmen is aware of the problem, and intends to take a leading role in helping the citizens adjust.Â”<br><br>And so in an act of supreme leadership, Cabinet Ministers will initiate an initial pay rise of 10%, subject to increase depending on circumstances.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a painful decision, but they have no choice,Â” said Mr. Hang. Â“It is being done for the good of the people. If we donÂ’t practice at home what is happening on a global scale, Singapore will be finished.Â”<br><br>The Cabinet will be taking even more steps towards tackling global economic issues, such as purchasing overseas homes, sending their children to schools abroad, and taking more holidays.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I say, I say, did anyone forgot to mention this -<br><br>besides hyper inflated salaries, many MPs and ministers are also earning sideline incomes - as directors of GLC and private companies.  Hundreds of thousands of dollarss in director fees and fat bonuses.<br><br>So actually they are all earning  many times more than their already hyper-inflated salaries, really!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by iveco:<br><strong>[b]Indonesia may raise salary of civil servants to combat corruption</strong><br><br>By Channel NewsAsia's Indonesia Bureau Chief Sujadi Siswo<br><br>JAKARTA : Indonesia plans to increase the salary of its six million civil servants in an effort to combat corruption and improve public service.<br><br>The pay increases are targetted at junior civil servants, whom observers say are prone to corruption because of their low wages.<br><br>After a request was made in June to double the take-home wages of 550 members of Parliament, authorities are now considering doing the same for their public officers in an effort to improve their working conditions, especially the lower-ranking ones.<br><br>Many are living on incomes below the minimum wage set out for the private sector, which is why observers believe they are more likely than others to be involved in corruption.<br><br>Junior officers earn about US$120 a month. The pay hike, scheduled for next year's budget, will see them getting up to a 30% increase.<br><br>The top civil servant -the Indonesian President - with his monthly basic salary of US$5,000, will get a 5% pay rise.<br><br>Indonesia's basic wage does not include benefits such as housing, personal and family allowances or a car, which will usually add up to another 30% or more.<br><br>Said Indria Samego, a military analyst at The Habibie Centre: "An Indonesian 4-star general, his income less than 5 million rupiah. Usually they get benefit and extra income because of their position. Their money come from everywhere, from somebody who needs political umbrella from him. So it's a lot of money."<br><br>So while critics support the government's motive to reduce corruption by increasing public officers remuneration, they say the fight against graft is just scratching the surface.<br><br>"The current effort in combating corruption focuses mainly on middle and small cases of corruption. They haven't touch the big fish - the big cases of corruption," said Luky Djani with the Indonesia Corruption Watch.<br><br>- CNA /ls<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Although u try to defend our ministers,but the title of ur post (Indonesia "may" raise the salary of civil servants to combat corruption) already making ur post less convincing."May" meaning Indonesia havent raise the salary of the civil servant,and becoz Indonesia political system is now more democratic than Singapore,they still have to go through their parliament n ppl consent before they can implement the idea.<br>So next time,before u wanted to defend our ministers "blindly",please post some articles that is more convincing,or wait until the Indonesia really raise the salary of their ministers then u come n post it here ok?</div>
