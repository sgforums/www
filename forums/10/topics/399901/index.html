              <p>Hey guys, need your help with this one.</p>
              <p>Okay, a bit about my background first. I was born outside of Singapore, but because my parents were Singaporean, I acquired a Singaporean citizenship (by descent). My family left Singapore at the age of 3, travelled around before migrating to Australia, so I never got to really experience the 'socio-economic benefits' of Singapore.</p>
              <p>I'm going to turn 21 next year, and I've decided to renounce my Singaporean citizenship and keep my Australian one (I think in my current situation, I don't have to do National Service). My questions are:</p>
              <p>1) In the future, will I be able to re-apply for another PR/citizenship, in order to work and live in Singapore?</p>
              <p>2) If yes, do I have to do NS? If not, wouldn't that mean I've sorta 'skipped' NS in that regard?</p>
              <p>I've heard differing views to the first question. My parents and a few of my Singaporean friends have told me that it is near impossible to re-apply for another Singaporean citizenship. On the other hand, the website below states that I shouldn't have any extra problems from previously giving up my citizenship, and that I'll be treated like any other foreigner when trying to get my PR/citizenship:</p>
              <p>http://www.guidemesingapore.com/singapore-immigration/c639-renouncing-singapore-citizenship.htm</p>
              <p>Not to mention with my somewhat unique background (being a Singaporean citizen by descent, and having left Singapore at the age of 3), I don't think I would immediately be rejected when attempting to re-apply, right?</p>
              <p>Please reply as soon as possible. Thank you.</p>

              <p>well.....either you:</p>
              <p>1)change yer name from mark lee to bruce lee and  claim australia was your birthplace and from birth certs in order to apply .problem is yer birth certs will reflect yer place of birth as in spore</p>
              <p>2)claim u changed sex to a female</p>
              <p>applying for a citizenship for yer case is zilch...in fact they could legally put you in prison first before sending u to a military court for ignorance of military law upon age of 18 as u didnt send them any paperwerk in past....so u would be jailed first and talk later.only a gal has tried it and officer told her she was lucky she could get her citizenship back.but for yer case,they would jail u first in a military prison before they would talk.there are rules and procedure u may not care but this is how it functions.no excuses even if u left spore at age 1 month even!!!for it is written and many may have gone into the slammer because of that.the slammer isnt as easy as a watchhouse.in the morning,some fat indian military police staff sargent would load u with a prisoner t-shirt ,army boots,shorts with old army helmet and 1heavy sandbag would yell at you to run faster with all the equipment as to how they deem fit...coyld be an hour a day or mebbe the whole day.some in these military prisons are not clothed and stark naked from what a military police frend .</p>
              <p>and whats wronmg with australia anyway???they dont pay much unless you are related to some minister in politics...even engineers cant afford a car let alone a house.they dont have plenty jobs that pay alot in oz???even a guy werkin at hungry jacks in oz earns more than the engineers in spore</p>

              <p>so.. basically you want to get away from NS, then in a later date, "get back" your citizenship without doing NS?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think u have to clarify with the relevant authority, I read somewhere can change citizenship before 16 then can escape NS something like that, if not, u are still subjected to NS even though u change citizenship at a older age, something like the 2nd-Gen PR who serve NS regardless they are foreginers. I think is a clause put in place to discourage people to change citizenship to escape NS. It is best to check with ICA to confirm scully u LPPL still have to serve.</p></div>

              <p>Hello Leon,</p>
              <p>Many people in this forum here is telling you to leave Singapore, why do want to come back?</p>
              <p>your background is not unique. Many singaporean moved to australia, they don't want their children to learn mandarin, serve NS...among other reasons. Now the children have grown up, and decision has to be made, singaporean or australian. Your ability to make decision shows whether you have indeed come of age.</p>
              <p>Singapore does not owe you the "social and economic benefits". Young singaporean male contribute by serving NS, and as reservists for the next 10 yrs, are you willing? Consider yourself lucky that you have the right of refusal to a Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p>are your parents still holding Singaporean passport and australian PR?</p>

              <p><br>Hi Leon Lai,</p>
              <p>Sure, you cannot apply for PR here, as for citizenship, it is not a problem if you are talented or married a Singapore wife and borne a singapore citizen child. Other than that, if you can invest about 3 millions in property or business here, the ICA officer will personally visit your house in Aust or singapore to beg you to become a citizen of Singapore, you dun even need to apply anything and certainly, no need any NS.</p>
              <p>As for my case, born in taiwan, migrate to singapore and become a singapore citizen while still holding a taiwan passport (PR) as  taiwan allow dual citizenship within the G20 countries. It is not a big problem, like me, most foreigners coming here to make money, settle down and become a citizen just to enjoy the fringe benefit in taxation, by which singapore is one of the lowest among the G20 and OECD countries, you can save alot here, however, we need to have a backdoor to run off if Singapore, as fragile as it is without natural resources, could one day fail and fall. That's is wise it is good to hold on to your Aust citizenship or as a PR in some other countries to act as an escape route.</p>
              <p>Hope all is clear</p>

              <p>good to earn money, good to sleep, good to eats, peace, harmony,  why not? until the day singapore cannot make it anymore, then we start to look for greener pasture, in the meantime, my advice  to singaporeans is to make contingencies plans, take up or buy a land or house in malaysia or thailand or if you rich , in aust or NZ, so that anything happen here, at least you got a route to run off.</p>
              <p>Remember, you need a back door to move on or run off, and becos most Singaporeans had been living in HDB prison without a back door but rather a balcony to jum off,  most ot them become so straight jacket type that they forget about their own safety, and that play into the govt hands </p>

              <p>well.....either you:</p>
              <p>1)change yer name from mark lee to bruce lee and  claim australia was your birthplace and from birth certs in order to apply .problem is yer birth certs will reflect yer place of birth as in spore</p>
              <p>2)claim u changed sex to a female</p>
              <p>applying for a citizenship for yer case is zilch...in fact they could legally put you in prison first before sending u to a military court for ignorance of military law upon age of 18 as u didnt send them any paperwerk in past....so u would be jailed first and talk later.only a gal has tried it and officer told her she was lucky she could get her citizenship back.but for yer case,they would jail u first in a military prison before they would talk.there are rules and procedure u may not care but this is how it functions.no excuses even if u left spore at age 1 month even!!!for it is written and many may have gone into the slammer because of that.the slammer isnt as easy as a watchhouse.in the morning,some fat indian military police staff sargent would load u with a prisoner t-shirt ,army boots,shorts with old army helmet and 1heavy sandbag would yell at you to run faster with all the equipment as to how they deem fit...coyld be an hour a day or mebbe the whole day.some in these military prisons are not clothed and stark naked from what a military police frend .</p>
              <p>and whats wronmg with australia anyway???they dont pay much unless you are related to some minister in politics...even engineers cant afford a car let alone a house.they dont have plenty jobs that pay alot in oz???even a guy werkin at hungry jacks in oz earns more than the engineers in spore</p>
