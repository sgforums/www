            <div class='col-md body'>Humans are creatures of freewill. Hence I always believe that if your wife or girlfriend can harbour affairs behind your back, she is not worthy of my love and might as well let her go.<br><br>A marriage or a relationship is only as good and strong as the integrities of both parties involved. If one is corrupt, things cannot work out. Murdering and the taking of your spouse's life, only escalates the situation into a grave one, in that both parties, dies.<br><br>Men largely are infamouse on the question of faithfullness. So how many wives did murdered their husbands? A mere divorce would suffice.<br><br>In most cases, a failed marriage is the by product of poor judgement of both parties, in assuming &amp; expecting that certain character traits of one another would change after marriage, or through the passing of time. Yes in some cases this can be true, but largely, not.<br><br>So, if your wife or girlfriend runs away, don't chase. Start "shopping" for a new one. Or keep a pet dog instead. Dogs are far better on the topic of faith and loyalty.</div>

This society seems to favour the women more, but they often forget about the men's part of the story. There's no equality. In fact, all these talks on gender equality is plain bulls.h.i.t!<br><br>In the beginning of time, women are made to submit to their husbands meaning - their initial role as a helper to their husband, the sole-breadwinner.<br><br>Men are made to take charge of everything in the household meaning - They are responsible for everything happening around them. And are to take full responsibility of their own family.<br><br>Men, who are not responsible enuff are known to be immature, and until they learn how to be faithful and responsible, they cannot have a woman, not to even mention a family. The truth is, women are looking for capable men who will love them as they are and provide for them.<br><br>Women on the other hand, needs to be faithful to their husbands. The reasons for some to have many affairs outside can be many. Hence, the focus should be on the couple themselves.<br><br>This boils down to communication and the willingness to be humble enuff to seek counselling. Many locals are so full with pride that they refuse being counselled. In the end, they all suffer as a result.<br><br>Main thing is - Know the rights and wrong. If someone cannot discern, he/she is still a little child, and don't deserve to marry or even be in a relationship just yet.<br><br>Grow up people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that's what i hate most, to think for centuries men were always thought of as being the unfaithful ones. The roles have certainly reversed, and now u hear of cases of woman two-timing their boyfriends, sleeping around with other men, and committing adultery. Yet when it comes to divorce, its always the women who gets the upper hand. Ailmony is the thing I am talking about.<br><br>Also, who would u believe if a woman and a man come up to u and accuse the other of molest? U want to talk about equal rights for all, then this Women's charter thingy should be abolished first before we even talk about equality.</div>
