              <p>In Novena Church Exorcism case,</p>
              <p>a Father was asked <span style="color: #ff0000;">the NRIC no.</span> right after he had prayed for the woman,</p>
              <p>or after the Exorcism was done as claimed by the woman.</p>

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>First Day, Charge of Disorderly Behavior and Insulting Police Officers on 4<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> July 2008, American Independence Day, at or near Little India Singapore. I deny both charges.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 24, 2008, Court 6, Subordinate Court Singapore, 9.30am<br></span><br>Case begins in court. 9. 30 am.<br><br>If
              anyone was to read the following narration and was to think that I had
              just killed 20 people in broad daylight, it is nothing of the sort. You
              see it is Singapore that you are dealing with, where small petty
              incidents and taken out of proportion if Lee’s political opponents are
              involved; taken out of context, twisted and a mountain made of a mole
              hill.<br><br>And not just that, taxpayers money wasted like water; with
              court cases everyday, state controlled newspapers writing full page
              twisted biased articles to vilify defame and discredit the offender,
              hoping to make him look in the eyes of Singaporeans who are gullible
              enough to believe such nonsense, that the man who had the audacity to
              criticize Lee and his country, is indeed much worse than Guy <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Foxe</span> himself; the criminal who set fire to London.<br><br>Again
              and to bring you back to reality, the accusation here is merely that I
              misbehaved and yelled at police officers. I am sure you will agree that
              all over the world, people sometimes misbehave and out of frustration
              or otherwise, call a policeman a pig or a donkey. And sometimes, I am
              sure you will agree that some policeman; not all; deserve such a
              scolding. And if that were to occur in any civilized country; the
              culprit is faced with no more than a warning, admonished and permitted
              to go his merry way; especially if it is his first time for such an
              infraction.<br><br>You see, policemen are <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">afterall</span> civil servants. They serve us. We pay their wages through our taxes.
              Therefore the best rule is that we should not insult insult anyone, not
              just policemen and we should be kind to animals. Similarly policemen
              should not insult citizens and they too should be kind to all living
              things.<br><br>But not in Singapore. Oh no. Especially if a former opposition politician such as <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair were involved; the most minor indiscretion has to be dealt with as
              if he had committed no less that serial murders. The full extent of the
              Singapore Police Force and the state controlled newspapers has to be
              used to vilify and defame him. A warning is never sufficient if <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair is involved. A warning may be sufficient for other ordinary men; but <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair is not an ordinary man; certainly not in the eyes of this
              dictatorship. He is one of a few but growing number of Singaporeans and
              former Singaporeans who feel it is time that Lee and his cronies should
              be told that Singaporeans should not be treated as slaves any longer.
              Not just Singaporeans but no one should be treated that way.<br><br>So
              Lee is afraid of what he sees. That is why he reacts this way, with
              prosecutions and defamation actions whenever he hears any criticism.
              This is not the reaction of a confident man to criticism. This itself
              is proof that he fears the growing numbers of people who are now
              courageously coming out to be counted. Standing up to this dictatorship
              demanding to be heard even braving arrest prosecution, conviction and
              imprisonment.<br><br>In Lee's Singapore, men such as <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair have to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Taxpayer’s
              money should be spent generously and lavishly for that purpose. He has
              to be charged. His face has to appear in the state controlled Straits
              Times on a daily basis with twisted reporting to show him as no better
              than the devil himself. Not just for one day but on a daily basis. So
              much so that everyday while I remain in Singapore against my will and
              walk about the streets, almost every Singaporean recognizes me.<br><br>But mind you, that is not to say that I myself did any such thing. I have denied both charges. This much has to be clear.<br><br>But
              the bad news for the Lee government is this. That if the intention of
              the government is to make me look bad, the effect is just the reverse.
              On a daily basis now, no less than 20 people approach me and
              congratulate me on what I have done. And what is worse for the
              government, after congratulating me and asking me to stand my ground;
              they curse this government.<br><br>They are aware, thank God of the truth.<br><br>I
              am becoming increasing popular in this country while I continue to
              remain here. And I hope the state controlled Straits Times will
              continue posting my picture daily on it.<br><br>And to remind you once
              again, the accusation against me is only that I behaved in a disorderly
              manner, whatever that is and I yelled curses at police officers. I deny
              those charges. No big deal on any score. This is not theft, murder or
              high treason. Please keep that in mind. Thanks.<br><br>In court at commencement of the trial, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair asks for full names of Judge, Prosecutor and Investigating Officer for the record. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Suprisingly</span> all of them refuse to give their full names. Prosecutor is prepared to say only that he is Peter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Koy</span>. Prosecutor is Chinese. They usually have a full Chinese name as well. The Judge is prepared only to say that he is James <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Leong</span> and refuses to give his full name. In the case of Investigating Officer
              in the case, he uses a completely false name. He claims to be S Vicki.
              He wishes to remain to be entirely incognito.<br><br>When I pressed the
              Prosecutor that he should not attempt to hide his true identity, that
              these are legal proceedings and he should give his full name, his
              answer was that he uses the name of Peter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Koy</span> only, that is how he appears in court and that he sees no necessity to give his full name to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair or to anyone else! Imagine that! These are legal proceedings and
              he is refusing to give his full name; and not only that, the Judge is
              himself trying to hide his true identity. Even he is not prepared, in
              legal proceedings, mind you, to give his full name. He stands by his
              position that there is n need to fully identify himself even though
              these are legal proceedings in court. As for the Investigating Officer,
              he is determined to hide his identity completely. I understand from
              some court documents that his name is indeed S. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vikneshwaran</span>,
              Investigating Officer Central Police Division, HQ, but why he should be
              so determined to remain under false pretenses like a thief is indeed
              mind-boggling.<br><br>I do not know why the Judge, the Prosecutor in
              court and the Investigating Officer are all so determined not to
              provide their true names! Mr. Peter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Koy</span>, the prosecutor, the Judge in this case, Mr. James <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Leong</span> and the gentleman who goes around under an entirely false name,
              Investigating Officer Vicki all must have some compelling reason to
              hide their identities. Or else why the great reluctance in stating who
              they are?<br><br>As to why they are so determined to hide their true
              names in official legal proceedings at any cost, is left entirely up to
              you. I have since discovered through my research that the Judge is
              actually Mr. James <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Leong</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kui</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Yiu</span> and the prosecutor is Peter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Koy</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Su</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Hua</span>. The Investigating Officer is S <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vikneshwaran</span> of the Central Police Division. I intend to ask him when he testifies
              again what his true name is and that going around, as S Vicki will not
              do at any cost. It will be interesting to see how he answers.<br><br>As for the Assistant to the Investigating Officer, I was informed that he is Tony <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Thien</span>! Again full name was not provided despite my asking.<br><br>Since
              the court was quite prepared to allow all government parties in the
              case to go around under false or incomplete names, I then asked the
              court, admittedly facetiously, that since this was so, perhaps they
              should change my name in all court proceedings to Gordon, since any
              other name would do! I pointed out that what is sauce for the goose
              should be sauce for the gander after all. The Singapore constitution
              does require equality under the law and if it is all right for judge,
              prosecutor and police officers in the court to be going around under
              false pretences, and incomplete names, why then should I not be
              permitted now to be called Gordon instead in all court proceedings.<br><br>As
              expected, and you would have guessed this much, the court denied my
              request. Gordon was not allowed for me, but the prosecutor can use an
              incomplete name, the Judge can do the same, the Investigating Officer
              can use an entirely false name but in my case, Gordon was not
              permitted. Please do not misunderstand me. I am very proud of my full
              name <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair and would rather die than be called something else. But for the
              sake of testing the equality of persons before then law, it was quite
              clear that it was one rule for the Judge, the Prosecutor and the
              Investigating Officer but entirely another for the Singaporean
              Dissident, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair.<br><br>A
              point needs to be clarified on the state controlled Straits Times
              report on me, of July 25 2008. It said without more that I asked the
              court to address me as Gordon in court proceedings. This is not
              entirely correct. I only asked that this be done, after the judge
              insisted that he, James <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">Leong</span> was not prepared to tell us who he is, the prosecutor was not similarly
              prepared and neither was the Investigating Officer. For the record, I
              am <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair, and very proud to be none other than <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair, now and always.<br><br>I
              then asked that the Investigating Officer, being a prosecution witness,
              not be permitted to remain in court during the proceedings. It is well
              known that in the past in Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee's</span> cases, it was found that the Investigating Officer sat in court during
              the proceedings, listened to the evidence, and was subsequently found
              to be coaching other prosecution witnesses who were yet to testify.
              This is a serious abuse of process. My request was granted,
              surprisingly, with the prosecutor Mr. Peter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-error">Koy</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-error">Su</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-error">Hua</span> confirming that the prosecutor will not be present in court while others testify.<br><br>My application for the other police witness Mr. Tony <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-error">Thien</span> to be sequestrated was disallowed on the grounds that he has to help
              the prosecutor with administrative duties. The judge had directed the
              prosecutor to order him not to relay any information to other police
              witnesses but to what extent he would keep that word, one does not know
              at this stage.<br><br>After the above exchanges in the morning, came another shocker.<br><br>The
              prosecution now, on the first day of trial, requests leave to serve on
              me amended charges. Although the prosecution had all the time in the
              world, since my arrest on July 4<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_34" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> 2008, American Independence Day, they wait until the day of the trial,
              July 24, 2008, 20 full days later, to surprise me with amended charges.<br><br>Naturally
              I object. The rule of law is very clear. The prosecutor is required to
              give notice to the Defendant of the charges he has to meet in
              sufficient time, for trial <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_35" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">preparation</span>.
              It is entirely unacceptable to surprise the Defendant with charges to
              which he had no time to address. I strenuously object. But the
              prosecutor argues that I should proceed and defend myself to them
              because according to him, the changes are minor and therefore such a
              practice of handing in amended charges at the last minute is
              permissible.<br><br>Thank God I am a lawyer and not a layman even
              though for the purposes of this trial, I am a layman. Had I been a
              layman in the true sense with no legal training at all, this prosecutor
              would have got away with it.<br><br>The court orders that the trial
              itself start on Monday, July 28, 2008 except for the testimony of Dr.
              Cheong which will be heard that day, and about which I explain below.<br><br>The first witness was supposed to be Doctor Gabriel <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_36" class="blsp-spelling-error">Choeng</span> of the Raffles Medical Group, A and E Department. Another surprise. Prosecutor Peter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_37" class="blsp-spelling-error">Koy</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_38" class="blsp-spelling-error">Su</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_39" class="blsp-spelling-error">Hua</span> suddenly produces a medical report of this doctor and serves it on me; the first time I have ever seen it. He then says that <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_40" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">unbeknown st</span> to me, Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_41" class="blsp-spelling-error">Cheong</span> has to leave the country for a year on Sunday night, 2 days later and
              that I should cross-examine him on his testimony that very day or else
              he will not be available for a long time!<br><br>What in Heavens! The police had from July 4<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_42" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> 2008 to give me the police report and they spring another surprise on
              the day of the trial with a medical report and a request that I conduct
              a cross examination of the doctor that very day, right away!<br><br>Upon my vigorous objection, the Judge agreed to have the doctor's testimony to be taken on August 6<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_43" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span>,
              2008, which happens to be a trial date for this case. Not wanting to
              wait that long, and being faced with an impossible situation, I
              reluctantly agreed to do my best that afternoon, after I had consulted
              my legal help, Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_44" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span> Ti <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_45" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lik</span>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Afternoon 2.30 pm. Court No 6, Subordinate Court, same day<br></span><br>2 amended charges, one for disorderly conduct and another for insulting police officers are read to me. I plead not guilty.<br><br>The charges are that on or about 10.30 pm on July 4<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_46" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> 2008 at a place known as Little India Singapore which is an area where
              the Indian community is concentrated, I had behaved disorderly in that
              I had gesticulated with my hands (whatever that means) and I had
              insulted police officers by using expletives at them. These 2 charges
              are not only baseless, they are absurd. I had no reason for doing this
              and no motive whatsoever. As to why the police are charging me with
              this, only they know. I have all along denied these charges and have
              clearly stated that I intend to fully dispute them.<br><br>Doctor Gabriel <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_47" class="blsp-spelling-error">Cheong</span>,
              of Raffles Medical Group, A and E Department now takes the stand. He
              was the doctor who first examined me at Cantonment Police Station
              during the early hours of the morning after my arrest on July 25, 2008
              while I was in custody.<br><br>The doctor is referred to his medical report prepared by him. In summary it states as follows. He saw me at 0125 hours on July 5<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_48" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> 2008. The examination was completed at 0133 hours. That he was asked to
              examine me for injuries and to take a sample of my blood for alcohol
              analysis. That I had told him that I was forced to the ground by police
              officers and that my spectacles were damaged. That I had complained of
              pain to my wrists from the use of handcuffs. That I was clinically
              ambulant. That he noted alcoholic breath. That he noted superficial
              abrasions over both my wrists. That there was no evidence of bruising
              or cuts on the rest of my body during examination. That he deemed me
              fit to be locked up. That he took a blood sample at 0128 hours. That
              testing of the blood was carried out by Center for Forensic Science.
              That the results are still pending at the time of the report.<br><br>The
              prosecutor then asked the doctor to summarize his findings. The doctor
              repeats what is in the report. He states that I had full range of
              motion with both hands, left shoulder and elbow. And then he repeats
              what is in his medical report. For the first time, he states that he
              noticed an abrasion on my right eyebrow.<br><br>To the prosecutor’s
              question as to why he did not mention the abrasion on the right
              eyebrow, his answer was that he was only concerned with life
              threatening injuries and that he was not looking for other lesser
              injuries. He did however say that I had tenderness on both elbows as
              well, although this too did not appear in his medical report.<br><br>At
              my question whether such injuries to my right eyebrow could have been
              caused by forcefully pushing me to the ground, the doctor agreed that
              it is impossible to hypothesize as to what amounts to excessive force,
              as was my contention that I was thrown to the floor with excessive
              force.<br><br>However to my question to the doctor as to how I behaved
              with him during his medical examination, his answer was that I did not
              behave disorderly before him, that I was polite to him and to all
              intends and purposes I behaved towards him like a gentleman. Moreover
              the medical report on my blood analysis from Health Sciences Authority
              dated July 08, 2008 states my blood alcohol level to be 24 mg per 100
              ml. This report categorically proves that I was not drunk at all, and
              what is more, I am even fit to drive a car. The alcohol limit for drunk
              driving, as you know is 35mg per 100ml.<br><br>The case was adjourned
              to Monday July 28, 2008. I will be writing on what transpired on this
              day in my next blog post, hopefully tomorrow.<br><br><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_49" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair<br>Singapore</p>
