There's a small town called Beezeebee, and all it has are small eateries offering meals at economical prices. In the neighboring city Neighhhh, there are all sorts of posh restaurants which a minority of the people of Beezeebee visit occasionally. But because it's located away from the town the people of Beezeebee call home and takes a bit more travelling to than usual, it has never been the general culture of the Beezeebees to splurge on their meals.<br><br>One day, a wealthy man decides to open one posh restaurant in the town of Beezeebee. Those who were once lazy to travel to the city Neighhhh grew curious about the posh restaurant and decided to patronize it since it was just at home anyway. And soon more and more people start to want to visit expensive restaurants.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is, building a casino here will mean introducing gambling to more Singaporeans albeit the strict regulations that may be imposed.<br><br>We cannot prevent the problem of having compulsive gamblers, but we should do what we can to minimize it.<br><br>Am I making sense? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
