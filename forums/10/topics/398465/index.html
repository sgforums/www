              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">There are too many yes-man in the govt who believes its either BTO or a huge glut of HDB flats.There are no shades of grey...<br></span></p>

                       pay if the goal of policy makers is to have stable prices</p>

                      		JOSEPH CHONG</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">
              </span></p><p>IMAGINE the following announcement: 'Due to
                       an administrative oversight, HDB has discovered 10,000 unsold completed
                       apartments. The Housing Board intends to sell these gradually over the 
                      next three years.' What would the impact be on HDB resale prices?</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">
              </span></p><p>I posed this scenario and question to quite a few on April 1
                       recently and the answer was quick and unanimous - it would stabilise 
                      HDB re-sale prices. The recent triumph surrounding the announcement that
                       HDB had managed to sell 31,000 completed flats and had no more unsold 
                      inventory is misplaced. I believe it is a policy error not to carry any 
                      unsold inventory.</p>
              <p>It should be official policy for HDB to always
                       carry a minimum of unsold inventory. Without ready inventory to sell, 
                      HDB would not be able to meet any sudden surges in housing demand or 
                      compensate for demand misestimates.</p>
              <p>Inventory and spare capacity 
                      are a necessary evil if the goal of policy makers is to have stable 
                      prices across various markets. Indeed, we see this in fiscal and 
                      monetary targeting across the world daily.</p>
              <p>For example, central 
                      bankers and markets around the world watch the unemployment rate very 
                      closely. We want a rate as close as possible to NAIRU but not zero. 
                      NAIRU is the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. That is, a
                       steady state unemployment rate above which inflation would fall and 
                      below which inflation would rise.</p>
              <p>NAIRU in the US is estimated 
                      to be about 5 per cent. If unemployment falls too low, it invariably 
                      leads to a spiralling jump in prices and eventually a bust in the 
                      economy as interest rates rise to quench inflation. Yes, there is carry 
                      cost of having unemployed people but the cost of a recession is far 
                      worse.</p>
              <p>This also applies to the argument from HDB that unsold 
                      flats have a carrying cost. What is good for HDB may be bad for the 
                      wider Singapore economy. Without the stabilising effect of unsold 
                      ready-to-stay inventory, volatile housing prices carry a far bigger cost
                       for the economy. In any event, unsold flats can always be sold to 
                      reflect their holding costs. In an upturn when demand surges, these 
                      should still fly like hot cakes.</p>
              <p>Indeed, evidence of this 
                      stabilising effect of unsold inventory can be seen in 2005 to 2007. 
                      Despite a surging economy then, HDB resale prices moved up more modestly
                       than private property. Indeed, I would argue that carrying unsold 
                      inventory intentionally would also allow HDB to influence to some extent
                       private property prices.</p>
              <p><strong> Oil as example </strong></p>
              <p>A very 
                      good example of the stabilising effects of spare inventory is Opec, in 
                      particular Saudi Arabia. Spare production capacity (inventory stored 
                      underground) of about 5 million barrels per day or about 6 per cent of 
                      global demand has allowed Opec to keep prices at around US$80 per 
                      barrel. Prices shot up to US$140 per barrel in 2007 because Opec ran out
                       of spare capacity. And the markets knew that.</p>
              <p>In business, we 
                      would love to carry zero inventory but this is not possible as demand 
                      surges cannot be predicted with absolute certainty. Even build-to-order 
                      firms such as Dell carry inventory! If we have nothing to sell when 
                      demand picks up, business goes to the competition. Here again, the cost 
                      of losing business outweighs the cost of carrying inventory.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the topic of inventory and spare capacity is often poorly
                       reported or analysed in the financial media. It is however crucially 
                      important. Changes in inventory affect the measurement of true GDP 
                      growth and corporate profits. Misunderstand this and you may end up 
                      investing in property or your business on fall premises.</p>
              <p>For 
                      example, the US reported 'sterling' GDP growth of around 5.6 per cent 
                      for 1Q 2010. See chart from Moody's Economy.com which shows this 
                      impressive trajectory. Unfortunately, the breakdown of data shows that 
                      more than 3.5 per cent from this 5.6 per cent comes from re-stocking. 
                      That is, final demand, which is the true level of growth, was only 2 per
                       cent.</p>
              <p>Indeed, this is affirmed by other data points. Currently,
                       US real retail sales (ex-autos and gasoline) are growing at about 2 to 
                      2.5 per cent annually.</p>
              <p>When demand started to recover in the 
                      second half of 2009, US firms did not ramp up production because they 
                      were uncertain of the future. They sold from existing inventories. Now 
                      that things have stabilised, inventory has to be re-built because the 
                      shelves are nearly empty.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the latest ISM data 
                      shows that the pace of inventory rebuilding is far greater than the pace
                       of new orders - meaning that production has to be throttled back in the
                       second half of 2010. I expect US GDP growth to taper off to 2.5 per 
                      cent by the end of 2010 - the level of sustainable final demand.</p>
              <p>The big jump in Singapore's 1Q 2010 GDP numbers, led by manufacturing, 
                      is very likely due to this re-stocking in the US. Once the US is through
                       re-stocking, Singapore's GDP will taper off as well. Therefore, it is 
                      premature for any hikes in CPF.</p>
              <p>Does it make sense to stipulate a
                       wage increase for labour just because companies are re-stocking? I 
                      thought growth through productivity was all about growing one's wages 
                      from higher skills and global relevance.</p>

              <p>Wow hes advocating building flats until there is excess inventory? What then if there is another crisis and people default on their payments? HDB would then have even more inventory on their hands and suffer massive losses.</p>
              <p>As for the Oil, Prices shot up because of the speculative Peak Oil Theory; where the world's supply of oil can no longer meet demand and everyone had a run on that commodity. For Oil you cant simply make more oil when there is increased demand - it is truly limited. So comparing Oil with flats doesnt make sense.</p>

                      factors by inflating prices with supply shortage..</p>
              <p>HDB's policy failures shows that highest pay alone does not 
                      produce the best results. Past performance also does not guarantee 
                      future performance. Its is the openess to competition of ideas and the 
                      less efficient ones being discarded that have stood the test of time.</p>

              <p>Wow hes advocating building flats until there is excess
              inventory? What then if there is another crisis and people default
              on their payments? HDB would then have even more inventory on their
              hands and suffer massive losses.</p>
              <p>As for the Oil, Prices shot up because of the speculative Peak
              Oil Theory; where the world's supply of oil can no longer meet
              demand and everyone had a run on that commodity. For Oil you cant
              simply make more oil when there is increased demand - it is truly
              limited. So comparing Oil with flats doesnt make sense.</p>

              <p>Oh the next 1.5- 2 million people thats going to be flooded in can mop the excess inventory easily.. The govt wants to embark on a policy of liberal immigration and you are worried a minimum inventory is a problem?</p>

              <p>Do you realize that the rise in housing prices is an asset bubble that is due to excess liquidity and speculative buying because of singapore's 'liberal immigration policy'?

              <p>Yup either high prices now(sucks to be home buyers) and have the housing market be shielded in the event of a downturn</p>
              <p>Or, do what the government is doing to make people happy, keep prices 'reasonable' by soaking up excess demand and risk having your flats be worthless in a downturn.</p>
