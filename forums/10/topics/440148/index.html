              locked horns during the final day of the 12th Parliament's first meeting on 
              Friday.</p>
              <p> <br>As the last speaker to speak from the opposition bench, Low -- 
              the MP for <span id="lw_1319261827_0" class="yshortcuts">Aljunied GRC</span> -- took 
              aim at Minister Lim Swee Say’s oft-repeated slogan of “cheaper, better, faster” 
              and said that  “perhaps we will start to see better, faster ministers at work 
              and perhaps cheaper (ones) after the ministerial salary review is completed”. 
              <br> <br>He also urged the government to ask itself why Singaporeans commonly 
              perceived the government to be "more concerned with paying its ministers well 
              than about the welfare of the people."     <br> <br>In reply, Lim – who is the 
              Minister in the <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=13c297klu/EXP=1320482082/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Prime%2BMinister%2527s%2BOfficefr=fp-today%26cs=bz">Prime Minister’s Office</a> as well as chief of the <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=1383fkcsl/EXP=1320482082/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=NTUC%2Blabour%2Bmovement%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">NTUC labour movement</a> —said that his “cheaper, better, faster” 
              slogan was referring to products and services and that comparisons were 
              unfair.<br> <br>“There’s a fundamental difference,” he said in his speech. “What 
              the NTUC and the tripartite partners and pursuing are cheaper, better, faster 
              products and services, and a cheaper, better, faster economy, not a cheaper, 
              better, faster workforce.”<br> <br>The East Coast GRC MP also said he was at a 
              loss for words when Low said he felt that ministers served out of self-interest, 
              accusing opposition MPs of taking credit for "the good things" that the 
              government has done since the <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=138vi52du/EXP=1320482082/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=May%2BGeneral%2BElection%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">May General Election</a> by saying that the presence of opposition 
              MPs have brought about policy changes. <br> <br>Separately, Low also urged the 
              People’s Action Party to refrain from using “doom and gloom” scenarios when 
              debating health care and welfare policy trade-offs.<br> <br>“I urge the PAP to 
              step out of the shadow of doom and gloom of certain pitfalls of Western liberal 
              democracy and work towards a First World Parliament in our own way,” he 
              said.<br> <br>Low was defending Non-Constituency MPs <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12tr18tom/EXP=1320482082/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Gerald%2BGiam%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">Gerald Giam</a> and <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=131oas3gc/EXP=1320482082/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Yee%2BJenn%2BJong%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">Yee Jenn Jong</a>'s earlier calls for the government to spend on 
              affordable and adequate health care, housing and retirement financing. 
              <br> <br>Both NMPs were then reminded by Minister of State for Trade and 
              Industry and National Development, <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=1307gj0bl/EXP=1320482082/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Lee%2BYi%2BShyan%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">Lee Yi Shyan</a>, of the pitfalls of a welfare state, citing the 
              example of a debt-ridden Greece and its welfare system. <br> <br>In rebuttal, 
              Low said "it is high time the PAP MPs refrain from using this as a red herring 
              to kill debate on alternative solutions and mechanisms to those proposed by the 
              government."<br> <br>Low added that the government had used the term "policy 
              trade-offs" to defend decisions that benefited them instead of the people. Low 
              gave the example of the decision to build the integrated resorts with casinos 
              and the government "highlighted the benefits to our society over the related 
              gaming and social ills -- never mind the trade-offs," said Low.<br> <br>Low 
              however did commend the PAP for its "resilience in response to ground reaction" 
              and added that it was not the opposition MPs, but rather the voters that should 
              really claim the credit for recent changes as they had voted more opposition in 
              and that the result is that the PAP takes a serious look at what is 
              happening.<br> <br>Both Lim and Low also eventually agreed that national 
              interest would remain above their own partisan ones.</p>

              <p>I think PAP MPs have too much welfare, just join a GRC and free ride into parliament with over $10,000 monthly allowance.</p>
              <p>Abolish the GRCs and compete on your own lah. So useless meh, don't dare to fight for votes alone?</p>
