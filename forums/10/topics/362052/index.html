              <p><strong>Radio: Israel to build new settlement in West Bank </strong></p>
              <p><span class="hui12"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2009-05-18 </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span>JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A new Jewish settlement 
              will be built in northern West Bank for the first time in 26 years</strong></span>, Israeli Army 
              Radio reported Monday. </span></p>
              <p><span>A tender of 20 residential units was issued recently 
              for the new settlement named Maskiot, which is to be established on the ruins of 
              another settlement abandoned years ago, according to the report. </span></p>
              <p><span>The report said the construction plan, which was to 
              transform a former army outpost into a permanent settlement for Jewish evacuees 
              from the Gaza Strip, was initiated in late 2006 by former Israeli Defense 
              Minister Amir Peretz, but was frozen due to the U.S. pressure. </span></p>
              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The United States and other western countries have 
              been calling on Israel to halt its settlement expansion.</strong></span> U.S. President Barack 
              Obama, who will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 
              Washington Monday, said several times that Israel should stop all settlement 
              activities in line with the obligations that it undertook as part of the 2003 
              international "roadmap" peace plan. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, David Ahayeini, head of the Jordan Valley 
              Regional Council that oversees Maskiot, has insisted that the construction is 
              being carried out completely legally.</span></p>
              <p><span>"There is full consensus among Zionist parties that 
              the Jordan Valley must remain under Israeli control within the framework of any 
              diplomatic deal," Ahayeini was quoted as saying. "The Jordan Valley is needed 
              for the sake of state security, and woe to the administration that strays from 
              this path." </span></p>
              <p><span>The local anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now movement 
              said the move is the proof that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Netanyahu is not ready to commit to a two-state 
              solution" and is striving to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span>There are more than 280,000 Israeli settlers 
              currently living in the occupied West Bank and some 200,000 living in 
              settlements in annexed east Jerusalem, according to the Peace Now statistics. </span></p>

              <p>Is it not surprising that China has move on from the events of WW-2, and developed her relationships with Japan and the whole World, while Israel will continue to hold the World to ransom with the WW-2 events remembered as the Holocaust ?</p>
              <p>Under the cover of holding the conscience of the World to ransom, the Israeli Right Wing Politicians will encroach on the same principles that they demand for themselves but will deny the same to those Arabs - generally known as Palestinians, who were born and lived for generations within the national territories now known as Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon - as well as in the terrirtories of Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
              <p>It is time that Europe and the USA should shake themselves loose from continuously being held to ransom and manipulated by Israel to achieve their own agenda of Israeli expansion at the expense of the native dwellers of the region.</p>

              <p>Not all of these native dwellers are members of Fatah nor of Hamas - some are disgusted with the impotence and corruption of Fatah, and some are similary disgusted with the dogmatic militancy of Hamas.</p>
              <p>The violence will continue as long as Israel refuse to accomodate those Arab native dwellers with roots that date back to the early history of the Jewish and Arab people in this region, and now leading to both sides fighting this land as their home.</p>

              <p>I think this was probably Israel's plan to kill off the leaders who were not so hostile to each other and to bring in more radical members to Hamas and Fatah so as to escalate the rivalry between the two groups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In September 2005, Israel began their plan of withdrawing troops from the gaza strip and leaving the PA to rule it. This triggered a war between Hamas and Fatah. If Arafat and Yassin were still alive they might had cooperated with each other, but both were killed in 2004.</p>

              <p>Blame the US, and their politicians dependency on the Jewish votes and money to keep them in power and inturn turning a blind eye towards Palestinian sufferings.</p>
              <p>And damn the House of Saud for not helping their own brothers and instead turn a blind eye for political dominance and protection from the US.</p>
              <p>Infact, all the world problems with terrorism stems from the US greed and ride rough shod over the natives and exploiting their lands for their own gain. If the US did not interfere in Iran in the 50s-70s we would not have fundamentalist Ayatollahs in control of Iran today. If the US might have payed enough attention in Afghanistan in the early 90s after bankrolling the Mujahideen war against the Soviets during the 80s, they might have noticed the warlords warring against each other and might have stemmed the rise of the Taliban. Instead they left the country to destroy itself after they gain their revenge against the Russians.</p>
              <p>Screw the politicians, they are ruining the world we and our future children live in</p>
