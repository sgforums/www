Almost all the Chinese populated countries have grown strongly in the last 2 decades. Does the growth of Singapore comes from merely good management? Or does other factors come into play?<br><br>Or why does Taiwan - a country is has fighting in parliament, corruption scandals, be ahead of Singapore a country of good management in producing research in supporting the economy?<br><br>Why are they better in producing a more vibrant arts and music scene, and better wireless internet infrastructure?<br><br></div>

If the point of outbreak is in Singapore, I am sure the results would have been similar.<br><br>Cambodia? Might as well compare Somalia and Ethiopia right. Maybe it's because they didn't pay Pol Pot enough, if they pay him and his cronies millions of US dollars in salary, maybe Cambodia will be like Singapore now.<br><br>There is no 2 person with same features, but yet we are able to make comparisons based on similarities, different doesn't mean we can't make comparisons, but we need to make equitable comparisons. Comparing with Malaysia and Cambodia is not an equitable comparisons. First of all Malaysia, the population make up is different, the geographical make up is also different.<br>For Cambodia, it was ground zero of ideological conflict after World War 2, where Russia and China was trying to exert hegemony on it, with US exacting an opposing motion. If the government of Singapore was caught in this position. Do you think that we will able to escape unscathed? (You have a few major powers concentrating their ideology on an undeveloped nation.) You have 4-5 giants fighting each other in your country; you think a Mr. Lee makes a difference?<br><br>Why compare Hong Kong with Singapore? They have a colonial past, they have similar population make up, they have a vibrant port, they have little material resources, they have limited land space, etc.<br><br>Hong Kong, though it's now under the care of the Chinese government has more freedom than Singapore, they can voice their discontent publicly with fear of being arrested and put in prison.</div>
