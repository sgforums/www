            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's model of governance can only be applied to authoritarian regimes, it will never work in countries such as France, Germany, Britain, USA, Switzerland, etc. The citizens there value their lifestyle and freedom too much, if their government tries implementing such style of governance, riots will break out leading to the downfall of the government.<br><br>PAP's style of governance has worked well till now is because of Singaporean's kiasi (fear of consequences) attitude, since young we are brought up under their draconian laws, we don't even have the basic right to protest to our discontentment; how would such style of governance be right? If you dine in a fine restaurant, you find that the food is not up to your expectation, you would raise the issue with the manager, but in the Singapore context, such rights has been removed from you, you are not able to voice any objection to the food being served.</div>
