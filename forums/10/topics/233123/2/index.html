            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I was comparing Singapore to JB and Batam, simply because Singapore is located in this region, near JB and Batam. It is an illustration that national sovereignty is a powerful and potent boundary.<br><br>Imagine, you take a ferry only, or cross the bridge only, and things change so much.<br><br>Why? Simply because the management is different. That is all.<br><br>It is perhaps the same like when you see those photos of Korea border.<br><br>On one side you will see an athletic South Korean soldier with a nice uniform. On the other side you see a smaller size North Korean soldier with an uniform too big.<br><br>I still remember a photo where the South Korean side has smooth paved road and North Korean side has crackly road.<br><br>Why?? Actually they are one nation. They are one nation but with two different governments. Different management.<br><br>So, when I compare Singapore to JB and Batam, it is to illustrate the strength of Singapore management.<br><br>Although you think Singapore demographics is different from JB or Batam, but actually, not so much different. It's not so much a question of demographics, but management.<br><br>If we compare Singapore to HK or Taiwan, sure, they are also good. But remember, HK is twice of Singapore.<br><br>Taiwan is many times of Singapore.<br><br>As an illustration, can you imagine if Singapore is divided into half, and then one of it become a country and compete with the 'whole' Singapore? What do you think it will be like?<br><br>So I would say, Singapore, which is one half of HK only, and one-dunno-how-manyth of Taiwan only, is standing up real well to comparison.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok guys. Elites is always the thing to talk about when such topic is hanging.<br><br>I know many of netizens around here dont really like PAP. Me too share the same thought. But i've come to a conculsion.<br><br>1) At least now in SGP, PAP can bring SG forward and successful if not no point complaining abt them. Admit it, they did a gd job in overcoming SARS and generating jobs for people. IR is a big project that is going to boost SG econs.<br><br>2)Compare Oppositon to PAP, the opposition is still not as capable as PAP. You might vote them the winner and the next, SG will crash. Opposition just have to try harder to prove to us that they will do a job at least as good as PAP.<br><br>3)I say we're lucky in a way or another but not in a whole. Lucky we dont exp floods as terrible as msia. We dont have hurricane like in US. Look at taiwan govt n ours, which do u prefer.  Taiwan is so unorganised in the parliament house whenever they got conflict. Among ASEAN countries, we're the youngest and can say we r the most successful among all.<br><br>4) Why do you think MNCs want to invest in SG? Save,Stable and Secure. That shows how much PAP have contribute. Going overseas and have regular meetings with other country's ministers to have close links.<br><br>somehow, we're lucky in one way or another but not the luckiest.</div>

Let's say there are 500 robberies in JB every week, as long as there are 499 robberies in Singapore we can be considered lucklier... which is pretty much nonsense. Also by that "lucky" logic we can conclude that when I see Cystaire being robbed and realize it's just the 458th robbery I can pretty much ignore it as we are still considered "lucky."</strong></blockquote>2.Dunt truth the manipualted figures fr SG and MY.Ask your fren,relatives and colleagues thenu know the crimes rate.</div>
