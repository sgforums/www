            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Generally</strong>, we are lucky.<br><br>When we talk about lucky here, i think it just boils down to the fact in the position of where we are standing. If we so happen to be high up there, powerful, rich and everything at the back of your call, i think that would be indeed considered lucky and that your view of the world is peaceful and prosperous.<br><br>However when you are unemployed, faced with the increase in GST, and a lot of mouths to feed at home. You would definitely feel you are the world unluckiest person. Unable to even provide the basic needs and eduction for the young, not being able to put food on the table, will the rich ever have this experience? Will the poor feel lucky in the state that they are in? And lets not forget that there will always be more poor ppl than the rich ones.<br><br>So how lucky can they go.</div>
