The direction, the discipline influences a lot on what values the child holds.<br><br>I will also like to point out that a rich parent doesn't necessary will raise a better child than a poor parent even though they might have a lot resources at hand to make use of. Survivability can often push human to limit most would have thought was not possible and Singapore has just shown that.<br><br>Just like u said, the infant stage of a nation shapes largely how the nation will be. Luck didn't play a large part at all in shaping what Singapore is to be now kudos to our good parent.<br><br>Look at Taiwan, look at Hong Kong and u will see how human when cornered, will stand up much stronger than some other richer nation.<br><br>That I guess is really human.</div>

We would probably have ended up with more home grown industries like Hong Kong and would not have taken the course taken by Mr. Lee (the elder), who relied heavily on Foreign Direct Investments, all of which have taken flight seeking greener pastures in China, India, Vietnam, etc. Thus leaving us with a fragile economy and an uncertain future.<br><br>Anyway, the credit of developing Singapore doesn't belong soley to Mr. Lee, there are other older Ministers who contributed to the development of Singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Meat Pao:<strong><br>As a comparison, look at another new nation, East Timor.<br><br>The leadership were educated in Mozambique.
