              <p>since you are concerned about FT, in addition to your
              postings, have you ever tried to help them find a job , say in your
              company? there are so many FTs, certainly 1 of these have the same
              skills as you ? why not you talk to your HR or give the FTs the
              email to write in to? or tel no? or your office address? you may
              also have coffee with them to listen to their stories of job
              seeking, the challenges and ups and downs? at least you can provide
              them a shoulder to cry on? or lend a helping hand or useful
              ear?</p>

              <p>Yes, true the foreigners are flocking here, but the there are also many being send back, and the send back ones do outweight the incoming ones. It is just a reducation in replacement of the current lots here, which is shrinking too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Logic behind this replacement was most older one being here for 4 to 6 years, all salaries had gone up and most already know the in and out of working here, i.e know how to go lazy and hiding or mc and some can even demand for more..</p>
              <p>The replacement is a renewal of new blood with a new yes sir  mindset very much intact. Better control and of course, lower paid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Employing local workers is a problem in heavy industries such as road works, construction and Marine or oil rigs. Our people are mostly ah pek or uncles liao, most prefer to laze in my outside joo chiat coffee shops or geyland. Not only local workers demand high paid, they also like to complaint a lot and alway show dissatifaction to  bosses like me.</p>

              <p>Of course not. They are saying "congee is scarce, monks are many".</p>
              <p>In the 1st place, why is there a need for foreigners?</p>
              <p>Lack of resources.</p>
              <p>But in a crisis where retrenchments are happening? You think there is a scarcity of resources? Definitely much much much less than before. But what is the number of foreigners here already? How many are on their way coming in already? Where is the control?</p>

              <p>i agree that too many foriegners are here in Singapore to fight with locals for jobs that locals can do.i have been to the job fair and i seen it with my own eyes.</p>
              <p>most if not all, foriegners flock here because their government cant do a good jobs to provide them with jobs and secrurity.Their corrupted government only know how to spend the countries wealth instead of put in more passion and hardwork on how to build a strong economic to provide jobs for their citizens.without compassion towards their citizens, their corrupted government caused alot of their citizens without jobs and poor to the extend of robberies everywhere.</p>
              <p>So, now they cant find jobs, Singaporeans had to give our ricebowl to them?Is this logical?To those who support the government policy of letting in foriegners without any check and balance, their country problem is our problem?</p>
              <p>To show compassion to the foriegners doesnt mean we had to let go of our own citizens ricebowl.Our son and daughter are the future generations to build our country, our parents need ricebowl to feed them.Not that we lack of compassion towards the foriegners, but sometimes we need to think of reality, and reality is, protect our own citizens first before talking about helping others.</p>
              <p>Imagine Singapore was so compassion towards Malaysia that we let in so many Malaysians into our shore to work either as operators or other jobs during the good times.i work in factory before and i know.If not for Singapore compassion, do you guys think Malaysia can create so many jobs for so many Malaysian workers during the 80's and 90's?</p>
              <p>Now economic go downhill in Malaysia, they are stopping foriegners and that including us Singaporeans.If let's say down here we are really so short of jobs, we need to work in Malaysia, but now they are cutting down on foriegners, so aint that so called protecting their own citizens first?We help others during good times, during bad times who going to help us?</p>
              <p>Think about it, helping foriegners and helping our citizens are 2 different things.Don't mix up reality and compassion.And compassion doesnt mean let go of our own priority. Hope my article can make some sense to some who still think we must let in as much foriegners as possible if not our economic will go bust.</p>

              <p>I agreed totally with you. I worked in factory in the 80s before (there are many singaporean) now I joined back the workforce and choose to work in the factory. Do you know wat?? 90% of the production operators are malaysian holding a PR.They are drawing the same pay as we singaporean. They work here, earn sing dollars, but stay in Malaysia. I do not know why government issues so many PR. Jobs all goes to them instead of singaporean. Really very sad to see our citizens without job and foreigners earning our money and critisizing our country.  </p>

              <p>To me I feel like a lot of blame is being attributed to the FT themselves.  It's like the FT are infiltrating the SG system or the system isn't able to cope with the FT without impacting us local workers.  Will higher taxes or E-fuck-off-Z-link changes solve the problem?  No.</p>
              <p>I feel this is unfair, because the FT situation is a direct result of government policy.  This isn't something the government needs to improve on.  This is how the government INTENDS it.  Whether it's for the long term good of Singaporeans or to bolster corporate income, the fact remains that the influx of FT is the intended result of government policy.  Don't blame or penalise the foreigners coming in for what they thinks is a fair deal.</p>

              <p><br>There's really no such thing as a fair deal.</p>
              <p>And it isn't exactly what the government has intended it like what you have mentioned.</p>
              <p>But you can blame the government for recruiting talents who aren't "evil" enough to devise good but efficient double standards policies which will silently protects it's country's welfare against foreigners who comes to rape our country and it's people of their rights and welfare openly and globally.</p>
              <p>FTs of course are welcome to take advantage of Singapore, but it is also necessary for the government to take back at least every 60cents for every dollar earned.</p>

              <p>If business set up in singapore do you think they doesnt know singapore labour cost is not cheapest? is labour cost the only reason? what abt the security that singaporean men sacrifice to protect the safe environment tat all enterprise love and enjoy? how abt the low tax that business in singapore enjoy other than HK?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we understand the need of globalisation trade. Do note that singaporeans are not asking for a total fullstop on foreigners, but we need to set a cap, a set of guidelines more strictly than ever?</p>

              <p>Aust has just announce they are immigrants to preserve job for local aussie.</p>

              <p>I agreed totally with you. I worked in factory in the 80s before (there are many singaporean) now I joined back the workforce and choose to work in the factory. Do you know wat?? 90% of the production operators are malaysian holding a PR.They are drawing the same pay as we singaporean. They work here, earn sing dollars, but stay in Malaysia. I do not know why government issues so many PR. Jobs all goes to them instead of singaporean. Really very sad to see our citizens without job and foreigners earning our money and critisizing our country.  </p>

              <p>Malaysian are consider Tradition source workers, unlike NTS, non tradition source. Malaysians here are mostly chinese and indians, of course minority of Malaysian Malays here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question to raise here is, do you think singapore can be what it is today without Malaysians contribution to our early industrialisation?. And secondly, Do you think we can survive now if the malaysian is to withdraw all their citizens back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my opinons, without the malaysian, we long ago had collapsed. In fact, most Chinese Malaysians have helped our economy alot, and i hv seen alot of hardworking ones. Not only malaysians workers are here, there are also alots of Executives from malaysia holding top post in Singapore. And some even build their family here to become singapore citizens, as our education is good for their childrens.</p>
