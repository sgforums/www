              <p>then when JB's land cost goes up.. then what.. relocation again ?</p>

              <p>Then I must ask.. what is the true cost of land to the gahmen ? Zero.</p>
              <p>What they are giving up is merely "opportunity costs".</p>

The Oldies are eligible to vote, so are the younger ones, if govt is to treat oldies badly, the younger one like me will see a image of ourselve getting there too, so do you think we still trust the govt.</p>

As a country lack of resources and small, what do you have, keep depending on the MNC and those circuit boards and kong guan biscuit is not going to help us much in the future as these companies will soon move out to lower cost countries. Beside biochemical and pharmacutical the next foresight will be entertaining, we are targeting singaporeans, but the whole world, and most of all the Chinese rich.</p>

              <p>I am not saying that USA got no good policies, but the way i look at it, accept for being a bit gracious in the west, (even beggars are polite), they are deterioting and hope they recover as we depend on them, if they decided to spend more this coming fall, great, we can manufacture more for them and we get more jobs, but if they remain down and conservatives unlike what they had in the past, spending lavishly, then, we look toward the resorts for some hope to serve our Asia Market.</p>

              <p>Please ok Mr Yap, you don't have to sound like my father. We the

              But most of us in SGforums are not them. But then again..even old
              men may also not like your approach. Very naggy.</p>
