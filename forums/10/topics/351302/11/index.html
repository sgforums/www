              <p>But let me ask you a very practical question.</p>
              <p>When you are old.. do you expect your children to feed you while they go hungry?</p>
              <p>I believe old people should be given the chance and infrastructure to be independent.</p>
              <p>The children are there for the support, but expecting to rely on them 100% is not practical at all.</p>
              <p>And what about the grandchildren ?</p>
              <p>If you have children.. do you really want to be a burden to them ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many times.. I imagine myself growing old in Singapore.. wat kind of life will I be living ?</p>
