              <p>We also dun give a damn of what USA citizens think of us, they
              are the spending brats and we are just waiting for them to spend
              more but seem like they are coming to a full stop and that is the
              worrying part, they can't even save New Orlean peoples and are
              target of the world muslims. And because of their rights, lack of
              control, except maybe for the rich and famous, the rest are just
              making up the nos, most of their jobs long gone oversea already and
              their financial peoples are game over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you know who recruited those singaporean at the e2i hub for
              the resort, it is the Macau chai, not american or european or
              local, but Macau who worked for Tung, Sand, lisbon, etc etc before
              and we are already having them here, 150 of them from higher to mid
              management. As a country lack of resources and small, what do you
              have, keep depending on the MNC and those circuit boards and kong
              guan biscuit is not going to help us much in the future as
              these companies will soon move out to lower cost countries. Beside
              biochemical and pharmacutical the next foresight will be
              entertaining, we are targeting singaporeans, but the whole world,
              and most of all the Chinese rich.</p>
              <p>I am not saying that USA got no good policies, but the way i
              look at it, accept for being a bit gracious in the west, (even
              beggars are polite), they are deterioting and hope they recover as
              we depend on them, if they decided to spend more this coming fall,
              great, we can manufacture more for them and we get more jobs, but
              if they remain down and conservatives unlike what they had in the
              past, spending lavishly, then, we look toward the resorts for
              some hope to serve our Asia Market.</p>

              <p>New Orleans is a sad case, no doubt.. a combination of arrogance and lack of foresight. However , Katrina was a big disaster. If it was Singapore, half of our land woulda be a flat piece of watery graves, you think our officials coulda done a better job ?</p>
              <p>And you think the Casinos are not MNCs ? Who are the top management dudes ? Any Singaproean on board ?</p>
              <p>If North Am are not spending brats.. do you think the economy can turn as fast ? Can we really depend on the Asians to spur the economy with our "hoarding" virtue/culture ? If everyone keep saving.. then who is buying ?</p>
              <p>Yes you may think westerners are materialistic.. but have you wonder why Asians arn't able to turn the table around ? Let Asians be the consumers, and westerners be the manufacturers and providers to Asian's materialistic needs. Can that happen with the kind of beliefs thats so deeply rooted in our Asian culture ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps , but it will take several generations to have that happen. For the sake of all Singaporeans.. let's hope the China people will be as materialistic as the Ang mohs before the "Cresort" starts operating.</p>

              <p>Yes you may think westerners are materialistic.. but have you wonder why Asians arn't able to turn the table around ? Let Asians be the consumers, and westerners be the manufacturers and providers to Asian's materialistic needs. Can that happen with the kind of beliefs thats so deeply rooted in our Asian culture ?</p>
