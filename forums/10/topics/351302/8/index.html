                                      British Borneo and that why Singapore lost Christmas and Cocos
                                      Islands to Oz. The Brits didn't want the Malays or communists to be
                                      at Oz their big land at their doorstep. In the end he got this
                                      miserable piece of dirt, that why he cried. His dreams of getting
                                      British Borneo shattered.</p>
              <p>Guess you were not there when it happens. Those who read both
                                      English and Mandarin at that time know more on both sides of the
                                      history. Most of the reports are bias on either end of the
                                      spectrum.</p>
              <p>The Speak Madarin is a coy to kill the major dialects. As Hakka

                                      was young. (long long time ago). Akin to the Chin (a small but
