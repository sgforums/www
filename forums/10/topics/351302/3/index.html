Stop issuing S-pass or work permits to these <strong>cheap foreign talents</strong> (actually calling them talents is really an insult to our own abilities).</p>
              <p>In good times, we really dont mind foreigners to take up jobs which Singaporeans do not want.</p>
              <p>Now it is the time for these highly paid PM and Ministers to show they are really worthly of getting such high pays...... '<em><strong>Else we may one day replace them with those cheap foreign talents too. (LOL)'</strong></em></p>
