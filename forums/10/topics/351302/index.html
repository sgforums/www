              <p><strong>Record jobs to be lost this year and foreigners still flocking to Singapore to compete with locals for jobs<br><br></strong>In my previous article, I wrote about the recent reports published by the media giving an erroneous impression of the abundance of jobs in the labor market for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>CNA reported today that this year’s retrenchment figures are likely to bust the record of 29,000 jobs lost in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis, according to Singapore National Employers Federation’s (SNEF’s) president, Stephen Lee. (source: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/414320/1/.html"><span style="color: #a91b33;">CNA</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was commenting on a survey finding by HR firm Manpower Staffing Services where 636 employers across seven industry sectors were polled.</p>
              <p>The survey found that 50 per cent of employers anticipate a cut in headcount, 29 per cent expect no change, while only seven per cent expect to increase staff strength in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>I believe that the figure of 29,000 is an underestimate and the real figure is much higher. Many SMEs and MNCs are already retrenching workers and freezing their recruitment drives. Measures such as wage cuts and forcing workers to take no-pay leave are introduced to reduce the overheads.</p>
              <p>In this dire economic situation, welfare  of workers is least on the minds of employers who are desperately trying to keep their companies afloat by trimming operating expenses. Without tighter legislation to regulate the hiring of foreigners, many will take the easy way out by replacing locals with cheaper foreign labor.</p>
              <p>At a job fair organized recently by Resorts World Sentosa, a significant number of applicants were also foreigners who flew here just to look for a job. (source: <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Prime%2BNews/Story/STIStory_348034.html"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Straits Times</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Filipina Elahn Grace, 28, an English graduate, who arrived two weeks ago, said she chose Singapore because ‘it is a safe place and there are many opportunities here’. Another Filipina, Ms Candy Lopez, 24, lost her job back home as an accountant recently, and decided to come here to try and find employment. She said: ‘I’m just taking a chance to be employed.’</p>
              <p>While we cannot prevent these foreigners from coming to our shores, a strong message must be sent out to them that jobs in Singapore are reserved for locals only.</p>
              <p>We need not look too far away for examples. The Malaysian government yesterday cancelled work visas issued to more than 55,000 Bangladeshi workers after demands from unions, as the country faces layoffs and the threat of recession. (source: <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Asia/Malaysia/Story/STIStory_348500.html"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Straits Times</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Bangladeshi workers who had visas approved in 2007 but who had not yet arrived in Malaysia would not be allowed to take up employment here.</p>
              <p>Foreigners should be allowed only in certain sectors and where vacancies are not filled up by Singaporeans. There are other ways to reduce business costs and employing foreigners at the expense of locals is definitely not one of them.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope the Ministry of Manpower can consider doing more to safeguard the jobs of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Sending unemployed workers for retraining is not a bad move, but they still need to bring the bread home at the end of the day. Unless the government pay the last salary received by workers going for retraining, it will do very little to help them tide through this difficult period.</p>
              <p>It is no joke to lose one’s job the midst of the nation’s worst ever recession. I was retrenched once before and was out of job for almost a year. With housing mortages, bank loans, credit card bills to pay and few savings in the bank to count on, how long can a Singapore worker survive without a job?<br><br><a href="http://wayangparty.com/?p=6155">http://wayangparty.com/?p=6155</a>   <br>By Jeremy Koh</p>

              <p>Just to point out.</p>
              <p>There's a 12 months diploma course being run at 3dsense that costs around 18k last i remembered.</p>
              <p>Now because of SPUR, it costs 2,200 and students receive an additional 1,000 per month for 6 months as a subsidy.</p>
              <p>Just one of the example that i know of currently.</p>
              <p>I'm not too sure how much they're giving for the courses of the other industries, though.</p>
              <p>But a person that has housing mortgages, bank loans, credit card bills and yet still have few savings in the bank seems to me to be living beyond their means and has a weak sense of responsibility.</p>
              <p>Would it be fair then, to use the money for people who live within their means and save alot to pay for the spendthrift habits of people who aren't responsible with their money?</p>

              <p>Maybe we can look at it from another angle.  </p>
              <p>Companies need to reduce their overheads to keep the companies afloat.  Now, if hiring foreigners who accept lower pay and can do more is going to achieve that, they will do it. </p>
              <p>On the whole, Singapore's government has to keep as many companies alive as possible.  If the companies close down, we are also shooting ourselves in the foot as that would mean even more retrenchment.</p>
              <p>The government's goal thus is to reduce labor costs, thus reducing company overheads in order keep our economy alive.  Hence, foreigners will keep flooding here as long as the government allows, and they will find jobs as long as they are willing to accept lower pay. </p>
              <p>So what happens to Singaporeans in this equation?  We either choose to accept lower pay... or suck thumb.   On the other hand, this is also a good time to upgrade onself, take some time off to study.  Hopefully, when you come out, you'd be able to find better jobs while being better qualified and in a more optimistic economic climate.  Hopefully.</p>
