            <div class='col-md body'>What is the criteria used in the selection of SAF officers? It seems that sons of Members of Parliament (PAP side) or high ranking officers in the SAF are automatically officers. But are these children qualified? The sons of these people are treated differently during their BMT. Imagine what would happen to the PC if the son of the Minister of Defence is being confined on a weekend. It seems that Singapore is still not a very Democratic country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do most of you understand the term "democratic"? It's more a question of "meritocracy", rather than "democracy".<br>But I'm not saying whether Singapore is 100% democratic. All of us know what kind of state *ah-hem* Singapore is, and I won't wanna get sued or anything.<br><br>But I do agree that the selection of officers is a felony.  While I did BMT, in my company, every platoon had less than 10 people going to OCS.  Whereas in another company, each platoon saw about 20 people going to OCS.  (Each BMT platoon has about 48 - 54 men, for those unfamiliar with army lingo. And OCS is Officer Cadet Skool) It's got nothing to do with education level - All of us had 'A' levels.  If OCS really picks the best calibre, it should be more of picking the top 10% of each platoon, so that everyone stands an equal chance.<br><br>But what the heck anyway! Do you really want that extra years of reservist? Are there that many priviledges being an officer? C'mon! After 2 and a half WASTED YEARS, out on the street, who gives a %&amp;*# whether or not u were an officer?

For all we know, the straits times is the biggest media joke and we all know that the CNN, CNBC and so on provide a more transparent and uncensored version of the news as it is ....esp home news. Lastly, I really admire u for ur admiration of our BG Lee. U make him sound like a supreme being.....well maybe like father like son? u for all i care can believe in his ability and not have a single doubt, but i and some others, and many more to come, will have and always have had a lot of doubts in his capabilities esp. military wise......btw, until there is war, a lot remains to be seen.....then again, there'll hardly be a war fought here, so think again......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the truth,<br><br>Please Do Not Put YOUR WORDS Into My Context, as I have earlier spoke about Speech Ettiquency.<br><br>Your comment about me being a 'Pro-PAP' individual have deal an amount of disregard for my credibility as a speaker/ writer.<br><br>I am definitely impartial in my writings, and relate to what I see.<br><br>What I see is that we have got the best Government Management so far that has kept Singapore in the long run for International Progress and Recognition.<br><br>If anyone was any better they would have taken over the current Management and proven themselves by now. And if they prove their worth, I dare say that I would definitely be one of the first to applaud them.<br><br>May I serve a gentle reminder:<br><br>Whenever you start to burt your rotor mouth off, try to ask yourself the "Why Not?" question.<br><br>If you were of any sense to the discussion here then perhaps you would understand the rationale behind this "Why Not' policy.<br><br>I have always adopt this approach to understanding your postings. Like the statements you made, I evaluated them by using the "Why Not" question and found that there are much less reasons to substantiate your claims, which would be labelled as "of no substantial value".<br><br>Yes, we can definitely continue with this discussion because that's the way a discussion goes when it progresses into a debate. And the involvement of a debate is the hottest part and definitely the most constructive element of a good discussion.<br><br>If you have read my other postings, there are also instances whereby I also try to understand your rationale (Adrian's as well) and voice my agreement. Which is why I don't see any biased based materials in my writings.<br><br>I am contributing to this forum under an open mind with my point of view, through my years of experience. Yes, I have been through NS, as a Combat Engineer, PES A.<br><br>I do contribute to CPF as well, like all of you here, except that maybe I see more rationale and advantages in it than most of you here.<br><br>Well, the truth,<br><br>Supposedly you were in a debate with another team regarding this topic, Are you going to label the other team as "pro PAP" and proclaim the discussion a standstill??<br><br>We are all thinkers in our own rights and I believe that I, together with the rest of you here, Deserves The Humanitian Right To Be Respected For Our Reasoning, The Right to be Viewed for Our Reasoning In Speech, Rather than Viewing Me as in the Political Party I Support, which clearly shows unpolished materials in your inventory.<br><br>Your comments about my Political Allegiance could possibly generate a laughing stock in a REAL conference.<br><br>------------------<br>Chromeheart Minds: The Endless Search for Intellectual Freedom</div>

Can you tell me whether if BG Lee alone could change the course of Nature just because like why you said, he had the "L &amp; E" in his name??<br><br>10) Can you identify the worthy ones to upstage BG Lee or any high-profile Ministers since you think there are so much talents out there??<br><br>The Truth,<br><br>you started the discussion with the incision that BG Lee is not so deserving of his military rank, and you have contributed nothing constructive else, except that you tried to summarise the topic by labelling me a "Pro-PAP Activist".<br><br>For your information and knowledge perhaps,<br><br>The above 10 questions I have listed out Are the Elements to look out for in a REAL DISCUSSION.<br><br>Try Reasoning them out first and Prove your Worth.
