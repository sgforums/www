Which sums up to a 'follower' isn't it?? There is such a thing as 'tic for tac' and I presumed someone of your intellectual mind understands that easy statement.<br><br>We are all talking about the main 'ol topic here, and I presume all here are seemingly of adulthood. Thus I view democratic worker's postings as having no significance in this topic.<br>(Yes, demo, it's called tic for tac)<br><br>Yes Demo, you can continue to shoot your mouth off for all I care for amusement.<br><br>But what you have posted as of today has, indeed gave a notion of you having nothing better else to contribute for the benefit of this discussion than to give cynical remarks about 'kia-si' individuals whom u think are 'kia-si' because they have chosen the Better government.<br><br>Er....Denocratic worker, do you get my drift or do I have to simplify it???<br><br>anyway, the truth, you have my respect for having the courage to remain in the discussion.

From what I saw from your posting, you really proof to me that you are real kia si, kia su and petty minded. Opposition party posted 1 topic, you posted 2 to argue with him. The truth posted another reply, you posted another 2 to shoot him back. I posted a comment, you slam me back with another 2 stupid nonsence reply. I really started to think that are you able to lose, or I should say you can't afford to lose. I am attacking on you personally, yes, I dare to admit, do u dare? I bet you wouldn't dare.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well time for me to come back to this topic also. I believe there is definitely a bias towards big shot sons. Definitely no officier would dare tekan a ministers or MPs sons. So there is definitely a link between SAF and ministers and MPs<br><br>[This message has been edited by democratic worker (edited 20 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From my point of view regarding "what criteria used in selection of SAF officiers". Who ever had a link with this topic CAN be mention. As I always said, I am not the kia si type, I don't give a damn. I really DO believe BG LEE got his BG because he is a LEE. (I would not use words like L and E, I would definitely spell out the whole word. Any body wants me to spell out his whole name?)<br><br>To the truth:<br>Will look into your reply seriously as you are really talking sense and I am sure you are the type who is willing to accept other opinion and not stick to mud type.
