            <div class='col-md body'>I read somewhere saying that "why is it that some company have more recruits than other company going to OCS. To be fair, every company should have top 10% being selected."<br><br>This is because (what i guessed) the top 10% perhaps refers to the whole cohort, not each company.<br><br>This is fair enough because, suppose all the so call "Top 10%" recruits happen to be in the same company, say "Scholar company", then based on the quoted argument above, only the best of the best which is the top 10% of this "Scholar company" will go to OCS.<br><br>Those who are "suppose" to be in OCS will not be selected because they "suay suay" happen to be in the "Scholar company" but fails to be in the top 10% of the "Scholar company".<br><br>Also, those who are "not suppose" to be selected are selected beacuse they are "lucky" not to be in the same company as those recruits of the "Scholar company".<br><br>So i presume the so call "Top 10%" refers to the whole cohort, not of each company.<br><br>Hope i am not confusing u all... ... :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like this topic is dead.... let me bring it back to the top of the list by starting another round of debate.... hehehhe.<br><br>Regarding the selection of SAF officers, someone mentioned abt BG LEE on his relationship with Old MR LEE which explains how he got his rank.<br><br>However, i believe that its bcoz he is one of the first group of 5 SAF scholar. This explains why. As we know, scholars with any organization, private or public, will definately be high flyers.<br><br>However, i would like to point out another BG LEE (younger bro of the BG LEE whom we had been mentioning). He is currently the CEO of some big and important organization. How many of you had the same question as in my mind as to why both brothers can be a man so such a high calibre? (both also BG~!)<br><br>Genes?<br><br>hmmmmm this i do not know. Perhaps the 2nd LEE is indeed highly talented, if not how could he be the CEO of such a high profile company? (cannot name the company... sensitive leh~!)<br><br>but there is some chance of a reason why he is a BG.... I guess i do not have to explain.<br><br>Any comments?<br>Perhaps some of u here knows this 2nd BG LEE better than I do? Pls let us know~!<br><br>Thank you in advance.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually no one knows how to get into OCS, xcept the ppl at CPC, perhaps they know best!<br><br>However some of the more common characteristic of those OCS cadets are:<br><br>1) GOOD A-level Prelim results or poly grades<br><br>2) Chances are, if you are from NJ, HCJC, RJ... u will be considered if u are not tat worse. But if you are from YJ, SRJC, chances are, u are unlikely to be considered. Of coz YJ / SRJC top students are exceptions. So it all boils down to your grades!<br><br>3) U have a good relationship with NCC / NPCC when u are in secondary school. Best if u proceed to be cadet inspector or cadet LT.<br><br>4) Be an SAF Scholar!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>These may be the general characteristic, but it is not exhaustive and it may not be consistent with reality. However, it serves as a good proxy for the <span style="font-style: italic;">Selection Criteral for SAF Officers</span></div>
