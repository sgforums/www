            <div class='col-md body'>Very briefly if you look at casino or gambling, it also has a loyal fan base. We should aim for ideas that bring in loyal fan base and turn them into tourists.<br><br>We should think like the thai prime minister thaksin. Setup a commitee to watch this man very carefully.<br><br>3 years ago they wanted to buy a foodball team I think was liverpool, the entire nation was against it but their people failed to see the rational and the beauty of the idea.<br><br>Among all the sports fans in the world the most hardcore of all are football fans, in england these fans will follow where ever their favorite team plays. Even in singapore whenever football season comes around every pub will operate till 3am in the morning. If thailand had bought liverpool they will not only earn good money from the team but they can also make the team come to thailand to play every year sucking in liverpool fans from all over asia maybe even europe, boosting tourism levels and receipts, boosting advertising and broadcasting rights. Fans will stay, shop and eat at thai establishments. When I first read about it, I immediately knew it was of great significance.<br><br>Lucky for us, most thais who objected are stupid and blind to such a brilliant idea, unlucky for us there are many singaporeans who are equally stupid and blind to such an idea if singapore were to ever buy such a team.<br><br>Since that time, the thai government increased efforts to create awareness to improve tourism, last year they had the worlds longest buffet that went to the guiness record.<br><br>This year they are hosting Miss World Contest, this will be a chance to feature the many cultural facets of thailand to the world and bring loyal following of beauty contest fans from all over to thailand and again boosting tourism and receipts.<br><br>The Malaysian F1 racing is also based on the concept of loyal fan base.<br><br>So if we don't take the casino what ideas are there out there that have a loyal fan base.</div>

Dun need to be "Uniquely Singapore".<br><br>Also.. got happening furniture industry in Sg.. can make exciting furniture for the industry. Imagine if OSIM furniture was adapted for.....<br><br>And.. since Sg is already a Business and Financial Hub with tons of foreign talent, coming to Singapore isn't such a suspicious activity as compared to going to Bangkok or Cambodia.<br><br></div>
