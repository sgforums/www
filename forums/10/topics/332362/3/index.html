              <p>STI already in 2100 region. next is 1800.that is 50% retraction from peak of 3600. that is a more realistic target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is getting worse in 4Q onwards why?</p>
              <p>1. singapore 3Q data release on fri will show negative growth.that means we are in fact in technical recession.</p>
              <p>2. No good news from wallstreet( BOA miss forecast, cut dividend),( job slashes across wallstreet) and mainstreet( consumer confident down, jobless up,housing down).</p>
              <p>3. Crude oil prices could be on the move up. OPEC will cut production. the problem here is alot of country central bank is cutting interest rate, that means if crude prices going up. inflation pressure will be back soon to haunt us.</p>
              <p>the worse scenerio, the world economy has to tackle and fina balance between world recession and inflation problems. that going to take some time to figure out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just my personal opinion.</p>

              <p>You are right. The rich are not really affected that much. Its the low and middle class that gets the brunt of the blashlash. Besides, all those CEO who drove their companies to the ground and world economies into hell, walked away with hundred million dollars of package. Then these same companies hire these failure of CEO to be consultant of their now shitty companies.</p>
              <p>So I had not seen any of the rich people suffer in this financial meltdown. In actual fact, they might have walked out with more of the people's money.That's why the US public is so unhappy about using their tax dollar to bail out these companies when the people responsible for the melthdown are not penalized but rewarded instead.</p>
              <p>Its the same here in our local context. There are many policies that did not deliver and get twisted into a different motivation (eg ERP) while the MPs get pay raise for the sole reason of corruption prevention. I refrain from refering them as brilliant as the solutions for some time now is : The Public has to bear the cost of whatever the Party decides to do.</p>

              <p>singapore no central banks. thus i think MAS is going to lax the strong SGD stand soon in according to countries central banks rate cutting moves.

              <p><span>WASHINGTON: Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson warned on Wednesday that more financial firms would go bankrupt in the United States and that recent market turmoil had "seriously impacted" the economy. <br><br>Paulson cautioned that a 700-billion-dollar government rescue package for the financial sector approved last week would not mean an end to bankruptcies and that it would take several weeks to put in place. <br><br>"One thing we must recognise - even with the new Treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail," Paulson said at a news conference. <br><br>The aim of the rescue package is for the Treasury to buy up toxic debt being held by banks, but Paulson said it would be "several weeks before our first purchase." <br><br>The new law "doesn't exist to save every financial institution for its own sake," he added. <br><br>Reflecting the international scope of the crisis, Paulson also called for emerging market countries to be included in broad international talks on stabilising the financial system. <br><br>Brazilian officials told AFP that a meeting of central bank chiefs and finance ministers from the G20 emerging and rich country group would take place in Washington on Saturday alongside a gathering of the G7 rich countries. <br><br>Paulson said a meeting of the Group of Seven afforded an opportunity to discuss "ways to further enhance our collective efforts." <br><br>In comments about the US economy, Paulson underlined that turmoil in the banking sector caused by declining house prices was already reducing growth in the non-finance economy. <br><br>"A chain of events caused by the ongoing housing correction has reverberated through US banks and financial institutions and has seriously impacted the underlying economy," he said. - AFP/de</span></p>

              <p>the last few crisis are never consider world crisis becoz it hit only bit part of the world.such as "asian economy crisis."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this crisis in my opinion is kinda different. the last few crisis do not involve financial sector meaning, business can still run as normal.borrowing as normal.</p>
              <p>next, the world has to tackle the high oil prices. this doesnt happen in the last few crisis, all this will lead to higher inflation. that make it hard to balance cutting interest rate and juggling inflation.</p>
              <p>finally world recession resulting in lower consumer spending,lower corporate spending which is link to above all pts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">in face of higher inflation risk face by country we are seeing desperate govt of various country using their bazooka that is cutting central bank interest rate. what next then? i dont think the world has any more weapons if the market still fail to recover. definitely henry paulson remarks that more financial closure in inevitable in coming mths just prove the pt right!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">we should divert all weapons and pt at oil producing nation not to cut oil supply thus pushing the oil prices further. thus elimination the inflation risk so that the world can concentrate to tackle this financial and global crisis.</span></p>

              <p>You are right. The rich are not really affected that much. Its the low and middle class that gets the brunt of the blashlash. Besides, all those CEO who drove their companies to the ground and world economies into hell, walked away with hundred million dollars of package. Then these same companies hire these failure of CEO to be consultant of their now shitty companies.</p>
              <p>So I had not seen any of the rich people suffer in this financial meltdown. In actual fact, they might have walked out with more of the people's money.That's why the US public is so unhappy about using their tax dollar to bail out these companies when the people responsible for the melthdown are not penalized but rewarded instead.</p>
              <p>Its the same here in our local context. There are many policies that did not deliver and get twisted into a different motivation (eg ERP) while the MPs get pay raise for the sole reason of corruption prevention. I refrain from refering them as brilliant as the solutions for some time now is : The Public has to bear the cost of whatever the Party decides to do.</p>
