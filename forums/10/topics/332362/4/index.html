              <p>i think it wil be higher but not for long.</p>
              <p>the late rally on wallstreet on friday is banking on G7 meeting.</p>
              <p>But, in my own opinion, i dont think any good can come out of the G7 meeting moreover, morgan stanley sales to MUFJ is still hanging by the thread.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>things could get worse as financial instituition is still trying to de-leverage and that means sell sell sell.</p>

              <p>maybe time to invest in fourth reich development funds.</p>

              <p>HBD will generally hold out well discount those who pay 800K for
              a HDB. if u buy during the 2003-5 times, 200k for a 5 room flat.
              you can rest in peace as there are many PR queuing to buy it from
              u.</p>
              <p>how more more can you downgrad from a 4-5 room flat.</p>
