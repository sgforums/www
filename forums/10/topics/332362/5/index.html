              <p>and i think US economy breakdown, it's because too many buddle, when people instead of make product, going in the the stock market, or real estate market, making more money than making product, i think there is something wrong, the economic model is risky, because when economy is not good, there will be a huge echo in stock market, it's risky, it's domino effect</p>

              <p>china dont make just cheap pdts, major part of china pdts are like by  pdts such as textile. demand for china toys have reduce since the lead tainted paint. demand for china milk by pdts will also hit it milk industries. china food export will also be affected directly.</p>

              <p>i dont understand what u mean by china stock market booming years ago. it was peak at over 5000pt just end of last year/early this year. it was good for years before this year. not the otherway round. it would be naive to think any economy is not affected by the US slowdown and could be world recession soon.</p>

              <p class="textBodyBlack">Credit-card delinquencies are likely to become the next flashpoint in the credit crisis, though the impact on the overall economy won't be as severe as the housing slump, analysts believe. 
              <table style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 5px;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="1%" align="right">

              </p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">As the economy worsens and unemployment rises, more Americans are having trouble paying off their credit card balances. That has pushed up losses for credit card issuers, forcing them to tighten standards, which puts a further squeeze on cash-strapped consumers.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">“After mortgages and home equity, credit cards are the next in line to feel the crunch,” says Marc DeCastro, an industry analyst with Financial Insights.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">With job losses growing, credit cards delinquencies could rise to 7 percent by the first quarter of 2009, which would be a 20 year high, says Howard Shapiro, an industry analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">And because consumers no longer have the equity in the house to fall back on, they're relying even more on credit cards to pay for living expenses.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">“Now with their home equities getting shut off, people are going to start augmenting their income with their credit cards," DeCastro says. "They are going hit their limits and once they hit their limits, then they are probably going to walk away from their credit cards.”</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Though consumer spending accounts for three-quarters of the US economy, the credit-card crunch isn't likely to be as big an economic blow as the housing crisis has been.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The reason is that credit card debt, while still large, is much smaller than the amount tied up in mortgages.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">There is roughly $1 trillion of outstanding credit card debt—compared to $14 trillion worth of outstanding mortgages—and in the second quarter of 2008, $385 billion of this had been bundled into asset-based securities, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Another reason for the smaller fallout is that credit card issuers have been working over the past year to tighten standards and limit the damage.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">“I don’t see the credit card industry facing the kind of stress that the mortgage industry has faced," says Shapiro. "They have had time to prepare, to tighten their underwriting standards which were not stretched to the same degree as they were in the mortgage industry."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Still, that doesn't mean the growing losses aren't going to hurt.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Credit card write-offs last year totaled $26.6 billion, and are on track to reach more than $41.4 billion this year. And that's just the beginning.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">“We think 2009 is going to be a difficult year for the credit card industry," Shapiro says. "There’ll be higher charge offs, slower growth, people are cutting back on spending. That is going to mean pressure on earnings.”</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Innovest Strategic Value Advisors forsees delinquencies rising through the next three quarters, peaking at 10 percent, with industry losses of close to $100 billion in 2009. </p>

              <p>That’s payday for everyone who took out insurance against <strong>Lehman Brother</strong>’s bonds. And bear-raiding hedge funds took out a heck of a lot of insurance against that investment bank. <a name="StoryVideo"></a></p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">In fact, while Lehman Brothers
              
              sold only $158 billion worth of bonds, the SEC allowed hedge funds to take out $365 billion in insurance.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">That means the U.S government, which now owns most of AIG, will most likely spend next Tuesday cutting checks to the hedge funds involved.  this payout will erase whatever value might be left in AIG’s common stock.</p>

              <p>china dont make just cheap pdts, major part of china pdts are like by  pdts such as textile. demand for china toys have reduce since the lead tainted paint. demand for china milk by pdts will also hit it milk industries. china food export will also be affected directly.</p>

              <p>i dont understand what u mean by china stock market booming years ago. it was peak at over 5000pt just end of last year/early this year. it was good for years before this year. not the otherway round. it would be naive to think any economy is not affected by the US slowdown and could be world recession soon.</p>

              <p>ask some of your chinese business associate or mature adults that property prices in shenzhen alone has plummeted some 50% from a year ago.</p>

              <p>but actually there are two way to look at the story, actually, the enthusiasm for chinese people go into stock market have greatly plagued, yes stock market is good to accumulate money for enterprise, and plus property market, which is vital for a mature economy,</p>
              <p> but for me, i don't see what's the difference if I stay out of stock market. economy slow down, is a general term, which i think will affect the import and export, but as i said import and export actually donnot play a big part, maybe for only some of china city like shanghai and tianjin, dalian ,yes, but china still have a large comsuption of food, entertainment, so whose company who mainly dealing domestic business, will not be affectly in a large scale, like my family is not affected in the recession, and i am happy to see that the food price is withdraw a little bit.</p>
              <p>Maybe for a medium sized city like which i live in, do not respond to the recession wave so quickly, but maybe this is opportunity to relook into the US economy model.Then hope chinese enterpise could learn from that.</p>

              <p>no it's definitely a matter of communism thinking or capitalism thinking, there plenty of people around me jump into stock market, some of them earn alot of money during the stock market boomming year. And during the stock market booming time, many, many people is attacked to the stock market, because many people surround them have earn alot from the stock market,</p>
              <p> i once notice a most successfull broker in Wall street, he have been making money for his client, finally he want to make a big shot for himself, he use all of his reserved money go into stock market, then eventually he ended up having nothing, so stock market is really unpredictable, i think it's wiser to really do sth, instead of hoping the stock price will rising in the stock market, of course if you do business, stock market is just a way to accumulate money, and i don't really know how it functions, is it if the company not doing well, instead of the CEO pay for it, it's the stakeholder, or shareholder pay for it, so it's like you lend your money to someone you don't know, it's really risky.</p>
              <p>I guarrantee you, not many really communist in china now, anyway communism and capitalism is just name, according to communism, if you have a company employ eight people, you are a capitalist.</p>
              <p>i say again, even the most brilliant analyist or broker cannot anticipate how the stock market will performing.</p>
              <p>So actually it's nothing more than gambling,</p>

              <p><br>A sole proprietor needs to expand his business, kept his profit earned as a sole owner, now he needs funds, with his current good business, the underwriter will propose an IPO for him, cash start to flow in from the public, he acquire more companies, become the Director, get paid as a director paid with share options. In the event the company collapse as most organisation dun last a century, he can just leave without paying or losing a single cents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A stock investor is different from gambling is that he got datas and sources to study and look at before making his decision to buy the stock, gambling is by sheer luck and probability, there is no source non datas to look upon, it either u win, loose or perhap draw. Therefore you cannot said investing in stock is gambling, if an investor lost in the stock markets, it is because he had poor information or simply he followed blindly without studying the trends or the health of the economy of the stocks he bought. If a gambler lost in a casinos, its simply no luck.</p>
