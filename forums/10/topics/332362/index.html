              <p>i agree. i think that many of us still have an impression that we are shielded from an impending US recession due to decoupling theories, strong SGD, a still-very-low unemployment ratio etc etc.</p>
              <p>I always use the number of people going to restaurants as an economic indicator, and right now this indicator is telling me that our economy is still going on strong.</p>

              <p>actually i was thinking about it. Does anyone think there are signs of a market bottom? Why do I think so?</p>
              <p>1) the VIX index is at 40 plus (dunno exact figure) but historically anything above 30 is a sign of a market bottom.</p>
              <p>2) Warren Buffet thinks its time to invest in equities again. Goldman Sachs and GE. But granted, he's investing in preferred stock giving him a 10% dividend.</p>
              <p>3) this $700B rescue plan/ bailout package, whatever u call it, would inject liquidity into the US financial system and create a secondary market for these mortgage backed securities (although it hasnt been passed im assuming it has). </p>

              <p>some analyst from OCBC securitie are predicting STI could be heading 2100 or lower in coming mths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>personally i think we are heading there.</p>
              <p>the market are now focusing too much on bailout plan. the economy weather bell company such as DELL, INTEL are already indicating a slower demand in mth ahead. GE, GM are issueing missing forcast estimate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>once the bailout plan are pass by house of representative, the funds manager will start to focus the real state of economy and it aint showing any signs of recovery but a sign of a slow recession in regions such as States, Japan, Western europe, central american.</p>

              <p>actually i was thinking about it. Does anyone think there are signs of a market bottom? Why do I think so?</p>
              <p>1) the VIX index is at 40 plus (dunno exact figure) but historically anything above 30 is a sign of a market bottom.</p>
              <p>2) Warren Buffet thinks its time to invest in equities again. Goldman Sachs and GE. But granted, he's investing in preferred stock giving him a 10% dividend.</p>
              <p>3) this $700B rescue plan/ bailout package, whatever u call it, would inject liquidity into the US financial system and create a secondary market for these mortgage backed securities (although it hasnt been passed im assuming it has). </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>frankly i dont think our stock market has bottom. because the financial crisis if not in the early stages are definintely not the final stages.</p>
              <p>1.the crisis has already spread from USA to europe as more european govt are bailing out their own mortage company and banks.</p>
              <p>2. it has started to spread to china. when one of its biggest insurance " ping An" made a staggering 2.3billions USD lost on its investment in trouble investment bank fortis.</p>
              <p>3. the 700billion bailout might not work, as banks might not want to sell it toxic mortages to the US treasury if they are going to lost billions of dollars. what is the true value of these assets? it may take more time to nego, discussion before these liquidity can be felt by the normal consumers.</p>
              <p>4. Even if the banking crisis is over in half to 1 year time, next come the problems of global recession. As you can see company such as GE, Intel, Dell has already miss sales forecast and predicted a slowdown demand. lot of singapore company that depends on HDD business, precison engineering business, OEM, ODM business will be badly hit. not to mention sectors that already in slowdown are property, banking will definitely report lower profits compare q to q.</p>

              <p>i not personally not optimistic especially on private property.</p>
              <p>the drop in prices reported is mth or quarter is just the beginning.</p>
              <p>many of the TOP are set to be launch end of early next year. many of such units are speculators which will sell their unit if property prices continue to slide.</p>
