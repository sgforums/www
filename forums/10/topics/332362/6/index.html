              <p>first, chinese is not like western people. When during the republic period, and japanese invasion, the chinese intellect who studying overseas, was stunned by communism, at that times, the capitalism world, also suffer from economic crisis and moral crisis, so the chinese intellect see communism as the only hope to save china.</p>
              <p>And after the independence of PRC, the leaders made some attempt to see whether the commuism economic model can work out, but it fails, under that model, no matter how spetacular a single person performed, the profit is share by all the people, it degrade the enthusiasm for people to work hard. But my mother told me, at that time, people compare to what are they now, are morally better, at that time, the door of your home do not need to be locked, because their is no theft, if someone get divorce or have an affair, with oppisite sex, the whole people of the town will discuss it, it's just so rare.</p>
              <p>Compare Taiwan and china, yes, taiwan have made more progress in Democratic development, but politics is always played by minority, i think most of chinese people don't care the democracy ruling or commusim rulling, as Deng xiao ping said, no matter white cat or black cat,as long as it can catch mouse, it's a good cat.</p>
              <p>Chinese election system is not transparent, i don't know how it's perfomed, but seems that, the candidate for president or PM, when it is selected, need to be working under supervision for several years, and most of the president, start working from low level to high level, from the governor of small city, then big city, then province, finally to beijing.</p>
              <p>I don't believe there is an abusolute democracy, like the president of US, reagon, he is an actor, but his speech is inspiring, so US people like him, then elect him, i don't see that he is so capable.</p>

              <p>A stock investor is different from gambling is that he got datas and sources to study and look at before making his decision to buy the stock, gambling is by sheer luck and probability, there is no source non datas to look upon, it either u win, loose or perhap draw. Therefore you cannot said investing in stock is gambling, if an investor lost in the stock markets, it is because he had poor information or simply he followed blindly without studying the trends or the health of the economy of the stocks he bought. If a gambler lost in a casinos, its simply no luck.</p>

              <p><br>let me check on the Wiki, but one thing is for sure, Marks and Engels are all well educated people, and gifted philosoper. Communism is not only practiced in china, it's practised in many contury, like terrorist, it's only kind of different ideology, but western people try to label them by their own interest, like George Soros, attack asian market, his action is completely legal, but cause many people to die, so in the history, the lord, or the wealthy class by all means leverage the peasant, take their land, and convert them to slaves,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS, Engels is from wealthy family, so i am not here discussing, whether commuism is right and wrong, the world is too complex to be labelled just right or wrong.</p>
