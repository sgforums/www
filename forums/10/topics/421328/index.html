              Stop Dr Chee from going to prison this election      
              Wednesday, 26 January 2011  
              Singapore Democrats
              
              
              Dear Friends,
              
              You may know that the Judiciary has rejected Dr Chee Soon Juan's appeals against his conviction for speaking in public without a permit â€” incidents that date as far back as 2005. He was sentenced to $20,000 fine or 20-weeks imprisonment in default. He has until 10 Feb 2011 to pay up or to go to jail. (See here for details.)
              
              The High Court's decision is not unexpected but its timing is most unfortunate. The SDP is in the midst of preparing for the General Election which is expected to be called within the first half of this year.
              
              With Dr Chee at its helm, the SDP has grown tremendously in the last few years. It has attracted many credible candidates and energetic young people who are eager to help the party do well in the elections and serve the people.
              
              We cannot afford to have Dr Chee incarcerated during this crucial period. We urge you and your friends to help us ensure that he will continue to lead our party to victory this GE. Please give generously. (See here for ways to help.)
              
              In solidarity,

              <p>Although I do not know Dr Chee personally, but based on the news paper articles  and reports over the few year, I can tell that he is someone that I am going to trust. I admire him as a great man with a strong and determination. I recognize his effort.</p>
              <p>Even though I am in financial hardship (with debts mounting on my shoulder) now, I will still pledge my support by donating $10. I know it may not be a huge sum, but $10 is how I survive everyday.</p>
              <p>I urge fellow forumers to help SDP to raise the $20K Dr. Chee and his team need.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think he can emigrant with a police record and much less find work, his whole life is sacrificed for this nation.</p>
              <p>He has toiled in vain for many years and will continue til his dying days, he will not have material comfort or even, like right now, the understanding of citizens, his whole life is for Singapore only. He will fight forever, sadly without the understanding of citizens.</p>
              <p>I don't think anyone can guarantee that Sinkapore can really have standards like the west, in fact, I think, never will be. So, it is a wise move that you have left.</p>
              <p>Sinkapore have already squandered its' best years, neglecting proper development of its own citizens, having only NTU and NUS in the past few decades have produced very little people capable of tackling higher technology to lift Sinkapore to another high technology level, worst still, many highly educated people have left, drawn by proper democracies in other countries. The past streaming of primary eight and seven have also throw many off the education system and wasted quite some people as well.</p>
              <p>All these done but yet PAP did not feel apologetic but proceeded to protect its'own turf but importing foreigners to boost their own standings.</p>
              <p>Opposition cannot bring about changes overnight, and I don't believe they can do it even within ten years, our people have many old, too little young people, the period under opposition, I believe will be worst off, as they take proper concrete steps to ractify what major structural damages PAP have done to the country. The dismantling of government linked companies into smaller companies will definitely create nightmares for some cushy armed chaired high executives, but bloated and inefficent companies have to go, too much taxpayers money are wasted on them.</p>
              <p>What I hope to see is a multi-parties government that is forthright with the people, admit it when things are wrong so that our people can plan ahead, not hide behind press and budget money give-away to pacify people, all these are wrong. We need a proper government that can and will listen to people when policies are really wrong and hurting the people, not turn deaf and still insist that things are right.</p>
              <p>This is a small step to have a country that can have citizens actively participating in actual governance of their country, to let people really feel that they can belong here and be born, work and die in a place that place each and every citizen freedom and moral obligation to a high standard that will not pale in comparison to the west.</p>
              <p>To let people be free to innovate, to create and to sacrifice whatever that their calling deems them to require, be they in their role as researcher, scientist, metal precision tooler, a hawker and anything that defines people identity to this nation, without the current ever looming notion that ,ÿou die, your business."corporate culture that rans counter to what defines a nation.</p>
              <p>Anything must have a clear and present identity for aims to be fired and let dreams of many to be fufilled in this small country, because our country currently have been running away from its' true path as a nation for too long, so intense pain will be felt with or without PAP for this few years after, but the one with the opposition will truly reflects what our nation pledge have been, one which we currently knew is just plain bullshxt.</p>
              <p>If we do it right as a nation with lots of heart whether with or without SDP, progess for all will follow, if we allow PAP to do it, only they will have progress in their bank balance.</p>
              <p>Lots of hearts are need right now, much much more than the bank vault which PAP is hoarding our taxpayer money, can we match up to that?</p>
