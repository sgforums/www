Engineers were in high demand. Hence, if you notice, the education system at that time (even evident today) had a very strong grounding in Maths and Science. Even in the Uni at that time, Arts and social sciences were seen as dumping grounds during the 80s. Art students in secondary schools at the time, were stereotyped to be less academically inclined. Conformity was the aim at that time, which resulted in less creativity. The workforce today, is made of students of that era. Just my take.</div></blockquote>In the 1992 there was a 'cap' place on the numbers of legal beagles wannabes.<br>External law degrees were deemed not good enough for a legal career here.<br>This led to a situation that only NUS was producing law graduates. From this pool, some abandoned their calling for a less hetic lifestyle. Which led to a shortage of lawyers. Which inturn led to the opening up to foreign lawyers to practice here, and now "opening the doors wider".<br><br>The 'cap' was actually touted to raise the standard of law graduates, but I suspect it was in retalliation to the rising number of such graduates harrassing the government in the elections at that time.<br></div>
