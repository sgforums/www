So he had to rely on uttering one policy after another and yet was unable to achieve much by way of creating whole new industries to better utilize our local talents or resources which we do have.<br><br>So he will have to keep playing with foreign investments and foreign talents being clueless to come up with another upgrading.<br></div>

Having worked with people from all walks of life and other parts of the world, a mindset they seem to have against Asians (people raised in Asia, rather than those who are of an Asian ethnicity) is that such people are often monotonous and have a tendency to "go by the book". While that invariably translates to Asians being fancied if a job required the monotonous reproduction of a given process (ie. Asians are more hardworking and efficient in that regard), they are often overlooked for roles where ingenuity and autonomy are required.<br><br>Just take a look at the culture in general - the next time you deal with a waiter, a bureaucrat or a senior management staff in Singapore, try making requests that are not predicted/expected and see how many is actually capable of exercising the common sense and flexibility to make decisions, instead of pursuing a course of action dictated "by the book" or having need to consult their superiors (which is just a further sign of bureaucracy and red tape at work). If you have worked in the Americas (I don't just mean the US, but also parts of North and South America), Europe or Australia, you'll experience a completely different culture.</div>

Engineers were in high demand. Hence, if you notice, the education system at that time (even evident today) had a very strong grounding in Maths and Science. Even in the Uni at that time, Arts and social sciences were seen as dumping grounds during the 80s. Art students in secondary schools at the time, were stereotyped to be less academically inclined. Conformity was the aim at that time, which resulted in less creativity. The workforce today, is made of students of that era. Just my take.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore, to increase the number of engineers, make engineering school a dumping ground tat accept the worse students compared with other profession. In a way it did force the number of engineers to increase. However it make the engineer become abundant and therefore less treasured. There r sure engineers tat become the CEO of companies but the fact is prospect of an engineer r stagnant and mnay become engineer for life with little pay increment. Just look at the many engineers in your company... 10 years later where do u think they will become if they stay in tat company ? Wat will their pay be like ? Now look at the many doctor and accountant or banker around. 10 years later doctor open their own clinic or become head of department, accountant become top accountant with much higher pay than engineer, banker rise very high because there r many layers of promotion. Engineer ? Become senior engineer or even manager at most.<br></div>
