              <p>Why must some people be like that one? Why is it they must vote BG Yeo out? BG Yeo is a god guy and a good MP, yet he kenna voted out. Likewise, his team members like Lim Hwee Hua and Zaniel Abidin are also good MPs. In contrast, they voted in an opposition that broached about a non existent First World Parliament and talked about slapping the driver.</p>
              <p>I think if they had voted someone else out, then okay lah, but BG Yeo is too good a person. Why him?</p>
              <p>The problem now is they voted a good man and his good team out and voted in an opposition that talked about something that don't exist and slapping the driver.</p>

              <p>Saya also really scared if they one day form the new government. Can they do it? Singapore political situation is delicated and not easy to handle. We are a truly multi racial country and we need to take into consideration the needs and interest of all races.</p>
              <p>In the end, having a new opposition government may not be good news. Just like Taiwan Chen Shui Bian and Lee Teng Hui, look what happened when they form the new government? Also don't forget in the mid 80s to the mid 90s, Taiwan was once one of the four tigers of Asia. Now look what happened now?</p>

              <p>why did the PAP not take out G Yeo when they knew WP was fielding in strong team. If they had taken out G Yeo and his gang, replaced with Raymund Lim, Mah PT, Wong KS, then G Yeo would still be in the parliament. That would be a Win Win situation.</p>

              <p><br>since you are away from Singapore, let's update you on some of the factors in the  situation in Aljunied GRC:<br><br>1) Singaporeans in Aljunied GRC placed national issues over their own wards' personal interests.<br>e.g. immigration, inflation, foreigners, soaring HDB prices over their HDB building facades/ lift upgradings...etc.</p>
              <p>2) Singaporeans are getting more daring, especially young 1st time voters.<br><br>3) the building up of anger over the arrogant PAP ex-MPs in Aljunied GRC.<br>e.g. lim hwee hua, cynthia phua.</p>

              <p>see what hong kong did when their govt wanted to implement gst.</p>

              <p>How much did ah bian take? enough to land him in jail.......if it was a risk that Taiwanese took to elect ah bian, they lost their pants, and the æ°‘è¿›å…š lost the election 4 years ago by over 220 millions votes!!</p>
              <p>do they then have no democracy under Mah?</p>
              <p>he who pay for a corrupted person in exchange for democracy knows not what democracy is.it is democracy that allow the taiwanese to elect ah bian as president, and it is the same democratic process that enable the taiwanese to dump him for Mah.</p>
              <p>Do HK people have democracy? they have demonstrations almost every week end, from protesting against giving PR status to phillipino maids, to allowing PRC mothers giving birth in HK...but they all act within the framework set out by the government in beijing, that is not democracy? </p>
              <p>and when HK government gave out HK$6000 to everybody who stay in HK,  even to those who have migrated to canada, nobody cares where the money come from, as long as I have the money....hmmmm.....it is money that talks in HK...not democracy!</p>

              <p><br>in that case, you should channel your complaints feedback on estate/ precinct to the town council.<br><br>Bedok bus interchange is already using the new temporary site presently.</p>
