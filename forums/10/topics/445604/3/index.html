              <p>Saya also really scared if they one day form the new government.
                  Can they do it? Singapore political situation is delicated and not
                  easy to handle. We are a truly multi racial country and we need to
                  take into consideration the needs and interest of all races.</p>
              <p>In the end, having a new opposition government may not be good
                  news. Just like Taiwan Chen Shui Bian and Lee Teng Hui, look what
                  happened when they form the new government? Also don't forget in
                  the mid 80s to the mid 90s, Taiwan was once one of the four tigers
                  of Asia. Now look what happened now?</p>

              <p>Why u so afraid of changes? If PAP fail. I say "IF". They change the name to Pay More Pay More, with the same old face. Vote them in again? Do u really have a choice?</p>
              <p>When u have a choice choose wisely. Just don't end up, telling other u don't have a choice.</p>
              <p>A few opposition can over turn the garment? LOL</p>

              <p>Firstly, I have already made an argument. I hope you know what an argument actually is.</p>
              <p>Secondly, why am I supposed to make a "cogent argument" to justify my statement? Arguments and main points do not justify statements. Rather, they require substantiation and justification.</p>
              <p>I know not if you were attempting to sound sophisticated, but you only succeeded in embarrassing yourself.</p>

              <p>Please explain how Singapore gets "bullied" by Australia "again and again", whether in the context of the free skies issue or not.</p>
              <p>George Yeo spearheaded the signing of FTAs with Australia, America and many other countries. His performances at WTO summits (such as the Doha Round) were stellar. He was also instrumental in developing ASEAN and maintaining regional order (especially between Indonesia/Malaysia and Myanmar). I fail to see how he was incapable of furthering our country's interests.</p>
              <p>As I said, "you should read up more on regional political developments of the past decade or so".</p>
