If you have the prospect to live till 90, I am sure you would be wise enough to invest in some funds. It's not like you are left with nothing, you still have the CPF lump sum. If you don't have anything at 65, the government is not going to dish out the compulsory annuity scheme to you too. We are not a welfare state!!! I think they should just let people opt in if they so wish to when they reach 65 instead of legislating it.<br><br>What about those who have short lifespan in their family genes? They definitely don't want to subscribe to the compulsory annuity scheme because it will not benefit them at all.<br><br>I think people would have the basic intelligence and maturity at 65 to plan the way they want to live their life. They don't need PAPa or Mama to tell them how to plan their life. I stand corrected because there are some people out there who still rely on others to plan their life for them.

Unfortunatley, these 'wise' old men have nuthing to offer other than to nitwit, nitpick, and call names. They are able to quote foreign sources and run local presses down. They are the only ones who read and internetnised the world web for their worldly knowledge on politics.<br>But they have no idea what are conditions in Myanmar, the old folks in nursing homes and the dying in hospice. Don't waste your time trying to convince how intelligent or knowledgeable or foreign-informed you are. I am not impressed nor are the many readers here.
