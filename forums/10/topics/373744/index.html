              <p class="textBodyBlack">US consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in four months in August on worries over high unemployment and dismal personal finances, though the mood improved from earlier this month, a survey showed Friday.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final index of confidence for August fell to 65.7 from 66.0 in July.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">That was the lowest since 65.1 in April but above economists' expectations for 64.5 and higher than this month's preliminary reading of 63.2.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"This tells me consumers are still in rebuilding phase," said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. "Investors still have to be worried about the sustainability of the recovery. It's clear to me that we cannot count on growth through next year as long as consumers are still on the ropes."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">U.S. stocks hit session lows after the data, while the dollar slipped versus the yen U.S. government bonds, which are favored by investors during times of economic weakness, trimmed earlier losses.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Consumers rated the current economic conditions as the worst since March, when the stock market hit 12-year lows.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The index fell to 66.6 from 70.5 in July, but was an improvement from 64.9 earlier this month.</p>

              <p><br>No, you are wrong, USA will not be the market of the future, our govt are not that stupid to get burnt again by another Madoff or Maddog.......or another lemon brothers, u need to learn your lesson. The paradigm shift is needed, we will say that USA can still be a main contributor to our economy, but not as much as before the crisis, with our foreign ministry making visit to a few asian places, you should know that the govt are trying to diversify it economy interest in a more flexible and liquitable way rather than just depending on USA ya. </p>

              <p><br>The current economy surge to what i believe is that industrials are busy producing year end season gifts, big investors are getting tire of waiting for consumer confident to return and therefore stimlulated the stock market with their capitals in hope of reaping some profits by the early end of the year. And even with oil price going up, it has yet to hit the 150++per barrel mark, currently only half of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The analysis here is when the production and transportation from industrial decline toward the end of the year. And with less bonuses or no bonus given to the working class due to poor 2009 performances, you will see another dive in the earlier months of next year. And with industrial over producing, retrenchment and layoff will sent off..remember PM said, there will more retrenchment coming by the end the year. More so is that property will have stablised and construction and banks will be facing some bad debts and some force selling due to high inflation set at current situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you know in Singapore, or even the world, so to speak, prices of goods can hardly come down after it went up, this will give a high inflation that can surge pass the 7% record rate, and that will be another diseaster for the working class. With  wage freeze or cut, no or less bonus, lost of jobs, high cost of living, u guys better grab what you have now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for shares, it will dip, if you can sell now, do it, if not keep those with high dividend one, like starhub ya.</p>

              <p>Singapore economic is still heavily depend on manufacturing export to mainly USA.</p>
              <p>Worst, many manufacturing plant are still moving out of high cost Sg to more cheaper alternative countries. Many people job will be lose. Some are replaced with highly skilled R&amp;D sector which employed more speciality job which create very little employment for SG market.</p>

              <p><br>The title is misleading.</p>
              <p>Peak Oil has never been about running out of oil but about extraction rate and about how much more expensive relatively to increase/maintain that extraction rate.</p>
              <p>Whether the abiotic theory on oil is true or not, there has been no evidence of oil fields replenishing itself at any significant rate. THAT is the point.</p>

              <p>Thu, Jan 01, 2009 - AFP</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy is likely to worsen next year after growing just 1.5 percent in 2008, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Wednesday, urging Singaporeans to "prepare for a difficult year ahead."</p>
              <p>"Our economy will probably contract further. More companies will be forced to downsize. So far we have not seen many job losses, but I expect more retrenchments in the next few months. We must be psychologically prepared," Lee said in his New Year's Day message to the nation.</p>
              <p>More job losses are expected in the next few months as companies are forced to shed employees, Lee said.</p>
              <p> "As a small, open economy, Singapore cannot avoid being hit. We earn our living by trading with and servicing the world. So the fall in worldwide demand has hit our exports, our tourism sector, and our broader economy," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We must therefore prepare for a difficult year ahead, and especially the first half of 2009.</p>
              <p>Singapore's key markets such as the United States, Japan and Europe have fallen into recession after a crisis in the US housing market spread to the financial sector and the larger economy.</p>
              <p>The city-state, one of Asia's wealthiest economies, went into a recession this year, although full-year growth came in at 1.5 percent, well below the official forecast of 2.5 percent and the 7.5 percent expansion in 2007.</p>
              <p>"<strong>The outlook is highly uncertain. At each stage of this crisis, events have turned out worse than the experts predicted,"</strong> Lee said.</p>
              <p>While governments have been implementing monetary and fiscal measures and rescuing troubled financial institutions and key corporations, "<strong>no one is sure how the financial systems and economies will respond, or which policies will work</strong>," he said.</p>
              <p>This has led to a loss of business and consumer confidence, he said, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">warning against expectations of a quick recovery</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Quite likely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the global recession will be followed not by a quick rebound, but by several more years of slow growth</span></strong>," he said.</p>
              <p>Next year's national budget, which has been brought forward to January, will focus on helping Singapore firms so that workers can keep their jobs, the premier said.</p>
              <p>"We will introduce measures to help them (companies) with their business costs, including rental and wage bills. We are also studying further financing support for companies," he said.</p>
              <p>The government will do its best to help workers keep their jobs and retrain those who have been laid off, he said, adding this will be done by helping businesses through the crisis.</p>

              <p><br>The economy will go into a double dip, next year, 2010, will be the test of our effort being applied this year and let us see how is the results. We are prone to external influences which we hardly have control over the situation, internally, we can do so much, the govt can implement policies and plans by infusing funds, but it is the external enviroment that we are at risk. However having said that, as long as we are prepare, aligned and not misleaded, together, we can make a different rather than remaining the same as most other countries do, we should therefore embrace ourselves and prepare for the test ahead, be it waves after waves, we believe that Singaporeans will pull together and worked our way out of this crisis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said all, if you look around, where is the crisis? But of course that does mean there is no crisis. It is just that our govt are proactive enuf to plan and execute decisively so that when crisis hit, we are still able to survive, improve ourselve and be vibrant as ever. We not facing crisis for the first time, we had been hit from left to right, rigth to left from time to time, and everytime we asked ourselves, how to improve and prepare for the next wave of crisis. In fact, after so many crisis, we natural become good in crisis management.</p>
