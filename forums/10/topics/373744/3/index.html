              <p><br>Regulatory and control there must be, that i cannot deny, but our regulatory and control system is base on a free market ideologist, and it had alway being in this way,..u walk into a showsroom, get a sale agent attention and negotiate an apartment you want to buy, and you bought it, walk out and go home, free market at play. Our regulatory is unlike other whereby you may not even have the luxury to step into the showsroom not to mention buying it, there is enforcement in it. Our regulatory play on the capital part, the initial downpayment, the approval of loan and the mean of a person. And it can change from time to time to create a conducive market, both vibrant, sustainable and yet able to control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The america crisis started when capital regulatory do not exist, as long as you are an American and an american needs a house, you can get loan which the bank underwrite and buy it.</p>

              <p>The US unemployment is already around 16% depending on states. The commercial real estate default on repayment of capital will start next year or this year end. But i figure Wall street will capitalized on profit gain as priority as everyone wants to recoup their Cash.</p>

              <p>I recommend you to read the website of Elliott Wave International</p>
              <p>This bear rally and the 2nd dip you mentioned had already been expected long ago via this wave theory. Starting with only $200 left in bank in Mar 09 and hence not able to capitulate on the cheap prices, I continued buying in Apr, May and June 09 from more salary because this wave theory had suggested a multi-month rise. Now, with the wave theory, the bear rally is coming to an end.</p>
              <p>And I can say, it's not going to be pretty. I'm starting to slowly liquidate some positions. And it might be too late as an island reversal, albeit weak, was formed yesterday.</p>
              <p>In fact, I have recently signed up for a CFD account, and will be waiting to short the market if and when the opportunity arises.</p>

              <p><br>my proponent here is that please dun alway compare with the Americans, it seem that all things goes right or wrong, the American is alway taken as a benchmark to compare with...what is American nowaday, beside those hollywood stunts still looking attractive, the rest are going downhill, look at those harvard trained business man in NY financial insitutions, so much money being swayed away with so much unethical management...does harvard train them to be like this..or MIT? The American way of managing their property is entirely different from our conservatives approach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We should therefore do our own soul searching, we being the first and the hardest hit economy in Asia because of the Americans and we still wants to compare apple to apple with them, no way. And we are able to plough thru this crisis (which, in other countries, it would had melt down totally) is because we stood by our strong free market regulatories and policies, which we had put in place in a proactive effort, next, our saving thru the years had give us an added advantage to stay afloat and better than others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many countries had initially think that Singapore is going to be finish with this crisis, but we stood firm, our dollars value is still there, and even much better than most, our employment rate is still good, our consumer confident is even more as shown in those Comex and NAtas tour exibitions. You dun feel that there is a recession.   </p>

              <p>Just before I'm not sure.</p>
              <p>From what I was told, bears were ridiculed. In fact, Elliott Wave International called for a top in Jul 07 (and subsequently to close all shorts and start to long in Feb 09, before re-iterating it in the first few days of Mar 09).</p>
              <p>I got interested only in early 08, and many analysts reports were still bullish at that time. Then near Mar 09, many analysts reports from those so called experts were super bearish.</p>

              <p>Just before I'm not sure.</p>
              <p>From what I was told, bears were ridiculed. In fact, Elliott Wave International called for a top in Jul 07 (and subsequently to close all shorts and start to long in Feb 09, before re-iterating it in the first few days of Mar 09).</p>
              <p>I got interested only in early 08, and many analysts reports were still bullish at that time. Then near Mar 09, many analysts reports from those so called experts were super bearish.</p>
              <p>Now on hindsight, I guess it's quite clear.</p>
