              <p>well, as an investor, he/she needs be optimistic, otherwise, might as well keep inside my piggy bank. As i posted, USA is still the biggest contributor to our economy, it is only this time that we see a down in USA due some mismanaged funds leading to finanicial crisis that affect the global. Are not we suppose to go back to the drawing board and look at the situation to diversify our portfolios of investment so that we do not put the whole chunk into the USA alone. Even if UOB or DBS shares are up, i am not going to put my whole sum into it,..i need to diversify some so as to be prudent and reduce my risk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manufacturing had alway been our main contributor to GDP growth, but it had gone down tremendously, therefore we have to relook at what kind of manufacturing we need attract, my take will be high end product that most of these third world countries are unable to produce or with poor qualities. I would say that what drives our GDP, firstly, we must good infrastructure and more importanly, a good asset of Human Resources, if you have these main assets, be it manufacturing, biotech, services, financial, IT, enginneering, logistic services etc etc..u will be the winner</p>

              <p>Manufacturing had alway been our main contributor to GDP growth, but it had gone down tremendously, therefore we have to relook at what kind of manufacturing we need attract, my take will be high end product that most of these third world countries are unable to produce or with poor qualities. I would say that what drives our GDP, firstly, we must good infrastructure and more importanly, a good asset of Human Resources, if you have these main assets, be it manufacturing, biotech, services, financial, IT, enginneering, logistic services etc etc..u will be the winner</p>

              <p>Do u know basis of property booming during a recession, because pple who have money will channel to a safer and long term product than into stock markets, and some are those who had lost, withdrew and redirect their financial portfolio into property, that is the basis of why property boomed. It will bubble, no doubt about it, but as long as you can change hand fast enuf, you gain. Today property boom is unlike another boom of the past, because nearly 1/3 of the buyers are foreigners with hard cold cash in hand, it is not like local going into loan and later find themselve unable to cope up with the loan and crippled into force selling whereby the bubble exploded.</p>

              <p>The problems is, the stock market has not burst, the housing market are raising, it has high possibility of asset bubble due to low interest rate offer by banks, speculators, foreigners and domestic alike. how low a interest will bank commit? how will govt react if real asset price raise too fast before the real income? are govt going to let inflation go beyond control?</p>

              <p>Hello, do u know that foreign dun even need loan to buy property here, just like Jet li, 20 millions hard cash and paid it all. No kidding, a condo of 1 million can be easily paid by a foreigner rich guy. China alone is creating thousands of millionaires, where to park their money, you think they park in mainland china, i dun think so, not secure, they buy property all over the world where there is chinese population ya..next, the indonesia Chinese millionaires or billionaires, just buy order a condo for his son to stay and study here with pure cash. It is only the poor/middle class Singaporeans who are lure into it will find it hard to sustain the loan in a long run, but even if they cannot sustain it, they can alway downgrade to 5 rooms and still earn a huge profit. The situation currently is so big that if you buy a condo and sell it even without it being built, you can take in as much as 300k, which for a layman worker, may take years to earn it.</p>

              <p><span>Singapore: Measures to pre-empt any speculative bubble from forming in the private property market have been outlined in Parliament by the National Development Minister. <br><br>Mr Mah Bow Tan said one of the steps to "temper the exuberance" of the market will be the immediate withdrawal of the interest absorption scheme and interest-only loans being offered for purchases of uncompleted property developments. <br><br>He told Parliament that both schemes could encourage speculation in a buoyant market as they lower instalment payments in the initial years. <br><br>Pointing out that property purchases are a major long-term financial commitment, the National Development Minister said the removal of the interest absorption scheme and interest-only loans will help make home buyers make careful decisions. <br><br>The immediate withdrawal of the interest absorption scheme will only affect new projects and not those which had been offering the scheme until the announcement on Monday. <br><br>As for interest-only loans, these will be disallowed with immediate effect. <br><br>The House was also told that the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme will be reinstated in early 2010 with the number of confirmed sites to be firmed up at a later stage. <br><br>The number of reserve sites in the GLS programme will also be replenished, Mr Mah said, so that the public can be sure of a steady supply of private housing. <br><br>The Minister also told Parliament that assistance measures outlined in the Budget earlier to stabilise the property market will not be extended given the change in the market conditions. <br><br></span></p>

              <p><span>Singapore: Measures to pre-empt any speculative bubble from forming in the private property market have been outlined in Parliament by the National Development Minister.<br><br>Mr Mah Bow Tan said one of the steps to "temper the exuberance" of the market will be the immediate withdrawal of the interest absorption scheme and interest-only loans being offered for purchases of uncompleted property developments.<br><br>He told Parliament that both schemes could encourage speculation in a buoyant market as they lower instalment payments in the initial years.<br><br>Pointing out that property purchases are a major long-term financial commitment, the National Development Minister said the removal of the interest absorption scheme and interest-only loans will help make home buyers make careful decisions.<br><br>The immediate withdrawal of the interest absorption scheme will only affect new projects and not those which had been offering the scheme until the announcement on Monday.<br><br>As for interest-only loans, these will be disallowed with immediate effect.<br><br>The House was also told that the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme will be reinstated in early 2010 with the number of confirmed sites to be firmed up at a later stage.<br><br>The number of reserve sites in the GLS programme will also be replenished, Mr Mah said, so that the public can be sure of a steady supply of private housing.<br><br>The Minister also told Parliament that assistance measures outlined in the Budget earlier to stabilise the property market will not be extended given the change in the market conditions.<br><br></span></p>

              <p>With all due respect, do you know how much had our govt earned from this property booming? with the taxation and LS charges, they are actually very happy to be in this position, our govt is alway an advocate of free market movement, even wages is subject to free market value. They are more worry in those underperforming sectors whereby even with stimulate packages were instilled and still cannot go up. If the govt really wanted to intervent the Property market, they would hv gone in earlier, but they are not, nobody is worrying about a booming market, in fact its is a good sign.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The govt are not worrying about those who can afford to buy, they interfered because of 2 things,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Excess inflation may set in that will disorientate the peoples with lower earning to suffer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The lower middle class who bought property due to speculation, may end up having difficulties to sustain the loan and interest that result in social and family disorientation.</p>
