              <p>From what I was told, bears were ridiculed. In fact, Elliott Wave International called for a top in Jul 07 (and subsequently to close all shorts and start to long in Feb 09, before re-iterating it in the first few days of Mar 09).</p>
              <p>I got interested only in early 08, and many analysts reports were still bullish at that time. Then near Mar 09, many analysts reports from those so called experts were super bearish.</p>
              <p>Now on hindsight, I guess it's quite clear.</p>

              <p>But seriously, as an investor or potiential investor, it is essential to take an objective look at who the advertisers and sponsors are behind these media and consultant giants, and determine if there is an underlying slant or bias toward particular types of investments. Some of these/ if not most consultants are paid to offer free consultation just to get you into the fraud funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Consultants especially the US of A ones are not the Godzilla strong type-like monsters people often portray them as. They exist to provide goods and services to the world while making a profit.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>At this moment, it is simple, with my money returned from MaryChia IPO that raised 80% from initial offering, IPO is on the move, so, whether is a bear in the our zoo, or the powerful US bull scrupture in front of Nasdaq, u do make money if you know the local newest trends, just like fashion, and my Angel consultation is to advise to all is to pull out all your investments during october before it is too late, and even if you invest, it should be short term and not long term unless the dividends is high. Other than that, for these coming months, look at your money in your hands, put it in your bags or wallets for guy, it is more save, unless you worry about pickpocket.</p>

              <p>I didn't have much posts in which I mentioned things after they happened, and claimed that I profitted from it. Hindsight is always 100%; I see no point in doing that unless you are studying how and why it succeeded or failed.</p>

              Agree with this. The biggest lesson from this recession/credit crisis is:
              Don't think that every analyst/financial advisor is completely unbiased. Always do your own homework when it comes to playing with your own money.

              <p>Wall Street is just another American Las Vegas. The only different is
              Las Vegas you bet with your own money. Wall Street bet with your money
              (they call it investment, not bet). If you win in Wall Street, those
              American fund managers pay themselves first, very big sum, then give
              you the leftover. If you loose in Wall Street, those American fund
              managers will still pay themselves first, and you loose everything you
              invest, and sometimes worse, you still owe them money. <br> <br> The
              Wall Street managers that graduated from American top university has
              long come out with a really genius, mind bogling "secret formula" where
              no mater what happen to their bet, they will always earn money. Also
              they made all these betting with other people money legally. So first
              thing, they get the fun doing the bet daily (with other people money is
              even more exciting), then if they bet it right, they get big cut, if
              wrong, they get small cut. <br> <br> To attract and confuse their
              victim, they use the "shock and owe" tactic. First get big office in
              down town big and tall modern building, that is the first shock to
              their potential victium. Then they give you the products, which was
              written by top lawyers (also graduate from American top university),
              which although still written in English, but since it is written by
              genius from American top university, nobody on earth can really
              understand what it means, but is sound "complicated", this is the awe.
              If you don't know what I mean, just read your own insurance policy.
              Third, they wear the Armani suit, drive the flashy expensive cars and
              meet you for lunch at $100 per meal restaurant. Finally, they get a
              "3rd party" to rate their products (whom also graduated from American
              top university), which give rating of "AAA". Well, most of the victim
              will just surrender their money to this "fun" managers.<br> <br> While
              the earth is plague with problem like polution, earth warming, food
              shortage and war etc, these fun managers continue to try to get more
              fun. Just like drug addics, they seek for larger dose and faster kick
              to sustain their habit. Now you start to hear they talk about new
              "package" and "products" and soon I think they will launch a new ponzi
              scheme. When you see American, especially from Wall Street, you better
              run.</p>
