              <p>There is nothing left for me to stay for anymore.</p>
              <p>My country isn't my country anymore. My family is gone because of a china woman. I feel like I'm the only one left, it wouldn't matter where I go.</p>
              <p>I will definitely leave this foreign country.</p>

              <p>Just go where there are opportunities and if one day you realise you miss the food, family and friends, you'll come back.</p>
              <p>Find it hard to digest that you are moving away from singapore because there are too many foreigners and to a foreign country where you feel at home.</p>
              <p>Think the main reason is that you are just bored of Sg and obviously having some personal issues at home.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless it is good to move around if you would be better off. Just like what the foreigners are doing in Singapore.</p>
