It just so happened someone came upon the email of complaint, saw who send it, and then decide to forward it to every mother son outside the SAF. The rest, as u know, is history. Quite simply, the camp that LTA Li is in should have some idea who that guy he complain is. I think that would be more than enough. I don't see why the guy should be named and shamed in public.<br><br>My point is that this is an internal matter that should have been settled within the SAF. It blew up because 1)the surname of the person who make the complaint and ii)some itchy hand leak out the email to the rest of the world outside SAF.</div>
