But still very little<br><br>But during one bad economic year when times werent so good, his company made a loss of 50 cents and he decided to stop all donation to charities. He said the company should only donate when there are profits ( even though they have made millions over forty years and are still financially very strong.<br><br>He argues no one owe you a living, people should only donate when there are profits.<br><br>Do you think this businessman is a miser? If yes why? If no Why?</blockquote>Wahlao why so miserly one ... loss of 50cents then stop donating liao x.x</div>
