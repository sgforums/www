              <p>The Primary Years Programme is an Inquiry-based curriculum which encourages students to develop the conceptual understanding, knowledge and skills they need, to become life long learners.</p>
              <p>The skill areas of thinking, communication, self-management, social skills and research are developed in the context of meaningful situations. Equally important is the emphasis on the development of positive attitudes and the ability to take responsible action when and if required.</p>
              <p>Through a structured Integrated Studies program, the students learn higher level questioning skills. The topics studied have been carefully selected, based on their relevance and significance.</p>

              <p>nice reply. i will attempt to see the diff between singapore and OFS doctrine</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">1. To focus on the individual needs of every student and to provide a supportive atmosphere designed to help students achieve personal academic goals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">sg teachers job is to make sure you pass your test, ask the friend help you, or personally teach one or one if needed</span><br><br>2. To sustain modern teaching policies and methods which give students positive attitudes to learning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">not expert in modern teaching method. think the sg teacher got use OHP and powerpoint woh</span><br><br>3. To maintain a "worldwide family" approach at school and help students to overcome any biased attitudes towards other cultures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">sg only have racial harmony day. think the student population is always a mixed though,</span><br><br>4. To work in open partnership with parents to prepare students for the changing world they will experience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">in sg, if the kid misbehave, the principal will call the parents down. if kids got problem, parents will complain to principal, so that is communication with parents bah.</span><br><br>5. To cultivate flexible approaches to problem solving which help students develop original thinking skills.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">sg trying to get more project work. not sure what other policy to add le.</span><br><br>6. To inspire each student to his or her potential level of achievement in a school where happy self-discipline and self-respect are guidelines for behaviour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">if the student can score well, teacher sure help. if the student is the star foorballer, the school sure support.</span></p>

              <p>I intend to become a teacher in the nearby future, that is if things go as planned, as they have a habit of not doing so in this world, oddly enough. I agree with your views and think that it's time for a radical change, and perhaps I myself will spearhead it.</p>
              <p>I love the ancient Greek way of teaching, to question and answer, and question the answer, my students I hope will question even me, and love me for it. To develop a passion for learning, not because you can earn money with knowledge but because it is beautiful to behold the world with that knowledge, for you will never see things the same ever again. Carpe Diem!! </p>

              <p>Question is, whether such an education system if introduced would be opposed by the majority of the people. It doesn't help if I were to dream, but the people don't see it the same way, and whether the government would lock me up for being a dangerous element and kill me on the pretext of corrupting the youth like they did to Socrates.</p>

              <p>Buat again I guess the Lees do not consider themselves mankind. They consider themselves above the law both God's and men's . They have US$ 10 billion dollar(though only 10 billion compared to 35 billion of the king of Thailand) but they do run the country's wealth so add another US100.00 billion.</p>
