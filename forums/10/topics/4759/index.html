Do you not know that many bright students from the minority races can't get into their local universities? There have been racial riots up till 1969 in Malaysia, but riots still occur for several reasons(eg Anwar) . The Malays still enjoy bumiputera status and have advantages socio-economically. Obviously, u have been oblivious to the amount of discrimination in there.Please do some reading before u make any nonsensical remarks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am rather surprised at MUIS' decision to avoid any discussion of this topic. They claimed that it will unravel the social fabric in a multi-religious society. Even Islamic countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have given their support to the US, why can't MUIS just even express sorrows for the deaths at NYC WTC? Is it too much to ask, or is there any hidden agenda involved?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Every religion has its blacksheep, I agree. But for this case, I wonder if it is true. Is it that religion is juz an excuse used to get pple under them and to shift all the blame to god?<br><br>Osama may be a Muslim (or any other for all I care), but can we really blame Islam for it?<br><br>Last time the Red Indians were persecuted cuz they want to spread Christianity. Go and conquer other countries cuz of Christianity.<br><br>This is not only for Christianity alone. Hitler exterminated the Jews cuz he want to remove their religion, and spread his. Is that an excuse, or issit that most of the Jews dun support him or sth from his intelligence service?<br><br>One may wonder if it is really a holy war, or is it juz an act of defiance on the part of the terrorists.<br><br>Do u think we can really accept their excuse as a jihad (holy war)<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>jimmm said something about a Chinese hijacking incident. IN fact there were many incidents until the Beijing govt got so pissed and sent security staff on board the planes.<br><br>In one incident, 2 Hijackers got their throat slit right onboard the plane by Chinese security staff.  No one dared to fuck around with the Chinese Commercial air fleet ever since.  Chinese killing chinese...<br><br>I honestly find it hard to imagine 2 muslims killing each other, if they were in the roles stated above.</div>
