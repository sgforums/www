Of course, the government will find it very hard to control the people's feelings,' he said in response to a question from The Straits Times.<br><br>'This nationalism is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the government can use it to rally the people. On the other hand, narrow nationalism can lead to chauvinism.'<br><br>The Chinese displayed 'this kind of narrow nationalist feelings' at Mr Lee's Taiwan trip and later at the Japanese during the Asian Cup final in Beijing, he said.<br><br>In 1955, he went to China from Indonesia to study at Peking University, then stayed on to teach history there before turning to scholarly research on South-east Asia. The 73-year-old is a Chinese citizen.<br><br>He said Chinese nationals looked at overseas Chinese 'as if they were our own people'.<br><br>Hence, their anger with Singapore, which is seen by people here as fundamentally Chinese.<br><br>But he added: 'Times have changed. The overseas Chinese are already citizens of other countries.'<br><br>In a speech he made earlier to the club, he noted that China's trade with South-east Asia was predicated more on politics than economics.<br><br>Proof that trade with the region was not a top priority: By last year, China's trade deficit with the region hit some US$16 billion (S$27.5 billion) and South-east Asia accounted for just 3 per cent of China's total foreign trade, he noted.<br><br>Still, China would want strong economic ties with the region to ensure there was peace and stability to focus on growing its own economy and resolving the Taiwan problem, he said.<br><br>Straits Times - 20 August 2004<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/eyeoneastasia/story/0,4395,268239,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/eyeoneastasia/story/0,4395,268239,00.html?</a><br><br></div>
