            <div class='col-md body'>To me, China seems to be struggling to fit itself into international norms and understanding diplomacy and is trying to push everyone around as if it's already the world superpower. Maybe it's the side effect of breakneck growth that gives its the cockiness and arrogance.<br><br>A recent quick look already shows China as the uncompromising and difficult to deal with neighbour in the region. China's relationships and diplomatic ties with several Asian countries are currently strained. Singapore is only of them. Japan is pissed with their lack of sportmanship and unneeded nationalism during Asian Cup and the Diaoyutai problem, Korea (North and South) are pissed with China claiming Korea as part of its territory recently. Seems like China is stepping on everyone's toes.<br><br>In my perspective, if we feel good ol' America is bad, then China is worse. At least Uncle Sam was relatively polite and didn't try any direct criticisms and play power politics with Singapore. Apparently, US always tries to settle things peacefully behind the scene (with regards to Singapore) and everything is done thru diplomacy, save for some critical writings in her press. At least things are requested from our government, not demanded like what China is doing. China demanded that our PM Lee cancel off his visit to Taiwan, which luckily we didn't. If PM Lee had succumbed to China, then it' would give China's leaders an idea that our government is weak and is "afraid" of China, which gives them even more reasons to try more power politics in future. I suspect it was a test of PM Lee's resilience and character -- whether he'll buckle and give in under pressure.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is a transitional period for China as it gropes around trying to find its place in the international community or already trying to assert its economic, political and military influence by flexing its muscles in the region and on the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE FOREIGN POLICY<br><br>Leverage on our strengths.<br><br>Our strengths are:<br><br>(1) Multi-racial, multi-religious and Multi-cultural country where people of diverse race and cultural background exist in harmony and understand one another.<br><br>(2) Our past economic success - except for the high cost part.<br><br>(3) International standing - tentatively successful except we tend to offend our neighbours with our high-profile pronouncements of all kinds.<br><br>(4) Our military hardware and civil defence software.<br><br>We have tested our neighbours' (Like Mahathir's) attitudes towards us before with our legalistic and high-profile "We are not afraid of you" pronouncements but this did not work. Abdullah the new Malaysian PM has already extended his warm gesture towards us. Let's us build on this window of opportunities and take the initiative to offer certain flexibility in respect of certain issues like water or causeway replacement based on realistic long-term interests of our nation.<br><br>If we are the first one to suggest and could form another follow-up delegation to iron out details, relations with Malaysia should improve. Legal minds may be too constrained/ Negotiators should not be full of legal jargons as our neighbours may not take our approach too well. Keep legal assertions as the final resorts when there is no alternative except to insist on arbitration. They should know our legal rights when we exchange correspondences or drafts. Keep legalities a bit to the background during negotiations.<br><br>As for our relationship with China, they are learning to respect our position. Last time our old administration has struck a certain common understanding with Mao and Deng and they saw our needs and aspirations as a multi-racial country. May be now is the time to build such mutual trust. If we go in and poke finger at their sensitive policies, without in-depth understanding of their major goals and policies, we may end up not the wiser.<br><br>Our strengths is that China may find our people trustworthy to do certain things but to help them build up their infrastructures and commerce. To use our strengths, it is crucial to exercise our foreign policies towards China with quiet low-profile helpfulness and mutual respects.<br><br>Our international relations should be exercised with suppleness and quiet diplomacy with willingness to benefit our neighbours through two-way technical exchange programs. Essentially this calls for a Swiss quiet diplomacy approach. Swiss has not lost out in any international conflicts to date and I don't see we will lose out if we are able to do the same. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

There were mutual trusts among the old leaders. As years went by, both sides went through leadership changes. On our side we change from LKY to GCT and now LHL. In China, from Li Peng to Zhu Rong Ji and now to Wen Jia Bao.<br><br>The relationship went on peacefully until LHL visited Taiwan. The Chinese needed to know if there were any changes in our position or has the new leadership taken the mutual trust for granted? Making noise was just part of their condemnation of any move that could undermine their one china policy. Such noise was necessary for both the international and their local audience, including Taiwan, and it is more important now than became because of ah bian.<br><br>Now months have gone past and what actually happened as a result?  Not much, except for cancellations of some trips, and I expect normal relationship to resume soon.  Such is the maturity of the relationship and the leadership of both governments. This certainly put to shame who were involved in anti-China and anti- Singapore bashing.<br><br>What is of real of concern is that from these anti china bashings, including many on this forum, we saw how little many singaporeans know about China and Taiwan. These two places are near to us in locations and close to many of us in ethnicity. Many Singaporean even spoke like the Americans commenting on democracy and freedom for China and Taiwan.<br><br>If anybody want to take on China, calling it big bully or communist, or "poke your finger at their sensitive .." part, it is better to learn from the Chinese proverb, "know your enemy know yourself, a hundred battles a hundred victories." This will benefit us not only in business and in foreign relationship, it save us from exposing our ignorance.<br><br>Your call for "greater in-dept understanding" is therefore most laudable.<br></div>

Let us hope our government will not conduct a China policy based on responses of some in this forums aimed at bashing China.<br><br>There should be in-depth understanding of others' needs and aspirations versus our own long-term interests in our foreign policy.<br><br>If we could do it during the communist era of China and gain their understanding and tacit support of our position in SEA, there is no reason we cannot now do better. Ah Bian seems to lack a certain balance in his foreign policy as he is too keyed up in gaining independence. May be he is just playing to his domestic politics to be too interested to gain a more acceptable solution.<br><br>Ah Bian's current move is against the interests of all parties and is not consonant with international realities. Americans already saw it fit and in their national interests not to contain or isolate China and is working towards accommodation with China. Why risk everything to spill for a fight for after all a modernising China is to everyone's benefits.<br><br>Taiwan can start negotiating for openness and eventual democratization of China using itself as a model to egg China to change with an objective of getting both sides to accept a time-table for re-unification.<br><br>China may respond to such an accommodation as it has to stablize HongKong as well. They had better diplomatic strategy at one time and had used the one-country two-system to induce cooperation of all parties under Deng Xiao Peng. Greater leadership is needed for China to gain peace with Taiwan and Hongkong.
