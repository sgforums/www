            <div class='col-md body'>Several fatalities were reported after multiple explosions rocked central London on Thursday, bringing the entire underground network to a standstill.<br><br>In central London, an explosion ripped through a bus just minutes after an earlier blast rocked the underground.<br><br>"We are at Tavistock place and we have had a bus explode just outside the building," said an official for the London Transport Police, adding that his offices were close to Russell Square.<br><br>A second explosion was later heard at Tavistock Square.<br><br>Citing unconfirmed reports, LBC News radio said seven people were killed in the blast at London's Aldgate underground station.<br><br>LBC News also said "a couple" of fatalities had been reported at Edgeware Road station, but couldn't confirm the information.<br><br>London's entire underground railway network was suspended, officials and rescue workers said.<br><br>Scotland Yard declared the emergency a "major incident".<br><br>The chaos came a day after the British capital was chosen to host the 2012 Olympics.<br><br>Police evacuated several mainline railway and underground stations after the first blast near Liverpool Street Station, which serves London's financial district, and several separate incidents in the west of the capital.<br><br>"We believe there was some sort of explosion. There are some walking wounded at Aldgate," a police spokesman said, referring to an underground station near Liverpool Street.<br><br>"We are not sure of the scale of the incident. Reports are still coming in."<br><br>Emergency vehicles rushed to the scene to deal with the confusion.<br><br>Witnesses on Sky television were quoted as saying people streamed out of some of the stations covered in soot, some in tears, many visibly shocked.<br><br>One of the evacuated stations was Stratford, which will be a key transport link for the site of the Olympic Games.<br><br>Metronet, a company which maintains the subway infrastructure, had earlier said the explosion was caused by a power surge.</div>

That, at the end of the day, we'll all just freakin die from whatever complications that might arise. That there wouldn't be 99 virgins awaiting you in heaven ( as these radicals belief), that if there is god we will have to pay our dues, that if god is just an illusion, it'll be the end.<br><br></div></blockquote>The ones who carried out the attacks and die are the ones who believe that there will be 99 virgins ( I think the figure is 10,000 virgins) waiting for them in heaven.<br>The ones who ordered the attacks are anarchists.<br>These anarchists are actually infidels themselves, but we call them religious extermists. Those of their faith condemn them.<br><br>The intention is to provoke a retaliation, a backlash. To generate hatred for their faith, and people of their faith. Ironically, if that do happen, these anarchists will say, "See, I told you so, they hate us."<br>We must not fall into their trap.<br><br>Accept that there are all sorts of people out there.<br>Some will fall for it.
