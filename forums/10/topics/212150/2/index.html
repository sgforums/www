            <div class='col-md body'>Strategy for increasing road space for personal transportation:<br><br>1. Finance road building to issuance of long-term (30-yr+) long bonds and transfer finance risk to private markets via LTA tender for - build, operate, transfer (BOT) but use multiple routes for competition so consumers will choose routes based on speed and cost.<br><br>2. Differentiate taxing authorities for road use-<br><br>a. local roads (intra-town) underground roads, maintained by town councils (taxed by town councils), they can provide free-parking for all local residents to drive to neighbourhood shops etc. Paid parking in selected areas to regulate congestion if needed just like any other city.  LTA will be regulatory authority in maintaining standards.<br><br>b.  inter-town, system (surface roads) maintained and operated, regulated by LTA for National connectivity, funded by road taxes on vehicles.<br><br>c.  National elevated Superhighway system that connects towns to towns and encircle current towns that provide high-speed travel using road tolls via ERP through private operators with multiple routes.<br><br>d.  National plan to triple-deck all current expressways will triple our expressway road space<br><br>e.   ensure higher quality public transport by insisting that off-peak hours guranteed seating standards -   I am sure all our subways train systems will fail this.   That's why people dislike taking public transport.<br><br>3. Accept decline in population as Singaporean personally directed strategy to increase per capita land space.<br><br>4.  Accept Singaporean disdain for FT policy due to overcrowding of Singapore.<br><br>5.   Quit putting everything in the city centre?  Why so many things need to be done in person???<br><br>6.   Why Singapore firms don't have an internet shopping strategy???<br><br>7.   Why is local shipping so expensive?????<br><br>8.   How come buy things in USA over the net can have free shipping and Singapore we have to give an arm and a leg, and have to be at home when they deliver???????????????? AND Singapore is a full-stop on the map when the USA spills over the map ????? WHY??????<br><br>9.  Why are 2 universities in the west? And the new one in the city when the North-east has nothing????????    And nobody and no traffic in the NE????<br><br>10.    Why always shopping areas near MRT and crowded and the shops so small and cannot move wheelchair and strollers around easily?????? And yet you need to drive there to get your stuff????<br><br>11.   Why they don't build Carrefour type warehouse big-box high-volume low cost, wipe-out small "ugly Chinaman" shop, in the suburbs away from the city center?????<br><br>12. why they don't build ramp style multi-storey carparks but instead build roundabout access, and driving is a pain in the butt and scratches on the car?????<br><br>13.  Why????? WHY???? WHY?????<br><br>It sucks!!!!<br><br>It ain't world-class till I see it.</div>
