              <p>Any transportation or town planning engineer or professional who has
                                  studied town planning will be able to tell you the objective and
                                  purpose of road system in town planning.<br> <br> In order to have an efficient road system, roads are usually planned in three tiers namely, <br> <br> 1st tier - Expressways or Trunk Roads (connecting city to city, town to
                                  town) where traffic should be of certain speed and generally fast
                                  moving to lessen the journey time between remote places for works and
                                  other economic activities,<br> <br> 2nd tier - Major roads connecting major towns and other networks within
                                  the same city, where traffic needs not be fast moving and certain
                                  slowness is tolerated.<br> <br> 3rd tier - Local Access Roads for residences or access to municipal
                                  districts and suburbs. where traffic jams may occur as part of life
                                  depending on how wide is the road or the density of the local
                                  population.<br> <br> Must the town planners be so paranoid as to design every tiers or roads
                                  whether expressways or major roads or access roads to be moving at a
                                  minimum speed of 30 km failing which $2 will be fined from the gantry
                                  set up all along the way home.<br> <br> If there are complete jams to cities or industrial estates where
                                  hundreds of thousand are working at 8.00 am sure by all means clear the
                                  traffic jams so that citizens will reach the office or work place on
                                  time. <br> <br> After all there are taxis, buses, MRTs so anyone who want to avoid jams can seek a more suitable mode of travel.<br> <br> It is crazy our LTA engineers cannot distinguish between these three
                                  tiers and insist on charging ERP fees for all three to the extent that
                                  traffic returning homes must be sped up to reach home fast otherwise
                                  they will be fined $2 for reaching home late.<br> <br> LTA should wake up to the different purposes served by different types
                                  of roads and not treat all of them on par with the cities, townships
                                  and major business districts and as soon as there is any jam (or
                                  slowing down) even on the way home all must pay gantry fees. <br> <br> Why must anyone want want to race home after work? So what if some
                                  people are not happy? We don't penalize the majority for the short
                                  temper of a few do we?<br> <br> Let there be life and leisure and not use the ERP to put everyone on edge.<br> <br> It is preposterous to impose ERP fees on everyone on saturday for going shopping or seeing a show.<br> <br> It is crazy to try to show off to the world we have the most successful
                                  traffic at night or on saturday just to prove something like their
                                  world class talents in solving every problems.<br> <br> Can't our leaders leave well alone start to let people live their life
                                  instead of tinkering with every slightest problems to prove their worth.</p>
