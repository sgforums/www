            <div class='col-md body'>well,i believe that a lot of the turnup percentage depends on how the war was started.if the war was started by ,say,one of our ministers goes gila over nothing,and deccides to start sending our units in,then the turnout might be very low,even zero!<br>but if the war was started by some countries with evil intentions,then i am sure that everyone will turn up.i know that i will.</div>

Cars pooling and MRTs are good ideas. For those who didn't turn up better hope they were killed during the war. Or they jolly well be prepared to clear all land mines in our motherland.<br><br>Btw we shouldn't be talking in detail abt our military strength, those LMFs in the north will learn and tries to match our capabilities. Beware, they have several 'car robbers, SS members and pigs' platoons for our weapons zeroing and practice. So clean your weapon well. IAs in these practice are waste of time. These platoons can also be our 'virtual reality' war senarios, just in case our trainings get rusty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like some others have mentioned b4, it really depends. But being Singaporean, I suppose we will have a duty to turn up to fight the war! Otherwise the government will eventually find ways to FINE us! It's all about money here...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I say we TURN UP... OR die... I've given this question a thought before... Would I stay with my loved ones and try to protect them..? Or would I go to war... I say I choose WAR... I'm actually a downgraded soldier, I'm not suppose to go outfield and hence is not combat fit at all... But still, I'm assigned to a battalion unit... I could have just wrote in to MINDEF or news to complain.... But I did nothing like that... I choose to take good care of myself during exercises so that I won't die for nothing prior to war (Which is something which could have happened during my NSF service... I HATED SAF for that BUT STILL, it's a DIFFERENT issue altogether...) I'm fighting for SINGAPORE, my friends, my loved ones... NOT for SAF, for myself nor the ministers... The government and SAF has given me a CHANCE to protect my loved ones and I appreciates that..... I've seen in movies before (and I know how TRUE it's gonna be in life during WAR..) of helpless men trying to defend their families... The theory is as simple as that... UNITED we STAND, DIVIDED we FALL....<br>Do you know why the government wanted us to 'waste' so much time in Nation Service...? It's because it wants the enemies to know that though Singapore is a small nation with little people... ALMOST EVERY MEN in Singapore can pick up a WEAPON and FIGHT LIKE A PRO when the situation requires it so.....<br>The only worry I have on mind now is when a situation where WAR really get triggered off, people would be running over all the place like don't know what... Would the RECALLED SOLDIERS be able to make it back to their reporting unit in time then..?<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry pals for replying late. Well, i agree very much with you devil1976, the reservists will probably be in a lost after they reach their camps. I think that some people may even forget how to operate their weapons. I think that there should be more ICT. So that the soldiers will always know what to do in times of a reaL CRISIS. BTw, even if the LMFs want to match, Singapore will always remain victorious. HAHA. BTW, you guys know that Singapore have a high interest in the Eurofighter2000! that cool! Its going to replace the A4Sus and maybe F5S<br></div>
