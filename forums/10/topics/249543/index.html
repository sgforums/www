Those FT that have passing out parade after 1 year is most likely not able to adapt.<br><br>One of the aspect of FT is the abilities to bring in different perspective ideas, methologies, training into the existing plate. There are only so much a person can learn and absort and hopefully thru media like internet can make that reference and conceptulizes and execute to local contexts.<br><br>Our pool of skills profession in both collars are very specialized it serve a particular function of corporate or industry. Because our economies constantly changing n transiting so these group of profession may need to move out of Singagpore to seek better advancement in the private sector. To Re-tool specialist are mostly out of the question if age group fall between 36 to 45.<br><br>The other questions that i believe need to address are the source of Talent. If you look carefully higher education are competing for bright n top students. Similarly they are competing for bright faculty members. Institutions competing at a similar level.  At some point U will find that the education experiences are going to produce homogenious candidates.  So where to scout for talent and what sort of talent can produce result. and I am not saying we should go into the DNA sequencing.<br><br>talk later.<br><br></div>

No so long ago, they are all immigrant or FT isn't it?

This means that when they get their pay, they really get paid instead of getting their salary siphoned for other purposes. Even if the FT and the Singaporean earn the same, the Singaporean is already at an disadvantage.<br><br>There's no way the Singaporean can compete except to sell himself cheaper and work much harder for the same amount of work. Given all this, why not become the FT instead of being a local worker?<br><br>The question I believe is this: <strong>Is Singapore a people magnet at the expense of it's own people?</strong><br><br>Attracting FT is not a difficult task, but recruiting local talent is more difficult given one has to make internal changes to policies, living standards, and systems of thought... things which apparently the powers-that-be are unwilling to fiddle with. So instead of encouraging... lets say more creative talents to blossom in Singapore by loosening the restriction on media laws and the like and accepting all forms of creativity (and not just the sterile forms that agree with the status quo) as valuable, we decide to take the easy path out by importing creative talents from other countries who already had the advantage of their more uncontrained upbringing in a more liberal country and the like.<br><br>In fact, it seems some want to have their cake and eat it to. We want to excel in sports but make no real move to nurture such talents in our young, driving home the point that one needs to go through the route learning path in order to become anything. It's laughable our sports school would have rejected Fandi and yet we wonder how come we need to import FTs to make up for this lack of talent.<br><br>It is not a game of musical chairs, more of poision ball... who wants to be a local worker when prospects as an FT are so much better?<br><br>Do I have anything against FTs? Not really I don't mind them being around. The real problem is that the local is basically fighting with one hand tied behind his back when it comes to trying to survive alongside the FTs. The fault is not with the FT for being talent, but for some systems that are taking the short route out to our talent "issues" by trying to import talents instead of generate it.<br><br>Instead of having an FT policy that acts as a way of enriching our soceity and injecting talents that we do not have to help us grow in this area... it seems we have crossed way over into importing whatever we have just to make up for the lack, and yet not taking any concrete measures to make sure steps are in place for the local resources to be developed.<br><br>At the end of the day, can our own FTs really trive, supposing they decide to settle down, as valued added Singaporeans? Given our systems I think their children will end up being pretty much like us, and the talent orginally imported would have been squandered.<br><br>It's great the FT team helped us to win the Tiger Cup, but I wonder if their children, assuming they had their parent's sporting talent, would truly be able to follow in their parent's legacy in our kind of system and soceity? Or will they, after years of grappling with our kind of educational system find themselves just like another local... being told that they don't have enough sporting talent and that the next generation of FTs need to be imported to make up for this "lack"?<br><br>Or we importing FTs to enrich ourselves, or just as a one-generation stopgap that we must carry out for who knows how long at the expense of the locals?</div>

Is that really a handicap in terms of competiting for jobs?<br><br>b) CPF contribution is cap at $4500, anything above will not make a difference to regardless if you are paying CPF or not. Beside that, if you are PR you have to pay CPF too.

And it turns out that the working conditions were pretty much like a sweatshop, where they were basically bringing in interns and FTs as cheap labour... which was kind of shocking for that company given it had a rather spotless reputation on the outside.<br><br>And this was not too long ago, given it happened in late 03.<br><br>Second hand of course we hear from this guy who tried to get a job in a local company from a PRC boss, and was told to explain why he should be hired given the boss had to consider things like his ICT and CPF when the Foreign Workers were free of such things.<br><br>Have we taken steps to make sure that these things do not happen?

I'm not entirely sure for I lack the data to find out. On the other hand, my mother works at this retail outlet where they make a habit of hiring foreign workers who come here to work short term as "interns". However the working conditions are anything but a learning experience-<br><br>They work from 10-10 (12 hours), do the same, if not more then the permstaff, and earn just 10 dollars a day (allowance). For the Singaporean worker this means that a proper job has been taken up by them, and for the foreign worker it means that they are been made use of.<br><br>In the end the only party that benefits is the company.<br><br>Has the MOM been effective in preventing this from happening? I'm not sure. Laws are dead but people are alive, and rather creative to boot. The issue it seems lies in the attitude of the system and soceity in itself.<br><br><blockquote>Is there any specific industry you think has suffered because of Singapore FT policy that you would like to highlight for discussion sake? </blockquote>This issue is close to my heart. The creative industry, despite all the money and FTs thrown at it still has very little to show for all the effort.
