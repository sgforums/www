What do you think is the status of democracy in Singapore now, compared to 10 years ago? Is the Singapore experience unique?<br><br>A: Singapore does not have a democratic political system. It has an authoritarian system that systematically obstructs genuine political competition for the exercise of state power. In the last 10 years, though, this has been combined with various new opportunities for Singaporeans to engage in PAP-controlled or sponsored forms of political participation. In effect, authoritarian rule has become more sophisticated but the scope for competing with the PAP hasn't significantly changed. </strong></blockquote>7.If sg is a  authoritarian system,this web site will not<br>be accessible!!<br><br></div>
