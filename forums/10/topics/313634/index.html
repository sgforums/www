              <p>When the government announces half-year and year-end bonuses and increments for the ministers and the civil servants the ministers always make it sound that everyone in the private sector will be getting such bonuses or increments so that they and their civil servants will enjoy the recommendations.</p>
              <p>It will not take long for any one in the private sector to discover that while the ministers are enjoying all the NWC or better recommended bonuses and increments usually a large proportion of employees in the private sector are not getting any such benefits at all as assumed in the annual NWC announcements.</p>
              <p>So NWC obviously is not intended to serve the employees to get their benefits which would otherwise be held back by employers taking advantage of unequal relationship. NWC appears to be created for benefits only for the ministers and their own kind and connection and not for employees as a whole.</p>
              <p>If it is only a vehicle to justify rewarding themselves and their own kind while ignoring the employees in the private sector should such an organization exist at all since it is not in the public interest at all.</p>
              <p>The many benefits like pregnancy leave and Saturday off are also given only to themselves and civil servants and are also full of hypocrisy with a lot of employees in the private sector unable to enjoy the same benefits usually due to unequal relationship and exploitations.</p>
              <p>Just study around and one could easily find that the private sector employers are not following such general rewards given to all the ministers and their own kind and yet every year the ministers are making it sound that because private sector are giving benefits they too will be given the NWC generous and over-generous rewards with bonuses going as high as 8 months even to those responsible for escape of Mas Selamat.<br> <br> Civil servants are given the regular annual wage increments based on certain assumptions that private sector employees are getting more. Any one who cares to look into this issue will easily find many employees in the private sector not getting even the 13th month
              wage supplement not to mention the July Bonus and Year-end 3-months bonuses. Complaints to MOM of non-13th month supplement fell on deaft ears as there is no labor law to make employers pay such supplement.</p>
              <p>will be to no avail if one is not an
              employee in a collective-agreement company.<br> <br> So there is really no justice being an employee in the private sector.
              Every year while civil servants are getting their increments and
              bonuses those in the private sector are not getting them. Yet the
              ministers in announcing NWC recommendations for half-year and year-end
              are always assuming that private sector employees will be given such
              benefits by their employers.<br> <br> Why when it is using public funds belonging to the public bonuses are so easy to pay out and when it comes to private sector employees the minister of Manpower doesn't seem to care?</p>
              <p>So the conclusion is that there will always be hypocrisy or dishonesty in paying out salaries and bonuses with all kind of false assumptions to make the NWC recommend higher than the norm in th private sector.<br> <br> So this is the kind of government and ministers called talented who deserve millions because they are good in looking after
              people and fighting for their justice and equity. It will not be surprising to find the prison chief who are negligent in allowing toilet bowl escape of terrorist prisoner to be rewarded several months of bonuses even after such incompetence.</p>
