            <div class='col-md body'>What is government ? Is it not the collective body of people to provide security against external aggression, internal threats, and services like judiciary, education, medicare, housing, communication, transportation and environmental for smooth overall functioning of the people as a people.<br><br>Must the government be vested with the role to micro-manage every aspect of life of citizens and must it take up every issue brought up and go beyond such essential areas of services to concern itself with manner of living, how people spend their own time, leisure, monies, where to go for shopping, and where and how to socialise and express their views etc.<br><br>Our leaders have been too carried away to over-manage and over-govern the people. It is over-sensitive to complaints of issues and problems of minor nature which impinges on personal life, minor mishaps or inconveniences and manner of living people's lives.<br><br>Over the past 40 years there were too much laws which were passed without deeper thoughts thereby teespassing the ultimate limit of governing.<br><br>Without drawing the vital line, a government will become excessive and obsessive and self-centred.<br><br>The best government is light government which is watching of not crossing the vital line.<br><br>A good government is one which will consciously avoiding over-control too much laws and legalistic maneuvering to the extent of killing social and cultural vibrancy and economic competitiveness and entrepreneurship.<br><br>Let bloggers be free to post as they like. Blogs are international cyberspace. Let a few citizens who are over-sensitive learn to be more tolerant and don't use their sensitive exuberance as opportunity to pass more anti-people laws to kill off society's vital energy without which a country cannot succeed as a great nation.<br><br>Do not over-react to every issue for the sake of showing power and authority or self-centred controls of dissents.<br><br>Dissents are human and they too will know where is the limit and will wise up. Don't get carried away by self-importance by passing more laws and putting up more control. Free the press control. The world is much bigger than legalistic governing and controls.</div>
