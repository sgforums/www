            <div class='col-md body'>indeed i believe most question ask during parliament have been rehearse.<br>remember not too ago the form then DPM LSL was on TV live meetig some experts on economic view and current affairs. i was disappointed with the question ask by these guest which some are professor from university, CEO of company and  blah blah. the show was a mere teacher answering question from the textbook and the guest dint dare to challenge the answer.<br>disappointment. that why my family stop watching these parliament and talk show coz all bull shit crap!!<br></div>
