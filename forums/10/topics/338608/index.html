              <p>We should view the world in terms of class conflict!  The Proletariat being oppressed by the Bourgeosie state instrument in a Capitalist society that is doomed to fail. </p>

              <p>only by viewing the world from multifarious aspects can we truly understand and appreciate the things around us. there is certainly no restriction as to how mnay perspectives we can take of this world we are all blessed with intellectual ability and the gift of thinking, hence we often analyze issues from various aspects, be it physically, economically, socially etc. To view the world only in one light and aspect would be to narrow our vision, to clamp down on our minds and fredom of thought and that would be just like animals who view the world only frm one point of view. we cannot view the world just from economical sense because it will cause our world to be devoid of love, care and emotions.</p>
              <p>we cannot view everything in the light of sociologically as this might result in communism. if everyone starts thinking back to ethics and morals and personal beliefs, then a great portion of the world would point out the income gap and difference in living standards of people. they would then seek to eradicate these disparities totally and there would be communism and no form of progress. the world would spend more time arguing over philosohpical and ethical concepts rather than working hard.</p>
              <p>taking your definition of psychological aspect, people would then only care about their own enjoyment, happiness and satisfaction and ignore both the economical and moral aspect.</p>
              <p>if one has the ability the view the world from different aspects, why seek to limit and restrict to only one?</p>
