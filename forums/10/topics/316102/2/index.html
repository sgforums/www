              <p>Meat Pao,</p>
              <p>It is not that people don't understand decision making process in a big organization as you have put it.</p>
              <p>What we the people are finding it difficult to accept is the constant harping of talents and abilities of various individuals called leaders who are actually lucky people given the opportunity to be leaders who as leaders have to accept responsibilities for poor performance and criticisms for mistakes.</p>
              <p>If as leaders they do not and cannot accept responsibilities for mistakes or losses then in the first place they do not have qualities of leaders, period.</p>
              <p>Proceeding from the above-stated basis, have our leaders like MM Lee plainly accepted the first principle of governmnet or leadership - accepting responsibilities for poor performance whether in specific examples of loss like in Shin Corp all these years?</p>
              <p>If GIC is an entirely private company like Worldcom or Enron, we the people can accept what you said that decision making is not a simple or easy process and people must take the good decisions with the bad ones and judge them for overall performance.</p>
              <p>GIC is an public organization set up to safeguard the collective assets and surpluses of Singaporeans and its monies are people's hard-earned monies. All on board of GIC are trustees of public fund. As trustees of public fund if they want to invest in Shin Corp or UBS (in a crisis situation) Bangalore or Russsia Township they as trustees must get the mandate of the people. Have they done so?</p>
              <p>If LKY is to set up GIC correctly he would have to invest such trust funds more prudently than this. Well and good with some luck he has made some gains in the past despite refusing to be accountable for this type of high-risk investments. He has through use of power refused to grant ex-president Ong Teng Cheong request to provide him as custodian elected president to make GIC and government accountable to some investments and that was a major error or judgmental blunder on his part.</p>
              <p>As a lawyer himself he should know fully well that public monies like MCST's funds can only legally be invested under the current general laws in trust funds consisting mainly of fixed deposits in banks or certain instruments not like what he is doing with public monies in the GIC.</p>
              <p>So there are two sets of laws here - one for himself and his GIC and one for the MCST or NKF monies belonging to the public. Is his action as a leader legally right or morally correct?</p>
              <p>Having seen the way he has been conducting the affairs of government vis-a-vis investments of people monies it will be clear that he does not want to be accountable to the people despite many years of people's unhappiness in this respect as published in the media and in the internet.</p>
              <p>The main issue when people now are talking about the further billions of losses by GIC in rash investments in risky shares and stocks overseas is simply one - is GIC being accountable ?</p>
              <p>If GIC is being accountable and is following certain prescribed rules and regulations and laws to safeguard people hard-earned monies (not LKY's certainly) we can then listen to your or his other points about investments being not an easy process and it is organizational decisions and not his own.</p>
              <p>Let the issue be understood in greater perspective and not be sidetracked as the media has been doing all the time with denials to ex-president Ong and so many feedbacks on this issue from the people (not just the internet forumers).</p>

              <p>Hi...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I understand a few main points in ur reply, which are the
              need for accountability of GIC, and the need for leaders to be responsible, to accept
              critism and feedback.</p>
              <p>These I agree very much.</p>
              <p>However some of the arguments, are not logical application of these principles.</p>
              <p>For instance a comparison is made between GIC and NKF, and how there is a difference of treatment. Yes of course, but isnt it obvious? Shouldnt that be a non-issue? And then there is a suggestion of asking for people's mandate for GIC decisions.</p>
              <p>Well, those are probably not so good elaboration of the above principles of accountability, and how leaders should be responsible.</p>
              <p>There is another one intriguing though, about President Ong asking in the past, to know more data. This I feel, is more logical, and in fact the formal rule as it should be, so it is a valid point to make, and indeed one can raise the subject, whether the current president has carried out this particular duty, and whether this safeguard is in place. I would agree with this point.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>some folks must be pretty high on hallucinogenics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they actually think that Singapore is run by a group of philanthropistic democratic politicians who would</p>
              <p>sacrifice themselves for the benefit of her citizens. nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they actually think that votes of individual politicians and the citizens they represent are taken into account.</p>
              <p>have we not heard from our great MM, that the feelings and thoughts of her citizens is inconsequential to his decisions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i wonder what vote was there to have MM &amp; SM, are they of the best interest to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>the only other regime that has this sort of policy are the old Qing Dynasty and North Korea.</p>
              <p>i wonder what benefit was derived from the appointment of a dead president to eternal president of korea done</p>
              <p>for the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some folks also distorting the lines between a failed acquisition and a money losing acquisition.</p>
              <p>Microsoft (MS) acqusition of Yahoo failed probably because MS did the number crunching and set a maximum bid for the share price of Yahoo.</p>
              <p>a share price that MS would be able to make a profit from the acquisition. whether the acqusition is a failure of success is an open ended question.</p>
              <p>of course they could have paid a much higher share price to make the acquisition a success, but ultimately is the acquisition beneficial to the current</p>
              <p>MS shareholders. are they going to make a profit for the MS shareholders?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whereas the Singapore government fund like Temasek acquired companies like Global Crossing, Merill Lynch, Shin Corp, Suzhou Industrial Park</p>
              <p>&amp; Optus have made losses. if a merger &amp; acquisition has gone wrong in MS, I am sure some bloke's head would be on the chopping block.</p>
              <p>in all of these companies, they were over enthusiastic with the acquisition resulting in over paying of the share price, in some cases write-off</p>
              <p>of goodwill were done after the first year of operation (a clear sign of overpayment).</p>
              <p>whereas a minister in charge of a ministry has allowed a known terrorist to escape, yet able to remain in office is baffling.</p>
              <p>the only reason he still remains in that post is because of his close relations to the Emperor.</p>

              <p>The fact is, they are investing <strong> your money </strong> which the people will not be drawing out; so they can hold as long as they wish too (at zero impact).

              <p>GIC gives money to Temasek; a private investment firm not liable to the government. If the money is lost, they are not accountable or liable. If they make money, it does not go back to the people but becomes their profit. Temasek is just like a super remiser - win or loose, they still win.</p>

              <p>Remember, they are investing with your money... not theirs. It's
                      a matter of using your money to make money which they then claim to
                      be their own.</p>
              <p>GIC gives money to Temasek; a private investment firm not liable
                      to the government. If the money is lost, they are not accountable
                      or liable. If they make money, it does not go back to the people
                      but becomes their profit. Temasek is just like a super remiser -
                      win or loose, they still win.</p>

              <p>and when you forget to put in your cash card at erp gantry they make you pay a fine of $10 on top of the erp amount. but when they refund any excess in ezlink charges they only refund the exact amount and you have to go all the way there to claim back your money. why they never compensate us for the inconvenience caused?</p>

              <p><br>To be exact, they have not lost the money yet. It's all paper lost at the moment and the government bought preferred stocks which guarantees an 8% return. So technically, while I agree they made a lousy decision to get in so quickly, I think the government would eventually turn out profitable in this one.</p>
              <p>The fact is, they are investing <strong>your money</strong> which the people will not be drawing out; so they can hold as long as they wish too (at zero impact).

              <p><br>Unfortunately for you and every Singaporean - while we believe that the money invested by the GIC and Temasek belongs to Singaporeans, this does not hold true to the MIW and the POWER of ONE.</p>
              <p>They truly believe that this annual surplus money transferred from the Finance Ministry to the GIC and Temasek belongs to them, as it is through their ingenuity in managing a Government Surplus at the end of each Financial Year - by over taxing Singaporeans through a gamut of creative money collecting schemes.</p>
              <p>While every country will treat the Annual Surplus as National Reserves, this Political Party - that form the Singapore Government for the last 50 odd years - has got it into their heads that the money rightfully belong to them.</p>
              <p>The best part of the whole scam is that - if there are any profits generated from the investments made by GIC and Temasek - the profits remain with GIC and Temasek PLUS the Principal Sums that were originally transferred from the Financy Ministry.</p>
              <p>These are continuously rolled over in the accounts of GIC and Temasek, and with the Singapore National Reserve continuously drawn down in total secrecy from any Parliamentary oversight, or even from any independent political supervision.</p>
              <p>The MIW - under the stewardship of MM LKY - have even passed legislation to prevent any new inoming Government from ''accessing'' the Previous Accumulated Operating Reserves to fund any new Programmes for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>This regulations was drawn up under the pretext of denying any rougue Political Party from promising the "Heaven and Earth'' to win any Election.</p>
              <p>So it seems that PM LHL's Government was supposed to be a NEW Cabinet - even if it is from the existing or incumbent Political Party, yet it was given free access to the Reserves accumulated by the previous Goh Chok Tong Government.</p>
              <p>And the scam continues - with the same MIW passing legislations like unquestioning sheep - that authorise the Government to pay themselves exorbitant wages to supervise the continuous grand scheme to empty the private wealth held by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The MIW Government has always made a big deal in boasting the annual pay out of S$1 Billion Plus to Singaporeans, that resulted in pittance paid out to Singaporeans that amount from $200 to $1800 per household, with the larger amounts forming a small percentage.</p>
              <p>This amount is nothing compared to what the MIW Government had taken from Singaporeans, and the multifareous financial traps that are in place to take back the same amount or more then what has been paid out  annually.</p>
              <p>If the Money is truly ours, and LKY and his Board of Directors are mere honorary custodians - then they should have the social sense of accountability towards Singaporeans, by answering to the Peoples' Representatives elected into Parliament.</p>
              <p>The annual financial status of GIC and Temasek Holdings should clearly and transparentaly reported, instead of hiding their operations behind a convenient excuse of National Security.</p>
              <p>This act of refusal to hold themselves accountable even to Parliament, clearly show the attitude of LKY and his MIW team towards the SURPLUS Public Money transferred from the Finance Ministry to GIC and Temasek.</p>
