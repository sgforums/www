              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><strong>Constitutional law for Singapore protestors.</strong></h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>With the most recent protest on March 15,
              2008 by Singaporeans who seek an end to dictatorial rule in Singapore,
              here are important things you need to know about Constitutional Law.
              You are not breaking any law at all in engaging in peaceful protests.<br><br>It
              is high time that you become aware of your rights now, with peaceful
              protests becoming almost a common occurrence in Singapore. Since it is
              impossible to seek change through Parliament, Singaporeans have now
              realized that only through protests can they ever hope to see real
              change.<br><br>These courageous <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> are mainly educated middle class Singaporeans, mostly upwardly and
              geographically mobile and aware of their legal right to protest.
              However there are some who are still are unaware, and it is these
              people that this blog is intended to educate and enlighten.<br><br>Please
              be clear in your minds about one thing. It is not illegal in Singapore
              to engage in peaceful demonstration or to give public speeches; no
              matter what the Singapore Police Force or Mr. Wong Kan <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Seng</span>, the Minister for Home Affairs say.<br><br>The
              law specifically permits you to engage in such activity; in fact all
              democracies encourage people to participate in them, since collective
              political participation and the robust exchange of ideas and debate can
              only benefit society, not damage it.<br><br>Singapore is a constitutional democracy. If it is not one under Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's dictatorship, it is at least supposed to be one in which the
              primary or most important legal document or law is the Constitution.<br><br>You
              can consider the Constitution as the backdrop that supports or defines
              every aspect of life in Singapore. You can also treat it as a template
              by which every law has to pass muster by. If a law fails to live up to
              the terms of the Constitution, such a law is struck down and declared
              illegal and null and void; as it violates the very supreme authority
              upon which all laws depend; the Constitution.<br><br>To put it very simply, every citizen, including Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his son, and the government of Singapore are supposed to obey and submit to the Constitution. The problem is that Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his son believe that they are too good for the Constitution, and they disobey by passing laws which are clearly ultra <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">vires</span> or contrary to the Constitution. This activity by Lee and his son is illegal and should be resisted.<br><br>What
              does the Constitution say? It lays down the people’s rights. The
              fundamental human rights. The right to free speech and expression
              without fear from government action. The right to assemble freely. The
              right to be treated equally. The right to elections. The right to
              change governments.<br><br>These rights are so important that in most
              countries governments are prevented from ever denying these rights. It
              is there to stay in perpetuity regardless of which government comes to
              power.<br><br>The Constitution exists so that men and women can hope to
              live as free men and women and be safeguarded against the excesses of a
              tyrants and bullies such as Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his son.<br><br>Other
              than the Constitution, there is Parliament. Parliament makes laws. But
              laws made by Parliament are subordinate, secondary and subject to the
              Constitution.<br><br>Therefore Parliament has to ensure that the laws
              they pass at all times comport and comply with the intent and meaning
              of the Constitution. If it violates any Constitutional provision, the
              law itself becomes illegal and of no effect. It can be disobeyed at
              will and any government that arrests people for violating that illegal
              law, themselves are acting illegally.<br><br>The Constitution
              specifically gives the right of peaceful assembly to citizens. Please
              read the Constitution of Singapore for the exact wording of the law.
              So, when Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> and 50 other Singaporeans assembled in front of Parliament House
              Singapore on March 15, 2008 at 2 pm, they were engaging in an activity
              which is entirely lawful and permitted by the Constitution of Singapore.<br><br>There
              is an illegal law in Singapore, deliberately intended to prevent
              Singaporeans from engaging in their constitutional right. I believe it
              is the Public Order Act but correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>Under this
              law, the government requires any public assembly of more than 4 people
              to have a permit. As I said, any law which clearly violates a
              Constitutional provision is null and void without more. Therefore since
              this law requiring a permit is in direct violation of a Constitutional
              provision, it is therefore without any legal force. That alone gives
              one the right to ignore it and protest in any number.<br><br>There are
              rare instances, such as serious national issues, where a constitutional
              provision can be temporarily amended. But such instances, as I said,
              are very rare.<br><br>For instance the constitution does prohibit the
              government from carrying out random searches and seizures against the
              person or property. Ordinarily the police need a magistrate’s warrant
              for this. They cannot just barge in. But this rule can be changed in
              emergencies, for instance during the unrest in Northern Ireland, where
              the rule against searches and seizures was relaxed to permit searches
              merely upon suspicion. But as I said, these challenges to the
              Constitution are rare and only in emergencies.<br><br>In Singapore Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew government's law that requires permits for a peaceful assembly for
              4 or more people is clearly unjustified and illegal. There is no
              compelling or urgent need based on national security reasons or
              otherwise for a law requiring these permits. Singapore is a peaceful
              place and peaceful protests pose not danger to anyone, not even to Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew or his son.<br><br>Therefore this law is illegal and ultra <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">vires</span> the Constitution.<br><br>Second,
              even if this law is permissible; which it is not; it again becomes
              illegal when the government does not exercise it fairly, justly,
              legally or in a judicious manner.<br><br>You will recall that Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> did apply for a permit; even though he did not have to; to hold the
              assembly on March 15, 2008. Even though there was no danger to anyone
              for Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> to hold the assembly; Mr. Wong Kan <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Seng</span>, the Minister for Home Affairs flatly refuses it without any reasons.<br><br>Furthermore
              the law requires the striking out of legal provisions that clearly
              violate the provisions of the Constitution, unless the government can
              show a compelling reason to justify it. Here, the government could show
              no such compelling reason based on national security or otherwise.
              There was clearly no danger to anyone by Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> and 50 others holding a peaceful assembly in front of Parliament House, Singapore. Therefore the denial of Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee's</span> application for a permit was clearly illegal and without any basis. Again, this denial of a permit alone is sufficient for the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> to break this law.<br><br>The other reason why these peaceful <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> were arrested was because the government claims the area outside
              Parliament House was a gazetted security area and no one is allowed to
              protest there. A whole load of humbug. Very convenient for Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, his son and his family but not so convenient to the citizens of Singapore.<br><br>This
              practice of gazetting places as security areas is merely a ploy to
              prevent ordinary citizens from exercising their constitutional rights.
              This law is invalid and illegal. There can be no justification for such
              a law in any part of Singapore unless a legitimate and compelling
              reason based on national security is shown. No such reason exists for
              the space in front of Parliament. Members of the public are there all
              the time. In fact, you can see busloads of Japanese tourists in the
              hundreds there with cameras at hand. Why were the Japanese tourists not
              told to leave because the spot was gazetted?<br><br>Parliament of Singapore is a mere rubber stamp, as you know. There are 82 as well as 2 opposition <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">MPs</span> in Parliament who attend at its sittings ready at any moment to say that Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew is Jesus Christ! So the laws these so called Members of Parliament pass are actually those of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his son. These two rule by dictate. The 84 <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">MPs</span> are stooges employed merely to say "Yes Sir."<br><br>Therefore
              it is you who has to decide what rights you have and what you have not.
              As far as Lee and Son are concerned, you don't have any at all.<br><br>Finally
              you are within your right in these circumstances to protest. You can
              realize by now that contesting elections every 4 years has not done you
              any good. I hope you realize that by now. If you do, then you must know
              that your only salvation lies in deliberately opposing this regime in
              protests.<br><br>There are many books in Constitutional Law but the
              book that I read at University was Stanley A De Smith's “Constitutional
              and Administrative Law.” I understand it is available through Amazon
              but I am sure the regular bookshops will carry other books on
              Constitutional Law. It will tell you your rights.<br><br>Lastly remember that police officers such as Deep Singh, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">DSP</span>, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tanglin</span> Police Station, who misused his police powers dispersing and harassing
              peaceful citizens at the Burmese protests; and on this occasion ASP
              William <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-error">Goh</span> who arrested Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> and 10 others at Parliament House, were not being entirely honest when they kept repeating that the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> were engaged in an illegally assembly. It was not illegal at all. If
              anything was illegal, it was the actions of such dishonest officers
              such as Deep Singh, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-error">DSP</span> and William <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-error">Goh</span>, ASP.<br><br>As for further information on Constitutional Law, I am sure Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span> Ti <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lik</span>, Lawyer, one of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> will be pleased to enlighten you.

Remember Pacific Daylight Time here is 15 hours behind Singapore time.<br><br>Don’t
              let up in protesting against this regime. You are already winning, as
              all the signs indicate. This government is finding it increasingly
              difficult to function, despite the propaganda being put out daily by
              its state owned and controlled media such as the Straits Times.<br><br><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair</p>

              <p>As you can see, the constitution does not protect you from holding illegal meetings and protests. It states you can assemble and protest, but only if you are not breaking any laws. If you need a permit, and protest without one, that's breaking the law.</p>
              <p>As much genuine fodder as there is to slam the PAP gov, it's seriously fascinating that people like the OP constantly has to come up with nonsensical claims to smear the gov. If they would only do a little REAL research, they could actually help their cause by  exposing REAL injustices, instead of these imaginary ones.</p>
