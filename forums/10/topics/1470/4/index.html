They are simply strengthened structurally. However, the avionics are still unchanged.<br><br>RSAF was considering the prospect of selling the 7 A/Bs to Thailand at 1 stage. I guess the deal did not fall thru. Then there were rumuors that RSAF might increase the A/B fleet by purchasing the Pakistanis A/Bs which were being held in the US. That didn't go through.<br><br>Now RSAF Vipers are essentially Block 52, I wonder what the fate of the 7 A/Bs will be. They are not logistically economical to maintain since there are only 7 of them.  ST Aero would love to upgrade them but I think RSAF said no. Are these Vipers being forgotten. I haven't spotted any Block 15 Vipers for a while in SG sky. The ones that I keep seeing are Block 52 based in Tengah.</div>

They were offered by the US (after Singapore lobbyed the US govt to release the technology after a long time) but Singapore turned to Israel for a similar secured data-link for the RSAF fleet of aircraft. I presume RSN would followed suit.<br><br>Well as broadband technology matures, we can be certain that DSTA and Mindef will employ such technology for Network Centric systems. So far, only the US or maybe some European countries can afford such high bandwidth systems.<br><br>The Network centric systems that the US is building are some really smart systems. They consider each radar and weapon system as a node and each are tasked with area of responsibility. If one node is taken off-line, eg. being moved or disabled by enemy's fire, then the network centric systems will alter some of its nodes to cover the offline nodes, kind of like "plug and play" and AI combined...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I believe what Singapore have is is data sharing/secure data link system in a network environment and that does not constitute to the network centric system concept.

Network centric involves some form of AI where a weapon system is controlled or coordinated by some central system which controls other detection or survelliance systems. You can almost think of it like the Star Trek Borgs.<br><br></div>

AI machines are smart enough to learn "like a human". However, they are limited by the amount of sensors and the data coming through from the sensors. It is however, still a good compliment to human manned systems.<br><br>Potential of AI application could see a vastly improved SAM system, eg. quick adaptation to electronic jammings, initiate different scan frequecies, evaluate threats from SAM suppression systems, etc.<br><br>Thus, the notion of a Network Centric system is not simply a rule based system, but one with some smarts that can adapt to situation itself without human intervention.</div>

ST Aero did "borrow" an A version for testing the Falcon-one upgrade. Furthermore, the news is a little out-dated because in the end, ST Aero partnered with BAe instead of Lockheed Martin. IAI have a similar upgrade for the A/B versions. So far neither ST Aero or IAI have secured any order (at least officially).<br><br>I think Viper52 might have more info on this one. Furthermore, last I read from Flight International (quite a while ago) was that RSAF did not make any commitment to upgrade A/B Vipers with Falcon one. I think they are more interested in intergrating some component of the Falcon One into the C/D Vipers, such as HMS for 4 gen WVR missiles.<br><br>Another thing is that there are "sightings" that some C/D Vipers already are equipped with the magnetic sensor attached on the canopy which sits right on top of the pilot's seat which could only mean that they might already been modified to equiped DASH-3 or even the JHMDS.<br><br></div>

The Falcon One prototype (RSAF F-16A Serial 880) was on static displayed during the AA2002. Segment noted that RSAF would be most unlikely to upgrade the A/B Vipers with Falcon One kits. Instead Mindef funded ST Aero to research into Man-Machine interface and the Falcon One prototype will be used as a research aircraft for future C/D Vipers upgrades.<br><br>Viper52 is right to comment that why would RSAF pay some $10mil for the upgrade of 7 planes where a new C/D Viper is only going to cost around $25mil.<br><br>I don't think ST Aero nor IAI with their Falcon ACE will get many contracts to modify existing Vipers form other international operators.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>[/b]<br><br>Let me rephrased my comment , the antennae array is guiding / data link  BVR missiles.<br><br>[/b]<br><br>See below for details.<br><br><blockquote><br>[Image: GEC]<br>AN/APX-113.<br>It consists of a Beam Forming Network and a combined Interrogator/Transponder unit and operates via four (rather striking) Forward Fuselage Antennas mounted on the upper forward fuselage in front of the canopy. These "bird slicers" are probably the most noticeable exterior changes for the F-16A/B after completion of the Mid-Life Update. AIFF provides Mk. XV or Mk. XII interrogation and response.<br><br>Benefits include interrogator/transponder capability (previously transponder only), the support of BVR weapons (e.g. AIM-120) delivery in excess of radar limits, increased range of 100 nm, relative position of friendlies, and reduced chance of fratricide (friendly fire).<br><br>The AN/APX-113 was also selected for Greek F-16C/Ds and the Japanese FSX.<br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br>The APX-113(V)/APX-111(V) CIT will give IDF, in addition to onboard radar and GCI/ACI, the ability to autonomously detect and identify airborne targets at extended range. The APX-113(V)/APX-111(V) is credited with a maximum effective range of 100nm, presumably in the active (interrogation) mode. This would enable the aircraft to more fully exploit the stand-off advantages offered by its TC-2 (Sky Sword II) medium-range BVR missile armament.<br><br></blockquote></div>

The RAAF HUG'ed bugs seem to use the similar blades as RSAF Vipers except they have 5 and our Vipers only have 4. The blades are also resting on a protruding base. Wonder what are the differences between all these seemingly similar and yet different AIFF systems.<br><br>BTW, the RAAF bugs are going thru phase 2 of the HUG, which involved replacing the APG-65 with APG-72. I wonder why don't they just wait for a year and go with the AESA version? Furthermore, do you know if they are also going to install the HMS to be used with ASRAAM? Man, it will be a darn interesting Pitch Black 2003/2004 to watch if both RSAF and RAAF decide to include high-offbore "missiles" in the exercises. It would be a real treat to have RSAF pilots using their DASH3/Python4 against RAAF bugs with JHMDS/Asraam combo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
