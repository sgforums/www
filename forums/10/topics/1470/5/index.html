            <div class='col-md body'>Read some interesting stuffs about Singapore UAV and thought of sharing it with you folks...<br><br>--------------<br>Aeronautics Unmanned Systems is one of a number of small Israeli UAV companies. Another, Emit Aviation Consultancy (Petach Tikva, Israel), has assisted Singapore Technologies Dynamics (ST) in the development of the Blue Horizon UAV. ST Dynamics has exported the 330-pound, tail-first Blue Horizon to the Philippines.<br><br>Blue Horizon is not the only UAV under development for Singapore 's secretive military. Firefly is reportedly a joint ST/Israeli project for a high- altitude, high-speed reconnaissance UAV that could be converted into a cruise missile.<br><br>Last year, Singapore 's MoD disclosed the existence of Lalee (low altitude, long-enduring endurance), a large multi-purpose maritime and littoral UAV. According to the MoD, US aircraft designer Burt Rutan (creator of the round-the-world Voyager manned aircraft) has participated in a three- year project to define the UAV. A twin-boom vehicle with a 26-foot-long payload pod, Lalee is designed to support a task group operating in littoral waters with both radar and optical surveillance and communications-relay functions. The term "long-enduring endurance" indicates that Singapore is looking for not only a long flight endurance but also a long service life. The next step would involve the testing of a proof-of-concept prototype.<br><br>The existence of ambitious programs such as Lalee is important even if they do not all see fruition. It indicates that, after a long and difficult adolescence, UAVs are beginning to reach maturity.<br>-----------<br><br>Source from JED:<br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.jedonline.com/default.asp?journalid=4&amp;func=articles&amp;page=0207j13&amp;year=2002&amp;month=7&amp;srchexpr=Singapore#hls1" rel="nofollow"><br>http://www.jedonline.com/default.asp?journalid=4&amp;func=articles&amp;page=0207j13&amp;year=2002&amp;month=7&amp;srchexpr=Singapore#hls1</a></div>

Both Global Hawk and Predator break the treaty limits"<br><br>and a more recent<br><br>"The State Dept. and Pentagon have found a formula to allow exports of Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk high-altitude unmanned reconnaissance drone. There was concern that the Missile Technology Control Regime effectively barred the U.S. from proliferating the technology. But State and Defense Dept. officials agree the U.S. could share systems like Global Hawk on a case-by-case basis with other NATO members, Japan and Australia. The Aussies are especially interested. Also watch for interest from Germany, where the UAV is expected to make an appearance later this year. Excluded under that arrangement are some other countries friendly to the U.S., though, including Israel--which has a healthy UAV industrial base of its own--and Singapore, which doesn't. And even for those on the approved list, exports will have to be justified on U.S. national security grounds. "<br><br>But seriously, do we need a global hawk? Not to sound like a sour-grape, but I think its waaaay over capable for our requirements. overcapability results in increased cost. Whatmore with the global hawk's cost skyrocketing due to USAF's habit of goldplating things(it actually costs what, 73 mil per plane now?), I dont think we can afford it.<br><br></div>
