            <div class='col-md body'>well generally i feel that the RSN has a overall poor AAW capability. The Baraks on the MCV constitute the best AAW system in the RSN. Frankly speaking I am not confident of the survival of the PV/APV/MGB in a high air threat intensity environment. Besides the missile, the inadequacy of the RSN radar to fulfill the air space surveilliance and management function is obvious.<br>Area air defence is something we sorely need. As of now, I think the RSN is very dependent on the RSAF for its air defence cover and air/surface picture compliation<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Feels damn good to be out of that Tekong shithole, heh heh.. ok, now what's this about our AAW being inadequate? Its true that the Barak is currently our best system, which would not be good against really scary weapons like the Sunburn or Moskit, but are we really going to face up against these weapons? Not likely. Malaysia and Indonesia do not have them, neither are they likely to acquire them in the near future, partly because these weapons are not suitable for our coastal waters. What are we up against, then? Exocets, Sea Skuas, and other ASMs of these types. The Barak is well able to handle these sort of weapons with its anti-missile capability.<br>On top of that, our ships aren't meant to operate too far from our coast, as we are not really looking for a power projection capability. With our current ships, we only have a brown-water capability, and air-cover is to be expected from the RASF. So I dont see any problems we would encounter in the AAW arena.<br>Oh, nut when the Frigates come though, they would give a green water capability to our navy, and thus they would be operated further from our coast, which would give them decreased aerial coverage, that's why they would be armed with the more capable Aster 15s.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I brought up the Sunburn once.  However, even I agreed that its not suitable for operations in our region.  Those missiles are carrier killers, long range, supersonic speed.  Not to mention a huge warhead.  Ships in our region rarely get larger than a destroyer, Sunburn would be massive overkill.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The role of the RSN is to secure our sea line of communication as well as to assist the army in land sea operation.

These chokepoints guards our sea lanes to critical resources and are proximal to potential adversaries. The air force, inspite of air - air refueling and extended range of its aircraft, will be strained to provide air cover at this distance. Convoys need to be escorted and the RSN is central to this. The Barak is not an area air defence system. The RSN is confident of the capability of the Barak and belives that it can handle the exisiting missile threat. However the target need to be found before the Barak can be employed and to do this require an adequate AD radar system.

The RSN does not have a monopoly on air assets and there is no gurantee of an air umbrella. To expect the Barak and existing AD systems to provide a cover over convoys, task forces and during land - sea operation would be unrealistic. This discussion is academic in view of the aquisition of the Frigates which represent a quantum leap in terms of our AAW capability.</div>

ST Marines has a new stealth OPV design in the pipeline, but gut feeling says that it might be one of the design RSN is looking at for a new fleet of Stealth warships to complement the La Fayettes. The Stealth corvettes/frigates will be some 80+ meters with AAW/ASW capability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by solaris:</div><div class="quote_body">With regards to the AEGIS system being authorise for sale to Singapore.....does anyone actually have any idea of the minimum tonnage a warship must have before installation of the system. Transfer of AEGIS technology does not mean that Singapore need to aquire the SPY system that you sea on the ARLEIGH BURKE and TICONDERAGA.<br>Technology is an intellectual property   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Personally I am skeptical of the report shown on the link given but we should think of the basic assumptions that we sometime make regarding military equipment, tactic and doctrine   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>The AEGIS system comprises mainly the electronically steered phased array radar that has to be mounted on the superstructure of the warship. The royal Australian Navy was at one stage contemplating adding AEGIS to the ANZAC frigates (MEKO 200 design).  However, the frigate was deemed too small for the radar. I believe US has come up with a lighter version of the radar. I think the Spanish F100 uses the lighter version.  Even the F100 is a good 5000+ ton warship. The ANZAC frigrate is some 3,600 tons yet deemded too small for AEGIS. As for Japan KONGO AEGIS destoryer, the type is built to Arleigh Burke design (not entirely but resemblance is very high).<br><br>It took Japan a while to get the US to approve the sales of AEGIS. What is the chance of Singapore getting approved of such technology - at current stage, almost impossible. Besides, the US will deem it as an overkill for Singapore. No RSN warships can carry the phased array radars. Unless the US has some secret "son-of-AEGIS" which is about a tenth in current size and weight and will perform at least 70% of the current AEGIS system, I don't see Singapore will ever get such system. The closest to such a highly capable air search/fire control radar would have to be some phased 3D radar mounted on top of a mast. I think the Europeans do have such radars, like the French Sea Tiger Mark 2 air and surface search radar on La Fayettes, and Thales Nederland SMART-L long-range air and surface surveillance and target indication radar. At best, RSN may want to install the Thales Nederland APAR Active Phased Array Radar. APAR is a multi-function radar(AEGIS like). But all these active phased array radars are meant to control Standard 2 Missiles to engage tactical ballastic missiles. Wonder RSN would actually need such capabilities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I was thinking more like an integrated Aegis network.  Since Singapore is soooo "network" crazy.  Most likely, our replacement for our E-2C, eg, wedgetail, would be integrated into a land, air, and sea, target acquisition, C4I systems.  Basically, Airborne and Surface radar information, constantly relayed between the 3 services's internal network, that distributes it out to all the various combatants.  Considering the latest developement in broadband technology, ie. Powerline, I feel that the SAF is clearly considering hi-tech warfare of such.  Where information must be relayed to all combatants within a blink of an eye.</div>
