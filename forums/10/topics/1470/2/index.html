In fact I find it hard to find sufficient space for the Baraks to sit. The LSTs are more likely to have the twin Mistrals like the old LST and the current Sir Lancelot class LST.<br><br>As for RAM for RMN OPVs, I thought they were going for Sea Wolfs?  Funny how all these reports are inaccurate. Just wait for their first ship to arrive.. shouldn't be that long, another 2 years?

            <div class='col-md body'>I found yet another site that hinted that RSN has purchased Aster 15 for the 6 La Fayette Frigates:<br><br>See: <a href="http://www.jedonline.com/default.asp?journalid=4&amp;func=articles&amp;page=0203j24&amp;year=2002&amp;month=3&amp;doct=ec%20monitor&amp;rsno=5#5" rel="nofollow">http://www.jedonline.com/default.asp?journalid=4&amp;func=articles&amp;page=0203j24&amp;year=2002&amp;month=3&amp;doct=ec%20monitor&amp;rsno=5#5</a><br>===========<br>MBDA (Paris, France) has successfully completed the first qualification firing of its Aster 15 Naval missile from an Italian SAAM/IT (Superficie-Aria Anti-Missile/Italia, or Surface-to-Air Anti-Missile/Italy) naval defence system. The launch was conducted from the Italian experimental ship Carabiniere at the French DGA's Mediterranean Test Center (Centre d'Essais de la MÃ©diterranÃ©e - CEM), off the coast of Toulon, south west France. The firing resulted in a direct hit against the target from a distance of 7 km and at an altitude of 1,000 m. The latest firing follows the October 2001 qualification of the French SAAM/FR configuration, which uses an Arabel multi-function radar. A total of 200 Aster 15 Naval missiles have already been ordered to equip 11 naval defence systems, intended for the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , the three F-1300S frigates Al Riyadh , Makkah and Al Dammal ordered by the Saudi Arabian Royal Navy, the second Italian aircraft carrier Andrea Doria , and <strong> six foreign frigates</strong>.<br>===========<br>Why I read the 6 foregin frigates are RSN ships is because the ships other than the La Fayatte produced for Taiwan, all La Fayattes are to be armed with Aster 15. Furthermore, I don't know of any current order books for "6 Foreign frigates" produced by the French..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> hee<br></div>

Does this mean we can start demanding for the AMRAAMs to be placed in Singapore? Apparently during the negotiations for the Longbow, the Yanks had initially offered to give us the Apaches, clear us for Longbow, train our pilots on it BUT leave the radars in US till a significant threat against developed. We said NO, and started making pro-Tiger noises. The rest is history...<br><br>It is a significant review of policy though, no matter what happens with the AMRAAMs.<br><br>One last thing: Have the Malaysians really bought Russian MBTs? Or is it just one of their "wanna-have" pipe dreams?

He was just in Russia, watching the SU-30, and is now in Poland taking a look at their PT-90 tank. Oh yes, they are also considering the Gripen too.<br>Let's see... they have a fighter competition, they seem to want to be getting an AEW platform, they want tanks, they want an attack heli, they want subs, and err, can someone remind me, what's their budget? (in US dollars, of course, lol) Do they even have enuff palm oil?<br>Oh yes, forgot to ask, how many VLS launchers is there on their Lekiu class frigates?

            <div class='col-md body'>M'sia seems to want to get quite a few stuffs. You are right. I read somewhere (darn, should have copied the reference, but I suspect it might have been from Janes weekly or some other western journals) that they are in fact looking at getting the MBT rather seriously. They are looking at quite a few Russian thingy other than just the MBTs.  They also have been looking at getting a few South African attack helos after RSAF acquired the Apaches.<br><br>Anyway, did you guys see the Chinese J-10 at AA? Did the chinese send a copy over?  Seems like the Taiwanese are quite apprehensive about this "Lavi-reborn" jet.<br><br>Secondly, US has just bought over the German HDW Sub maker. Now the americans pretty much controls the most of the conventional subs maker, including Kockum and HDW. They are also have significant influence over ASC.

(just my wild thoughts)...<br><br>Back to some serious discussion, I think US is changing the export control policy now that they are considering selling some of the most advanced stuffs to friendly nation. They are looking at allowing Korea to buy AGEIS, Taiwan to get some really high tech stuffs not to mention some diseal subs. I'm sure if Mindef presses hard enuff, we would get the Amraams. The only thing is that does the govt think that it is a good thing to have Amraams at home now?

            <div class='col-md body'>J-10 at the AA2002? where? From what I heard, its roughly equal in capability to a F-16 Blk 30. Of course, chinese views vary greatly. Some claim that its more capable than the JSF (yeah, right), some claim that its only slightly better than the F-8II.<br>I support the view that its about as capable as the Blk 30. It has high foreign content, having the AL-31FN as its powerplant, giving it good TW ratio. Its avionics are Isreali and Russian, and it seems to have a quad-redundant flight system. Some articles claim that the avionics are sensor-fused, but if it is true, it qould be limited, considering that Isreal, which is better than Russia and China in software development, has still not come up with true sensor-fusion yet. In terms of the radar, they still seem to be considering a few Russian and Isreali radars, but it should be roughly comparable to early models of the APG-68.<br>It is a 'lo' end mix to the SU-30, and thus naturally, would not be as capable as the Rafale, Typhoon, Eagle or even the F-16 Blk 60. However, its undeniably a significant step to producing a modern plane, from China's point of view. (even though, IMO, the help gotten from the LAVI program and from the F-16s provided from Pakistan is so huge, and so much equipment is foreign, that this is not really a plane China can claim to be "100% China" )<br>Furthermore, the AL-31FN has to be provided by Russia, they have not agreed to let China make the engine. I have heard that a second variant of the J-10 will use the domestically produced WP-15 engine instead, which is not as good as the AL-31FN, but at least its domestically made, and doesn't come with any restrictions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Poland is offering 64 tanks and armoured vehicles for 250 mil dollars, and up to 300 mil for additional services and support equipment.<br>Also, for some bizarre news, a man was arrested for walking down a street in Russia with an Igla missile on his back! When questioned, he said he found it. lol</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at weapons and buying weapons is quite different from actually buying weapons. Everytime Mahathir or one of his cronies go weapons window shopping abroad, they always want to buy everything but the goddamned kitchen sink, only thing is more often than not they finally end up buying only the sink's rubber plug and nothing else. I prefer to wait till the delivery is actually made before believing anything I read about their weapons buys.<br><br>Somehow I wonder how the Malaysian Armed Forces cope, with a sudden influx of new weapons every decade or so...won't this lead to an endless cycle of training without attaining type proficiency before the weapon is phased out and replaced by a newer type. Eg their MiGs are not even 10 years old!!!!<br><br>As for the batteries of tanks report, yup batteries is not usually used for tanks. Terms which SAF uses is platoon, company, battalion, with most Western(and even Russian) armour units using the same terms to describe tank units(Russian tank battalions are called regiments I think- can someone confirm?). Batteries are used to refer to arty, AAA or SAM sub-units. Think some reporter who knows nuts about military putting foot in mouth again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah, M'sia likes to shoot off their big mouth saying we want this and that....but eventually, they couldn't even pay for the stuffs...<br><br>Reality checks:<br>1. M'sia told the whole wide world that they wanted subs long before Singapore acquired ours. Verdict... they looked at lots of options and purchase none until recently... they had to settle for ex-swedish Dakens which are not even sailing... They are used for port training...<br><br>2. Migs29 - part barter trade... apparently the price of the palm oils could not cover the actual hard currency equivalent.  The palm oil were subject to commodities price index and the Russians only agree to the sales because they were desparate for hard currencies....<br><br>Secondly, spare part issues, technologies of the aircraft dated - aircrafts have to be modified to the latest avionics only after a couple years of service.<br><br>Verdict: poor choice - bad logistics, combat readiness low....<br><br>3. F-18 Ds.... only 8 planes... what are you going to do with just 8 of them given that any 2 to 3 will probably be out for service/maintainence at any 1 time....<br><br>Verdict: good plane, insufficient number to make an impact.<br><br>4. Lupo Frigates. Good ship, good radar, etc, but untested. BAe got into trouble in the weapon control system and integration.<br><br>Verdict: Good platforms but just 2 of them?<br><br>========<br><br>Of course, there will be more of these to come...<br><br>I predict their MBT purchase will have a similar logistic problem like the Migs unless they can start building spares themselves.  Tank rounds are also non NATO compliance which means they have to depend on the Russians or ex Warsaw pact nations to provide them.<br><br>Su27/30 - good planes but you got to wonder haven't they learn their lessons with their Mig29s? Better still look at those countries that field Su and ask them what they think....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I did some checking, and it seems that the Lekiu class has only 16 VLS cells for the Seawolf. That's only as much as our missile corvettes, which also holds 16 Barak VLS systems. Isn't that too light an armament for a frigate? Luckily our Frigates will come with 32 cells.</div>

Each Sea wolf canister is also not as compact as the Barak, thus they could only have 16 missile at the bow of the ships.  The same area would easily accomodate up to 32 Baraks...<br><br>As for RSN future La Fayattes, they are much bigger. They are at least longer by some 20 meters and wider too. Having 32 Aster 15s are reasonable for this size ships.<br><br>Come back to RSN MCVs, how I wish they add a CIWS weapon to the ship. The space where they put up a rubber dingy, between the sonar area and the structure could possible be enough to place Phanlax or Sea RAM or even a decenet size cannon. What a waste of space...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I came across a website which showed the specs for the Isreali Sa'ar V class corvette, and I was very surprised at the amt. of weapons it carried.<br>Also, while there was space where the rubber dingy was on, is there any space BELOW the rubber digny? The any CIWS system and cannon system has a pretty large space requirement below deck to store the ammo. Perhaps that's the reason why there was no CIWS placed there... I dunno about the RAM though, but the SeaRAM, which shares the same turret as the Phalanx, is out of the question.</div>
