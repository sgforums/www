            <div class='col-md body'>Yo guys! I just did some SERIOUS research on the net, and I got these tantalising bits of info on some EW and avionics systems on-board our platforms:<br><br>1. Our F-16s are equipped with (there may be other pods) the ALQ-131. 6 ALQ-131 pods were upgraded from Block 1 to Block II, under a $6.5 mil contract in 1997. Should have been completed in Jan 98.<br><br>2. The APX-109(V)3 APX-109(V)3 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system is on 18 of our F-16s. Should have been completed on Nov 98.<br><br>3. Our Apaches may be equipped with the Helicopter Integrated Defensive Aids Suite (HIDAS), currently in production by Marconi (Stanmore, Middlesex, UK) for Royal Air Force helicopters. I'd give this bit an accuracy rating of 8 to 9 out of 10, though, unlike the above to info, which should be accurate. The HIDAS will provide warning, situational awareness and automated dispensing of chaff and flare, but that an active radar jammer is not currently part of the system.<br><br>4. The NS 9003A/9005 Integrated Shipborne ESM/ECM Suite for Israeli SaÂ’ar 5 corvettes, and has been sold to Chile, Singapore , Venezuela and others. The new NS 9003A-V2/9005 provides a real-time electronic order of battle and IFM and DF on a per-pulse basis. The system can be fully integrated with command-and-control systems, decoys, hard-kill systems, radars and navigation systems. Frequency coverage is expandable from 2-18 GHz to 0.5-40 GHz, with a 2Â° bearing accuracy.</div>

Other questionable equipment is the digital terrain system. The USAF versions has one that incorporates terrain avoidance system using a digital map.

The only thing missing in the Sharpshooter pod is the card that interface Maverick IIR "F" version with the target acquistion seeker in the pod. Given that RSAF has purchased the "G" version Maverick which uses the IIR seeker rather than the TV version used in the A/B version, I believe RSAF may have the LANTIRN targetting pod rather than Sharpshooter.<br><br>I believe it was reported as Pathfinder/Sharpshooter package for RSAF in the press to avoid difficult situations where neighbouring countries would complain that Singapore is getting offensive equipment or the US would be "force" to sell similar things to less friendly countries.<br><br>Secondly, no customer was given the lesser Pathfinder/Sharpshooter since early 90s. Given RSAF purchases most of the Block 50s in mid and late 90s, I would say that RSAF most likely got the full package.<br><br>I will cross check with the article again and see what I can dig out. I had it photocopied and stacked it somewhere at home...<br><br>As for the D dorsal spine containing Israeli made equipment... Viper, you are right, its just speculation, but I believe if the speculation comes from Janes (it is where I read it from, plus a couple of articles from different journals all speculate the same), I believe it would most likely be right. Furthermore, a clue to it is a look at Block 60s dorsal spine.  The American intends to use it to house additional electronic boxes included ECM/ESM stuffs. I believe RSAF had the Israeli ECM/ESM equipment because it makes sense. As you and many have point out that the D versions are used for strike, and the back seat WSO is in fact the guy doing the targetting and weapon control. Given RSAF has no sign of getting HARM and that the Block 50/52 was purposely built for a "SEAD" role, I believe the assumption is highly credible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Then again... pure speculation....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Engineering journal? Which might that be?<br>For our -16Ds, I think that we can be almost certain that the spine contains an ESM/ECM suite of some sort. The only question is what model. The speculation goes that Isreali -16s which have the same spine have SPS-3000 installed in it, and so Singapore MIGHT have it installed in the Ds too, but this is just a wild guess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was just doing some research on the Raptor when I found this:<br><br>October 2000<br><br>Â©SIGNAL Magazine 2000<br><br>Simulator Sharpens Raptor's Claws<br><br>System measures fighter's electronic defenses against variety of real-world threats.<br><br>By Henry S. Kenyon<br><br>A powerful computer that generates thousands of radar signals is being used to test the electronic warfare suite on the F-22 Raptor. The device pushes the aircraft's countermeasure package to the breaking point, allowing engineers to locate, analyze and repair faults in the system prior to installation.<br><br>The Raptor, the U.S. Air Force's next-generation fighter, is designed to dominate all emerging aircraft threats well into the 21st century. An important feature of the F-22 is its advanced electronic warfare (EW) suite, the AN/ALR-94. Cutting-edge technology allows the fighter to detect, analyze, evaluate and react to the most current EW threats fielded by potential adversaries.<br><br>The aircraft will enter service at a time when there are no major global political blocs with their complementary families of equipment, radar and jamming systems. Even the poorest developing nations can access a variety of sophisticated weaponry from either the West or the former communist bloc. This mixed radar environment complicates the work of the EW system designer because radars formerly identified as friendly could be operated by potential aggressors. Over its expected operational life of 40 or more years, the Raptor's EW package will have to protect the aircraft under constantly shifting threat conditions.<br><br>According to John J. Sciuto, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Comptek Research Incorporated, Buffalo, New York, his company has been involved with every phase of the AN/ALR-94 since its initial concept and validation phase in 1996. He believes it is the most sophisticated airborne EW system ever developed for an attack aircraft.<br><br>It was during the development process that Comptek designers realized how much power the computer would need to generate all of the scenarios and the signals of threat emitters to adequately test the system.<br><br>"When you test one of these systems, you try to take it to the point where you saturate or break it," Sciuto explains. It took almost three years to deliver the project because of the complexity of the system involved, he adds.<br><br>The testing device, called the advanced dynamic radio frequency simulator (ADRS), is used on F-22 EW systems before they are installed in the aircraft. It is built around a supercomputer-class processing engine that contains nearly 40 gigabytes of high-speed memory, integrated to provide a total processing capability of more than 500,000 million instructions per second. This capability allows ADRS to generate the signals of more than 2,000 radar emitters simultaneously. Built from commercial off-the-shelf components, the simulator can be easily upgraded and maintained to meet changing threat profiles. Sciuto claims that ADRS is one of the 10 most powerful computers on the planet.<br><br>ADRS features a built-in scenario-generation capability that allows end-users to program in a variety of simulations. This is coupled with an up-to-date threat library provided by the U.S. government that contains data on every known radar signal currently in use. The scenarios consist of a variety of signals selected from the threat library that are fed into an F-22's EW system. The simulator then measures how the system processed the scenario and the EW signals. ADRS can also analyze the effectiveness of specific functions within the aircraft's countermeasures suite. Sciuto notes that the overall complexity of the EW system required a more complicated testing and measurement capability.<br><br>In the testing and development phase, the fighter's EW system is tested to saturation--a point where there is too much data coming in to be analyzed. Once that level is identified, the goal is to modify and repair the weakness before the system is put into production, he says.<br><br>Comptek has built three simulators to support the F-22 program. Two were delivered to Lockheed Martin and a third is being installed for the Air Force in its electronic combat test laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base in California. This particular simulator will be modified to test the Raptor's EW suite as well as those on several other aircraft, Sciuto notes. ADRS also could be used to test the Joint Strike Fighter's (JSF's) countermeasures suite. However, because the JSF has a different mission than the F-22, its EW system will also differ. Barring potential modifications to the hardware, any dissimilarity between systems should be minor enough to require only software changes in the simulator, he predicts.<br><br>Sciuto asserts that there is an art to writing computer code for EW suites. Designers must understand the environment in which the system will operate. For example, shipboard units must deal with radar reflections off the water and onboard interference from the constant operation of the ship's own radars and communications gear. When a countermeasures system is being developed for an aircraft, the designers must understand the airborne environment. For example, radar and EW systems developed for aircraft operating at low altitudes have to cope with problems such as ground clutter, which is not a requirement in high-altitude platforms.<br><br>Sciuto maintains that advanced EW systems testing capabilities did not exist 15 years ago and that countermeasures suites built before then were made without the benefit of current measurement and analysis techniques. He notes that there have been complaints from within the EW systems development community that EW packages are not performing correctly. But this problem would not be identified if the technology did not already exist to test and look for deficiencies. "These systems are invaluable. Even if it costs $20 million to build a simulator to test the F-22, it's worth every cent and more to make sure the thing is in fact doing what it's [specified] out to do," he says.<br><br>The added complexity of ADRS is necessary because the EW threat environment that the F-22 will operate in is considerably more complicated than the bipolar Cold War world. Unlike previous decades, where systems operated against a specific suite of Soviet designed radars and jammers, the current global situation can pit sets of potentially friendly equipment against each other. During the Cold War, EW and threat library design was much simpler, Sciuto says. However, now it is possible to encounter a hostile F-4 Phantom of U.S. manufacture that is equipped with an APQ-72 radar. In the past, a system would identify the F-4's APQ-72 as being friendly and move on to the next threat, he explains.<br><br>"Today you can't do that," Sciuto observes. "Now you have to be able to actually distinguish a friendly F-4 from a potentially hostile one because the bad guys have the same equipment. It really has complicated the EW world immensely, and therefore it equally complicates the simulator business."<br><br>Modern countermeasures systems must be able to identify differences in similar systems that might distinguish friend from foe. One example is the distinction between properly and improperly tuned radar systems. The United States and most developed world military organizations keep all of their equipment in top operating form at all times. This is not a common practice in some parts of the world.<br><br>"One of the discriminating factors when dealing with Third World countries is that they do not do that [tune their radars]. For example, the pulse train coming from a French-made Mirage jet operated by a Third World nation will not look the same. If that same radar was on a U.S. platform, those peaks would be sharper, clearer and spaced correctly," Sciuto observes.<br><br>Once these differences are understood, EW systems can be programmed to discern them and other similar triggers. Sciuto believes two lessons were learned from the Gulf War: Though developing nations may have access to the best equipment available, they often do not train their personnel on how to use it at peak efficiency, and those systems also are not maintained at maximum operating ability, he says.<br><br>The nations that supply arms and equipment to much of the world are also continually upgrading and developing new radars that are less susceptible to jamming. The French, Israelis, Germans and British have been very active in developing new, more sophisticated systems, Sciuto notes.<br><br>Intelligence also plays a role in good EW capabilities. When the U.S. military deploys into a potential threat area, the units are provided with the latest information on the enemy's order of battle, including the electronic order of battle. Sciuto explains that current EW systems are designed with online and offline libraries of signal data. However, when a force moves into a specific theater of operation, its online threat library is reprogrammed to minimize the time lost from sorting through the library. "While the system has a vast capability, it is condensed to the specific theater of operation," he says.<br><br>As the F-22 program grows, Sciuto believes there may be a possibility for selling the ADRS overseas. While Comptek has never sold anything as complex as the F-22 EW simulator internationally, it has sold many other types of EW testing systems to Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan. Although these countries buy the systems, the threat libraries are not included in the sale. Only the software is provided so users can enter their own threat data, he notes.<br><br>Comptek has recently become a subsidiary of the Northrop Grumman company. Additional information on Comptek Research Incorporated is available on the World Wide Web at <a href="http://www.comptek.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.comptek.com</a>  .<br><br>Some of Comptek's EW simulating equipment were sold to Singapore! This may not sound like much, but it confirms many articles I have read that puts Singapore as one of the few countries in Asia (along with Japan, South Korea, Austrialia) with an EW equipment potential within this decade.<br></div>

Thanks for the posts.<br><br>Yes, you are right Singapore takes EW very seriously. It gives Singapore Armed forces an edge over potential enemies. However, there are still a long way to go to become very good at it, especially building enuff data and growing the threat libraries. Singapore armed forces come in contact with very limited armed forces. There are very little chance of growing the threat libraries quickly except purchasing from the likes of Israel, India, European countries and South Africa.<br><br>I think through the use of the SIGINT/ELINT C130, RSAF will be able to slowly build up quite a bit of data.<br></div>

Maybe South Korea???? Singapore and Malaysia is a little too far to be "neighbouring countries", Australia is even more distant.  However, it seems that the mentioned countries have a credible enough ELINT or plain o' intel to want to be able to intecept the J-band radar signal from the Chinese fire control radar. I wonder what kind of fire control radar that is? Ship borned or air borned.  I would expect Japan, Taiwan and Australia to be particular interested and concern about this new electronic capability displayed by the Chinese. Singapore and Malaysia might probably be on fact finding mission and perhaps build up some sort of capability to intercept such radar signals....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> just my thoughts...<br></div>
