            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MM Lee, opposition MP Low Thia Khiang debate increase in salaries</strong><br><br>Opposition MP Low Thia Khiang questioned the need for such high salaries for ministers and top civil servants to prevent corruption.<br><br>He said Singapore ranked below Finland, Denmark and Switzerland, in a UN report on how corrupt a country is, but these countries pay their top civil servants less than Singapore.<br><br>This had Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on his <strong>feet</strong> and challenging his statements.<br><br>"Does he realise that Singapore's GDP is only one-third of its external trade? Our external trade is 3 1/2 times that of our GDP, higher than Hong Kong. And if this economy ever falters, that's the end of Singapore and its First World status. Denmark, Switzerland and Finland are part of Europe. You can fail and you're still caught in the European situation. If you fail here, you go back to a Southeast Asian situation. Just look around you," said MM Lee.<br><br>"So is the Minister Mentor saying that without paying such a high salary, we are bound to fail? And even if we pay top earners' salary, can the present government bring Singapore up to superpower (status), as what he has mentioned for those in Denmark?" challenged Mr Low, MP for Hougang.<br><br>"I am putting a simple question and asking for his clarification. He has compared Singapore as if it were Denmark, Finland or Switzerland. <strong>Their systems and governments never produced the kind of transformation </strong>that we have, and their system and government have a broader base and can afford a mediocre government," said the Minister Mentor.</div>

In fact, Luxembourg, with a population of 465, 000 and a land area of 999 square metres) has the highest GDP per capita in the world totalling USD70, 000 (approximately 3 times Singapore's)...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now that you speak about Germany - why aren't comparisons drawn in parliament about how Singapore's economy was transformed thanks largely to it being modelled on the German one during the Third Reich? For the record, Hitler and gang (who are far more capable, albeit more cruel and inhumane, than the ambitious clone whose numerous policies were modelled on that of the Nazis) transformed a debt-ridden nation into one with the second highest industrial output at the outbreak of WWII - all that in a timespan of 6 years.
