              <p><strong>S'poreans are living longer  <br> <br> <br>Tue, Feb 12, 2008<br>The Straits Times  <br></strong>        <br>  <br> <br>SINGAPOREANS are living longer, with life expectancy continuing to increase.</p>
              <p>A boy born here in 2006 could expect to live an average of 78 years, compared to a life expectancy of 76.6 years for a boy born in 2003 - an improvement of 1.4 years.</p>
              <p>Singaporean women could expect to live longer than the men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <br>A girl born in 2006 is expected to live on average 82.8 years, up 1.2 years from the average of 81.6 years for a girl born in 2003.</p>
              <p>The longer life expectancies are borne out in the latest figures released on Tuesday by the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) in an information paper on 'Complete Life Tables for Singapore's resident population' from 2003 to 2006.</p>
              <p>Life expectancies for older people have also improved.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Singapore men aged 65 could expect to live another 17 years on average, compared to 16 more years in 2003, while Singapore women in the same age group in 2006 could live 21 years more, against 20 years in 2003.</p>
              <p>DOS said Singapore's life expectancy compares well with selected developed countries.</p>
              <p>It is lower than life expectancy in Sweden, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan but higher than South Korea's and United Kingdom's.</p>
              <p>The latest life expectancy figures are derived from a new series of "complete life tables" compiled by DOS.</p>
              <p>"The derived life expectancy figures give an indication of the average longevity of the population, but do not necessarily reflect the longevity of an individual," said the department in a statement.</p>
              <p>Details on the methodology and highlights of key data trends can be obtained from the Statistics Singapore website.<br> </p>

              <p>Sometimes I rather they cut the bullshit and just dedicate 1 page or something and tell us what we really ought to know. Been hearing of rising life expectancy all the time, Its an overkill. Not only in Singapore, Australia too. Things they do to make you buy insurance and convert superannuation savings into annuity plans etc.</p>

              <p>With all this discussion going on I'm surprised no one has wondered about the following.</p>
              <p>1. How much can we expect to spend on health care after retirement as this affects any planning for our pension sum?</p>
              <p>2. How can we adjust the scheme to ensure we arrive at the projected pension sum at the end of the scheme?</p>
              <p>3. Other then food, housing and clothes, will the pension sum also provide for entertainment, optional contributions to charity and other expenses?</p>
              <p>4. Most annuities penalizes you for early withdrawals, will such penalties be waived for death and what kinds of returns can be expected?</p>
              <p>5. What, if any contraints are there to will such sums to dependants or to family or charities?</p>
              <p>6. Will the government allow citizens to opt to place their CPF in another "approved" pension fund other then the government managed one? If no, then why not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many other questions that may be raised and discussed. It may even result in someone picking up some pointers and writing in to the press (one can only hope) or writing in advance to advise them that you're bringing such questions to any meet the people sessions so they can prepare proper answers.</p>
              <p>If someone did that, I'd be properly impressed. I'm not so impressed by posturing about how "not fooled" by PAP certain people keep insisting they are.</p>

              <p>Thanks, kramnave for the link.   I believe that is not final, believe there may be some changes.   Whatever it is, buying of annuity should not be made compulsory.   AFterall, money is ours and the gahmen should not be so high handed to make decision for us.    The rest of it is overkill because they are real desperate to want people to support the compulsory buying annuity.</p>

              <p>Dear maurizio,</p>
              <p>The use of irony is to make fun of attitudes by applying it to extreme examples to properly showcase how inappropriate these are. It raises questions and is funny without ever making a criticism and is the choice of literary technique by people who try to avoid censorship. You should maintain it consistently thoughout your essay to avoid confusing your reader as irony is already a confusing enough technique. A departure should be properly indicated to forewarn readers. Sample as follows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I really hope to live to 100 years old as I'm very curious about how CPF would have developed to. Hopefully I'm not blind so I can see it for myself first hand, ha ha. I also think we should be able to choose how grand our funeral is, maybe there can be a percentage of CPF that we can opt for to set aside for this? As I don't have any dependents, I would like to have a really grand funeral.</p>
              <p>My brother says he's going to commit suicide when he's too old to work but I think he has got a bad attitude. Myself, I'm very positive and looking forward to my funeral and have started making plans for the decorations.</p>
              <p>I agree with pushing back the drawdown age because I want to make sure there is enough money for my farewell party."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>nb the departure from irony lies in the description of the brother's opinion being the voice of the real response to the policy.</p>
