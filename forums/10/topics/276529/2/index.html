Human society is so much better than ape societies because in the ape society, the strongest win because the weak do not know how to gang up against the bullies of ape society. In that sense, most Singaporeans are brutish apes not willing to stand up for the weak when they are bullied, even when the one bullied is a woman parliamentarian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if its not you then deep inside us, we have to convince ourselves, whether or not we have read this thread. If you ask me, i don't suscribe to the idea at all. To vote off somebody by consensus doesn't make sense. In the name of increased accountability, to vote off somebody so that the opposition can win without merit doesn't make sense. To vote off somebody because of "veiled threats" to a "weaker parliamentarian" does not make sense. That aside, i like sylvia. Think we should let the opposition do their work.</div>
