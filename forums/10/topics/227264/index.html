They are not telling you the truth. Do your own research!</blockquote><blockquote> <strong>Top 8 reasons NOT to immigrate to Canada</strong><br><br>8. Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.<br>Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.<br><br>7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.<br>From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.<br><br>6. Health Care Crisis.<br>Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.<br><br>5. Very High Taxes.<br>Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.<br><br>4. Money Hungry Government.<br>Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.<br><br>3. No Culture.<br>Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.<br><br>2. Worst Weather.<br>Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.<br><br>1. No Jobs.<br>Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in Canada for the rest of their lives. It is indeed a very sad and hopeless future. </blockquote>Below : Dr. Khalid Rafiq, is one of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants in Canada forced to survive on the worst labour jobs the country has to offer.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do Birds Migrate?<br><br>Every spring and fall, many species of birds migrate from one place to another. Why do they migrate, and how do they know where to go?<br><br>First, what is migration? Migration is when an entire group of animals moves from one area to another area. Some swallows go all the way from southern South America up to Northern Canada. Even longer, the Arctic Tern travels 18,000 miles on its route between the north and south poles.<br><br>Birds that migrate do so in order to find food and suitable breeding territory. Most are strictly limited in the type of environment they must have in order to survive and reproduce, although some are "habitat generalists," meaning they can adapt to just about anywhere...<br><br>Â“My interest isnÂ’t at all scientific, IÂ’ll leave that for the more logically minded." Kathleen Gibson<br><br>Canada geese that nest in Massachusetts are descendants of geese once kept in captivity to be used as live decoys. These birds were released when the use of live decoys was outlawed in 1935. Having been bred in captivity for several generations, these birds never developed a migration tradition which passed down from generation to generation in wild birds. Hence, those geese never learned to migrate, nor did their young. There were only a few geese originally and caused few problems but as the population expanded, doubling every few years, by the 1970s people began complaining about nuisance geese. So it's not that they don't migrate anymore, they never did, but with over 30,000 geese in the state now, people are certainly more aware of them.<br><br>Emily DickinsonÂ’s Poem<br>Hope is the thing with feathers<br>That perches in the soul<br>And sings the tune without the words<br>And never stops at all<br><br><a href="http://singabloodypore.blogspot.com/2004/11/winner-takes-all-in-singapore.html" rel="nofollow">http://singabloodypore.blogspot.com/2004/11/winner-takes-all-in-singapore.html</a><br><a href="http://singaporegovt.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://singaporegovt.blogspot.com/</a>   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
