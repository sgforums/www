There will be a loss of moral suasion on the young PAP members as well as one can see from their postings. How can they be expected to understand the needs of others or the responsibility to contribute to social and cultural wellbeing of society?.<br><br>They will always ask questions like: why this and why that instead of being more concerned and compassionate to one another or one another race. This is our state of governance, please take note whoever power that be. After all these years including running down of political opponents or ignoring complaints about high costs, this may be negative marks for social cohesions.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

They have nothing to gain from it,<br>if the government gets damaged , the WP and SDP would not survive as well<br>If a racial riot really happens, then the WP or SDP people who are planning it, would not be able to achieve their agenda as well to discredit PAP , if they are really racists, then they would also not get elected into office<br><br>To dis-credit PAP, they would be.., in actual fact , making themselves look really bad full stop. Anything to add on? None!<br><br>If the moderator is really of Y PAP , they could have tracked down the IP to a WP member or SDP and get "praised" by why isn't it done til this day?<br><br>The WP or SDP member would also have known if he gets caught , it will discredit his party even further.<br><br>Silent dude, please think before you talk , you are an junior member as well.</div>
