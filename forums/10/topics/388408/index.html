              <p>It was supposed to be a routine run of the mill article on Temasek Review on the issue of foreign workers, but it ended up being the most commented article in its history. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/14/myanmar-national-with-poor-command-of-english-working-as-accounts-executive-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>In the span of four days, the article about a young Myanmar lady working as an accounts executive in Singapore and taking English lessons at a Community Club at the same time had atracted more than 5,000 readers and 400 comments so far.</p>
              <p>Apparently, somebody had tipped off the Burmese community in Singapore who flooded our site posting comments berating us for “insulting” the Myanmar lady by posting her particulars online when we had obtained the information from Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Some posters accused us of poking fun at her language skills and demanded that we apologize and delete the article. Others slammed us for being “unprofessional” and threatened to sue us.</p>
              <p>Though we have explained repeatedly that the gist of the article is about the immigration policies of the ruling party and not on any particular persons or nationality, the flaming continue unabated till it becomes a mud-slinging session for both the foreign workers and locals to vent their frustrations, resentment and anger.</p>
              <p>Judging from the comments posted, it is quite obvious that the tension has been building up in both communities for quite some time already. Our article is merely a spark which triggered the storm.</p>
              <p>While the Burmese felt that they were being bullied by the locals, Singaporeans are of the view that they are here to snatch away jobs are otherwise taken up by them.</p>
              <p>This is probably the first time that an all-out “flame war” has broken out between foreigners and locals, a reflection of how serious the problem has become which continues to be ignored by the ruling party.</p>
              <p>In an ambitious plan to increase Singapore’s population to 6.5 million people, the ruling party had allowed too many foreigners into Singapore in too short a period of time without taking into consideration the interests and feeling of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>After realizing the extent of the problem, they decided to throw money at it in the form of a $10 million dollar Community Integration Fund which proved to be “too little, too late.” </p>
              <p>The root cause of the social tension lies in the fact that Singaporeans feel they are not getting a fair deal from the government as rightful citizens of the nation ranging from housing subsidies, places in primary schools to jobs which pay well.</p>
              <p>Singapore had accepted many immigrants from Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the 1980s and 1990s and Singaporeans never had any issues with them as they are similar to us in culture and had come in smaller numbers.</p>
              <p>The latest wave of immigration saw the ruling party opened the floodgates to the world, especially Chinese and Indians who flocked to Singapore in such large numbers that they do not see the need to integrate into Singapore society.</p>
              <p>Some questioned why we did not close the article for comments which appears to be inciting hatred between the Burmese and Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We are leaving it open for the authorities to see for themselves the mess they have created for Singaporeans and if they do not revamp their policies radically and reverse the intake of foreigners, the flaming they see on TR now will spill over into real life one day.</p>

              <p>Told you how many times already, i am neutral ya. I speak from my heart, all govts have their good and bad, there can never be a perfect govt in this world, so, your job is to weight between the good and bad ya, and then decide whoever you want to be your govt.</p>
              <p> A smart opposition will alway praise his/her opponents once awhile instead of keep attack them with critics and comments,  praising make them unaware of his motives and when you praise somebody for sake of praising, you put them at the weakiest point, because they feel so high and think that you are nothing but a lacking dog praising the master, and just as the master is sleeping, the dog bite deep into it and win the battle.</p>
              <p> I am not joking, Uncle, if you look at how LKY coming into power, you will understand what i mean, he praised his opponents until they dun even notice him, and when he bites, game over.</p>
