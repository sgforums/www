              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Justice Judith Prakash. Another Kangaroo Judge.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>After
              my imprisonment in Singapore for 60 days, thanks to Singapore's Lee
              Kuan Yew, I was let off for 5 days so as to get my things in order
              before I was banished forever from Singapore on November 26, 2008.</p>
              <p>The
              5 days enabled me to attend the case in the High Court, generally known
              as the Kangaroo Court T shirt case. On Monday 24, 2008, the Singapore
              judge Justice Judith Prakash found all 3 defendants guilty as expected.</p>
              <p>The sentence was to be delivered on Thursday November 27, 2008 which I
              could not observe, as I was deported on Wednesday the 26th. There was
              jail terms for all 3 Defendants, with Mr. Tan having to serve 15 days,
              and the other 2 Isrizal and Shafi, 7 days each. In addition they were
              each ordered to pay the government costs of $5,000.00 each.<br><br>The
              facts are that these 3 wore T shirts with the image of a kangaroo in
              judicial robes, (which means that the court is not impartial but
              corrupt), to the hearing before Justice Belinda Ang, (which by the way,
              was the same judge whom I was accused of insulting, resulting in my 3
              month imprisonment), from May 26 to May 28 2008 at the Supreme Court
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>As you will recall, the case before Judge Ang was for
              assessment of damages that Dr. Chee and company have to pay Lee Kuan
              Yew in his successful defamation action brought by Lee against Dr.
              Chee. For wearing these T shirts to Judge Ang’s court, Justice Prakash
              found them all guilty and the resultant severe penalties.<br><br>None
              of the 3 deserved any punishment. The Singapore constitution allows
              every citizen the freedom of speech and expression. And wearing T
              shirts with the image of a Kangaroo is the exercise of that freedom
              which the Constitution guarantees. Secondly it cannot amount to a
              contempt to say something which is true.<br><br>Everyone knows that the
              Singapore judiciary is complaint to the wishes of Lee Kuan Yew and his
              government as can be seen from the series of politically motivated
              court cases from as early as the 1960s up till today against the late
              JB Jeyaretnam to Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Lee's victims, who have been
              imprisoned and impoverished. How then can saying something that is
              true, that the Singapore courts are kangaroo courts and Singapore
              judges’ kangaroo judges, amount to contempt of court?<br><br>Justice
              Judith Prakash just as all her fellow judges in Singapore has once
              again disgraced herself, her office as judge and let down Singapore by
              shamelessly doing the bidding of her master Lee Kuan Yew by convicting
              and punishing these brave young men, who are in fact the pride of
              Singapore. They unlike the masses who live in fear of Lee Kuan Yew, had
              the courage to speak the truth and do what had to be done, which is to
              stand up to their convictions and say what has to be said, come what
              may.<br><br>These politically motivated cases, intended to break the
              will of good upstanding men and women of Singapore is difficult to
              endure. The jail terms of 15 days and 7 days is bad enough but
              endurable. But what is crippling is not the jail terms. It is the court
              costs of $5,000.00 (about US$4,000.00) each that they have to pay. This
              is a huge crippling amount of money for an average wage earner in
              Singapore.<br><br>If they find the money to pay, it will be a lesson to
              them never to criticize Lee's courts again. On the other hand, if they
              cannot pay, they would be made bankrupt, which means they cannot travel
              outside Singapore and the requirement that they report each month to
              the Bankruptcy office to explain their financial standing. Either way
              it is a debilitating crippling punishment, intended to send a clear
              signal both to them and everyone else that they should not, ever, dare
              to criticize Lee Kuan Yew or his courts, regardless of whatever
              dishonesty he or his courts perpetrate.<br><br>And if they ever do what
              they did again, they will be sent to jail for longer periods as well as
              suffer even heavier financial burdens.<br><br>With Lee Kuan Yew abusing
              the law courts to stay in power, and with unprincipled shameless judges
              such as Judith Prakash, what then is the answer to make this fascist
              dictatorship of Lee Kuan Yew accountable to the people? It is easy for
              me to say from the safety of the United States that more and more
              Singaporeans should pick up the courage that these 3 admirable young
              patriots had, and do what is right.<br><br>But that is easier said than
              done. During my 6 months forced stay in Singapore, with my passport
              held by Singapore police, waiting for my trial 4 months later, I had
              ample time to meet many Singaporeans. Each time I told Singaporeans to
              stand up to this dictatorship by open protest, I have always been faced
              with the same expected answer.<br><br>They tell me that they are all
              ready to speak up against the dictatorship, but they cannot because
              they would lose their jobs and their children would suffer; they and
              their families would be ruined financially at the hands of these
              corrupt compliant judges. This, you would well see, is a hopeless
              situation, forcing them to suffer in silence in fear of Lee Kuan Yew
              and his courts.<br><br>I do not have an answer to this question. Dr.
              Chee Soon Juan and his sister Chee Siok Chin have paid gravely to stand
              up to their convictions. Dr. Chee has lost everything and so has his
              sister. In history, there are only a handful of men like Dr. Chee, like
              Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. It is unreasonable to expect ordinary people
              to be martyrs like them.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew as you can see has a grip
              on power. And his principle instrument to stay in power is his law
              courts with his compliant judges which he uses to destroy and demolish
              his opponents, by bending and breaking the law outright when necessary.<br><br>But
              I know certain truths painful about the country. One is that it is
              imposable to change this government through parliamentary elections.
              The Singapore Parliament is nothing more than a rubber stamp. As
              Christopher Lingle, the NUS professor who was charged with contempt of
              court and managed to flee the country had written, "Singapore is a one
              party Leninist state".<br><br>Although outwardly Lee Kuan Yew portrays
              Singapore as a Parliamentary democracy, nothing is further from the
              truth. It is Lee Kuan Yew, the 86 year old dictator who controls
              everything, the courts, the trade unions, the media, everything.
              Parliament has no powers at all. Members of Parliament are mere stooges
              who would be quite prepared to say 2 plus 2 is 27 or any number Lee
              Kuan Yew wishes, to take the example of Orwell's 1984.<br><br>Therefore
              the only way to change this government and to make it accountable is
              for people to be able to say that 2 and 2 are 4 and not any other
              number of Lee's choosing. And the way to do this is not through the
              elections of 2010, the next general elections in Singapore, but through
              peaceful protest on the street.<br><br>But peaceful protest means
              unbearable hardship to the protestors. It would mean 15 days jail and
              $5,000.00 court costs liability, if not more, to take the recent
              example of the Kangaroo T shirt case.<br><br>With the crippling and
              terminal nature of these punishments, who among Singaporeans will be
              prepared to embark on this dangerous adventure? George Orwell in 1984,
              said correctly that the proletariat will not be the ones with the
              daring to do it; because they do not understand the need for such
              abstract values such as freedom and democracy, being content with the
              hope of getting a an extra $1,000.00 in pay or a better TV set.</p>
              <p>Neither
              will members of the elite with the knowledge of such values as freedom;
              the Inner or Outer Party in his novel 1984, be prepared for that
              sacrifice, as they would have too much to lose financially.<br><br>The
              answer lies with the young men and women with a tertiary education,
              citizens who are armed with a good English education, who know that
              they can succeed anywhere in the world, who would care 2 hoots to what
              Lee Kuan Yew can do to them. If they protest and get arrested, so what?
              They can take the next flight out to Australia where they will be
              welcomed with open arms, where they and their families can live as free
              men and women, able to speak their minds without fear of Lee Kuan Yew
              or anyone else.<br><br>It is these young men and women who should take
              courage and join Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his noble fight to seek freedom
              for his people. And I call upon them not to remain silent and do what
              is right and noble. Stand up for Singapore and stand up for the truth.
              You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.<br><br>Leaving
              Singapore for a life overseas is itself the greatest form of protest
              against Lee Kuan Yew and his politically motivated courts. In effect,
              by leaving, you are telling Lee Kuan Yew that you are not prepared to
              live as a slave in his island and the ability to live a free man is
              worth more than any amount of riches that corrupt judges such as Judge
              Judith Prakash can earn in her entire lifetime by playing second fiddle
              to Lee Kuan Yew, her master.<br><br>At present, I understand that as
              many as 1000 Singaporeans emigrate from Singapore’s shores annually for
              countries such as Australia. I have read that Lee Kuan Yew himself has
              gone to cities such as Melbourne begging overseas Singaporeans to
              return with no success whatsoever. Why should they return to a fear
              infested island where the slightest criticism of Lee or his courts will
              result in crippling financial ruin! By the way, I understand that the
              numbers of those leaving has been steadily increasing above 1000 each
              year!<br><br>As for the likes of Justice Judith Prakash, she will
              continue to live her life in luxury for the dirty work she does to
              please her master Lee Kuan Yew. Her income for being an agent for Lee
              Kuan Yew to silence and destroy his critics, I understand is several
              millions of dollars a year.<br><br>But I am sure that she loathes each
              time that she has to look at herself in the mirror, because what she
              sees is the face of a dishonorable unconscionable and unprincipled
              human being who lives by prostituting her position as a judge to please
              her master Lee Kuan Yew, who finds no other way to stay in power other
              than abusing the law to silence his critics.<br><br>May I say the same
              thing that I said about her fellow Singapore judge, Judge Belinda Ang,
              which landed me in prison for 2 months? Judge Judith Prakash of the
              Supreme Court Singapore has prostituted herself in her capacity as a
              judge hearing the Kangaroo T shirt case on November 24, 2008 by being
              nothing more than an employee of Lee Kuan Yew and his son, whom he
              appointed Prime Minister. By her actions in sending these young men to
              prison and making them pay crippling court costs of $5,000.00 each, she
              has shamelessly disgraced herself, her office of a judge, disgraced the
              Singapore Constitution and disgraced Singapore.<br><br>Shame on you, woman.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <blockquote>This case, which I shall call the disorderly case, took 18 days of
                                      trial in court. I defended myself. After all I am a lawyer. So if I
                                      have been fined $3,000.00, you may say that I got my money's worth.
                                      I have made the court and the Singapore Attorney General to work
                                      very hard for 18 days of court time. In return the fine I have to
                                      pay them is only $3,000.00. If you look at from a financial
                                      standpoint, you could say that I have ripped them off. What, for 18
                                      days of court time, they get only $3,000.00!</blockquote>

                      travel, has resulted in severe financial burden to me. I have to get my

                      of. I am therefore badly in need of financial assistance. Your

              <p>That the payment he calls salary of $3.7 million is in fact

              <p>The same applies to all his Ministers who
                      are <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">thieves</span> just like him.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows that he may in fact be taking even more
                      money without telling it.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows that if any Singaporean were
                      to question him about it, he will be destroyed.</p>

              <p>And we all know that his

                      believe in him.</p>

                  off his deck trying to round the Horn in the Roaring Forties in 70 knot

              <p>But now when I revisit it in my mind,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> it was one of the
                  greatest adventures of my life.</strong></span> And to come back to shambles in
                  California and having to pick up from where I started, is another
                  adventure.<br><br>You can say this again, my life has been a roller
                  coaster. But you know what, I wouldn't have it any other way. I agree
                  entirely with Harry.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

                  channels to register the claim in a US court. A US court would then
                  have to consider whether what I did would be a violation of the laws in

                  America is a country of laws. And their judges are proud to defend
                  those laws. Not like Singapore which uses its courts as their principle
                  tool to silence dissent. There is no way that Singapore can even hope
                  to succeed. But I would be glad if they tried, which would make me an

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">The Singapore Straits Times Report "Nair retracts apologies" Wednesday December 3rd 2008</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The state controlled press, the Straits
              Times of Singapore of Dec 3, 2008, reports that 2 days after I reached
              American soil, I retracted any apology given in the Lee Kuan Yew
              controlled courts of Singapore, Court 15, Subordinate Courts, before
              Judge Leslie Chew.</p>
              <p>This is correct. All apologies are retracted. So is
              my undertaking not to write my mind on the dire lack of human rights,
              the shameful lack of independence of the courts and everything else
              that need to be addressed. I shall also be reposting the blog posts
              which I was required to remove of Sept 1 and Sept 6 of 2008 in this
              blog.<br><br>The newspaper report states that the Singapore attorney
              general is looking into my turn about. My advice to the Attorney
              General of Singapore is to do all he can and whatever he wants. But the
              sad fact, for him that is, I am on American soil. America is a free
              country.<br><br>If he determined to make a fool of himself, extradition
              is what he has to consider. To do that, Singapore has to apply through
              diplomatic channels to register the claim in a US court. A US court
              would then have to consider whether what I did would be a violation of
              the laws in Singapore. In considering the question, they will have to
              look into the question whether what I did would tantamount to a crime
              in the United States.</p>
              <p>It is here that Singapore would find themselves
              in a bind. America is a country of laws. And their judges are proud to
              defend those laws. Not like Singapore which uses its courts as their
              principle tool to silence dissent. There is no way that Singapore can
              even hope to succeed. But I would be glad if they tried, which would
              make me an even greater celebrity than what they already have made me.<br><br>Dictatorships
              all over the world use dirty tactics to stay in power for as long as
              they can. I say for as long as they can, because sooner or later they
              all collapse. One of these tactics is to unjustly condemn a man and
              then repeat that lie over and over, hoping that the lie will eventually
              take root.<br><br>The state controlled press report mentions that <em>"In writing about the case on his blog, he insulted High Court judge Belinda Ang".</em> This is a deliberate lie. This refers to my arrest and conviction for
              what I had written in my blog post Thursday, May 29, 2008 <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a>. The material words which the Singapore Court relied on to convicted me before Justice Kan Ting Chiu of the Supreme Court were<br><br><em>"The
              judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire
              proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew
              and his son and carrying out their orders. There was murder, the rule
              of law being the repeated victim."<br></em><br>The state controlled Singapore court with its complaint judge Kan Ting Chiu found that the words <em>"prostituting herself during the entire proceedings",</em> among other parts of the blog post, was an insult to her.<br><br>This
              is completely untrue. According to Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate
              Dictionary, other than the usual meaning of a prostitute being a street
              walker, it also means<br><br><em>a) to devote to corrupt or unworthy
              purposes, debase, e.g. to prostitute one's talents b) devoted to
              corrupt purposes c) a person who (as a writer or painter) who
              deliberately debases himself or his talents (as for money).<br></em><br>And
              this was exactly what Judge Belinda Ang did during those 3 days of May
              26 to May 28, 2008 in the High Court of Singapore. Reading the blog you
              will see that my accusation is factually correct. She unashamedly,
              throughout the proceedings permitted her position of a judge to be used
              for Lee Kuan Yew and his son's advantage; not the not the interests of
              the law.<br><br>And I repeat those words I said again here. She undoubtedly <em>"prostituted herself in her position as a judge"</em> to serve the interests of Lee Kuan Yew and his son, the Prime Minister of Singapore.<br><br>Therefore
              there was no insult at all. My claim is factually correct. I am lawyer
              and I choose my words with discretion. But whatever the truth was, did
              not matter to Lee Kuan Yew's agent, Judge Kan Ting Chiu that day. He
              finds that I insulted the judge when there was no insult at all. And
              now, the state controlled Straits Times picks it up and repeats that
              defamation again and again hoping that people will believe that I had
              in fact insulted the judge.<br><br>And then another lie. The report reads <em>" Separately in July he behaved in a disorderly fashion and hurled expletives at police officers"</em>. I did no such thing.<br><br>I
              was accosted by 5 men claiming to be police officers who demanded to
              see my particulars in Little India on the July 4th 2008 at about 8.30
              pm in Race Course Road, Little India, Singapore. Not knowing who they
              were I refused. And a little later, I was arrested. Of course, I being
              Gopalan Nair, and a former Singapore opposition politician, they
              pressed charges and came up with anything they can imagine which
              included an accusation that I called one of the police officers <em>"A Malay bastard"</em> and that I was gesticulating with my hands.<br><br>The
              trial took 18 days. The police officers in an orchestrated fashion
              recited the same lies. In fact they could have said anything they
              wanted, even that I had tried to kill them and the Lee controlled court
              of Judge James Leong presiding, Court 16, Subordinate Court would have
              accepted it.<br><br>But the judge James Leong having accepted the lies,
              and convicts me of disorderly behavior and hurling expletives at police
              officers, the Singapore state controlled paper picks it up and repeats
              that lie again and again, hoping that somehow the Singapore public
              would believe that I am a man who goes around hurling abuses at police
              officers and being disorderly in public.<br><br>The Singapore
              government in their eagerness to tarnish the name of anyone that
              criticizes them is going about this entirely the wrong way. They should
              realize that they have chosen the wrong man to defame and punish. I
              denied both the Judge Belinda Ang case and the disorderly case, which
              took 18 days and 8 days of trial.</p>
              <p>They spent a great deal of money and
              effort. Perhaps they hoped that I would have pleaded guilty and left
              the country without much fuss. But my refusal to admit the charges and
              go to trial meant my staying in Singapore for 6 months, which was much
              more damaging to them.<br><br>During this long stay in Singapore, I was
              able to associate with Dr. Chee Soon Juan and members and activists of
              their party, understand the political situation in Singapore better and
              even assist in their political activism.<br><br>It increased awareness
              of may case among the Singapore public, where strangers used to come up
              to me and shake my hand with appreciation, my picture being on that
              paper almost everyday. My case received international attention with
              world bodies calling for my release and for the charges to be dropped.
              This blog overnight began to be read by almost everyone in Singapore
              who knew English.<br><br>All this, was not in the interests of Lee Kuan
              Yew's Singapore. If they had given it some thought and found out the
              sort of person I was, they would have done well to deport me the very
              day I wrote the blog. But they seem adamant to continue in their folly
              by their continued interest in me with their newspaper report of Dec 3,
              2008.<br><br>If someone could advice the Singapore authorities and
              their state controlled newspaper that it is best to leave me alone for
              their own good. Of course I hope they would continue with this vendetta
              against me, because it greatly serves my purpose of exposing this
              regime of Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore.<br><br>The report also states "<em>Mr.
              Nair was admonished, warned against launching future attacks on the
              judiciary and had to pay the AGC (Singapore Attorney General) $5,000.00
              in legal costs."</em><br><br>While I was in prison, a day before my
              release, Francis Lim, police officer from Central Police Station came
              to prison and gave me a letter from the Attorney General demanding that
              I pay about $6,000 (inclusive of their expenses) by November 26, 2008,
              which was the date of my banishment from Singapore Changi Airport. You
              would like to know that I have not paid this and I don't intend to pay
              this ever. And they made no attempt to stop me from leaving!<br><br>By
              way of parenthesis, you would like to know that in an earlier
              politically motivated case which partly resulted in my leaving
              Singapore in 1991 for good, another contempt of court case, an election
              rally speech in Bukit Merah where I stood as a Workers Party candidate
              in that by election, I was ordered to pay the Attorney General
              $13,000.00 which I have refused to pay, as I was already in the US by
              the time they worked out the figures.</p>
              <p>And not just that, about that
              time, I was suspended from practicing as a lawyer in Singapore for 2
              years for writing a letter to the then Attorney General demanding that
              he explain himself on a matter relating to the late JB Jeyaretnam,
              another shameful political action, in which they worked out my
              liability for costs in access of, believe it or not, $150,000.00. I
              have not paid that either.<br><br>No other government would sit idly by
              when an individual mocks their court orders in this fashion. They would
              take every effort to go after that individual no matter where he was.
              But you see, the Singapore government is not any other country. All
              their bravado and their arrogance is only in that small island where
              they rule by intimidating people by abusing the law.</p>
              <p>They leave alone
              anyone outside their borders because they know that they are a morally
              bankrupt country which will not command the respect of anyone else. Not
              to say that Singaporeans respect their government or their legal
              system, but because of fear there is nothing they can do in that prison
              which is called Singapore.<br><br>I would have been satisfied even if a
              single human being had read this. But with the wide coverage that this
              blog gets, and with the grapevine, Singapore will hear this and will
              hear my side of the story.<br><br>Many thanks.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
