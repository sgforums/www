              <p>Arrest Gopalan Nair NOW!!</p>
              <p>Oh i think AGC can apply to court of USA to extradite Nair back to SG</p>
              <p>to taste curry in QRP again!!</p>
              <p>Nair breached the conditions of sentences:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              In the proceedings on 12 November 2008, the Respondent(lion
              note Gopalan Nair) admitted in open court that he had made the
              utterances and statements that were punishable as contempt of court. He
              then went on<span style="color: #ff0000;"> to offer an unreserved apology t</span>o the court and to District Judge James Leong for the offending utterances and statements made by him.<br> The Respondent also proceeded to state, in public and on record, that he<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">unconditionally withdrew the allegations made against District Judge James Leong</span><br> and any statements imputing that the Singapore courts are beholden to the<br> government. The Respondent further <span style="color: #ff0000;">undertook in public not to</span> make such<br> statements in future and to remove the offending blog posts as soon as practicable.
              <p> </p>
              In view of the Respondent’s unreserved apologies and undertakings which were<br> made in public and on record, the Deputy Solicitor-General informed the court<br> that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Attorney-General would not be pressing for the Respondent to be sent to<br> jail</span>.<br> District Judge Leslie Chew then found that the Respondent had purged his<br> contempt and, in view of the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Respondent’s remorse, admonished him in open<br> court</span>. The Respondent was also <span style="color: #ff0000;">warned against </span>launching attacks against the<br> Singapore Judiciary in future. In addition he was ordered to pay legal costs to the<br> Attorney-General.

                  because Lee Kuan Yew likes him, as he would do well as his errand boy.

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Hello from Fremont, near San Francisco, California.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I
              am back in my office in Fremont, Northern California. I arrived at San
              Francisco airport on May 26, 2008 in the evening. Major problems caused
              by being forced to stay in Singapore for 6 months. Unpaid office rent.
              Unpaid mortgage. Disconnected telephone lines. Disconnected home
              utilities. Massive credit card debts.<br><br>But I tell you what. I am
              breathing. I am alive. And I am in America. Where anything is possible.
              And what is most important, I intend to continue with even greater
              resolve to expose the dictatorship which is what Singapore is. If Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew thought even for a moment that he has broken my spirit, he can't be more wrong.<br><br>In a way, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew has done me a great service. Before my arrest and imprisonment,
              this blog was well read. But after that he has made it a must read, for
              a great many. And furthermore, it has given it international publicity.
              And he has given me credibility to an extent I did not have before.<br><br>After my release from prison on the 20<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> of November 2008, I was allowed to remain in Singapore for 5 days to
              get my personal affairs sorted out before I left. A condition of being
              allowed to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">remain</span> in Singapore for 5 days was that I did not interfere in Singapore's
              domestic politics. I am prohibited from entering Singapore again unless
              I have prior permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In
              effect, I will never be able to return to Singapore.<br><br>But even if I was given <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">permission</span> to return it would be unwise to do it, since I could be arrested again
              under one or more of the litany of laws in place to silence criticism.
              And for sure, I am not looking forward to more time in a Singapore
              prison.<br><br>I have many matters to take care of presently leaving little time to write blog posts. But Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his government can take this from me now. I am defying the
              undertaking that I gave in court on September 12, 2008 when I admitted
              being in contempt of court. I am withdrawing the admission and
              repeating what I have always said that the Singapore judiciary is
              corrupt for being a stooge to Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his government.

              the moment goodbye. Too much personal work to catch up. The telephone,

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Lee Kuan Yew losing his grip on power</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I was in prison in Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's Singapore from Sept 20, 2008 to Nov 20, 2008 for writing a blog post criticizing Singapore's Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> for acting no better than an agent of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his son while presiding over the assessment of damages hearing from May 26, to May 28, 2008 in the case of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew against Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan.<br><br>While in prison, I read the book, "All the Shah's Men" by <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kinzer</span>.
              An excellent book which I strongly recommend. It describes how in 1953,
              the British and Americans conspired to depose a lawfully elected Prime
              Minister of Iran, Mohammad <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq</span> because he nationalized the prize of the British in Iran, the Anglo
              Iranian Oil company, with the excuse that if he was not deposed and
              replaced with the pro West <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mohammed</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Reza</span> Shah, the Russians will occupy Iran.<br><br>The methods used by the American CIA are almost identical to those of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew. For instance, the Americans discredited <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq</span> by printing and publishing articles discrediting him in Iran, calling
              him an unbeliever, a communist and even a Jew. Then they used corrupt
              judges to convict anyone with sympathies for <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq</span> with false charges. People who were sympathetic to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq</span> were dismissed from their posts. They managed to get almost everyone in
              the Parliament to support their policies and to condemn <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq</span>. Finally they managed to get the Shah to sign <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">fermans</span>, a sort of edict, ordering <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq</span> to step down, which he did, and promptly replaced by the British and American puppet, the Shah of Iran.<br><br>These
              tactics of 1953 Iran are almost identical to those of Lee in 2008
              except that it varies in degree only. But it should be clear to anyone
              that such dirty tactics of 1953 Iran cannot work in modern day
              Singapore of 2008, for the simple reason that today, we have the
              Internet. In 1953, when newspapers containing these falsities against <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq</span>,
              that were in fact written in Washington and London appeared the next
              day in Tehran, appearing as if they were written there, the people had
              no way of knowing otherwise. Without the Internet, they believed every
              lie put out to them in these smear sheets. The people being illiterate
              and ignorant had no way to disbelieve the false convictions by the
              false courts convicting <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mossadeq's</span> supporters.<br><br>But
              Lee today still uses these same dirty tactics to stay in power. He uses
              his courts as a weapon to destroy his political opponents from <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeyaretnam</span> in the 60s to Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> in 2008. Yet he demands that everyone respect the legal system under
              pain of imprisonment and impoverishment. This is an untenable situation
              for him. Every Singaporean today, unless he is blind, is well aware
              through the series of well publicized political cases that there is no
              rule of law in Singapore. Yet he demands that people not say it as it
              is. What is left for Lee is one thing and one thing alone. Fear. His
              only tool is to instill fear throughout the people to silence them.<br><br>As for the state controlled media and the press, it is exactly the same as 1953 Iran. The papers on a daily basis call Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> a liar, a cheat and what not. But today, nobody believes a thing
              written in the Singapore press about Lee's critics. Today they have
              access to he Internet. They can read outside publications which tell a
              completely different story about Lee's critics. At they end of the day,
              no one believes the state controlled press of Singapore which demonizes
              Lee's opponents on a daily basis. In desperation to continue singing
              the same tune, Lee takes the foreign press to court to shut them up.
              But whether they are shut up or not, in the end, the effect on
              Singaporeans is just the opposite. All the more they disbelieve Lee and
              believe that the truth lies in his victims, not with Lee.<br><br>What
              is left is one thing and one thing alone. Fear. Fear to criticize. Fear
              to complain. Fear to speak your mind. You end up being a skilled
              exponent of "doublespeak" of Orwell's 1984. That is to say something
              when you believe something else. To say that Singapore has the rule of
              law, when you know it does not. To say that Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> is a crook, when you know he isn't.<br><br>I
              cannot see how this place can go on like this for long. The educated
              have already seen the dishonesty in this whole thing. So they pack up
              and leave for the west, particularly for Australia. They can afford to
              leave. They are English educated with tertiary education. They can go
              anywhere they want, so they leave.<br><br>The average man without a
              tertiary education may not see this, and so he may stay. But such
              citizens are not the essential workforce that Singapore needs. What
              they need is the brains for leadership. But alas, the brains know the
              truth and the truth is not conducive to Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew.<br><br>I
              do not believe that Singapore can be governed this day and age by fear
              alone. As you can see, the government comes down very hard on critics
              by imprisoning them, impoverishing them and bankrupting them. Yet all
              this punishment is failing to deter more and more young men from coming
              out and openly condemning this dictatorial regime.<br><br>What will
              happen is this. As Lee finds that his critics increase in number, he
              will increase the punishments meted out to them. But I cannot see this
              working for him. In the end he will alienate even more Singaporeans to
              a point where they will not take this lying down and then there must be
              change. It is inevitable.<br><br>He has to know that 1953 colonial tactics cannot work in 2008 Singapore. The good news is, he does not appear to know this.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>I respect Dr Chee Soon Juan stay on and fight.</p>
              <p>Unlike Nair just says: <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Read my lips from USA!!</span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p>He is smart.But he forget SG gavaman always hire Upper Class</p>
              <p>Honor law grad.Nair never think SG will prosecute him.</p>
              <p>I say before.If u want to bankucpt any one,sue him.</p>
              <p>If u want anyone taste the Curry of Queentown Reman Prision,</p>
              <p>prosecute him.</p>
              <p>Before Nair went to jail,he had said in his democratic USA that</p>
              <p>he heard curry in QRP is really good.</p>
              <p>Now he tasted for himself.How is the taste,Mr Nair?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I have heard from reliable sources, that conditions in Queenstown
              Prison <span style="color: #ff0000;">are not really so bad at all. </span>You get three meals a day, and if
              Indian like me, you get curry everyday. It may even be better than
              California for me since I have to go out of my way to get curry here. I
              am getting fed up with hamburgers. Within Queenstown you get to
              exercise and make very good friends inside.</p>

              <p> </p>
              In the proceedings on 12 November 2008, the Respondent(lion
              note Gopalan Nair) admitted in open court that he had made the
              utterances and statements that were punishable as contempt of court. He
              then went on<span style="color: #ff0000;"> to offer an unreserved apology t</span>o the court and to District Judge James Leong for the offending utterances and statements made by him.<br> The Respondent also proceeded to state, in public and on record, that he<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">unconditionally withdrew the allegations made against District Judge James Leong</span><br> and any statements imputing that the Singapore courts are beholden to the<br> government. The Respondent further <span style="color: #ff0000;">undertook in public not to</span> make such<br> statements in future and to remove the offending blog posts as soon as practicable.
              <p> </p>
              In view of the Respondent’s unreserved apologies and undertakings which were<br> made in public and on record, the Deputy Solicitor-General informed the court<br> that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Attorney-General would not be pressing for the Respondent to be sent to<br> jail</span>.<br> District Judge Leslie Chew then found that the Respondent had purged his<br> contempt and, in view of the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Respondent’s remorse, admonished him in open<br> court</span>. The Respondent was also <span style="color: #ff0000;">warned against </span>launching attacks against the<br> Singapore Judiciary in future. In addition he was ordered to pay legal costs to the<br> Attorney-General.

                  — Immigration attorney Gopalan Nair returned to the Bay Area this week
                  after six months in Singapore, where he was imprisoned for two months
                  after being convicted of sedition.</p>
              <p>Nair, a San Jose resident who
                  practices law in Fremont — in an office above The Argus — maintained
                  his innocence Friday and continued to lash out at the Singaporean
                  government as being corrupt.</p>
              <p>The 58-year-old had traveled to his homeland in May to observe the defamation trial of some opposition political leaders.</p>
              <p>Afterward,
                  he criticized the High Court judge, Belinda Ang, as a "stooge" for the
                  country's leader, Lee Kuan Yew. She was "prostituting herself during
                  the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Lee
                  Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders," he wrote in a May
                  29 blog entry.</p>
              <p>Friday, he pulled out his Webster's dictionary to
                  explain what he meant by prostitute: "a person ... who sells his or her
                  services for low or unworthy purposes."</p>
              <p>Nair said he did not mean the judge engaged in sexual activities, but that she had misused her powers.</p>
              <p>"Those
                  words were strong, no doubt. But ... those words were necessary because
                  this judge was ... shamelessly abusing her authority," he said.</p>
              <p>"She was not carrying out her duties in a judicial manner."</p>
              <p>In
                  the same blog entry, Nair seemingly challenged the court by providing
                  his name and the name and address of the hotel at which he was</p>
              <p>staying,
                  stating that, "It will be interesting to see if ... Lee Kuan Yew and
                  son, who strut around ... bullying everyone who so much as criticized
                  (them), will sue me now for calling him nothing more than a small time
                  street bully."</p>
              <p>Nair was arrested at the hotel May 31 and spent
                  several days in solitary confinement, during which time police officers
                  would interrogate him at odd hours of the night to try to get him to
                  confess to e-mailing the judge with threatening letters, he said. He
                  has continued to deny that accusation.</p>
              <p>The immigration attorney
                  posted bail about a week after his arrest, and a trial date was set for
                  September. But Nair said authorities confiscated his passport, forcing
                  him to remain in the area.</p>
              <p>Homeless, Nair at one point slept in a
                  warehouse and developed a respiratory problem that landed him in a
                  hospital for five days, he said.</p>
              <p>On July 4, while awaiting trial,
                  Nair was arrested again — this time for disorderly conduct and
                  insulting an officer. He denied both claims, saying he was walking
                  alone on the street when five plainclothes officers attacked him.
                  Nevertheless, Nair was found guilty and fined $3,000.</p>
              <p>As for the
                  sedition charge, despite his insistence that he had used the term
                  "prostituting" correctly and that he never sent threatening e-mails to
                  the judge, Nair was sentenced in September to three months in jail.
                  After serving two months, he was released Nov. 20 for good behavior.</p>
              <p>A
                  week before his release, Nair said authorities accused him being
                  contemptuous in court during the trial regarding his July 4 arrest.
                  Because he did not want to jeopardize his chances of being released,
                  Nair said he pleaded guilty and agreed never to criticize the
                  government on his blog again. He also agreed to remove controversial
                  entries he had posted Sept. 1 and 6.</p>
              <p>But on Friday, he said he
                  plans to repost the two previous entries and that he will continue to
                  write critical pieces of the government, realizing he'll never be able
                  to step foot in Singapore again.</p>
              <p>Nair, who lived a total of 35
                  years in Singapore, twice ran for Parliament as a member of the Workers
                  Party, but lost his bids for office. He immigrated to the United States
                  in 1991, where he was granted political asylum and became a U.S.
                  citizen in 2005.</p>
              <p>After leaving Singapore this week, he flew into
                  San Francisco airport Wednesday, and spent his first two nights back in
                  the United States at the Islander Motel in Fremont because power and
                  water lines had been turned off at his San Jose home. Although
                  electricity had not been restored to his home by Friday evening, Nair
                  planned to return home.</p>
              <p>He owes about six months in mortgage
                  payments for his house, back rent for his law office, plus he needs to
                  pay off his credit cards, including half a year's worth of interest.
                  While waiting for his trial to begin in Singapore, Nair took out cash
                  advances on his credit card to pay for living expenses.</p>
              <p>Factoring
                  in lost wages, court fees and the interests on debts he owes, Nair
                  estimated that the entire ordeal has set him back $100,000 — and he
                  believes he is in danger of losing his house.</p>
              <p>"I paid a price,
                  but the Singaporean government has paid a bigger price," he said,
                  adding that his case has shed more light on what he called a tyrannical
                  government.</p>
              <p>"Before this incident, I was just Gopalan Nair. Who?
                  ... But after this case, (Singaporean leaders) have made me more
                  popular. They made my blog popular. They've given publicity to my
                  cause," he said.</p>
