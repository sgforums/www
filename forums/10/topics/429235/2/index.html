              <p>And khaw, in the thought of being kind, suggested that the old can go JB for healthcare needs. That's like Obama telling the Americans that they can go to Mexico for healthcare. He should relook his 3Ms thing, relook how the Medishield can be further restructured to lessen the burden of heavy medical bills on the middle and lower classes.</p>

Miss Ang had lodged a report in November last year and had yet to receive a reply from the police.<br><br><br>Instead of offering some words of consolation and support to her, Mr Yeo gave a one-liner reply:<br><br><strong>“Please see your MP”.</strong><br><br><br>Mr Yeo’s rather insensitive reply drew flak from netizens who lambasted him for lacking “emotional intelligence” on our article which has drawn nearly 100 comments so far.<br><br><br><strong>Out-of-touch</strong> felt that Mr Yeo’s lack of empathy is reflective of the entire PAP government:<br><br><br><em>“The Govt is getting out of touch with the common people.

We need smart mangers, BUT leaders capable of compassion and able to show caring feelings.”</em><br><br><br><strong>sibeidulan</strong> concurred that the reply is a bad PR move:<br><br><br><em>“Even if he’s not truly concerned, the least he could do is to be nice about it and refer the case to the Wong Cunt Sink at MHA nicely.

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>Straits Times, Feb 10:</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>SINGAPOREANS could consider living in nursing homes in neighbouring Johor Baru, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan suggested yesterday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>It would be cheaper, yet be near enough to Singapore for family members to visit and for residents to return for medical care if necessary, he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>He told Parliament yesterday that he recently visited a site in Johor Baru where a Singaporean investor was planning to build a 200-bed nursing home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>He asked the investor about the costs involved, and was stunned at how low they were.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>He said: ‘It is mind-boggling. The cost of land and construction cost is so low that my cost of putting up just a polyclinic (in Singapore) is probably more than his cost of putting up a 200-bed nursing home (in Johor Baru).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>‘The monthly cost of keeping a resident in a private nursing home in Singapore, you can stretch it easily to pay at least 2-1/2 months of nursing home care in Johor Baru.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>If any medical problems cropped up, the elderly could be taken back to Singapore by ambulance, he said.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>For most Singaporeans, visiting a relative in a Johor Baru nursing home would not pose significant difficulties, he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The investor, who is a nursing home chief executive, told him that many people visited their relatives weekly, even in nursing homes in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mr Khaw added: ‘Of course many visit daily, but quite a significant number visit only during the weekends, so what is the difference in putting them in Johor Baru?’</span></p>
