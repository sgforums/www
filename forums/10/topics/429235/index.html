              <p>Just see their rally speech and they are painfully lousy with their speech.</p>

              <p>khaw's presence is actually an obstacle to pressing healthcare reforms. He talks about the 3Ms: Medishield, Medifund and Medisave in which no sgporean will ever fall through the safety nets provided.</p>
              <p>Then why is it that Tan Howe Liang, our olympic silver medallist actually had to pay $100,000 of medical bills for some health problem? Why do some people go bankrupt having to pay medical bills? Why some people stay C class wards have to pay the sky? His means testing implementation meant that the middle and lower class have to pay more for their stays in B and C class wards.</p>
              <p>And his recent claim of the $8 bypass....if he has the balls, then declare to the public how much subsidy he's received because he's a cabinet minister and the insurance that he has that allowed him to pay a meagre $8. Nobody in Singapore pays $8 for a bypass unless he's very well insured.</p>

              <p>And....why do we have so many docs from myanmar and india these days? Just look at the polyclinics. If we have such a shortage of docs.....then why wasn't the intake for medical school increased in tremendous doses 10 years back? Arent these jobs something which Singaporeans can do?</p>
              <p>Walk around the hospitals and you see many filipinos working as professional medical staff. Arent these jobs something which many unemployed singaporeans can do?</p>
              <p>And khaw, in the thought of being kind, suggested that the old can go JB for healthcare needs. That's like Obama telling the Americans that they can go to Mexico for healthcare. He should relook his 3Ms thing, relook how the Medishield can be further restructured to lessen the burden of heavy medical bills on the middle and lower classes.</p>
