              <p>Ok. I've consulted the CPF Life Guide. My answer to you is yes.
                  The premium payable is = to 100% of your Retirement Account
                  balance. This is a lump sum = one time payment at age 55. Once you

              <p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
              <p>I am going to try to explain this whole CPF Life thing and how it links to the current Minimum Sum Scheme. The examples I use DO NOT apply to everyone and are quite generic in nature. Information I provide is for general education only. DO NOT take anything here as a professional recommendation or professional advice. If in doubt, do counsult a financial advisor.</p>
              <p>All of us (working professionals or have worked before) have a CPF account. This CPF account consists of 3 major components, namely CPF-OA (Ordinary Account), CPF-SA (Special Account) and CPF-MS (Medisave Account). During our working years, our CPF will look something like this:-</p>
              <p>CPF-OA            CPF-SA                    CPF-MS</p>
              <p>$100 000           $50 000                    $30 000</p>
              <p>Say you turn 55 years this year (2009), and the above is your CPF Account Statement. What happens now? When you turn 55, a new CPF component will be set up for you. This account is called the Retirement Account - aka CPF-RA. When your CPF-RA is set up, funds from your CPF-OA and CPF-SA will be transferred over to make up what is known as the Minimum Sum. The Minimum Sum is an amount dictated by the Government and increases every year ($117 000 in Year 2009). Using the above example, your CPF account will now look like this:-</p>
              <p>CPF-OA            CPF-SA                   CPF-MS                    CPF-RA</p>
              <p>$33 000              $0                             $30 000                     $117 000</p>
              <p>Remember: CPF Board will clear out your CPF-SA first, then followed by your CPF-OA to make up the Minimum Sum. If there is any balance left in your CPF-OA or CPF-SA after making up the Minimum Sum, you can withdraw it as cash (REMEMBER: this scenario only happens when you turn 55 this year, 2009).</p>
              <p>Now that this is explained, i shall move on to explain what the MSS and CPF Life is. When you reach 62 years old, you will attain what is known as the Drawdown Age (DDA). This is when your monthly payouts begin.</p>
              <p>The current Minimum Sum Scheme (MSS) is a 20 year insurance plan also known as an annuity. An annuity is an insurance plan. What happens is all the money in your CPF-RA ($117 000) will be taken to pay you a monthly payout for the next 20 years, compounding at 4% p.a. (till Dec 31 2009).</p>
              <p>Then the Govt realised that people are living longer, and there is a pertinent danger that they might outlive their savings (20 years of MSS payouts). So they decided to come out with CPF Life,</p>
              <p>CPF Life is VERY SIMILAR to the current MSS - the only difference being CPF Life pays out monthly payouts FOR LIFE. The current MSS only pays out for 20 years whereas CPF Life pays out for life.Also, with CPF Life you can choose to receive a higher monthly payout or a lower monthly payout, depending on which plan you choose (there are 4 of them). With the MSS your payouts are fixed and you cannot choose.</p>
              <p>The above example used is very generic and does not apply to everyone. In my next post I will elaborate on other aspects of CPF.</p>
              <p>Hope I've been of some help.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If that's the case, what is stopping the government from taking out a sum or % that does not justify the relevant fees or is even higher than what private insurers are taking?</p>

              <p>Back to my attempt at explaining this whole CPF thing -</p>
              <p>The example I have given was an ideal one - where one has enough money in his/her CPF account to put aside for the Minimum Sum Scheme and still have cash to withdraw.</p>
              <p>However the truth is, alot of us do not have this kind of money in our CPF. Why is this so? Remember - alot of us use our CPF to purchase our property (and property prices are very high in Singapore). Another reason is, we only contribute CPF from our monthly salary of up to S$4500. I will use an example to illustrate this.</p>
              <p>Say for example you are making $4500 a month, your CPF contribution is :-</p>
              <p>$4500 x 20% = $900 ( your CPF contribution)</p>
              <p>$4500 x 14.5% = $652.50 (Employer's contribution)</p>
              <p>Total CPF Contribution = $900 + $652.50 = $1552.50</p>
              <p>This $1552.50 will be split between your CPF-OA, CPF-SA and your CPF-MS. This percentage differs with age. For more information on allocation rates, see</p>
              <p>http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/Employers/Gen-Info/cpf-Contri/ContriRa.htm</p>
              <p>EVEN if you make $5000 a month, $6000 a month, $20 000 a month, your CPF contribution stays at $1552.50. This is to reduce the burden on employer contribution. Now imagine if your property cost $400 000 (Assume: HDB Resale 4 Rm in mature estate), how much will you be left with after paying for your property?</p>
              <p>So a more realistic scenario for your CPF Account when you are 55 years should look abit like this -</p>
              <p>CPF-OA          CPF-SA                 CPF-MS</p>
              <p>$50 000          $30 000                  $30 000</p>
              <p>With the above figures, how are you going to make up your Minimum Sum? The answer is - you are allowed to use  your property to make what is known as a property pledge.</p>
              <p>Using the above example - a 4 Rm HDB Resale flat at $400 000, you are allowed to use 50% of the Minimum Sum as a property pledge.</p>
              <p>Since you can use 50% of $117 000 = $58 500 as a property pledge, your CPF account should now look like this :-</p>
              <p>CPF-OA          CPF-SA                CPF-MA               CPF-RA</p>
              <p>$21 500               $0                    $30 000               $58 500 (property pledge)</p>
              <p>                                                                                       $30 000 (CPF-SA)</p>
              <p>                                                                                        $28 500 (CPF-OA)</p>
              <p>This mans that you can withdraw $21 500 as cash when you turn 55 this year (2009).</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Ok. this is my personal opinion.</p>
              <p>Honestly it is a good plan. I currently work as an independent financial advisor and in terms of annuity plans, there is NO other plan better than CPFLife in terms of  returns. There used to be one, from Manulife, but it has already been discontinued.</p>
              <p>However i think there is a very huge opportunity cost involved. The government, in implementing CPF Life, have classified all Singaporeans into one group with one broad stroke of the brush. Why do I say that? The implementation of CPF Life and some new regulations e,g, phasing out of 50% withdrawal rule, our CPF monies will be stuck in CPF for life. I will post more about the phasing out of 50% withdrawal rule in my next post.</p>
              <p>Think about it. An annuity plan is the insurance equivalent of buying a property. If i am allowed to take out cash from CPF to buy a property and rent it out, isn't it also a form of annuity? Or if I take the cash and buy stocks or invest in a business, there is a chance I could grow the money into an even bigger amount.</p>
              <p>With CPF Life, I am not given that choice.</p>

              members who are unable to meet the full CPF MS at age 55 are allowed to
              withdraw the first $5,000 or 50% of their savings in their CPF Accounts<sup>1</sup>,
              whichever is higher. Members who are able to meet the full MS will be
              allowed to withdraw the remaining monies in their CPF Accounts.</p>
              <p>As announced in 2003, from 1 January 09, the percentage for
              withdrawal will decrease from the current 50% to 40%, and thereafter be
              further reduced every year by 10 percentage points. Therefore, from 1
              January 2013, CPF members must meet the CPF and Medisave Minimum Sums
              first before they can withdraw their remaining Ordinary Account and
              Special Account balances at age 55. However, CPF members can continue
              to withdraw the first $5,000 from their Ordinary Account and Special
              Account balances.</p>
              <p>The change in the withdrawal rule will enable members turning age 55
              from 1 Jan 09 to set aside more savings for their retirement.</p>

              <p>I agree with you on the point that everyone needs some form of annuity.</p>
              <p>The point i am contending is, that the annuity does not need to be an insurance plan. It can be a private residential property, a commercial property, a stock that pays out a dividend, etc etc. These are all different forms of ''annuity'' which serve the same purpose, which is to give a regular passive income.</p>
              <p>To be fair, the annuities on the market now ( i shall not give names) all average about 2% return p.a., which is honestly, not alot. However on the flipside, i acknowledge that low return = low risk and their projected return probably can be extrapolated into the future without much deviation from the trend.</p>
              <p>Just my personal opinion...</p>

              <p>Plus Plan</p>
              <p>this plan totally no RA. all your funds from RA will be used for LIFE.</p>

              <p>so if you die and you are using the Basic or Balanced plans, your kids will get the balance in RA and any unused annuity PREMIUM.</p>
              <p>if using the Plus plan, the kids will be getting unused annuity PREMIUM.</p>
              <p>However for Income plan, nothing will be refunded, even if you die before you even start drawing the annuity. meaning if u suay suay 64 yo die, nothing will be left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note for people born after 1954, meaning us, the draw down age is 65.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on a side note, can move this topic to my forum ma. cause i set up a forum for financial discussions like this and currently no activity in my forum. haha XD</p>

              <p>I agree with you on the point that everyone needs some form of
              annuity.</p>
              <p>The point i am contending is, that the annuity does not need to
              be an insurance plan. It can be a private residential property, a
              commercial property, a stock that pays out a dividend, etc etc.
              These are all different forms of ''annuity'' which serve the same
              purpose, which is to give a regular passive income.</p>
              <p>To be fair, the annuities on the market now ( i shall not give
              names) all average about 2% return p.a., which is honestly, not
              alot. However on the flipside, i acknowledge that low return = low
              risk and their projected return probably can be extrapolated into
              the future without much deviation from the trend.</p>
              <p>Just my personal opinion...</p>

              <p>what you say is true. but for stocks, i think a bit risky for old people. property, not many people can afford to get multiple properties, and those who can, are most likely not going to be very affected by the sum taken for CPF LIFE.</p>
              <p>is like 1 hdb unit can cost 250k? the sum taken for CPF LIFE is at most 106k. and not to mention the possibility of getting lower rents and having to pay a higher installment for the house.</p>
              <p>i think for property is more of capital appreciation and income generation. depending on income generation alone might be a little risky, as if the property market falls, the person might not live long enough to wait for it to go up again. but if there is intention to hand down the property to the kids then different story le, which probably means the guy is rich enough and no need to depend on his kids and thus most likely not going to be affected by LIFE.</p>

              <p>nice insights from bladez87 and maxtor there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but how much bequest be it low medium high, the formula is undisclosed yet. And I cant imagine living in a place where I work hard for 40 years only to have my CPF locked inside till i die.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CPF life has good interest rates no doubt but they are non-guaranteed. And this CPF life plan doesnt factor inflation into it. $500 today is peanuts 30 years later.</p>

              <p>I reckon in another 10 years time, they will tweak the scheme again with another scheme to lock in more of your money.</p>
