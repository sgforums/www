              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by maxtor:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Back to my attempt at explaining this whole CPF thing -</p>
              <p>The example I have given was an ideal one - where one has enough money in his/her CPF account to put aside for the Minimum Sum Scheme and still have cash to withdraw.</p>
              <p>However the truth is, alot of us do not have this kind of money in our CPF. Why is this so? Remember - alot of us use our CPF to purchase our property (and property prices are very high in Singapore). Another reason is, we only contribute CPF from our monthly salary of up to S$4500. I will use an example to illustrate this.</p>
              <p>Say for example you are making $4500 a month, your CPF contribution is :-</p>
              <p>$4500 x 20% = $900 ( your CPF contribution)</p>
              <p>$4500 x 14.5% = $652.50 (Employer's contribution)</p>
              <p>Total CPF Contribution = $900 + $652.50 = $1552.50</p>
              <p>This $1552.50 will be split between your CPF-OA, CPF-SA and your CPF-MS. This percentage differs with age. For more information on allocation rates, see</p>
              <p>http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/Employers/Gen-Info/cpf-Contri/ContriRa.htm</p>
              <p>EVEN if you make $5000 a month, $6000 a month, $20 000 a month, your CPF contribution stays at $1552.50. This is to reduce the burden on employer contribution. Now imagine if your property cost $400 000 (Assume: HDB Resale 4 Rm in mature estate), how much will you be left with after paying for your property?</p>
              <p>So a more realistic scenario for your CPF Account when you are 55 years should look abit like this -</p>
              <p>CPF-OA          CPF-SA                 CPF-MS</p>
              <p>$50 000          $30 000                  $30 000</p>
              <p>With the above figures, how are you going to make up your Minimum Sum? The answer is - you are allowed to use  your property to make what is known as a property pledge.</p>
              <p>Using the above example - a 4 Rm HDB Resale flat at $400 000, you are allowed to use 50% of the Minimum Sum as a property pledge.</p>
              <p>Since you can use 50% of $117 000 = $58 500 as a property pledge, your CPF account should now look like this :-</p>
              <p>CPF-OA          CPF-SA                CPF-MA               CPF-RA</p>
              <p>$21 500               $0                    $30 000               $58 500 (property pledge)</p>
              <p>                                                                                       $30 000 (CPF-SA)</p>
              <p>                                                                                        $28 500 (CPF-OA)</p>
              <p>This mans that you can withdraw $21 500 as cash when you turn 55 this year (2009).</p>

              <p>inflation has been factored in. in a way the interest rates they give you are a counter to the inflation rates. it is good compared to private sectors but catch is you dont really see it until later on. for the basic and balanced plans.</p>
              <p>the interest private sectors give for annuities really cannot match up to inflation.</p>

              <p>no doubt a lot of insurance policies do not guarantee the rates of return but these financial institution are after all profit making entities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have 4 million Singapore and PRs who contribute to the CPF fund, surely they have the leverage to offer guaranteed rates for their citizens?

              <p>there annuity plans that are so called inflation adjusted, just that the initial payout is low and gradually increases per year.</p>
              <p>example of inflation adjusted annuity of sum 600.</p>
              <p>1st year, 100, 2nd year 200, 3rd 300.</p>
              <p>example of fixed annuity payout of sum 600.</p>
              <p>200 200 200.</p>
              <p>lets put it this way. you put in the minimum sum of 106k. if the sum of all payouts and refund is 106k then yes, your minimum sum has not factored in inflation. however , if u do calculate the payouts , you will arrive at a sum that is higher than 106k. because of the interest given. the interest will result in a higher amount of bequest for your beneficiaries. and yes, this is my own interpretation.</p>

              <p><br>It's a contract and can it be reviewed as and when possible? The principal amount remains the same. And if you say adjustments will be made to the minimum sum, that is already a surety but only for the future and <strong>new</strong> entries into CPF life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we talk about payout, it is understood that the rate of return has been factored in. No annuity will indicate otherwise. Well, I leave u to ur own interpretation.</p>

              <p>Let's look at it this way.</p>
              <p>No system is perfect.</p>
              <p>Do you prefer an egalitarian society whereby a worker pays 40% tax ontop of various VAT/GST, and never see a dime returned when you grow old?</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>Contribute 20% to a fund pool, and when you grow old, you get the total sum + interest back? And such funds in the meantime can help provide for social spending?</p>
              <p>Mankind is not facing extinction, and national administrators will always seek ways and means to provide for all, so that none gets left behind, provided everyone in a society do their part, each generation contributing meaningfully till they retire, followed by the next.</p>
              <p>Therefore, think wisely. Whatever country one goes to, there is NO FREE LUNCH. At least in your home, you get to decide the dishes as a consensual majority, elsewhere you have no say in whatever dishes served. </p>

              <p>Some of the stupid ones end up much worse. They will erroneously think that overseas means more taxes, expensive goods &amp; services. They should look at overseas life from a foreign citizen's perspective. I do agree that taxes, goods and services do cost more, but then the citizen also made much more compared to Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>so many go australia, usa and europe and dowan to come back. Those below 20 come back because of NS, those who have finished NS find the quality of life there better.</p>

              <p>Official stats is that less than a 1000 give up citizenship every year. That is like 0.003% of the Singaporean populace. Why is the govt so worried? I suspect the actual figure to be much higher.</p>
