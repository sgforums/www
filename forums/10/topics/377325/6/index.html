              <p>I believe the max payout option has a clause that they will pay

              <p>Meaning all your CPF money goes back into the pool - assuming
              100k, that's lot of CPF money you forego just like that.  I am
              seriously curious as to how many people want to bet their CPF money
              by taking this option. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>it is highly unlikely for so many people to live beyond 85. yes, the life expectancy of people have rise with the advance of technology and healthcare, but there's a limit to how long people can prolong their life.</p>
              <p>in the past, those elderlies born before the 50s, they mostly live in kampong and led simple lives. no msg, no pollutants etc. with better healthcare, it is reasonable for them to live till their 80s.</p>
              <p>but for our generation, growing up on fast food, coke, msg, chemical pollutants etc, we are already seeing some old-age diseases in our youths, ie. arthritis, hypertension, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, diseases which were once associated with only the elderly. with this in mind, do you think we will live longer than our parents' generation? unlikely.</p>
              <p>thus, it is highly probable that the government will stand to profit from the cpf life scheme with more people dying before collecting payouts. since the amount of money pledged will not go to the beneficiaries, the money will go to the government instead.</p>
              <p>so instead of acting as a guardian of our savings, the government has transited into an organisation eyeing the hard-earned savings of our citizens.</p>
