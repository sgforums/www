I travel to Malaysia very often (~20 times a year) since my dad stays there (Not JB). You always get jam on the causeway one, but sometimes Singapore side smooth, Malaysia side kenna stuck. Sometimes, Malaysia side smooth, Singapore side kenna stuck. So, like they alternate play games want to reduce traffic like that one.<br><br>You see, I always see both side also got empty booth never open even during the high peak hours. Sometimes really suspect both the government actually pa gart together want to reduce traffic. Then play games officially together say this say that. Then the bridge thing also obviously stupid idea, traffic so heavy liao still think of having a bridge that can open up. Siao. Even I know not practical.
