Not those tanker or container liner. Futhermore it is hazzardous if ship are that close to mainland.  pollution, accident like sleeping captain knocking into the bridge...etc.<br><br>imagine more than 10 storey high of vessels passing on the spore-malaysia straits that is so small and narrow for them... the view...... so scaring....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: Little Tiger,<br><br>Nope, not from SMRT or government, but just a kay-po. Singapore could gain an imaginary hinterland up north all the way to China if fast monorail becomes a reality.<br><br>Mind you, our small island will no longer be that small if it is well connected by fast trains to many northern cities and countries within hours.<br><br>If our small island is connected to cheaper labor due to mass travels our underground MRT will become feasible. The road causeway can be kept for heavy transport. Such fast speed train will offer greater incentive to Thailand to trade through with more countries through our sea terminal and Trade will grows with Northenn China.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cheap air tickets compared to bus or train, depending on your destination that is. Say if you want to go to KL, taking train or bus is definitely cheaper. Furthermore, the bus or train fare is consistent throughout most of the year, whereas air tickets fluctuates and does not include airport tax, insurance, security tax and fuel surcharge. If you talk about LCC, the later you book your tickets, the more expensive it gets.</div>
