            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is a good country all rite. BUT only if you are rich or have degree. Like me only now with a lousy diploma working temp. Everyday my work a lot and got to rush. Not even much time for a break. And then you see the full time degree holder all so free. Got time to walk aorund and chit chat somemore. Ha Ha. They also don't like me much cause I don't take time to socialise with them. I only work and work. But what to do. I where got like them so free and got so much MONEY.<br><br>To all the poor guys. Work hard to find a way to get rich. Then you can follow what the other succesful low educated people do. Migrate away and occasionally come back to show off and complain. Never mind them say you quitter. Quit quit lor. Whats the big deal. Continue to say in this god forsaken country and be spitted on mei</div>

Notice how those families that  have problems paying their bills usually have 2 or more kids?

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, the cost of living is moving in the opposite direction of our income levels. The "expiry date" of the workforce is getting faster(you're considered over the hill and a liability once you hit your late 30s or reach 40), official retirement age is being raised. Today's Straits Times has a long article/analysis on the falling global birth rate that you might find interesting. Anyone with a basic education and the ability to add numbers will find it hard not to conclude that having children is a pretty bad idea given today's social/economic climate, unless of course you're being paid minister's salaries or mp's allowances with a lifetime pension waiting for you as well. Again, you only need to look around you, the ones that are the most stressed about finances are the ones who have kids, esp if they married late. Its our basic survival instincts at work here thats contributing to the falling birth rate.<br><br>Children=financial liability<br>Opportunity Cost of having children=increased savings, lower overhead, more time to relax and de-stress from work, etc.<br><br>Quality of life issues are very important. Do the policy makers seriously expect Singaporeans to work much longer hours for less pay, pay more for everything, worry about employment once they reach middle age(thats when you're kicked aside to make way for younger and cheaper employees), outsourcing woes etc and still find the time, money and energy to raise 2 kids in the increasingly cut-throat/competitive educational environment which elmininates more than educates? If so I'd like some of what they're smoking, because its obviously very good stuff.<br><br>Something else I want to comment on is the sheer hypocrisy that is at work in Singapore. For all the promotion of "asian/confucian values" by our leaders, respecting age, experince wisdom of our elders etc etc, older people ARE considered a liability by all employers including the civil service. Respect for age is nothing but lip service.<br><br>Malay children do have the benefit of free education up to secondary level if I remember correctly(someone enlighten me if I'm mistaken). Not sure about other subsidies.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by drawer:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey,since u mention this,i have a big question to ask the government.We know that the government keep asking ppl to born more babies,but what i dont understand is that when we overuse the utility,like water or electricity,we will get fined!But since there more family members,the usage of utility will of coz be higher.If the government anyhow fined ppl like that,who will dare to born more children?<br>And education fees,medical fees keep increasing,how the hell is the low income group going to survive with more babies?<br>I have heard that minority races,like Malays,got subsidies if their income is low,dont know whether its true or not?If its true,why Chinese dont have?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by av98m:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, its true. We do end up with the government that we deserve. What the people should do if they really want to send a message is to ignore the "carrots" dangled in front of them before the elections, be it upgrading of flats or share allotments. However I will bet on the same thing happening again. The majority of the people will go for the carrots. Voters in Singapore have very short term memory, based on the results of the last few GEs. It does not help that we don't really have much of an opposition movement here, since most of us are content to complain and do nothing. It may take a very serious economic crisis to wake us up.</div></blockquote>Yes, this is a very good view as people should be discerning and objective in choosing government. If they are easily pleased with goodies and do not look at the whole picture, they may not deserve a good government after all. Finally they will only have themselves to blame.<br><br>That is why, I feel that there is no need to keep singing praises for government. We can acknowedge our praises in a more mature way by expressing opinion objectively to guide the government to do even better rather to help it to become more arrogant or condenscending. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you raise a very good point in the upgrading of flats. by the way some singaporean are enlighten by the recent turn down of upgrading by singaporean in some estate. finally they realise your points.<br><br>recently while in china, i watch a very interesting discussion show on singapore political scene by a china television show. they raise some interesting topic and issue about the political scene in singapore and while singaporean can tolerate and not question the dominance of the lee dynasty here in singapore.<br><br>even foreign Tv show care abt what happen in singapore but our local singaporean are even interested in what happen in our political scene. very very sad indeed. hopefully our generation ppl will rise to challenge the system here and create a new era in singapore politics.</div>
