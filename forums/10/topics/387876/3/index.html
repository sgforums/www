              <p>aiyo, Uncle hit,</p>
              <p>because of welfare and pension, i see many young aussies lazing around, so those hard working immigrant have to work hard, pay tax to support them with pension and welfare, beside aussies are also a racial lots, then like to whack black and brown people after drinking.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, if you work, employers have to chip in 13% of your salary into your pension account, so, in this way, it encourage people to work and not laze around, drinking, gathering and commit crimes ya.</p>

              <p>angel70,</p>
              <p>are u tellin me just because of some gov give people money then they become lazy ?what about spore gov?dun they give u money too????that explains u sitting down and not really doin much werk!!!!money from gov dun really make people laze...its the person within!even if the oz gov stopped givin money to its people they will still laze around and probably die off in process.but oz gov are not monsters unlike silent monster gov dat kill n backstab u silently.</p>
              <p>ausssies are rough nuts..yes....they drink and fight everyday of the week.thats because they have too much steak after dinner and they fight for the pamela anderson chiobu in their drinking places.they fight mainly for dat reason.</p>
              <p>employers chip in 50% also salary in spore not enough  compared to other countries!kiss my ass!!</p>
              <p>pension account in spore.....depends on how much u have in bank account.then that is not pension!!!!!please take out dictionary and read.</p>
              <p>pensions are suposed to be given to u forever even if u have no savings in your bank AND ARE DISABLED OR SICK .main purpose is to enable person to survive DAILY.the singapore meaning of pension is FLAWED AND IS WORTH SHIT only!</p>
              <p>THAT MONEY employer gives IS RIGHTFULLY PART OF the  EMPLOYEE SALARY AND IS NOT CONSIDERED EVEN CLOSE TO ANY PENSION SYSTEM .</p>
              <p>and if u think oz is special then u should look at south korea!they have people who are unemployed and their gov still give them money!!!!does dat make  south koreans lazy too??</p>
              <p>what have u been smoking marijuana ...heroine...speed ectasy....??remember..u smoke them and not slice them up with knife n fork n eat them like steak!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>A) Singapore also has stamp duty, for a S$500,000 property, you are paying S$9,600 in stamp duties. For S$500,000, you can probably get a 4-5 Room HDB in Singapore, but you can get a landed property in Australia. The stamp duty for a A$500,000 (Landed Property) in Australia ranges from A$8,750 to A$21,970.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B) Australia does not have Radio and TV licence, you still need to pay S$110 every year to government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C) There is no property tax for owner occupied housing in Australia, but in Singapore you still have to pay a concessionary rate of property tax to Singapore's PAP government. The advantage of low property taxes in Singapore will be eroded in 10 years, due to Singapore's property taxes. Also don't forget the higher cost of living in Singapore compared to Australia. Electricity, ERP, Medical Services, GST (Australia exempts medication, books and basic food from GST, Singapore is non discretionary).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D) The wage level for Australia is higher than Singapore, Singaporeans make $1,200, while similar job in Australia pays 3-4 times more. You get A$15 for stacking shelves in the supermarket in Australia. How much do you get in Singapore for stacking shelves? This also means that it's easier for Australians to pay for their A$500,000 home compared to a Singaporean. When your salary is 3-4 times that of Singapore, it's justified to have "<strong>private"</strong> housing that cost $500,000. How do you justify <strong>"public"</strong> housing costing S$500,000 when your salary is 1/3 to 1/4 that of Australia's?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's tax in general looks better, but when comparison is taken to relative wage levels and price level, it's a stark contrast compared to Australia.</p>

              <p>and yearly increment is always 10-15% of gross salary overseas ...no performance appraisal or those other sai appraisal found in spore!which means salary would then be adjusted after 1st year which is $7700/mth...2nd year would be $8400/mth...3rd year would be $9200/mth...4th year would be over $10,000/mth!!!anybody given this kinda money in spore would not only wash test tubes but the boss car and possibly the entire factory windows...but in overseas those kinda pay and increments are considered standard issued!</p>

              <p>5 years and whats wrong with all those countries u are in?to work properly make sure u first get a FIRM foothold in any one of the countries u are in!it is like a ladder....u cant climb up further if u  dont have a firm grip of first step on ladder.with firm foothold in civilised countries u would find spore salary is low and uncivilised.u got firm foothold in counrries u are permanently or not???</p>
              <p>why think of spore to work????they never reward u last time what makes u think they will reward u in da future.u got potential to get job all by yourself and werk with overseas people all by your own so setting up company earning $50k/mth is possible.think nothing bout director or CEO etc etc ,just do what your mind tells u to do!</p>

              <p><br>Just tell me, who in singapore is hungry?? we have plenty of food, as i alway said, live by your means, if you cannot afford, dun over do it. Paying bills is part and parcel of life all over the world, not only in Singapore...everywhere you go, you see people cursing their govt on tax and bills, because govt is alway taken as default of all their problems.</p>
              <p>But if we will look at ourselves, where are we now and where are we heading next, what to save and what to spent, how to upgrade, where to learn better skill and knowledge,....where to get the best bargain, we will be better off instead of keep saying these and that....on the govt, which in fact, got no solution to it.</p>
              <p>Just like a storm is coming,...go out collect you cloth, shut the door, call in your dogs, close the window, prepare some hot coffee or tea, make yourself cosy on your favourite massage chair..do all these instead of keep blaming the weather, the storm, the rain, the lighting...etc etc,..which will not solve your problem.</p>
              <p>Most people fail to plan their lives, and end up blaming the govt?? it is fair??? we provide top education, opportunities for all races, skill upgrading, re-skilling and knowledge facilites, job matching agencies, a roof above everyone head, a peace and harmonious environment for you to grow and excel in whatever endeavour you pursue on. What more do you want?? help carry you to bed and tell stories for you to sleep??? please lah..dig your own bait and fish for yourself ya</p>
