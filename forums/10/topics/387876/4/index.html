              <p>chances are that these werkers are even stupider as they cantt figure out money for tomorrows food....if thats the case then they should go back to country of origin.if they dun earn enough money then why stay ina place where they cant survive n ens up eating food for the needy!! pretty soon wspore will be a nation of beggars,vagrant eople in rags from every single poor country ON THE PLANET</p>
              <p>if THEY DO NOT WERK.....THEY DO NOT GET FREE MEALS!IF THEY DO NOT WERK ENOUGH....THEY WILL DIE.construction werkers with inda diet will never build a wall or concrete complexes like in china!those diet has not enpughmeat to build a wall in time!</p>
              <p>in china all their construction workers wear grey uniform ,wear crash helmets and are clean shaven.</p>
              <p>are u sure those people in temple are construction workers and not homeless people from china ,india and afghanistan?they dont lookmlike construction werkers and those temple diet cant make them werk enough...so what are they eating for and what are they building with that kinda meagre diet!??</p>

              <p>why think of spore to work????they never reward u last time what makes u think they will reward u in da future.u got potential to get job all by yourself and werk with overseas people all by your own so setting up company earning $50k/mth is possible.think nothing bout director or CEO etc etc ,just do what your mind tells u to do!</p>

              <p>I used to be involved in Perth's Chinese print media, but my publication ceased lately due to boardroom conflicts. Recently allpied for a position at Dimensions International College via Jobstreet. Hopefully, I can get that job, but I am worried about relocation expenses. My family are still living in SG, but they are not particularly well-off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other companies I have applied were Universal Media Group (think it has folded. website no longer active) and Faith Community Baptist Church (its corporate communications writer job suited my qualifications, experience and interests to a T).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you know of any creative writing jobs in SG, please feel free to PM me or email <a href="mailto:andrew-situ@insing.com">andrew-situ@insing.com</a>.</p>

              <p>A) Singapore also has stamp duty, for a S$500,000 property, you are paying S$9,600 in stamp duties. For S$500,000, you can probably get a 4-5 Room HDB in Singapore, but you can get a landed property in Australia. The stamp duty for a A$500,000 (Landed Property) in Australia ranges from A$8,750 to A$21,970.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B) Australia does not have Radio and TV licence, you still need to pay S$110 every year to government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C) There is no property tax for owner occupied housing in Australia, but in Singapore you still have to pay a concessionary rate of property tax to Singapore's PAP government. The advantage of low property taxes in Singapore will be eroded in 10 years, due to Singapore's property taxes. Also don't forget the higher cost of living in Singapore compared to Australia. Electricity, ERP, Medical Services, GST (Australia exempts medication, books and basic food from GST, Singapore is non discretionary).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D) The wage level for Australia is higher than Singapore, Singaporeans make $1,200, while similar job in Australia pays 3-4 times more. You get A$15 for stacking shelves in the supermarket in Australia. How much do you get in Singapore for stacking shelves? This also means that it's easier for Australians to pay for their A$500,000 home compared to a Singaporean. When your salary is 3-4 times that of Singapore, it's justified to have "<strong>private"</strong> housing that cost $500,000. How do you justify <strong>"public"</strong> housing costing S$500,000 when your salary is 1/3 to 1/4 that of Australia's?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's tax in general looks better, but when comparison is taken to relative wage levels and price level, it's a stark contrast compared to Australia.</p>

              <p>Hi Beta,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First off thanks for your post and welcome to SC. My points below for your perusal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A) Stamp Duty for $500,000 as of today is $25,070 in AU. $9,600 as you mentioned in SG. Forex lets take it $1.20 SGD for 1 AUD. It can be seen that AU is actually more expensive. B &amp; C are small amounts when compared to the stamp duty to be honest sir.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D) Well its kinda true that the wage in Au is higher than Sg. You should also realise that it only applies to the low wage earners between these 2 countries. As can be seen from a post I made earlier in this thread.... once revenue hits a certain amount I think its $180,000 per annum tax is 45% meaning 45c of each dollar earned after $180,000 is taken by the government. I think Sg does not tax that heavily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next point I'm going to bring in is cost of daily expenses. Food in SG is relatively cheap as compared to AU. Public Transport is also cheaper. So is petrol i <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THINK.</span> I just pumped last Sat and it was $1.27aud/litre for unleaded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another point to take note is the mortage interest %. ANZ is currently offering 6.66%. That works out to about $2750 monthly interest only (no principal) for a $500,000 loan. I think Sg have it better here?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kind Regards</p>

              <p>1 kg of pork is $4.90/'kg on offer....and 1 kg or corned silverside beef is $5.00/kg.they have tons of them in supermarket at any one time.</p>
