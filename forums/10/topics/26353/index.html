            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all airplane buffs out there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> .<br><br>Malaysia is buying superhornets and they will trade in their existing hornets with the new ones. They announced it last week.Hmmmnn what do you think?<br><br>Lower RCS due to revised intake more AB thrust and also better capable radars which can track bogeys further. IRST capability<br>and maritime surveillance. Well for the sure fact the first squadrons in the US navy operational squadrons has alot of praises for them.<br>Well not to forget added weapons hardpoints. Seen it at oshkosh 1999 very big plane bigger than the C model.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure, its got a lower RCS compared to the older C/D versions. If I remember correctly, it has the lowest RCS of the 'teen' series. (-16, -14, -15, -1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> However, with any meaningful bombload, whatever RCS reduction is moot, as external armaments raise the RCS of the aircraft very significantly. The same reasoning applies to the Rafale and the Typhoon. This is why any sales pitch about them having a low or relatively lower RCS signature can, IMO, be disregarded, even though they may be stating the truth.<br>As for Malaysia's SHornets having better radars, that's only of they get the APG-79 radars. However, in the notification to congress, the negotiated sale seemed to be for the APG-73 radar which their current D model hornets are using. I was qute surprised at this(pleasantly surprised, I must add <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ), as I expected them to go for the better radar. Perhaps they used up their budget? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Unlike a russian deal, palm oil is not exactly what boeing might want, i guess...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guys go to www.boeing.com and see the specifications of the F/A-18E/F for further details.<blockquote>Two versions of the Super Hornet are currently in production for the U.S. Navy: the single-seat E model and the two-seat F model. Both will perform a variety of missions including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defense, maritime, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker. Converting from one mission to another can be done quickly and simply by flipping a switch.<br><br>With a total of 11 weapon stations, the Super Hornet also provides warfighters with increased payload flexibility by mixing and matching air-to-air and air-to-ground ordnance. A typical loadout for a self-escort mission might start with an advanced infrared targeting pod, one AIM-120 AMRAAM and two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and an external fuel tank. This leaves six underwing weapon stations available to carry a variety of weapons and other payloads. The F/A-18E/F also carries a complete complement of "smart" weapons, including laser-guided bombs.<br><br>A comprehensive upgrade strategy for the future Â— including the addition of an active electronically scanned array, or AESA, radar Â— will improve overall supportability. Other planned upgrades include an advanced targeting forward looking infrared, or ATFLIR; joint-helmet mounted cueing system, or JHMCS; multifunctional information distribution system, or MIDS; and an advanced aft crew station. These and other enhancements will ensure that the Super Hornet remains combat relevant well into the 21st century.<br><br>The Super Hornet program remains on time, on weight and on cost. Improved aerodynamic design gives the F/A-18E/F exceptional combat maneuverability, an unlimited angle of attack and increased resistance to spins and departures.<br><br>Two General Electric F414-GE-400 engines power the Super Hornet. The F414 produces a combined 44,000 pounds of thrust. Its nine-to-one thrust-to-weight ratio is one of the highest of any modern fighter engine. Increased airflow to the engine is provided through the Super Hornet's distinctive caret inlets.<br><br>The Super Hornet is a versatile, durable and survivable strike fighter designed to meet the stringent requirements of today's air and naval aviation forces. The aircraft has successfully demonstrated its unsurpassed flying qualities during a flawless development program. The F/A-18E/F has proven itself departure resistant and has a reconfigurable flight control system that detects and corrects for battle damage.<br><br>The first production model Super Hornet was delivered to the U.S. Navy in December 1998, more than a month ahead of schedule. After completing the most thorough operational evaluation in naval history, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet entered operational service in November 1999. The Navy stood up the first operational F/A-18E/F Super Hornet squadron Â— VFA-115 Â— in June 2001. The Super Hornet is expected to deploy on board the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) later this year.<br><br>Currently, 284 Super Hornets are on order by the U.S. Navy, which plans to buy a minimum of 548 Super Hornets through 2010.<br><br>Excerpts from official Boeing company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IRST and FLIR is different. FLIR is better suited to searching ground targets, while IRST is better used for A2A purpose. IIRC, its due to the different wavelengths used by these two systems.</div>
