A few of my father's friends earn even more because they are corporate lawyers. The thing is .......SO WHAT?  I also know of people who earn 2-4K per month but who are filthy rich in their own right and hardwork through savings and investing, like the cleaner in my work place who owns 3 houses in her own country. She paid them off ( NOTE : NO HOUSE LOAN)  and she is humble about her properties.<br><br>Thank you for your kind recommendation but I think Gedanken is attached ( I think he says he has a gf) , and I am also attached to someone who doesn't whine so much about his predicament .</div>
