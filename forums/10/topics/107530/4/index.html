It is not that porn is totally unavailable in Singapore. Porn can be viewed on the web, and if you want you can go to Yangtze cinema for adult show. Similarly, it is not that gambling is not available in Singapore. There is Toto, 4D, Big Sweep, Horse-racing, SCORE, etc. The question is whether we should develop it as a tourism attraction.<br><br>I am not in favor or against liberalizing gambling or sex industry. What I want to point out to Singaporeans is that Singapore has reached a stage of development whereby future growth requires tradeoffs. How much are Singaporeans willing to trade off for some economic benefit? In truth, the Govt will decide for you Â—that is Singapore. LKY knows that --- that is why he says if the casino attracts more foreigners, overall we win, but if it attracts more locals, overall we lose.<br><br>Whether we win or lose overall, remember that there are going to be winners and losers all the time (and I am not talking about casino winnings).  It is just a game of musical chairs Â– when the music stops, you may find yourself without a seat. This is the reality of SingaporeÂ’s society; the old motto Â“Govt knows bestÂ” is history. That's why i am cynical when the govt says that its policies are in Singapore's interest.<br></div>

Here's some shocking arguments:<br><br>1. By right, no minors under the age of 18 were allowed into the coffeeshops. By left, teenagers were seen freely entering and buyding the stuff.<br><br>2. Most people who tried the 'soft drugs' sold by the coffeeshops eventually went on to 'hard drugs' which cannot be sold in those shops.<br><br>3. Crime rates soared after the coffeshops were legalised. Coincidence? I don't think so.<br><br>4. Sure, the more 'dangerous' drugs like heroin and crack won't be sold. This will only force the users of these drugs to go underground. It won't stop the problem.<br><br>What's more, crack can be easily manufactured in the kitchen from cocaine if you know how to. No, I'm not a druggie, I read this in Reader's Digest. Even if crack is not sold in the shops, druggies can easily manufacture it from their legally bought cocaine.<br><br>5. Proponents of drug 'coffee shops' claim that the addicts are only hurting themselves. Yeah, right. Tell that to their broken families. Tell that to the woman who was stabbed after refusing to give her son money for drugs. Tell that to those shell-shocked kids who can't go to school because daddy died after overdosing himself.<br><br>Bottom line: Drugs should never be legalised. EVER.<br><br>Don't listen to the Dutch or the Swiss.... they're just fooling themselves when they say that legalising drugs was the best thing that happened to them.<br><br></div>

I believe such a move will help to kill off all other type of drug use (especially hard drugs) and at the same time prevent "innocent" harmless people from getting their life and career ended because of minor drug offense. If we are worried about the impact on the society, we can limit the number and location of coffee shops and only tourist and adult are allowed to patronize.<br><br>If Singapore want to be bold, we must be bold enough to shock the world.<br>If we can have world class entertainment complex, casino, shopping district, legalized prostitution, and coffee shops, i think there will trememdous potential to make singapore one of the must see city in this world.<br><br></div></blockquote>Tourists like singapore because it is safe and it is clean . It is a shopping and eating haven for them. My friends in australia enjoy Singapore because in Singapore they do not have to worry about "druggies" out in the street. Tourists are just transient<br>occupants of Singapore.<br><br>Do the amsterdam coffeeshop and you get your tourist-repellant druggies out there who pester them for money like in australia. No tourists would want to come back again.<br><br>Legalised prostitution exists in Singapore - the sex workers have yellow cards in which they have to go for STD testing to check if they have STDs or NOT. You all can go on about legalising prostitution - POINT IS IT IS ALREADY LEGALISED with health and safety regulations impounded on prostitutes' card and it basically confines them to the working brothels in red light districts NOT SHOPPING CENTRES.  In case you do not notice - social escorts are available in the yellowpages - those are your high class prostitutes without a yellow card- legal on surface - illegal if they indulge in the sale of sex but then again who really knows?<br><br>Singapore is already the must see south-east asian country with a squeaky clean image . Singapore is already the shopping and eating paradise. Why should we spoil this image for the benefits of a few oversexed persons who don't care so much about the social consequences?<br><br></div>
