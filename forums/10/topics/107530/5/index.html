I do not welcome the idea of giving others freedom to wreak my own.</div></blockquote>Do YOU?  Dick.<br><br>as witness said, alcohol and nicotine are tolerated in singapore.  Why?  Because the government gets so much gawddamn tax from it.  So money makes it all good now, does it?<br><br>For example, you notice how airlines tell you that every passenger is allowed say 30kg of check-in baggage for <span style="font-style: italic;">saftey reasons</span>?  Why can you pay for excess baggage to be taken on board?  Basically, the bottom line is "money can buy the airline into looking over saftey"?<br><br>So in the same way, why the hell dont you complain about the government dealing nicotine and alcohol (that are both drugs by the way), to the public?  The government is one big drug laundering company, because without them, the sale of alcohol and tobacco would be illegal.  So basically, though they know its bad, its okay because they get revenue from it?<br><br>So, back to what you were saying, do YOU know what drugs do?  First hand?  Or from books and what you hear the government tell you?  Hmmm?</div>

Most people who tried the 'soft drugs' sold by the coffeeshops eventually went on to 'hard drugs' which cannot be sold in those shops.<br><br>5. Proponents of drug 'coffee shops' claim that the addicts are only hurting themselves. Yeah, right. Tell that to their broken families. Tell that to the woman who was stabbed after refusing to give her son money for drugs. Tell that to those shell-shocked kids who can't go to school because daddy died after overdosing himself.<br><br>Bottom line: Drugs should never be legalised. EVER.<br><br>Don't listen to the Dutch or the Swiss.... they're just fooling themselves when they say that legalising drugs was the best thing that happened to them.<br><br></div></blockquote>Point 2 is BS.  There has been no evidence showing that soft drugs lead to hard drugs.  You probably are getting figures from studies that study people that already have made up their mind about using substances, and start off with soft shit and move on to the harder ones.<br><br>There is nothing that says that soft drugs lead to hard drugs.<br><br>Point 5: Do you want to then criminalize (1)divorce and (2)retrenchment? Look at how many broken familes there are due to the 2 forementioned points.</div>

I really think that Gaz attitude is deplorable by seeing what he posted in the food forum. People are dying in the deadly tsunami and he is making fun of that. I would continue to irritate his ass off. Make him regret the day that he was born.  He would dream of his wife going at ** with all the nerds at his workplace, or his best friend.  I will haunt him down.<br><br>Thank you for your consideration to this message.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Shake_Spear.<br><br></div>
