              Government officials in Seoul have tended to stress that the 66-year-old leader of the impoverished nation is recovering fast and still in control.
              <p>But media reports speak of ongoing health problems, raising concerns about the future leadership of the secretive, hardline communist state.</p>
              <p>The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper quoted a Chinese official saying Mr Kim has been occasionally losing consciousness since April and not been fully able to instruct on policy affairs.</p>
              <p>Mr Kim also suffered heart and kidney problems last year, the paper said, quoting the unnamed official who is privy to North Korean affairs, and has cut back his duties to concentrate on medical treatment.</p>
              <p>However a meeting between Kim and China's vice president Xi Jinping in July in Pyongyang was successful, after he underwent two months of clinical treatment, it said.</p>
              <p>Sunday's report came after South Korea's intelligence agency told parliament last week Kim suffered a stroke but is still able to run the country and will recover, confirming earlier media reports about Mr Kim's illness.</p>
              <p>His health comes amid deadlock in a six-nation nuclear disarmament deal with North Korea and fears the nation, which tested an atomic bomb in October 2006, intends to restart its programme.</p>
              <p>Another report in the Yomiuri Shimbun said the North has not replied to a new US proposal to verify Pyongyang's nuclear facilities, which is part of the deal, the Yomiuri said, citing an unnamed senior US government official.</p>
              <p>The US has not received any direct response to the August proposal, and the US official said 'what we can do is only to wait,' the report said.</p>
              <p>The official pointed to the possibility that Mr Kim may not be able to order a response because of the stroke, it said.</p>
              <p>Mr Kim's health has been the subject of intense speculation since he took over from his father, who died in 1994, in the communist world's only dynastic succession. He has not publicly nominated any successor. -- AFP</p>

              <h1 class="article"><span class="article_main_title">North Korea's Kim died in 2003; replaced by lookalike, says Waseda professor</span></h1>
              <p>Is
                  Kim Jong Il dead? Yes, North Korea’s “Dear Leader” is no more, having
                  passed away in the fall of 2003, writes Waseda University professor
                  Toshimitsu Shigemura in Shukan Gendai (Aug 23-30).</p>
              <p>A one-time Mainichi Shimbun journalist posted in Seoul, Shigemura is
                  introduced by the magazine as a leading authority on the Korean
                  Peninsula. His latest book, released this month, is titled “The True
                  Character of Kim Jong Il.”</p>
              <p>If true, the implications are potentially vast. Among them: former
                  Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s summit partner during one or both of
                  his landmark visits to Pyongyang in 2002 and 2004 was not Kim himself
                  but a dummy—the stand-in Shigemura claims has been fooling the world
                  for at least five years.</p>
              <p>A dictator having one or multiple doubles is a familiar notion since
                  Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was shown to have deployed them. But Saddam was
                  alive at the time. Kim, in Shigemura’s scenario, was not manipulating a
                  look-alike; he was replaced by one.</p>
              <p>Of course it’s fantastic—but in North Korea, says Shigemura, fantasy
                  and reality are not mutually exclusive. “Japanese common sense cannot
                  take the measure of North Korea’s uniqueness,” he writes. “For example:
                  Kim came to Tokyo six times in the 1980s.”</p>
              <p>Then as now, North Korea and Japan had no diplomatic ties. Kim, then
                  heir to the throne under his father, “Great Leader” Kim Il Sung,
                  apparently traveled incognito by ship. His purpose: to take in the
                  magic shows staged by magician Hikita Tenko at the upscale Cordon Bleu
                  show pub in Akasaka.</p>
              <p>Shigemura cites as sources (without naming them) several people
                  close to Kim’s family. He hears from them that Kim’s diabetes took a
                  turn for the worse early in 2000. From then until his supposed death
                  three and a half years later he was confined to a wheelchair.</p>
              <p>Was the flurry of diplomatic activity in which the world saw Kim
                  engaged during those years mere sleight of hand?  The “hermit kingdom”
                  seemed all of a sudden to grow remarkably outgoing. In June 2000 Kim
                  hosted the historic summit with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung. 
                  The following month, he received Russian President Vladimir Putin. In
                  October his guest was U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. In
                  January 2001 he visited China; in August, Russia. In September 2002
                  there occurred the first summit with Koizumi, culminating in Kim’s
                  admission, after decades of denial from Pyongyang, that North Korean
                  agents had kidnapped Japanese nationals.  August 2003 saw the launch of
                  the Six Party talks aimed at North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.</p>
              <p>“Then suddenly,” writes Shigemura in Shukan Gendai, “the pace slows.”</p>
              <p>The second Kim-Koizumi summit, in 2004, lasted all of 90 minutes.
                  Scheduled meetings with other foreign dignitaries were abruptly
                  canceled. Kim’s retreat from the public eye was almost total. State
                  television in October 2003 showed him touring a collective farm, but
                  mention of the date of the visit was conspicuously absent.</p>
              <p>Kim’s family, meanwhile, was in a state of upheaval. His wife
                  died—of breast cancer, said official reports; assassinated, according
                  to persistent rumors. His favorite sister, a high-ranking Communist
                  Party official, suddenly moved to Paris. Her husband lost his post.
                  Clearly something was afoot.</p>
              <p>In the spring of 2006, says Shigemura, American spy satellites
                  succeeded in photographing Kim. An analysis of the photographs led to
                  an astonishing conclusion: Kim had grown 2.5 cm!</p>
              <p>“Recently,” Shigemura proceeds, “someone who was in contact with a
                  Kim family member told me he heard the family member say, ‘There’s been
                  a promise not to decide on Kim’s successor so long as the current
                  shogun is alive.’”</p>
              <p>“‘Shogun’ was Kim’s nickname,” Shigemura explains “If Kim were
                  alive, the family member would simply have said, ‘the shogun’—not ‘the
                  current shogun.’ The stress on ‘current’ seems to suggest that the
                  person in question is someone other than Kim Jong Il.”</p>
              <p>Shukan Gendai asks a government official who helped plan Koizumi’s
                  Pyongyang visits what he thinks of all this. His reply: “Rumors of a
                  dummy Kim began circulating after the summit. Some of us said we should
                  have Kim’s voice prints analyzed. But if we did that and proved the
                  prime minister had been conferring with a double, it could have
                  destroyed the Koizumi administration. So we didn’t proceed.”</p>

              <p>Shukan Gendai asks a government official who helped plan Koizumi’s Pyongyang visits what he thinks of all this. His reply: “Rumors of a dummy Kim began circulating after the summit. Some of us said we should have Kim’s voice prints analyzed. But if we did that and proved the prime minister had been conferring with a double, it could have destroyed the Koizumi administration. So we didn’t proceed.”</p>

              Government officials in Seoul have tended to stress that the 66-year-old leader of the impoverished nation is recovering fast and still in control.
              <p>But media reports speak of ongoing health problems, raising concerns about the future leadership of the secretive, hardline communist state.</p>
              <p>The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper quoted a Chinese official saying Mr Kim has been occasionally losing consciousness since April and not been fully able to instruct on policy affairs.</p>
              <p>Mr Kim also suffered heart and kidney problems last year, the paper said, quoting the unnamed official who is privy to North Korean affairs, and has cut back his duties to concentrate on medical treatment.</p>
              <p>However a meeting between Kim and China's vice president Xi Jinping in July in Pyongyang was successful, after he underwent two months of clinical treatment, it said.</p>
              <p>Sunday's report came after South Korea's intelligence agency told parliament last week Kim suffered a stroke but is still able to run the country and will recover, confirming earlier media reports about Mr Kim's illness.</p>
              <p>His health comes amid deadlock in a six-nation nuclear disarmament deal with North Korea and fears the nation, which tested an atomic bomb in October 2006, intends to restart its programme.</p>
              <p>Another report in the Yomiuri Shimbun said the North has not replied to a new US proposal to verify Pyongyang's nuclear facilities, which is part of the deal, the Yomiuri said, citing an unnamed senior US government official.</p>
              <p>The US has not received any direct response to the August proposal, and the US official said 'what we can do is only to wait,' the report said.</p>
              <p>The official pointed to the possibility that Mr Kim may not be able to order a response because of the stroke, it said.</p>
              <p>Mr Kim's health has been the subject of intense speculation since he took over from his father, who died in 1994, in the communist world's only dynastic succession. He has not publicly nominated any successor. -- AFP</p>

              <p>Also, ASEAN and NKorea have signed a treaty of non-agression.</p>
              <p>There is too much propaganda against NKorea. Actually they are just worried about SKorea + USA, thats all.</p>
              <p>Thats why they made nuclear weapon.</p>
              <p>They dont have any intention or hostile interest towards anyone else. Except maybe historical resentment against Japan. But for that, even SKorea also have similar sentiment.</p>
              <p>For me, the way I look at NKorea, is a little bit with sadness. Mainly due to welfare issues. I hope China and Vietnam can persuade NKorea to reform their economic system abit.</p>

              <p>They dont have any intention or hostile interest towards anyone

              <p>For me, the way I look at NKorea, is a little bit with sadness.
              Mainly due to welfare issues. I hope China and Vietnam can persuade

              <p>If SK indeed has plans to unify the North, the intention should be a good one for no country would be crazy enough to inherit a starving population. Korea should be unified for the betterment of her people but not under the rule of commies.</p>

              across the neck of Manchuria". Then he would have introduced half a
