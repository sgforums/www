            <div class='col-md body'>I teach at the university level and taught in both Australia and Spore.  My students in Aust r diverse - Europeans, Australians, Asians.  My students in Spore r mainly Sporeans, mainly Chinese.<br><br>I'm sorry to have to say this, but I really dislike teaching Sporean students (even though I was born Sporean and Chinese).  The Sporean students that I meet - either in Spore or in Aust - are simply NOT independent in learning and do NOT seem interested in learning.  They come to class for the sake of attendance marking, REFUSE to participate in tutorials and ONLY want model answers.  What's even more irritating is that students like to come up to me only after tutorial and lecture times to ask questions <strong>in order to ensure other students don't learn the extra bits</strong>.<br><br>Yes, I was educated overseas before I entered university.  Although education systems are different across nations, I'm not sure why the Spore system is so unique.  I'm appalled at the prolific number of selfish rote-learners in such a small society.<br><br>Education is about the dissemination of knowledge.  Knowledge should be shared for the good of society.

Students are not encourage to think and to question. Our meritocracy policy has unfortunately caused students to develop an unhealthy fixation with good grades. They believe that memorising the books is the only way to it. To think and to question is a waste of time.<br><br>If you have been reading this forum you should know that there are some who don't like to think and question. They accept anything that is fed to them and would even put up with any inadequacy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember once when I tried to rephrase some of the textbook's definitions just by looking at the units and tieing it up with the rez of what i had learnt..<br><br>Ended up being chided by teacher for veering off course..<br><br>Aparts from that, whenever I engage the teacher in an arguement I could see the popular-waiting-to-get-laid-by-the-jocks girls rolling their eyes at me? The bez response i got was a yawn from the school's jock..<br><br>It isn't entirely the students' or the teachers' fault that we aren't intereactive during classes.. Because they have to produce the results, not for the students but for the parents!<br><br>Nowadays, whenever the child fares badly in school, the first thing in the parents' mind is that the teacher is incompetent, not the child's intelligence and dilligence(blame it on the tuition and crap holiday motivation classes ie money,basically).<br><br>As a result, the teacher has to work towards grades in a short period of time and what better way to do that other than memorising?<br><br>Intelligence in Singapore is grades, established "branded" schools and getting the MOE, Cambridge certified answers.<br><br>Learning is encouraged.. but they prefer us to do it in our own free time..<br><br>Remembered last year, I had this fantastic prof for physics, he neva had answers, we gave him answers by thinking abt the questions he posed in classed.. Learnt that thinking and learning rather than physics are more important</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>because the whole reward and panality system of education here is geared towards that negative behaviour you talked about and reinforced the students such that only through rote learning, regurgitating, model answers and other socially unacceptable actions that they can make it to higher levels of education but for people outside of the system do not understand.<br><br>Whereas, in other countries, perhaps, its geared towards exploration, discovery, sharing and presentation with an ideal to groom better, curious, independent people. Such is not the ideal of MOE that much I can say. And it will not happen any time soon, so don't hold your beathe...<br><br>or you'd turn blue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyways, I did it for survival. Without a good cert in singapore, all the doors are closed to you. So you see, the entire system is geared in this way and it becames social conditioning and a norm/bahaviour trait imprinted onto the society.</div>
