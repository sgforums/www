The losers will be Malaysians and the economy on this side of the Causeway.<br><br>The move has not gone down well in Johor due to its far-reaching implications on the retail, hospitality and property sectors. Visitors from across the border, including Malaysians working there and driving Singapore-registered cars, contribute significantly to the local economy.<br><br>It is a complete reversal of the situation in the north, where owners of Thai-registered vehicles enter the country primarily to top up their empty tanks with subsidised fuel.<br><br>But buying fuel is probably the last thing on the minds of the visitors from Woodlands, who cross into Johor Baru daily. They donÂ’t have to because their tanks are nearly full when they cross the Causeway or the Second Link.<br><br>It is mandatory since February 1991 for Singapore citizens and permanent residents to have their fuel tanks three-quarters full before they drive into Malaysia. This started with the half-tank petrol regulation in 1989, and the move was intended to stop Singapore motorists from giving business to petrol kiosks in Johor.<br><br>Those who breach the rule are liable to a S$500 (RM1,400) fine.<br><br>Hence, the contention that Malaysia is being robbed of subsidised fuel by Singaporean motorists holds no water.<br><br>It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 Singapore-registered cars cross the border every day, and the majority of them are Malaysian-owned. The Malaysian owners are permanent residents of Singapore. They live in Johor Baru and cross the Causeway daily to work in Singapore.<br><br>Under Singapore law, a PR holder cannot drive a foreign car. Hence, the visibly high presence of Singapore cars on Johor roads.<br><br>Admittedly, they contribute to the daily traffic snarls and the squeeze for parking space in the city. But the upside is that they spend their disposable income in Johor, and are welcomed by local businesses.<br><br>They are a major contributor to the local economy as they buy or rent houses and spend a sizeable portion of their wages on shopping and entertainment. Because they are paid in Singapore dollars, they are also less susceptible to the ups and down of the Malaysian economy and are, therefore, a stabilising factor for local businesses.<br><br>Like it or not, the Johor economy is heavily dependent on Singapore patronage and the fear is that the exit levy, if imposed, could result in these PRs moving to Singapore.<br><br>This prospect is real because there would be no savings to be made for these Malaysian workers, and their position is made worse by the daily traffic crawl at the Causeway.<br><br>The levy could also be an irritant for Singaporean day-trippers who frequent Johor Baru. They are price-sensitive and even a mere RM20 for a car load of them could put them off from making the trip.<br><br>And this could hurt Johor Baru badly.<br><br>Statistics showed that some 23,500 Singaporeans visit the city every day, with the Causeway being the main entry point. These visitors spend some RM5.3 million daily.<br><br>Last year, at the height of the so-called "crime wave" in Johor Baru, an estimated one million Singaporeans cancelled their trips, and the business sector lost about RM225 million in potential earnings.<br><br>With that kind of money at stake, the levy could be a case of killing the goose that lays the golden egg.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br></div>

In JB how much do you pay RM1.93? If it is, you save RM1.66 per lit. For one quarter tank you pump 14 lit, saving RM23!! Don't forget you need to drive to JB, using another 5 lits of petrol?

            <div class='col-md body'>atobe, let me just put the electricity issues and perhaps the msian couple retirement plan in perspective.<br><br>to understand better, let's just put it that i have a particular property in msia. and with regards to electricity charges, i know for a fact that i can just bring my floor layout of my terrace, bungalow and meet up with the official in charge of my area and tell him that i would like this particular row of electrical points to be charged "fixed" rates/month. how's that for cheaper electrical charges? does ur statistics on electricity in msia still stand?<br><br>as for msian couples planning retirement...first off, they can own a landed property provided both couples are working and earning around 10K+ or less per couple rather comfortably. that's the msian standard. look at their newly developed "condo" around JB or KL (i'm stating these 2 areas bcos of high demand and turnover), in JB, one unit (condo) is selling at around 90K ringgit...freehold! what in singapore can u get this? let's talk abt a damasara landed unit, retails around anywhere from 250K to 300++ ringgit for a smaller landed unit. is it possible in singapore? thus, home ownership is so much affordable in msia than in singapore. this translate into earlier if not easier retirement planning for the msian couple than for a singaporean couple.<br><br>of course, in between there'll be issues like standard of living and so on...but let's focus on the above and u can see for urself how "easy" it is for a singaporean couple to plan for their retirement in msia and much faster in achievement of that retirement than a msian couple. speaks alot of why msians still want to cross the straits to work in singapore.</div>

not forgetting if one decides to buy these gds, one has to carry these back to s'pore. where's the costs for this freight then? thus, let me assure u that it is definitely not worth to get certain stuff in msia anymore...much less to talk abt fuel etc.</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">It was a relief that you have brought up the subject of exchange rate - but I am surprised that you did not develop this <span style="font-style: italic;">'brainwave'</span> further in your follow-on reply to the subject of NTUC purchases from Malaysia but merely digress into the costs of transporting the purchased products into Singapore.<br><br>Yes, Singapore has the advantage of a superior exchange rate over Malaysia - at the current exchange of SGD100.00 to RM231.50; which increases our <strong>Purchasing Power</strong> when buying Malaysian products.<br><br>In response to your digresssing point concerning the free flow of water in Malaysia, did you consider the investments in infrastructure to draw on the "abundant flow of free water" and to process this water before bottling it for sale.<br><br>On the Singapore side, we are reducing our dependence of water from Malaysia, and turning to the <strong>FREE</strong> and abundant supply from the sea with our Reverse Osmosis technologies, as well as the NewWater from the abundant flow of waste water that <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Singaporeans naturally produce</strong></span>  - from the raw stage to the tap (if that is what you mean with your abrupt inclusion of tap water) .<br><br>But - are we discussing about the water supply agreement, or about the 1.5litre bottled water  - sold in Malaysia for 90sen and in Singapore for 90cents ?<br><br>Are you quite certain that Malaysian manufacturers are <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'out to "chop" a hefty price off the singapore companies'</strong></span> - when they have to compete for the Singapore orders against supplies from Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, China ?<br><br>Do you seriously believe in your own prejudicial ideas that Malaysian manufacturers will practise <span style="font-style: italic;">politiking</span> in the same manner as their politicians - when attending to business transactions ?<br><br>Do you know that a bundle of 10 packs of facial tissue sold at Giant in JB is priced at RM5.80, while the same product is available at Shiong Sing and Mustafa for only S$1.80 ?<br><br>A <span style="font-style: italic;">'premier'</span> pack of 5 boxes of tissues - each containing 200 2-ply sheet - is sold in Malaysian outlets for RM8.60, while the same make is available in the named Singapore outlets at S$3.60.<br><br>Toilet rolls packed in 10 rolls per pack, and bundled in 3 packs are retailed in Malaysia for RM24.80, and available at the named Singapore outlets for S$8.40<br><br>If you will consider both the Malaysian and Singapore prices are inclusive of profits, how much do you think will be the mark-ups on the Singapore side - considering that our STRONG SINGAPORE DOLLAR will allow us to dictate the price based on our ability to give an <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>assured REGULAR, REPEATED and LARGE BULK ORDERS</strong></span> ?<br><br>The same should be applied to that 1.5litre bottle of pure water sold in Malaysia for 90sen and in Singapore for 90 cents - with bulk order that Singapore wholesalers or retailers can purchase with our <span style="font-style: italic;">STRONG SINGAPORE DOLLAR</span>, we should be able to buy in bigger bulk volume than the Malaysian retailer, and hence get a better price from the Malaysian manufacturer.<br><br>Some of our retailers have passed on the savings to Singaporeans, while others will capitalise on the lower costs by making a bigger profit.<br><br>Dr Goh Keng Swee had initiated the practise of building a <span style="font-style: italic;">strong Singapore Dollar</span> by concentrating in what we can do best, so as to be in a position to buy from Others, those items that we cannot produce any cheaper by ourselves.<br><br></span><br></div>
