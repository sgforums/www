            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like the Malaysian Government may not impose the exit tax of RM20 at all. You could see for yourself who were the one who were most anxious in either persuading or trying to get them to impose it!The local TV reporters were seen trying to interview the minister in charge of such levy and he was seen telling them off diplomatically that they have some legal or other matter to sort out.<br><br>The retail sectors, some petroleum companies were anxious about this of course as it has some direct impacts on them. The Singapore custom on the causeway checkpoint has totally stopped looking into your fuel tank while anxiously awaiting the advent of the exit tax on the other side of the causeway!They did not want to be the 'bad guy' to burden you further when Malaysian side takes action. But on the contrary if they check your fuel tank judicially each time you cross the causeway, Malaysian side may not want to take action, so the waiting game continues! Many Singaporeans were seen taking advantage to gamble on the waiting game while the 3 quarter tank rule is still valid! Anytime if you are caught without three quarter tank, you are still liable to a fine of S$500!<br><br>If you study the relationship between Singapore and Malaysia, you tend to believe that Malaysian side WILL NOT impose the exit tax after all. If they wanted to, they would have imposed it during Mahatail's period. Remember there was one MP from Johor kept harping on this issue on many occasions but was turn down each time he proposed it. Mahatail was smart in some way that he had reversed the traffic flow across the causeway when he kept the ringgit low(but not at this low after the Asian currency crisis). Many Singaporeans went across the causeway even when the exchange rate was around 70 sens to S$1, from thence on he was seen trying to woo more Singaporeans in whichever way he could to shop in JB, that was when JB started to prosper. The ups and downs in the relationship were seen years later when the competitions got heated up, especially after the  Asian currency crisis!<br><br>On the surface Singapore-Malaysia relationship looks good but on the contrary, it is not that rosy as many think. The historical baggage is enough to weight them down, let alone the other cultural and economic differences.So, base on all these assumptions,Malaysian Govt may not be interested in your RM20!</div>
