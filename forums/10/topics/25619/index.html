They don't have a core of pilots and aircraft who practice acrobatics and perform at shows fullt time. When theres a show coming that RSAF wants Black Knights to be present, it repaints the aircraft + reserves into team colours.<br><br>When the shows over, at the next major maintenance for the birds, they'll be reverted back to original camo. The last Black Knights appearance was at NDP 2000. Its almost certain all the A-4s/F-16s will be reverted back by now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In AFM March 2002, there is an article on interview with the Singapore Air Force Chief, Brigadier General Lim KIm Choon.<br><br>regarding the F-16A/B , he said this"The RSAF intends to phase out its existing F-16A/Bs. However, it continues to have an interest in ST Aero's Falcon ONE cockpit upgrade since the emerging technologies in the upgrade may have possible and relevant applications on RSAF fighter aircraft, such as the F-16C/D. For example, the RSAF is interested in exploring the new systems, such as the mission computer and multi-function colour displays, to evaluate the effects of man-machine interface(MMI) features and requirements, as well as data integration for an advanced cockpit configuration. In addition, the RSAF sees the F-16 as a suitable platform to examine such concepts for future aircraft configurations".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Consider the large number of suplus stock in USA for A/B model, it is unlikely sg will be able to sell the aircraft away unless we are willing to sell at a very low price which I think we won't.<br><br>A/B version are more agile and therefore more suitable for dogfight compare with C/D version. So IMHO, since this aircraft are the most agile one that RSAF have, they can set up a Top gun school(like the one in US) using this plane as enemy (like the boxer coy for the army). They will be flown by the most experience instructor in RSAF against the trainees.<br><br>Alternatively they can upgrade the plane to F-16 Ace or Falcon one standard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I have said before in my previous post, the best 2 options, if RSAF is to retain them, are<br><br>1. use them as dissimilar air to air combat training - like the USAF's Agressor sqn or the Navy's Topgun.<br><br>2. Upgrade them to the MLU standards and sharing as many Block 52 components, eg. APX-113, APG-68(V) radar - or upgrade to APG-66(V), MFDs, Sidesticks, RWR, etc.<br><br>BTW, found some really interesting article of USAF dissimilar training with RSAF and RAAF.
