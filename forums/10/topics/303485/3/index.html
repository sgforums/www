Who get a better chance ? This is especially so in Civil service.  Look at how they promote the higher educated one...  you mean to tell me those without degree cannot work as good?  Just that for some reason these poor fellows do not had the so call paper qualification.  To be honest, when I lost my job some 12 years ago, I could get the same job back all because I do not have the basic degree. ( I was a manager when I left my previous company) .. ..  this is the reality ..  You had question the credibility of this " walkover" minister...  my answer to you is he got a stack of papers that tell you that he is qualified and who is there to question them ?</div>
