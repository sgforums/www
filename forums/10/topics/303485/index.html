Thus most of the ''not study type'' are pushed into ITE.<br><br>If one day , they change that O level can only go ITE , and those not so good result ones go to poly , i think few year down the road , all elites are fighting for ITE<br><br>The school or MOE draw out clearly themself that ITE is low grade school , and people aiming for high grade school , they keep claiming that student are looking down on ITE.</div>
