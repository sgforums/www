            <div class='col-md body'>Actually they do...they use consultants to gather intelligence on how much employers/businesses will take if they raise taxes or impose a minimum wage. The experience of Europe has shown that if you have a minimum wage, that will automatically become the maximum wage a new employee can expect. To make sure workers have decent wages, you will have to raise the minimum wage to a decent level. But that will mean higher costs for employers, who will have to pay the minimum wage to foreign workers as well.<br><br>The UK minimum wage is 5.52GBP per hour or S$15.50. If you hire a waiter to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks, the bill comes up to S$2480. Pretty decent, you might say. But can the restaurant afford to pay this to its lowest-paid waiters? All the PRC workers will flock to Singapore and there will not be a shortage of waiters. Instead, the restaurant owners will either increase your bill or pack up and set up shop in JB or Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong, our closest competitor, does not have a minimum wage, we will lose out in competitiveness. The luxury restaurants like Les Amis will not have a big problem....your dinner bill may go up from $600 to $650 for two....not a big problem. But the coffee shop owner may have to close shop, because with his clients he cannot afford to pay 2.4k for a coffee shop assistant.<br><br>But maybe the UK rates are too high. Let's use rates in Asia then. The minimum wage in fellow industrialized nation South Korea is 30,160 won or S$46 per day. The waiter who works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month will now cost only S$920. The employer is happy, because he now can reduce the salaries of all his workers to just $920 a month, because that is perfectly legal. It's good for business, but is it good for Singaporean workers?<br><br></div>

Tax rebate..... like if you are working and earn below "X" amt for that year you get rebate of "Y" amt.<br><br>I do see both sides of the coin as you pointed out ... i dunno what will be best for SG im no shooting star like them scholars....but i do now that the current living standard of the low income earners is TOO low  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

While price level maintains the status quo, there will be a decreased standard of living as low wage workers are less able to afford the basic necessities.<br><br>Price levels are always sticky downwards, as a business owner, if there is a business downturn and a decrease in orders for goods. Do you think?<br><br>1) Business owner will decrease selling price of goods to retain all workers.<br><br>2) Business owner will decrease workers to maintain the selling price of goods.<br><br>A good example is Nike. Their shoe production have all shifted to China from USA, but have prices come down or have prices maintain their previous levels.<br><br>Therefore an increase in low wage workers from 3rd world country can only decrease the standard of living for the local low wage workers.<br><br>If according to you, the restaurant owners all pack up shop and set up shop in JB or Hong Kong, there will be an increase supply of restaurants. More restaurants fighting for the same quantity of pie, eventually their earnings will decrease due to the increased competition.<br><br>Restaurants might not do well in other countries, because not everybody is accustomed to the local taste of a particular country. So for a restaurant to relocate overseas is not a practicality, there are other issues regarding tax and business laws. Try setting up a beef steak restaurant in India.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
