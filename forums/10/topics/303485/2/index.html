            <div class='col-md body'>last time , my school also same , the principal said the whole class of us shld go ITE. And the batch before ours , there are ppl who get 6 pts for their n lvl but she dun allow him to go sec 5 because he got some cases. But from what i think , it isn't fair not to promote him to sec 5 just becos of some cases. Although he got case , but he have proven it that he can study , and the principal ain't giving him a chance at all. But now he end up in poly anyway. ok back to topic , from what i feel , if you are at sec 5 , you shldnt be thinking about ITE at all. You shld only be thinking about poly and JCs , because that is your choice whether to progress to sec 5 a not when your n lvl result is out , and the minister of education is telling sec 5 ppl to go to ite? why not he tell those N lvl ppl who get 7-10 pts to ITE? So he reall shouldn't say they shld go ite. because they are SECONDARY 5. and should be aiming to go poly or JCs instead of ITE. And why waste that sec 5 1 more year before u go ite? u can go ite after ur n lvl. and save 1 year right? think about it ppl. i am not saying ITE is not good. It's just ppl mentality that ITE is not good , but actually it's good.</div>
