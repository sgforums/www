Things of the spirit; the development of a human being to his true potential in accordance with his own personal genius in the context of equal rights of others.<br><br>Today, youth is interested in getting paper qualification and, as soon as possible, shoveling gold into their bank accounts. ItÂ’s a different world, even the law.<br><br>I am a consultant here [Drew &amp; Napier]. When I left in Â’78, there were three partners Â– it was supposed to be a big firm; two assistants Â– we were a big firm; 17 staff. This office has four floors. They think that it is a waste of time to use the lift so we have an internal staircase. We have more than 90 lawyers, more than 200 secretaries and I donÂ’t know how many staff.<br><br>The law is no longer a vocation, it is a business. Everything is geared to business!<br><br>Of course, there is this pragmatic development of our country. Ah, our rising expectations of a pragmatic character! It is a fantastic and almost a miraculous development in my lifetime.<br><br>When I was Chief Minister, there were men dying of starvation and because of Â‘beri-beriÂ’. I took my PA [personal assistant] and an Inspector of Police for night at midnight. For two hours, we toured Singapore and we estimated there were two ten thousand men sleeping on the pavements. No homes.<br><br>Today - no unemployment, no homeless. I started this business of building homes for our people. Compare the puny work I achieved and the fantastic HDB homes that are available today for our people. I am deeply impressed and I take off my hat to this very able honest government. Dedicated!<br><br>But I am seen as a critic and I am a critic.<br><br>I am frankly terrified by this massive control of the mass media, the press, the radio, television, antennae, [and] public meetings. You canÂ’t write a letter to the Straits Times; if there is a shadow of criticism, itÂ’s not published. And the Chinese press follows suit. ItÂ’s a very dangerous position because experience proves that no one group of human beings has got all the wisdom in the world.<br><br>I meanÂ… well, two of you are Chinese and one Indian [Ed: actually, the interviewers were one Chinese, one Jew and one Indian]. I donÂ’t know much about Indian history but look at China. You had Confucian authoritarianism for more than 2500 years. What happened to China? She was a fossil. She had to reinvigorate herself with the Western ideology of communism. Another authoritarian ideology! And what was the result?<br><br>There must have been a million decent people who were transformed into vipers, vicious obscene vipers. IÂ’m afraid of this control of the mass media.<br><br>And are youths the miasma of apathetic subservience to authority? But you say to yourselves, Â“Well, you know, what do we seek in life? We seek a rice bowl, full!Â”<br><br>It is full and overflowing, in fact. They serve you your rice in a jade bowl with golden chopsticks; not that it makes much difference to the taste of the rice. But youÂ’re empty!<br><br>YouÂ’ve got technocratic skills and you are seeking more but internally you are empty. Money is your acid test of success.<br><br>IÂ’ve got nothing against money. IÂ’d like to have money myself! IÂ’d like to have a house and a garden and dogs and a car and a chauffeur but, look, IÂ’ve got a flat. IÂ’ve got a swimming pool attached to the flat. IÂ’ve not even got a car but I use taxis. I have a dignified way of life without being wealthy.<br><br>I donÂ’t see the necessity of owning a Mercedes-Benz and a swimming pool and a couple of mistresses. I think weÂ’ve got our values all wrong.<br><br>You know $96,000 a month for a Prime Minister and $60,000 a month for a minister. What the hell do you do with all that money? You canÂ’t eat it! What do you do with it? Your children donÂ’t need all that money.<br><br>My children have had the best of education. In fact, IÂ’m very proud of them. One of them is a senior registrar to two major hospitals in Oxford. Another of them is a consultant in European law to the Securities and Investment Board in the United Kingdom. TheyÂ’ve had their education. There are no complaints.<br><br>I never earned $60,000 a month or $90,000 a month. When I was Chief Minister, I earned $8,000 a month. Look, what is happening today is we are encouraged to and are becoming worshippers of the Golden Calf.<br><br>We have lost sight of the joy and excitement of public service, helping our fellow men. The joy and excitement of seeking and understanding of the joy of the miracle of the living the duty and the grandeur. We have lost taste for heroic action in the service of our people.<br><br>We have become good bourgeois seeking comfort, security. ItÂ’s like seeking a crystal coffin and being fed by intravenous injections through pipes in the crystal coffin; crystal coffins stuck with certificates of your pragmatic abilities.<br><br>What has changed?<br><br>The self-confidence of our people has grown immensely, and that is good to see. Our pragmatic abilities have grown magnificently, and that is good to see. Very good to see!<br><br>You are very able. YouÂ’re ambitious, and the government has heroic plans for the future. It hasnÂ’t finished.<br><br>I take off my hat to the pragmatic ability of our government but there is no soul in our conduct. It is a difficult thing to speak of because it is difficult to put in a computer, and the youth of Singapore is accustomed to computer fault. There is no longer the intellectual ferment, the passionate argument for a better civilisation. The emphasis on the rice bowl!<br><br>Tell me IÂ’m wrong, come on.<br></span><br><span class="small">For further reading click on <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><a href="http://thinkhappiness.blogspot.com/2006/08/meeting-david-marshall-in-1994.html" rel="nofollow">David Marshall's views</a></strong></span><br></span></blockquote></span><span style="color: darkred;"><br>Can you appreciate honest talent when you see it before you; or being a technocrat, will you only mechanically perform the tasks assigned -  suppressing any inclination towards humanity ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>
