Problem with some Singaporeans is that they are quick to blame everything on the government. I've seen countless posts that's anti-PAP/LKY/any authorities.</div>

Maybe not all pple like the type of freedom that he says he's fighting for. If he is to become the government, is he going to force pple to be free? A great deal of criticism about the lack of democracy in Singapore stems from the result that there's very little opposition in Singapore. These pple already perceived that there must be a lot of opposition in the Parliament and anything result contrary to their wishes is not democracy. They simply assume that anyone who hold a contrary view to them are not thinking or brainwashed. Could someone not go through critical thinking and adopt a different stand? By not respecting pple who adopt different stand, how different are these pple from the pple that they are "fighting" against. These pple are not different from the "oppressor" that they are against, they are just oppressors personalties not in oppressing positions. The idea of democracy is to allow different type of pple in the same camp, not to have the same type of pple in different camp.</div>
