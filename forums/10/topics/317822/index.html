              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. The Professor and the very bright student.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Reading the article of the state
                  controlled newspaper Channelnewsasia of May 13, 2008 titled "The
                  Professor and the very bright student" you would be forgiven if you
                  mistook it for a love story of how 2 lovers met, rather than believe it
                  or not, how the Singapore government appointed the young Tamil Indian S
                  Shanmugam Minister for Law in the cabinet.<br><br>You must read this newspaper article to appreciate my point. Internet edition of Channelnewsasia of may 13, 2008.<br><br>From
                  the article, one thing is certain. This young man's entry into
                  politics, his joining a law firm, his being given law cases and
                  ultimately being appointed Minister for Law has all been orchestrated
                  and arranged by Professor Jayakumar the immediate past Minister for
                  Law, both Tamil Indians by the way.<br><br>Please don’t think even for
                  one moment that this whole thing is even remotely related to politics
                  as one would ordinarily expect in a democratic country. The tarpaulin
                  covering on the outside claims it to be a democracy. In the inside, it
                  is no different from the Soviet era Deutche Democratishe Republic or
                  the DDR or East Germany as it was called in the west.<br><br>The love
                  story starts more than 2 decades ago when a young man walked into
                  Professor Jayakumar's constitutional law class at National University
                  of Singapore when the Professor immediately noticed; or rather fell in
                  love with the said young man. Nothing short of love at first sight.<br><br>The
                  article claims that as soon as the said young man, the present Minister
                  for Law walked into his constitutional law class, the Professor
                  immediately knew that that this was the man, or the chosen one.<br><br>There
                  was an unmistakable chemistry in the air. Had the young man been a
                  woman instead, it looks as if Jayakumar, the Professor would have
                  dropped everything and proposed on the spot!<br><br>Since the Professor
                  had no doubt at all that this young man, S Shanmugam was indeed the
                  protégé, like the new found infant Dalai Lama, when the strongman Lee
                  Kuan Yew wanted a name for the future Minister for Law, Mr. S
                  Shanmugam, the new found love of the professor, was immediately
                  recommended.<br><br>There are even more touching passionate encounters in this long love story.<br><br>Professor
                  Jayakumar tearfully recalls during one private moment between his new
                  found love S Shanmugam and himself, when the professor popped the
                  question of marriage, no not marriage, but whether S Shanmugam would
                  join politics; the professor recalls with great emotion and tears
                  almost rolling down his cheeks that he noticed his love, S Shanmugam
                  nearly fell off the chair.<br><br>Although this is not mentioned, I am
                  taken to understand from inner circles, that the Professor immediately
                  ran to cushion his beloved from the fall thereby ensuring the young man
                  was not hurt at all.<br><br>Not even a scratch, thank God.<br><br>Even
                  today, when Professor Jayakumar recalls that moment, he cannot help
                  tears welling in his eyes. The moment was extremely passionate, which
                  Jayakumar cherishes even till this day and swears never to forget it
                  until he is dead!<br><br>Imagine that. It seems when Jayakumar the
                  Professor had asked the question, the young man was surprised why he
                  was chosen. In utter surprise at the question, as was earlier
                  mentioned, he nearly fell off the chair and was rescued by the gallant
                  Professor in the nick of time at great danger to himself!<br><br>One thing is clear in the strange island of Singapore.<br><br><strong>It appears this man S Shanmugam, had no intention of joining politics at all!</strong><br><br>It
                  seems from the article that it was only with great difficulty in
                  persuasion that he was finally made to join politics. <strong>A strange
                  parliamentary democracy indeed where reluctant people are coerced and
                  threatened to enter politics and made to rule over Singaporeans!</strong><br><br>It seems the odd entry into politics of a reluctant candidate was not only in S Shanmugam's case.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly,
                  even the Professor Jayakumar himself, the recent Minister for Law was
                  himself completely averse to politics. <strong>In fact, he himself states that
                  he joined politics with great reluctance and did it as a duty to his
                  country.</strong><br><br>If I could see Jayakuamr, I would tell him that he
                  should have done whatever he wanted and stop trying to imply that he is
                  some kind of a Godsend for all of us. It would have made no difference
                  had it been a donkey instead of him.<br><br>Coming back to the intimate
                  private tryst between the lovers Jayakumar and S Shanmugam, in their
                  meeting of love, it appears that the young man was wearing a hat and
                  there was a ring in the private room and when he was thus provoked with
                  the question of politics, this boy Shanmugam forthwith took off his hat
                  and gallantly threw it into the ring aforementioned. Why he did what he
                  did and did it mean anything, that is throwing his hat into the ring,
                  is a puzzle we will never know!<br><br>It seems that this new discovery
                  S Shanmugam had told everyone in the People's Action Party or Lee's
                  party that his ambition had all along been to become the best lawyer in
                  Singapore. There is no doubt when the members of the said party was
                  thus informed, immediately after he graduated as the best law student
                  in Singapore tutored under the passionate arms of none other than
                  Professor Jayakumar, he was immediately invited to join the largest law
                  firm in Singapore where the lawyers are all Lee's party members and
                  immediately given all the biggest cases, thereby making sure that his
                  ambition was achieved to the letter.<br><br>Jayakumar states that his
                  love S Shanmugam was never too far out his sight and he was arranging
                  for this young man to become his successor when he left the post of
                  Minister for Law.<br><br>It seems, according to the Professor, there
                  was a lot of talk and private discussions behind closed doors as to
                  whether it should be this man who was to be anointed Minster for Law,
                  but his love the professor states unequivocally, he had no doubt
                  whatsoever.<br><br>At the end of this story, the professor tearfully
                  leaves his position he held as Minister for 26 years only to hand that
                  position to his chosen love S Shanmugam.<br><br>I am not sure if
                  Hollywood had gotten wind of this heartwarming love story between
                  professor and student, somewhat in the lines of the Oscar winner
                  Brobeck Mountain, but we will never know.<strong><br><br>And all this has
                  happened in Lee Kuan Yew's definition of a First World Democracy, none
                  other than Singapore. If you are shocked, I don’t blame you.</strong><br><br>As
                  I had said in the past, had it not been for his part the professor and
                  Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore strongman, it would have made no difference if
                  this S Shanmugam was wearing the Tamil sarong, smoking a beedi,
                  spitting betelnut all over the place and frying the Indian pancake
                  "thosay" and stall 231, Tekka Market in Serangoon Road, Little India,
                  Singapore, at $2 a piece.<br><br>By the way, you must read the Channelnewsasia article please.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
              <p><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-professor-and-very-bright.html">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The above piece gives us the answer as to why there are no real political leaders in Singapore, why there is a leadership crisis in Singapore, why Singapore can never advance any further under PAP rule and why Singapore politics and Singapore society is dead in general. And also why people are emigrating to other countries instead of staying on in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Spoken like a person who knows nothing about group dynamics or group psychology.</p>
              <p>Soccer is a team sport, you need players to have camaraderie and team spirit in order to play the sport well. It does not rely solely on individual players, you need to cooperate, pass the ball around avoiding all the obstacles in order to score.</p>
              <p>If all the players don't want to be in the team. Means no camaraderie and team spirit.</p>
              <p>You think Ronaldo can single handedly dribble the ball through 10 players and the goalie. You must be buffoon or something.</p>

              Another minister's post is probably reserved somewhere. Candidates will not be revealed until the time is ripe. 
              
              That in short is our system. No one is a better judge of ministerial material or talent except the holy one.
              
              No one else has the quality of ministers or even CEOs of Temasek or MPs, Parliamentary Secretaries, Political Secretaries, Senior Ministers or Ministers until the power that be himself is ready to bestow such positions.
              
              Where is the HR department entrusted with duties and responsibilities to scout talents if necessary based on practical abilities at getting things done or the buck stops here.
              
              Who else is able to be a leader? He has the catch the eye of the holy and be annointed by him with olive oil first.

              <p>Soccer is a team sport, you need players to have camaraderie and team spirit in order to play the sport well. It does not rely solely on individual players, you need to cooperate, pass the ball around avoiding all the obstacles in order to score.</p>
              <p>If all the players don't want to be in the team. Means no camaraderie and team spirit.</p>
              <p>You think Ronaldo can single handedly dribble the ball through 10 players and the goalie. You must be buffoon or something.</p>

              OM,
              
              It is not surprising the governing party will seize on such news about the opposition to fix them and make them look more foolish.
              
              Actually as leaders government should be more broad-minded and regard this latest news about oppositions voting for PAP's candidates as evidence of greater democracy at work and congratulate them for maturing to the greater benefits of democracy as after all some ruling party members without surprise are also voting for the oppositions.
              
              It also depends on particular qualities of candidates in determining whom to vote as one's MP. If MM Lee is not living in Tanjong Pagar but living in a constituency where the opposition MP has greater quality, I feel certain that as a leader of quality he may also vote for the opposition.
