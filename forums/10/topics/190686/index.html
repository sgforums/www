            <div class='col-md body'>(posted at FBU on 14.5.2006 in reply to forumer who quoted our system is like a tree of integrity and wisdom best able to stay rooted in a storm)<br><br>Precisely, the tree that is rooted strongly in integrity of accountability and transparency will be a much stronger tree that will not be uprooted in the storm.<br><br>If the tree of integrity is based on eliminating opposition and unable to level up to the next level of excellence practised in the first world economies like Switzerland or Finland, will that tree still be called tree of integrity or a tree of firm root.<br><br>Last two recessions witnessed practically that a system based on top-down assumptions called leadership or meritocracy of a few top echelon was unable to withstand challenges posed by the new world order.<br><br>Ministers told the media in the period 1997-2002 that the government ministers could not do anything to upgrade the economy and the people as every thing is dependent on external world economic circumstance.<br><br>The tree of wisdom has apparently run out of wisdom so the widespread unemployments and dropping wages and property values were not blamed on GCT's asset enhancement fiasco but the people once again.<br><br>So every time there is a recession, the tree of wisdom or integrity kept quiet about its own abilities or wisdom but would find some other causes like people must upgrade their own skills. (forgetting to mention that economic rstructuring and skill upgrading based on top-down pro-foreign policies have been tried for years by Spring and WDA without result)<br><br>The high cost problem and the "20 major policy errors of government" as posted to FBU have been largely unsolved to this day.<br><br>One wonder what is the meaning of integrity or strong roots from stronger solutions of problems.</div>
