              <p>I think the reason why you think it will "impair" the Uni development while Dr TonyTan think it will "benefit" the Uni development, is because, the two of you have different understanding and concepts.</p>
              <p>But I trust Dr Tony Tan more.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think the involvement that was mentioned is more towards acamedia/ faculty only. I could be wrong though, not sure whats the details.</p>

              <p>It's alright, cos they just needed dumb Singaporeans to test out their newly developed education collaboration with US and China.</p>
              <p>Unless even the Ministers of Parliament themselves also sent their own children to partake in this 4th University's education collaboration, I don't think it's fair for them to encourage dumb &amp; eager to achieve success Singaporeans to waste their precious youth time like some lab rats. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>But of course, government may tell you all the benefits and advantages, but I'm also sure that the government would also like all Singaporeans to be able to cultivate their own keen sense of judgement and figure out the weaknesses and disadvantages for themselves.</p>
              <p>Afterall, they are smart enough to attend University, they should also be smart enough to have develop an independent mindset to analyse and think for themselves.</p>
              <p>I hope people who attended Universities are really smart people. But so far, I have yet to meet or know any of such people. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>My personal opinion is that it is better not to have another university.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I am worried it will bring unintended consequences.</p>
              <p>It will bring a dilution and dissipation of intellectual resource.</p>
              <p>It is better to consentrate, pollinate, nurture, consolidate, network, and build up a critical mass in a few universities.</p>
              <p>Even SMU is still questionable to me. They could have put the same thing and same program, same faculty, within NUS.</p>
              <p>But no, they separate and become isolationist.</p>
              <p>It also dilute and canibalize NUS business school.</p>
              <p>Is that good thing or bad thing? I dont know, but I have a feeling it will be better if they try to put it within NUS.</p>
              <p>And now they want to make a 4th university.</p>
              <p>I am still not sure whether a very good 2-universities, well integrated, is not a better option.</p>
