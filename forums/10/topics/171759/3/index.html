            <div class='col-md body'>state coroner blasted them implies most probably the coroner's report shows that he could have die from prolonged deprevation of air or drowning, which normally wouldnt occur instantly, but maybe after 5 minutes or so. Perhaps it implies that if the trainers were to be more on the ball, the accident could have been averted, that's why the state coroner blasted the trainers?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>26/07: SAF Training Accidents: Shit Happens?<br>Category: Columns Posted by: Bo Zheng Hu<br>"Besides enhancing the safety culture, the SAF has also improved the dissemination of safety information within its ranks. A knowledge management system for safety information is currently being set up. The SAF is also studying trend forecasting methods to anticipate and address potential safety problems before they arise."<br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean's comments during the Budget Debate 2004<br><br>Oh really?<br><br>MINDEF has been pretty quiet on the recent fatal rapelling mishap at Sembawang Airbase. In that training accident, 1SGT Shiva Mohan and a foreign trooper fell to their deaths during heliborne training on 13.07.05. Since 14.07.05, MINDEF has not released new information on the accident, probably pending some serious bureaucratic redtape paperwork on what accurately happened. This is what we found out in the Internet. Accurate or not? Hmmm<br><br>We all want to know what happened then. Was it human error or a technical fault, since a similar rapelling accident happened before in the early 1990s? According to some theories in the Internet by people in the loop, it might be a technical design in the rope anchor devise that farked things up. From what I understood as the closest thing I did to heliborne rapelling was climbing down a double-decker bed in student hostels overseas, all safety checks were done prior to the exercise. The pin in the rope anchor devise that ensured that a trooper would not plunge down to earth during rapelling was probably not inserted fully. And this is the shit happens part. It was not human error as all SOP were followed to check that the pin was 'inserted' and rope could hold. It was not a technical fault as all SOP was done to check that the equipment was OK. So everyone sadly looked up to the sky and shrugged their shoulders? While the crew and technicians looked around nerviously who might become a scapegoat this time.<br><br>Speculation arose because the SAF has not chosen to comment on the accident. Just like they did not comment on the drowning of 2SGT Ong Jia Hui at Changi Naval Base on 15.06.05 during 'special operations training'. The MINDEF statement said that the case was being investigated and there is no news on it since then. Maybe 2SGT Ong was climbing up the side of a ship and fell into the water, his body armour and weapons dragging him down to the bottom of the sea. But we will never know the truth and whether safety SOP were observed or not.<br><br>MINDEF might give the excuse that full public disclosure of such accidents could breach the OSA. Whatever. Maybe. But it shows that MINDEF is not subtle enough in its PR skills to reveal information without revealing information. Why can't the SAF be mature enough to be more open in explaining to the public?<br><br>The same old story of accidents in the SAF and transparency. Since RSS Courageous, the SAF has been struggling to juggle concerns of realistic training, transparency and accountability in human errors. The public has tasted blood since the milestone RSS Courageous tragedy and goes on a lynch mob frenzy especially if a NSF dies during training.<br><br>I guess you already know that MINDEF does not publish statistics of training accidents in their website. They do not even have a special section on updates on investigations in training deaths. We don't need to hear the results of the inquiry yet. We just want to hear the progress of what is being done. These are sure signs of deliberately not being transparent.<br><br>Sure, training accidents happen in all professional armies. It is a job hazard and I don't deny it. But the more the SAF does not reveal, the more I feel that a particular fatal accident could have been prevented, the more I develop a lynch mob mentality and want someone in the SAF to take the blame, sadly even if a fatal accident was truly unpreventable and genuinely a tragic act of God.<br><br>RSS Courageous and 2SGT Hu Enhuai's drowning were controversially steps in the right direction for the SAF's move towards accountability and transparency. The SAF should improve on it and now give frequent updates on what is happening in getting to the bottom of the recent training deaths. Saying that they are investigating the matter and leaving it at that is no longer enough.<br><br>Comments<br>Rachel wrote:<br>I think they wont release any details from the investigations, and even if they do release any official statements, they may not reflect the entire truth at all. Usually, the results of the investigations are released to immediate family only. Personally, I do hope that MINDEF releases the results of these investigations as public record. The people have the right to know, because some of the injured/deceased are friends and they won't know how or why their friend(s) were taken.<br>04/08 20:30:42<br>Noname wrote:<br>Release details to family?

Do you know how frustrated i am? We are having sleepless nights.. worried.. tensed.. feel as if like we've broken our left arms.. But these SAF officers are just having their normal routines carried out.. How can these people be like that.. Our lives can never be the same again.. SAF can have new recruits every year.. But i can only have one brother in my entire life.. SAF is suppose to carry out safety procedures. My brother is very good at rappelling. He has even done that for last year's national day parade, at other countries too.. He has carried out numerous rappelling exercises.. Why is that so? I dont want the question mark to be placed on my family .. Why are they taking so long in getting back to us? I want a SOLID and VALID reason and not a scapegoat to be blamed in the end.. Just because we are ladies.. Is that the reason why they are keeping things away from us????? Life is very precious and so is my brother and mum to me.

That soldier would not have inflated in any case until it is too late. He's SOF...if he is told not to inflate the life vest, he won't do it...<br><br>Reminds me of an instance years ago during BMT. We had to pass a swimming test...tread water for a certain period without any floating aids. If you cannot tahan you are allowed to stop and swim to the side of the pool.
