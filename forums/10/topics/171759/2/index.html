I remember there were times when the single duty MO was activated to cover an exercise or called up for meeting with HQMC...If the medical centre was not informed beforehand, the duty MO would have no excuse not to attend some silly briefing or other at HQMC or CCO.

They are skilled to do a lot of things, but ultimately, a doctor is needed to do some of the more difficult resuscitative procedures, like treating a case of tension pneumothorax via an intrusive procedure (medics will know what I'm talking about).<br><br>The Senior Medic can do nothing more than provide more advanced stop-gap treatment than the regular medic. He can try to give the more advanced resuscitative treatment, but at the risk of being charged if there are any screw-ups.</div>

He doesn't have anything which may help him cover his a**. Regardless of whether or not the medical center was supposed to have a duty MO around, he had still failed to carry out his duty.<br><br>This is a c*ck-up of the highest degree. No medic covering safety, faulty equipment, medical center not informed... It totally defeats the purpose of having a fully comprehensive TSR if it's not followed at all. By all means, we should give our soldiers tough training, but we shouldn't be killing them in the process.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wanna hear about the time this happened in sembawang airbase, 1st med sq?<br><br>this guy had an eplitic fit while driving. luckily his foot slipped off the accel so the car was crawling along slowly. A CSM from the base happened to drive by n found the guy n brought him to the med center.<br><br>while they were resuscitating him, this old tree at the only road leading into the med center collapsed. so there was no way for the ambulance on duty at the med center to evac the casualty. and then, to top it all off, the falling tree hit someone, and he had to be resuscitated as well. They needed to make an emergency resuscitation table because med centers are only equiped with one as standard.<br><br>Guess what day that was? Its a friday. u can guess the date.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
