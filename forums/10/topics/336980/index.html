              <p>Haha hear this i know one guy who wanted to vote for PAP but when he saw the form he read the instruction wrongly and voted for WP instead.</p>
              <p>Because last time, i almost cross the wrong box. The instrcution says put a "X" for the party u want. but some people may think the "X" is for the party they dont want to vote for because since it is basically a huge cross.</p>
              <p>These are the workings of the normal human mind which have been used to routine and habitual environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reminds me of popular sales tricks in the business world where when u saign up for a product or service terms of conditions. There are confusing tiny text ect where the forms are designed to make u confused and "get over it fast". And these forms change regularly to avoid "familiarity" to rake in the moola</p>
              <p>Same for banking products, investment products ect. <strong>So treat your voting slip as a product and read first before u sign! </strong></p>
              <p>Everything in this world is a business. So be vigilant and alert</p>

              <p>I have studied a Business marketing major in Oz during Uni. and this was one of the points the professor made which really stick hard in my head.</p>
              <p>There are indeed lots of business tricks in the commercial world which many people dont know of as consumers and it pretty much ties in to other things in the environment as well.</p>
              <p>Anothe rpopular trick is the product cycle, well u know that Intel for example releases chips in incremental order but in fact a supercomputer chip which is = 100 Core 2 Cpus is already  been invented in their secret labs.</p>
              <p>But releasing this cpu may not make money for the company  as it will be very expensice initially and as a result is not affordable to the masses and will  come down in cost after a while when none are buying it.</p>
              <p>This business model will mess up their profit cycle and it is the reason for that.</p>

              <p>i remember that during election time, they will run advertisement on TV on how to vote, put on newspaper on how to vote. there are lots of instructions at the polling place on how to vote. the election people there will tell you how to vote one last time.</p>
              <p>the only people who vote wrongly is once again... the civil servents. they election people are more likely to assume they are pro, and give them less assistance, and they might vote wrongly.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is why the PxP is so farked up... the dishonorable behavior, the greed for public money and the lack of competition. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Which is why Dr Chee Soon Juan's cause is so important, to open up the playing field so that it is fair for all-comers..</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Intel can do that because AMD the competitor is also doing the same crapz... coming out products with incremental improvements.</span></p>

              <p>how did the MAS screwed up this time? the last time i've read, even the "smartest" investor would have recommended the Lehman Brother's minibonds as the safest investment one would have made.</p>
              <p>MAS didn't expect it to be a piece of cr*p until the economic went down. let's put it this way, all the guys running the banks are smart "alex's" and seriously, they are the cream of the crops. if they find that the investments and the products they are selling are flawed and eventually will cause the company to lose lots of money, they won't sell.</p>
              <p>who would? also, MAS adopted the "non control" policy in banking sectors. if they have to <span class="dicColor">scrutinize </span>every investment plan, then the banks will complain that MAS is trying to have control and monopoly over their bank's operations. they won't be happy too.</p>
              <p>so truly, you can't please everyone.</p>
