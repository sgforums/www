              <p>how did the MAS screwed up this time? the last time i've read, even the "smartest" investor would have recommended the Lehman Brother's minibonds as the safest investment one would have made.</p>
              <p>MAS didn't expect it to be a piece of cr*p until the economic went down. let's put it this way, all the guys running the banks are smart "alex's" and seriously, they are the cream of the crops. if they find that the investments and the products they are selling are flawed and eventually will cause the company to lose lots of money, they won't sell.</p>
              <p>who would? also, MAS adopted the "non control" policy in banking sectors. if they have to <span>scrutinize</span> every investment plan, then the banks will complain that MAS is trying to have control and monopoly over their bank's operations. they won't be happy too.</p>
              <p>so truly, you can't please everyone.</p>

              <p><br>Pray do not tell me you are one of those fucking RMs mis-selling in banks to hit personal quotas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of these structured products, banks don't lose, only consumers do. Truly smart alexs eh. How much do you understand these anyway before you comment here? Key here is mis-selling, not scrutiny of every investment product. Such structured products do not suit the unsavvy investor and risk profile of the average auntie or uncle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even the smartest investor would have recommended this product? Are you sure? Show me proof that anyone said so when the sub prime crisis was already brewing.</p>

              <p>sorry i took so long to reply. was away for work.</p>
              <p>nope, i'm not working in a bank so i have no reason to defend them. i work in a totally different sector, I.T solution and retail.</p>
              <p>i've never claimed that during sub prime crisis, people were saying that Lehman's minibonds were good. i only claimed that 2 years ago, people were saying that Lehman's minibonds were REAL good. (they said, not me)</p>
              <p>i read an article on Straits Times on minibonds dated (if i'm not wrong) 26th September 2008, (i'm still trying to find that article to validate my claims) that indicated any reputable investment advisor would have recommended Lehman's minibonds as a safe investment 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>you can also read on other forums that others (kamomo) claimed that 2 years ago, Lehman's minibonds were very much thought to be a safe investment. you can read: <a href="http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?p=2311235&amp;sid=43b4884ac6a2e038f9469b9b679261ee">http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?p=2311235&amp;sid=43b4884ac6a2e038f9469b9b679261ee</a></p>

              <p>taken from the webpage:</p>
              <p><em>I may be the only one who thinks Mini and Hi-5 risks were low and fairly disclosed. </em></p>
              <p><em>Consider this: Suppose you are walking down Orchard Road and get hit by a meteor from outer space.</em></p>
              <p><em>Should the Land Transport Authority have warned you? How about the Ministry of Environment? Someone must be responsible!</em></p>
              <p><em>Of course, it is an unanticipated event. It was no one's fault, not even yours. </em></p>
              <p><em>The same is true of Lehman's bankruptcy. It was one of the world's most established investment banks. Who could have guessed 15 months ago that Lehman would be the victim of a US financial crisis?</em></p>
              <p><em>Page 1 of the Hi-5 brochure and pricing statement dated 29 Mar 2007 says Lehman debt is rated A+ by Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P). That's high. The country of Malaysia only got an A- rating. </em></p>
              <p><em>The same for Minibonds. Page 15 of its pricing statement dated 11 May 2007 says, 'Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc has a long-term debt rating of A+ by S&amp;P.'</em></p>
              <p><em>Does anyone really think the sales staff should have told investors: 'Please pay no attention to S&amp;P's A+ rating of Lehman Brothers. My analysis shows Lehman Brothers will go broke.'</em></p>
              <p><em>Even if the sales staff were so insightful, who would have believed them?</em></p>
              <p><em>There is a good reason why investors were never warned of Lehman's bankruptcy. It is because the chances of it occurring were near zero when Mini and Hi-5 were sold in mid-2007. Back then, even experts like S&amp;P thought Lehman was super-safe.<br></em>_________________________________________________________________</p>
