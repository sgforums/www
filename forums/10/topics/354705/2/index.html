              If "gold" can be manufactured, then that thing is not really gold - merely having properties or appearance resembling gold. Brass, copper and "fool's gold" are also gold-lookalike metals. But if you look at its atoms, it's not Au.
                                                                    
              As far as chemistry is concerned, a pure element cannot be destroyed, broken down further or created, as it's already in its basic form.
                                                                    
              Even if gold is alloyed with other metals (like 916 gold), chemistry processes can break down the alloy (or also known as "refine".) gold to its purest form 999 again.

              <p>To whoever it may concern the SGD is not stronger than USD be it by PPP or real terms as the current exchange rate is floating between US$1 to SGD$1.48-1.53. Gold is understandably the best storage currency in times like this and particularly as a reserve currency due to the mounting US$ deficit causing a lack of liquidity for countries holding the dollar as reserve currency.</p>
              <p>However the possibility of a replacement reserve currency remains to be more of a future plan as it will take at least 10 years for the conversion to be complete. Yes there is more short run gold hoarding, but do not forget that gold is not entirely as liquid as holding monetary currency as their source of demand stems from primarily speculative sources and for other investment purposes (or wealth storage). Whereas for the US$ it is still a pervasive form of 'global currency' traded today. Commodity prices are often priced in terms of US dollars.

              <p>Simple economics. When you appreciate the SGD, US goods become cheaper to buy in terms of domestic currency as 1 SGD now buys more goods than previously.

              <p>Dude I din rebuke you, you yourself did. I just pointed out the lack of understanding in what YOU posted thats all. What you posted speaks for itself there was no need for me to rebuke you or whatsoever. And you just made the same mistake again by saying costs rise to make up for the appreciation. It doesnt. Appreciation already cut the prices of imported raw materials etc. which we are so reliant on and thus reduces imported inflation. So where does the cost increase come from? And judging from the support that I get from 4sg (appreciate it man ;)), I cant be that far off actually. At least I know my concepts are sound. 4sg do correct me if Im wrong but I think his latest post just demonstrated his misconceptions again.</p>
              <p>Never did i say there was no inflation. I explicitly said that there is inflation but Im targetting your explanation for its cause. Dont believe me just go look at my post again. Im just trying to tell you that appreciation alleviates inflation, not worsen it.</p>
