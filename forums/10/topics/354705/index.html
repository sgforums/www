              The currency that we have is not REAL money. It's just a piece of printed paper (of plastic in this case) representing a value stored somewhere.
              
              REAL money has the following properties:
              - gains value over time, over recession
              - easily liquidable
              - recognised worldwide for its value
              - rare, limited supply in this world
              - cannot be manufactured/printed more when demand increases
              - will never have ZERO value
              - easily carried/stored
              - is never used up/destroyed, merely transform from 1 form to another.
              - therefore, it is permanent
              
              
              Only 1 thing in this world satisfied ALL the above criteria. *Hint: this thing can be found in the chemistry periodic table.
              
              I'll reveal the answer later...... ;) (I think, some ppl already know what I'm talking about!)

              <p class="Titel"><strong>The dollar debt paradox</strong></p>
              <p class="Lauftext">What
              soon became clear to US Treasury and Federal Reserve circles after
              1971, was that they could exert more global influence via debt, US
              Treasury debt, than they ever did by running trade surpluses. One man's
              debt is the other's credit. Because all key commodities, above all,
              oil, were traded globally in dollars, demand for dollars would
              continue, even if the US created more dollars than its own economy
              justified.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Soon,
              its trade partners held so many dollars that they feared to create a
              dollar crisis. Instead, they systematically inflated, and actually
              weakened their own economies to support the Dollar System, fearing a
              global collapse. The first shock came with the 1973 increase in oil by
              400%. Germany, Japan and the world was devastated, unemployment soared.
              The dollar gained. </p>
              <p class="Lauftext"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This
              Dollar System is the real source of a global inflation which we have
              witnessed in Europe and worldwide since 1971. </strong></span>In the years between 1945
              and 1965, total supply of dollars grew a total of only some 55%. Those
              were the golden years of low inflation and stable growth. After Nixon's
              break with gold, dollars expanded by more than 2,000% between 1970 and
              2001!</p>
              <p class="Lauftext"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
              dollar is still the only global reserve currency. </strong></span>This means other
              central banks must hold dollars as reserve to guarantee against
              currency crises, to back their export trade, to finance oil imports and
              such. Today, some 67% of all central bank reserves are dollars. Gold is
              but a tiny share now, and Euros only about 15%. Until creation of the
              Euro, there was not even a theoretical rival to the dollar reserve
              currency role.  </p>
              <p class="Lauftext">What
              is little understood, is how the role of US trade deficits and the
              Dollar System are connected. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The United States has followed a
              deliberate policy of trade deficits and budget deficits for most of the
              past two decades, so-called benign neglect, in effect, to lock the rest
              of the world into dependence on a US money system. So long as the world
              accepts US dollars as money value, the US enjoys unique advantage as
              the sole printer of those dollars. The trick is to get the world to
              accept. The history of the past 30 years is about how this was done,
              using WTO, IMF, World Bank and George Soros to name a few.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="Lauftext">What
              has evolved is a mechanism more effective than any the British Empire
              had with India and its colonies under the Gold Standard. So long as the
              US is the sole military superpower, the world will continue to accept
              inflated US dollars as payment for its goods. Developing countries like
              Argentina or Congo or Zambia are forced to get dollars to get the IMF
              seal of approval. Industrial trading nations are forced to earn dollars
              to defend their own currencies. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The total effect of US financial and
              political and trade policy has been to maintain the unique role of the
              dollar in the world economy.  It is no accident that the greatest
              financial center in the world is New York. It's the core of the global
              Dollar System.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="Lauftext">It
              works so: A German company, say BMW, gets dollars for its car sales in
              the USA. It turns the dollars over to the Bundesbank or ECB in exchange
              for Marks or Euros it can use.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">The
              German central bank thus builds up its dollar currency reserves. Since
              the oil shocks of the 1970's, the need to have dollars to import oil
              became national security policy for most countries, Germany included.
              Boosting dollar exports was a national goal. But since the Bundesbank
              no longer could get gold for their dollars, the issue became what to do
              with the mountain of dollars their trade earned. They decided to at
              least earn an interest rate by buying safe, secure US Treasury bonds.
              So long as the US had a large Budget deficit, there were plenty of
              bonds to buy.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Today,
              most foreign central banks hold US Treasury bonds or similar US
              government assets as their "currency reserves." They in fact hold an
              estimated $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion of US Government debt. Here is
              the devil of the system. In effect, the US economy is addicted to
              foreign borrowing, like a drug addict. It is able to enjoy a far higher
              living standard than were it to have to use its own savings to finance
              its consumption. America lives off the borrowed money of the rest of
              the world in the Dollar System. In effect, the German workers at BMW
              build the cars and give it away to Americans for free, when the central
              bank uses the dollars to buy US bonds.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Today,
              the US trade deficit runs at an unbelievable $500 billion, and the
              dollar does not collapse. Why? In May and June alone, the Bank of China
              and Bank of Japan bought $100 billion of US Treasury and other
              government debt! Even when the value of those bonds was falling. They
              did it to save their exports by manipulating the Yen to dollar to
              prevent a rising yen.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Because
              the world payments system, and most importantly, the world capital
              markets---stocks, bonds, derivatives—are dollar markets, the dollar
              overwhelms all others. The European Central Bank could offer an
              alternative. So far it does not. It only reacts to a dollar world.
              German banks destroy the German economy as they rush to imitate US
              banks. T<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he Dollar System is destroying the German industrial base.</strong></span> German national economic policy as well as Bundesbank and now ECB
              policy is oriented on the far smaller export sector, to maximize trade
              surplus dollars, or to the big banks, to attract as many dollars as
              possible...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>a global currency would also stabilize international business. Manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic, for example, would no longer have to adjust to huge changes, such as the slide in the value of the euro from $1.17 initially in 1999 to 83 cents two years ago then back up to about $1.22. The value of stocks and other assets in countries now subject to high currency risks and inflation would also soar hugely as investors became more reassured of values.Another benefit: no more national currency crises, which have riled Argentina, Mexico, Thailand and Russia in recent years. No country would have a balance-of-payments problem or need to maintain reserves of foreign assets, such as currency or bonds, to counter dramatic fluctuationsBut world money has drawbacks too. No single nation could adjust its domestic monetary policy to remedy a specific economic situation. So the Fed could no longer lower interest rates to counteract an economic slump.<br><br>Also, central banks would not be in competition to maintain low-inflation rates for their money. Then there's the question of management<br></p></div>

              there're cases whereby ppl in US buy a house using gold coins only (no cash)! I won't be surprised if gold bars is the new currency. Then again if it happens, it would meant the economy is really more jialat than now!

              Did you know alot of americans are buying gold bullions now? as they are beginning to realise their USD has fallen 98% (1 USD now real value is 2 cents only! - quoted from a US forumer)
