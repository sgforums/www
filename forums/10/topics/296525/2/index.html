Within the peranakan community, there are those who only speak hokkian and malay, no english. Within the chinese community, there are those "chinese helicopters", who studied in chinese schools and speak mandarin and dialects, no english. The poorer singaporeans, especially the old onese, don't speak english.<br><br>when these minorities go to restaurants, will they be served with waiters and waitresses who speak mandarin, malay or tamil? why are the menu not in chinese, malay, or tamil? anybody who think he can shout to get somebody to serve him in his language is expressing his lingual superiority, unfortunately, at the same time, he demonstated his lack of tolerance and his poor unbringing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As a truely multi lingual multi racial multi religious society, true singaporeans learn to accept differences. Differences are there because not all of us understand a different race, a different religion, and definitely not all the languages. If you cannot tolerate people who can't speak english, migrate! huhh...but even in UK, Australia, American and Canada, there are many immigrants from China.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>WE NEED A LAW....that is the greatest joke here.

There are even 3 Indian schools running on India curriculum catering for over 4000 indian students. The parents of these students are here temporary. At least the PRC in Sinapore, try to merge with our students by studying in the local schools.  There is no Chinese International School.<br><br>I am not selling coffee, so I don't care who are here to serve in coffee shops. In fact, I am glad those who are prepared to accept for lower pay to serve so that I dont have to pay more for a cup of coffee.<br><br>I speak and write english and chinese, so I am not worried about chinese who can't speak english taking over my job. I have local singapore, working together with PRC, philippino and indian. Local salaries higher because they perform better and they speak mandarin and english. Are they worried? no because they know where they are good, and when the PRC, the indian, the philippino got their PR, they need higher salaries to live the singaporean lifestyle, they cannot continue to sell cheap any longer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>But woe to those who speak english only. It only takes 8 months to 1 year for a PRC to learn english, by then they would speak both english and chinese.

One of my lunch kakis is Indian-Chinese, looks very Indian and speaks fluent Mandarin.  Before she opens her mouth, the hawkers always ask her in English what her order is.  Another colleague of mine is just like me, non-Chinese but Chinese looking. Both of us face difficulty communicating with the PRC workers.  Some even make fun of us saying things like "Chinese and yet can't speak Chinese".  When we say we are not Chinese, they give us a look like "Right and I'm bleedy LKY!".  Sometimes we purposely order from the same stall as our Indian-Chinese colleague.  The same person who can speak English to our friend pretends he can only speak Mandarin to us??!<br><br>Just yesterday I was quequing to buy nasi padang.  The Malay lady quequing in front of me had difficulty giving her order to the PRC worker.  She turned to me and said "alamak, now even malay stall manned by PRC!".  I know exactly what she means and boy do I share the pain!</div>

Since when the PRC learned to cook nasi padang good enough to sell? or why do the store owner, a malay, a peranakan or a local chinese employs a PRC to face the customers? shock? yes, surpriseed? yes, pain? why?</div>
