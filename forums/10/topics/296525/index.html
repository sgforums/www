Do you discriminate against locals who cannot speak english? Do you hate anyone who can only speak malay or tamil?<br><br>I'm sorry if you're poorly educated or just ill informed. The mandarin taught to the Chinese ppl is the exact same one taught as a COMPULSORY subject to local chinese students.<br><br>When you said, "ker ler", it translates to english as COLA, which is, my dear boy, hardly singularly indicative of coke. Handing you a pepsi was not his fault; It was yours. The person who does not understand a local language is YOU, not him.<br><br>But let's just do away with anyone who can't speak singlish properly huh? Your grandparents probably can't. Hell, a significant number of singaporeans probably can't talk in your imaginary singlish. It's idiots like you who can't even master their basic mother tongue that take pride in Singlish. If you want to treat it as a separate language, have the guts to admit you don't know english. You can't have it both ways.</div>

First of all, there are singaporeans that don't understand english. If this wave of hate you propose does take off, do we lynch them too?<br><br>Then, there's the fact that we chinese singaporeans are supposed to be acting as the bridge between the foreigners and the locals. Just because you suck at your mother tongue does not mean the rules should change for you. I've never seen a local having difficulty getting help in getting their ideas across to foreigners. Just because you're part of the problem does NOT mean you get to make up solutions.<br><br>Finally there's this stupid misguided noble idea of yours to put singaporeans above all else. What is this? War? It's a social problem that YOU can help solve, but refuse to.<br><br>I don't even know why you registered that nick.
