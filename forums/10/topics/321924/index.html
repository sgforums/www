The Nation.</span> <br> <br> Jun 22, 2008
              <br> <br> Singapore is brilliant at self-promotion, says an Australian
              analyst, but it is no financial dynamo. Much of the world has been
              deluded by its hollow roars of success
              <br> <br> Singapore, the modern city-state known for its authoritarian ways
              and conservative government, has a reputation for functional efficiency
              and capitalist success.
              <br> <br> The smallest member of Asean geographically is often touted as one
              of Asia's great success stories - a gleaming city that emerged from the
              tropical swamps under a strict but wise autocrat, Lee Kuan Yew.
              <br> <br> But a fascinating new book by Australian Rodney King looks deeper
              into the "the Singapore Miracle" and reveals that a lot of the city's
              supposed successes are in fact hot air.
              <br> <br> Reports of Singapore being a dynamic commercial melting pot are,
              King says, simply the oft-repeated claims of a government that
              tolerates little dissent, and city leaders who may actually have
              stifled the sort of entrepreneurial dynamism you get in places such as
              Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan and maybe even Bangkok.
              <br> <br> King is a Perth journalist who lived in Singapore for a number of years and worked briefly at the Straits Times.
              <br> <br> "The Singapore Miracle - Myth and Reality" casts doubt on the
              city-state's claims of cutting-edge efficiency, global competitiveness,
              economic freedom and transparency.
              <br> Most Singaporeans are not as affluent as their government makes out, King says in his extensively documented, 500-page tome.
              <br> <br> "Books about Singapore usually praise its achievements or
              criticise its authoritarian rule," he writes. "But few ever probe its
              widely publicised claims that it is a brilliant success that other
              countries should follow."
              <br> <br> King argues that Singapore's workforce productivity is often
              mediocre and well below that of the West and Asian economies such as
              Hong Kong.
              <br> <br> "The country also displays endemic inefficiencies at both macro
              and micro-economic levels. The performance of the construction,
              financial and service sectors is second-rate, while Singapore Airlines
              does not deserve the top rankings it receives."
              <br> <br> Singapore, he says, has "a dependent and underdeveloped economy".
              Multinational companies and state enterprises predominate, and the
              economy has "low entrepreneurial and innovative capacities and an
              under-educated workforce".
              <br> <br> The city-state's supposed affluence is also largely a myth.
              <br> <br> "About 30 per cent of the population still lives in poverty by
              Western living standards," he says. And Singapore's Housing Development
              Board, Central Provident Fund and state-run health schemes have severe
              shortcomings.
              <br> <br> What Singapore has been good at, he says, is marketing itself.
              <br> <br> "Singapore has brilliantly sold itself to the world as an amazing
              success story to attract foreign investment and talent. It's managed to
              get most Western think-tanks and ratings agencies to give it top scores
              for such things as competitiveness, transparency, economic freedom,
              etc.
              <br> <br> "These bodies reflect the interests of foreign capital and their
              methodologies are shoddy and incompetent at times. And the statistics
              they are fed by the Singaporean authorities are often dubious and
              designed to put Singapore in the best light.
              <br> <br> "To sell itself to the world Singapore has also denigrated and patronised its lesser-developed neighbours."
              <br> <br> Singapore was hardly an economic backwater when Lee Kuan Yew took
              power in 1959, says King, who has no special regard for the premier,
              who held office through his People's Action Party (PAP) for 31 years.
              Lee is now known as a "Minister mentor" and elder statesman.
              <br> <br> "Lee is always carefully listened to, and rather too politely ...
              his views and lectures often receive reverential attention from opinion
              lenders, American think-tank experts and others who often have little
              direct first-hand knowledge of Singapore."
              <br> <br> In the early to mid-'60s, Singapore had one of the highest living
              standards in Asia, with one of the best-educated and hardest-working
              populations.
              <br> <br> Its strategic location and magnificent harbour - with extensive
              British-built shipyard facilities - alongside one of the world's
              busiest sea-lanes, meant that it became a natural transport hub. And
              these features were a great asset for industrialisation.
              <br> <br> The strategies Lee used to develop Singapore were an open-door
              policy to foreign capital and export orientation to tap into global
              trade. They helped the city-state enjoy double-digit growth from the
              '60s to the '80s.
              <br> <br> But the Lion City became heavily dependent on foreign capital
              while state enterprises focused on infrastructure and "nation-building
              concerns".
              <br> <br> Entrepreneurial and innovative capacities have suffered because of
              a lack of domestic competition and the predominance of state bodies.
              <br> <br> Public servants running state boards often have little experience
              of the private sector "and no idea how to run a business", King and
              other analysts say.
              <br> <br> "The local private sector, normally the seedbed of innovation in
              most market economies, is stunted and starved of venture capital," King
              writes.
              <br> <br> "The country's capacity for indigenous research and development
              and entrepreneurial and innovative endeavours remains limited.
              <br> <br> "Heavy state control of the economy is exercised through an
              extensive layer of state enterprises. The state imposes this control
              through layers of red tape.
              <br> <br> "The government also manages a big chunk of the people's savings
              through forced savings … and owns 72 per cent of the city-state's land.
              <br> <br> Moreover, the government controls the unions and most of the
              labour force. Equally mythical are Singapore's claims to being
              transparent. Nothing could be more untrue. The operations of
              Singapore's government and bureaucracy are swathed in secrecy."
              <br> <br> King counters claims of high home-ownership levels, saying 86 per
              cent of Singaporeans rent government flats from the Housing Development
              Board on 99-year leases.
              <br> <br> The author is provocative but very thorough. Every aspect of life in the city-state is analysed in detail.
              <br> <br> "Singapore's flaws are hidden by the PAP state's vigorous marketing campaign," he says.
              <br> <br> And most local and foreign journalists "are usually too restricted
              or intimidated by government defamation laws and other penalties to
              challenge or refute" the "river of statistics" promoting Singapore's
              achievements.
              <br> <br> There is a wealth of statistical and anecdotal material in this
              book to counter the official lines - or lies. Economists and anyone
              with an interest in Singapore should take note. This book could change
              the way you view our industrious neighbour.
              <br> <br> But, perhaps the saddest facet of King's work is not what he's
              written, but the fact that the people who most need to read his book
              may find it hard to get, if Singaporean bookshops refuse to stock it,
              as he expects. (The Nation, Bangkok)

              <p>Not necessarily true. In our early years, the govt had to regulate land use as to ensure safety and hygiene for us all. If you were to compare HK and Bangkok, you will understand what i mean-haphazard constructions, uncontrolled effluent flowing down sewers, etc, even till today. Many of the largely uneducated entreprenuers didn't understand the regulations and felt oppressed by the social order that was enforced to protect the population.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there wasn't much funds in our coffers to help entreprenuers in the early days. There were many other social needs that must be meet.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, Spore was only a population of 1.5million then. What kind of a market was there for our entreprenuers? Could they have survived by producing what our neighbours already had?</p>
              <p>Thus the govt had to step in and use the land space for industrialization and the people to get a fixed salary. In time when we had grown, only then can entreprenuership be better encouraged, such as current times.</p>
              <p>I too wish there were better ways, but back in the 60s, our young fledging nation had little choices.</p>

              <p>The govt had encourage entrepreneurship and had created agencies to help facillitate the growth of entrepreneurship. They are EDB, IE Singapore, and Spring Singapore. They not only provide funds to help startups, smes, and industries, they also lend management expertise when required. For full details, i would encourage any would-be entrepreneur to check them up. But do be aware, those monies are ours, and these agencies will have to ensure that the money is responsibly spent and not to fund 2nd wives or that new car.</p>
              <p>There are also local venture capitalists whom one can approach. In our country now, there is no lack of encouragement and help. Only issue is, do our citizens prefer the safety of a fixed salary or would they dare venture out? Do realize that if they venture out, the local market may be small to realize extensive profitability. And the overseas market is highly competitive and realitively unknown to those who had not studied or spent a large amount of time to research.</p>
              <p>Our govt understand these, and provides seminars as well as agencies to help and guide those whom are keen and have the intelligence with drive to succeed.</p>
              <p>But if you are talking about importing or exporting 'freedom of speech or freedom to slander', then you are on your own. Our society have other needs that could be better spent on, such as 'freedom from hunger', 'freedom from disease' and 'freedom from illiteracy', if judging from the quality of 'freedom of speech and slander' on this forum is of any value to go by.</p>
