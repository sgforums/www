            <div class='col-md body'>Is the GRC-type of walkover in political trial where the defenders are the weaker party who find it futile to defend thereby giving up the defence a true win.<br><br>There is simply no proper hearing of facts or laws in such lawsuits. Everything is so one-sided. What is the purpose of having a judiciary in any country? It must be for administration of justice isn't it?<br><br>The old jury is the best people to find the facts in any political defamation trial and not the judge. The reason is that the judge is too closely connected to the executive. The executive is responsible for judges' nomination, recommendation and appointments. Some judges had been transferred out after not giving judgment in favor of the executive. The damage done in past such cases were already too ingrained and deeply affecting the independence of the judiciary.<br><br>So all the judges could not be expected to giving finding of facts against the executive. Judges' salaries furthermore were so high that they are only human to tread carefully not to jeopardise their own future promotion and salaries which are administered by the executive.<br><br>If the jury system has not been abolished the executive would have to think twice before trying to start any political defamation suit because they will have to think of the facts more carefully e.g. whether the alleged defaming remarks could be justifications or objective criticism of government.<br><br>The jury would have become a more reliable and objective panel to decide whether the words uttered were defamatory or justifications. For example, if the alleged remark concerns the lack of accountability and transparency of the government refers to the NKF saga, the jury might well find that because of overwhelming evidence of lack of accountability in NKF as found by the Minister himself and the judge in the SPH/NKF case, there might be element of lack of accountability and transparency and the remark alleged to be defaming might even be objective finding of non accountability in running of NKF. But is this kind of finding possible in our present non-jury system of judiciary.<br><br>Unfortunately our jury system has been abolished leaving every thing in adjudication to the judge who will now be totally in charge of findings of laws and of facts. That is known in common parlance as being a jury and a judge at the same time signifying unfairness and injustice by the common people in many countries.<br><br>The leaders in abolishing our jury system has done the people a disservice. They should rethink the restoration of the jury system so that all the citizens will be protected against such political law suits.<br><br>If they want to govern the country with fairness and equity, then this is one move they must make to demonstrate their intention to improve and upgrade their accountability and transparency.</div>
