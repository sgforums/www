              <p>Reuters - <span><strong>2 hours 38 minutes ago</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE, Feb 5 - Singapore's finance minister said on Thursday the economic downturn was worsening and the government may have to tap its multi-billion dollar pool of reserves for another fiscal stimulus package next year.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Singapore was the first country in Asia to fall into recession last year</strong></span> and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam reiterated a forecast made before the country's January stimulus package that the economy could shrink up to 5 percent this year.</p>
              <p>"We are seeing continued momentum in the decline week by week," Tharman told parliament at a budget debate.</p>
              <p>Singapore, a tiny city-state of 4.6 million, last month took the unprecedented step of drawing on its reserves to help finance a S$20.5 billion stimulus package as its economy shrunk for the third straight quarter. [ID:nSP404398].</p>
              <p>Tharman said the stimulus package was sufficient. It will result in a budget deficit of about 6 percent of gross domestic product for 2009/2010 before investment income and the top-up from reserves.</p>
              <p>"There is a possibility the government may have to go back to the president and the CPA in a year's time to seek a further draw," Shanmugaratnam said, referring to the Council of Presidential Advisers. Singapore's president, whose role is otherwise largely ceremonial, is the formal guardian of the reserves.</p>
              <p>A senior politician said on Sunday the government would dip into the reserves only in times of crisis and to pay for welfare.</p>
              <p>"As a general principle, the government must continue to fund such programmes out of revenues raised in the current term of government, not past reserves," former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said</p>
              <p>Singapore's two sovereign funds, Temasek [TEM.UL] and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp, or GIC, together manage an estimated $400 billion in assets. (Reporting by Kevin Lim; Writing by Nopporn Wong-Anan; Editing by Jan Dahinten)</p>

              <p>Nope, but it will be their fault if they muck up the usage of the reserves this round.</p>
              <p>By drawing upon the reserves, they need to ensure that they will be able steer Singapore towards a speedier recovery.  In other words, we fall into recession first, we should also recover first, especially if we were to tap into our reserves.</p>

              <p>Why do u guys just pin point on the few quarters growth or first country into recession?</p>
              <p>Take Oz and SG as a example.The Down Under has been growing at much lower</p>
              <p>rate than SG for many years.So,do u want much higher growth rate for years</p>
              <p>or not first country in recession but lower growth rate for decades?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u calculate the compound growth rate for 10 years than u know</p>
              <p>the big differences for one or two % points growth rate in a year?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SG--1.048 to power 10=1.59</p>
              <p>oz ---1.032 to power 10=1.37</p>
              <p>so SG grew 59 % in ten years ,oz by 37%.</p>

              <p>Why do u guys just pin point on the few quarters growth or first
              country into recession?</p>
              <p>Take Oz and SG as a example.The Down Under has been growing at
              much lower</p>
              <p>rate than SG for many years.So,do u want much higher growth rate
              for years</p>
              <p>or not first country in recession but lower growth rate for
              decades?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u calculate the compound growth rate for 10 years than u
              know</p>
              <p>the big differences for one or two % points growth rate in a
              year?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SG--1.048 to power 10=1.59</p>
              <p>oz ---1.032 to power 10=1.37</p>
              <p>so SG grew 59 % in ten years ,oz by 37%.</p>

              <p>We need to watch out for how the billions of dollars in economic stimulus is being handed out.  Is this given mostly  tp those who know how to exploit these ...with just some $2 HongBao for rest of us..  I am troubled by a report in Channel New Asia abvout a recently announced funding scheme.</p>

              <p><strong>These companies don't need state funding.</strong>...they should be funded by the capitalists who have and are still making big money funding start-ups.   These people are so good at raising capital that they have even persuaded the state to give them some? </p>
              <p>In any case...with the extent of the problem and serious job losses....the last thing the govt need think about at this stage is funding incubated startups. </p>
              <p>Fund people who have lost their jobs and want to start of small business to make a living instead.</p>

              <p>Why not migrate to Israel I believe their economy will be doing great once this global crisis fade away. Its people can  feel relief and lucky that their economy is doing great once this crisis is over......eeerrrr unlike Singapore in my opinion. Stuck with the PAP and the FamiLEE LEEgime.</p>
              <p>can Singapore ride on the next wave of global economy growth? or stagnation is the new growth?</p>
