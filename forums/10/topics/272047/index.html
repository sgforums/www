            <div class='col-md body'>ST latest news<br><br><blockquote>Feer fails in appeal to dismiss defamation suit<br>THE Far Eastern Economic Review (Feer) and its editor failed in its final bid to get a defamation suit brought against them dismissed on Friday.<br>The Court of Appeal, in turning the Hong Kong-based magazine's appeal down with costs, said it saw no merit in its appeal and that they agreed with the previous High Court ruling on the issue.<br><br>This is the third time Feer has appealed against the court's decision to dismiss their bid to strike out the defamation suit.<br><br>Feer and its editor Hugo Restall failed in their first bid last November. They then appealed to the High Court against that decision but were turned down.<br><br>They appealed again and were heard by then-Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon. But he too dismissed Feer's appeal in Febuary in a 64-page written judgement.<br><br>Following Friday's ruling, Feer will have to file a defence for the defamation suit by Aug 14.<br><br>The magazine's editor and publisher Review Publishing are being sued for defamation by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, for an article published in July last year.<br><br>It questioned, among other things, Singapore's reputation for 'squeaky-clean government' and suggested libel suits are used against critics to cover up 'real misdeeds'.<br><br>The Lees' lawyers have argued that the article was calculated to disparage both leaders by suggesting they were corrupt and unfit for office, and that they would sue and suppress those who question them as the questions would expose their corruption.<br><br>In court on Friday, the three judge panel, comprising Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, Justice V K Rajah and Justice Andrew Phang, heard both lawyers for the Lees and Feer present their cases.<br><br>Feer's lawyer Mr Peter Low relied on two main arguments when making his case.<br><br>One was that the Lees had asked the court to extend its jurisdiction beyond Singapore as their claim for damages was not limited to what was applicable here.<br><br>On this point, Judge Andrew Phang noted that the Lee's lawyers had made a declaration stating they had no intention of making claims outside of Singapore.<br><br>Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, representing the Lees, added that his clients were concerned with how the Feer article affected their reputation among Singaporeans and not among foreigners.<br><br></blockquote></div>

Her Majesty's decided to involve legal practitioners in the matter after a trailer was shown, in which she appeared to storm out of a shoot with US photographer Annie Leibovitz.<br><br>Palace sources have been contending that the shot, in fact, was the one in which the Queen was walking into the shoot.<br><br>"The Queen feels very let down," British tabloid The Sun quoted a palace source as saying.
