Why should anyone trust the outcome of an investigation conducted by the interim board which is conducted behind close doors?<br><br><strong>A Committee of Inquiry must be held. One of the terms of reference for the COI must be to determine whether there was any truth by the statement made by NKF Chairman Richard Yong that:<br><br>"...In 1986, it ran out of money, so he (NKF Chairman Richard Yong) and other board members had to make the heart-wrenching decision of who among their 32 patients should continue with dialysis, and who would have to be sent home with morphine to die..." ST, April 2004<br><br>If that statement was truthful, the COI should determine why the Singapore Government and the Minister of Health in particular, allowed some amongst the "32" people "to be sent home with morphine to die". Even without this pledge(see below) by MOH, it is totally unacceptable for patients to be sent home to die just because an organisation like the NKF "ran out of money".</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.moh-healthprofessionals.gov.sg/html/hppin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.moh-healthprofessionals.gov.sg/html/hppin.html</a><br><br><strong>"...However, no Singaporean will be denied access to the healthcare system through their inability to pay." Ministry of Health, Singapore<br><br>At the very least, the Minister of Health at that time should be held responsible for the deaths of "some" amongst these "32" people who were "sent home with morphine to die".</strong><br><br></div>

There is the same talk to use build large unlimited reserves like endowment funds from which to pay out small insignifcant small sums to the suffering people for mere subsistence.<br><br>When it comes to disclosure on alleged lavish spending on all kinds of luxurious community clubs and the 7 wonders there is the same total evasion of accountability and transparency and yet there is no hesitation to quickly paying the surpluses out in the form of billion-dollars annuities and hyper-salaries to its own political elites.<br><br>Given the above-mentioned circumstances will the new board, commission of inquiries or KPMG ever want to rock the boat or return any guilty findings on Durai or NKF? It think it might be another eye-wash like the Nicol Highway case where the negligence of political leaders were never the subject of any queries at the inquiry.</div>
