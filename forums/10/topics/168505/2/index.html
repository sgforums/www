            <div class='col-md body'>More violence. This time it's revenge by the Lebanese community on the white aussies<br><br><img src="http://network.news.com.au/image/0,10114,5086344,00.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2005/12/13/gal1_wideweb__470x313,0.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2005/12/13/gal5_gallery__470x313,0.jpg"><br><br>Part of a news report on the Lebanese gangs terrorising certain parts of Australia:<br><br>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,17551315%255E601,00.html<br><br><blockquote>The scene in the beachside suburb was one of momentary madness as the gangs of men avenged Sunday's riots, mobbing innocent pedestrians and cruising the foreshore and backstreets to attack people, cars and shops.<br><br>One man, simply putting out his garbage on Kurnell Rd, three blocks back from the beach, was hit in the head by a large object. He lay on the ground surrounded by shocked family members as fire officers bandaged his head, waiting for ambulances to arrive.<br><br>On Eoulera Rd, car windows and shopfronts were smashed by groups of youths with sticks and bats in lightning attacks.<br><br>"We were at the beach. Two car loads of Lebs pulled up. They just started smashing cars. We ran for our lives," said local woman Rebecca.<br><br>Another local, Ryan, said he heard gunshots before four carloads of youths smashed the windows of six cars and three shopfronts on the corner of Eoulera and Hume roads.<br><br>"There were four cracks that sounded like a pistol," he said. "They smashed all the car windows and then did U-turns and they all took off."<br><br>Near the North Cronulla Beach kiosk, police pulled over three car loads of youths and made them lie face down on the road. Their yells of "get down, get down" were met with cheers from dozens of locals. Police then turned on the onlookers: "Get back in your homes."<br><br>Police chased suspect cars around the suburb.<br><br>Some motorists were ignoring the road blocks, driving around the obstacles and, in one case, careering into a tree. </blockquote>Not looking good ... even the locals in some parts of Oz are living in fear now. Police and laws are too lax there ... they could learn a lesson or two from singapore here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting commentary that i feel is worth reading ....<br><br><a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10119,17549669,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10119,17549669,00.html</a><br><br>NEW South Wales Premier Morris Iemma has failed to give his state the strong political leadership it needs to put an end to racial and ethnic division.<br>His response to Sunday's riots was little more than a continuation of the blinkered politically-correct approach to anti-social behaviour that has led, in large part, to the current crisis.<br><br>He fails to understand -- or chooses to ignore -- the nature of the painfully deep-seated resentment that led to the shameful, disgusting and despicable actions of the cowardly mob at Cronulla and led to the unprecedented violence in retaliatory attacks at Woolooware, Maroubra and Brighton-le-Sands later that evening.<br><br>The attack on a surf patrol on Cronulla beach a week ago was the notional trigger for Sunday's events, but the tangled roots of anger lie deep within the failed multicultural policies foisted on an unsuspecting nation decades back.<br><br>Though sold with the help of such anodyne ditties as I Am, You Are, We Are Australian, it has long been apparent many people from certain migrant groups -- notably Lebanese Muslims -- neither think of themselves as Aussies nor wish to embrace the extraordinary tolerance identified as a remarkable Australian trait.<br><br>Police Minister Carl Scully's non-performance would indicate that his colleagues acted wisely in refusing to support him for the top job.<br><br>Forming a special police taskforce to pursue those who took part in the ugly attacks on people and property is a better-late-than-never strategy but it begs the question of why the mayhem was permitted to reach the level it did before a taskforce was deemed necessary.<br><br>As with the Redfern riots 22 months ago, and the Macquarie Field riots 10 months ago, the police brass were clearly caught flat-footed.<br><br>Though officers acted bravely, whatever strategy was being employed permitted the mob to access excessive amounts of alcohol, left individual policemen at risk and failed to protect property.<br><br>Mr Iemma belatedly called a meeting of so-called community leaders from Lakemba's Muslim community and from Sutherland Shire with the Community Relations Commission chairman Stepan Kerkyasharian to "send a message to the hotheads".<br><br>But it's a fair bet that real message from the "community" won't be mentioned.<br><br>That message is simple. The community wants to see police act on anti-social behaviour, and it wants criminals to serve real time, not make-believe sentences, for their crimes.<br><br>Though branch-stacking politicians and academics might like to think multiculturalism is all about exotic clothing and tasty kebabs, those residents who have remained in suburbs subjected to the multicultural experiment feel neglected.<br><br>They believe they have had to cope with carjackings, gang rapes, drive-by shootings, the occasional explosion at the football, amplified calls to prayer, and gangs of violent young men who boast that they are proud not to be Australian.<br><br>They have watched newer residents adopt a culture of entitlement and victimhood such that unemployment rates among Muslims are now five and six times those of non-Muslims.<br><br>Not surprisingly, some from Sydney's Islamic community have blamed the violence on what they call racist and irresponsible sections of the media.<br><br>Islamic Friendship Association of Australia president Keysar Trad has long preferred not to face the hard truth but find reasons to blame others for problems that are endemic to his community.<br><br>He is as silly as Greens Senator Bob Brown and those reporters from the ABC and Channel 7 who preposterously tried to use Mr Iemma's press conference to scapegoat Prime Minister John Howard for the beach warfare.<br><br>Just as the noxious Australia First group tried to exploit the tensions for its own racist ends, so too have a number of commentators from the other end of the political spectrum rushed to accuse Australians of being inherently racist and intolerant.<br><br>Stereotyping people of Lebanese descent, as Cronulla yobs did, ignores the long, honourable record of many fine citizens.<br><br>Just ask Governor Marie Bashier, her husband, the rugby great and former lord mayor Nick Shehadie, or Victorian Premier Steve Bracks, to name a few who have contributed greatly to our society.<br><br>Any question of a deep underlying racism in Australia was dispelled almost one year ago when Australians from all walks of life opened their hearts and purses to aid those devastated by the tsunami.<br><br>There is a solution to this violence and it lies in breaking down cultural barriers.<br><br>Those who claim to be outsiders in Australian society must ask whether their isolation is self-imposed, whether they live in self-made ghettos and have made any attempt to accept the culture of the land they have chosen to live in.<br><br>They have no one to blame but themselves, their parents and community leaders if they accept second-class citizenship and an apartheid of their own making.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what happened in Australia is unlikely to happen in Singapore. Not only does the government actively promote racial harmony here, but the law and police is much stricter as well. The youths in Aust only went rioting because they knew the police in australia were real softies. Take a look at this letter, the constrast between the authorities here and in oz is quite amazing!!<br><br>http://dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0,20281,17560765-5001030,00.html<br><br><blockquote>I'm a police officer - and I am scared<br><br>This open letter, from an anonymous police officer, was being distributed to locals in Cronulla yesterday<br><br>December 14, 2005<br><br>I AM a NSW police officer with more than 17 years' experience and I tell you that I am scared.<br><br>am scared to do my job and I don't blame the community for taking the law into their own hands.<br><br>In the late '80s when I first joined the police force, I saw how the old school police did things. I agree there was corruption and things had to change, but what the Government, judicial system and ultimately society did to the police force was just disgraceful.<br><br>In days gone by, if there was a group of hoodlums hanging around intimidating people outside a pub, two 6'2" burly coppers would turn up in a big F100 truck.<br><br>The way they spoke, their stature, respect and how they dealt with these hoodlums gave them real power and not some weak piece of legislation given to them by some reactionary Government.<br><br>If these hoodlums hadn't already run off because they knew what was coming, they would cop a flogging, a kick up the bum, a slap over the head. The young kids were afraid of the police and that's how we controlled and protected the community.<br><br>Fear is the only thing a young male understands. That real power is now lost forever.<br><br>Let's look at how the new police force would handle the same job.<br><br>Firstly, we changed our name to a "service" because it was aggressive to use the word "force". We send two small female officers, wearing silly little yellow caps.<br><br>If we want to move these thugs out of the area, we have a very strict procedure we must follow. We have to announce our name and place of duty. The thug laughs and starts calling us by our first name.<br><br>We have to tell them why they have to move on. We have to warn them that if they fail to move on, they may be arrested.<br><br>If there is more than one thug, we have to do this to each one.<br><br>They tell us they don't speak English, start stating their rights and call their friends by mobile phone to come to the location.<br><br>The process we have just started doesn't work with a drunk who wants to argue - it just makes it more confusing.<br><br>We have to make detailed notes of the conversation and caution them not to say or do anything in case it incriminates them.<br><br>Each time we use a power, we have to tell the hoodlum what it is and why we are doing it.<br><br>From the very outset, they have the upper hand and it continues. They have the real power ... we have pretend power.<br><br>If we do decide to arrest them, we have to be so careful not to grab their arms too hard or wrestle them to the ground because it may graze their legs or rip their jeans.<br><br>The thugs will allege we damaged their phones, took $50 from their wallets, swore at them, put the handcuffs on too tight.<br><br>When they get back to the police station, they complain to a supervisor who now starts to investigate us.<br><br>The whole charging process takes hours in a run-down police station with computers that don't work.<br><br>So we charge them with offensive language, assault police, resist arrest and put them before the court.<br><br>A local magistrate is presiding over the matter. After 30 minutes in court, the charges are dismissed and the recommendations made that the police should be charged with assault and sent to jail for six months.<br><br>We are told we should expect to be sworn at, called a pig and stood over by thugs.<br><br>The complaint and civil action lingers on for 18 months as it goes from the Ombudsman to ICAC and PIC. The thug has got off the charges, winks his eye and smiles at me as he walks out of court.<br><br>That's the justice that we have that goes on every day in many local courts in NSW.<br><br>Can you see why I am scared?<br><br>Do you think I am going to arrest someone, come next Friday or Saturday night, with all that rubbish going on?<br><br>I am going to take my time getting to the job, hope the thugs leave before I arrive and stand there and take the abuse. I hear my commanders saying we will uphold the law to the letter. Easy for them to say, but it just doesn't happen.<br><br>If we were fair dinkum, we would have hundreds of arrests and charges every day.<br><br>Have a look at the promotion system. Junior police being promoted in front of other senior police with 20 years' experience, because they can answer a question in an interview better.<br><br>Everyone is looking after themselves. We are no longer a team versus the thugs. It is me alone versus police management versus the thugs.<br><br>You have seen the quality of our senior police leaders. They wouldn't last long in private enterprise.<br><br>After the stuff-ups of the Redfern riot - an absolute disgrace in operational policing - we heard senior police say "we will learn from this".<br><br>Not a year later, Macquarie Fields. The same mistakes and stuff-ups.<br><br>Listen to the commissioner as he talks. It is all reactionary policing.<br><br>Why didn't Intel pick this up earlier? Why weren't measures put in place earlier? Because the problems have been going on for years.<br><br>The police out there have poor morale, equipment and training. We aren't united as a team - everyone has their own agenda and we are scared.<br><br>We have the weak, ambiguous powers the Government says we have to have and a judicial system that just defies logic.<br><br>I totally understand why young men feel they have to take the law into their own hands. I don't trust, and have very little loyalty in, the police service and the court system. </blockquote></div>
