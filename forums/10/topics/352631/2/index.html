              <p>Israel, as a sovereign country, is bound under UN laws to not attack civilians. Palestine, however, is overrun by militias. Even if Israel cedes most of its territory, the war will still go on. If Israel takes back its sovereignity and all the Jews go to Western Countries, Arab extremists will attack Western Countries. Does it ever end?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then should Western Countries cede their own land becoz of their own Muslim minority? You are saying very senseless stuff here...</p>

              <p>It was a classic setting for international intrigue, a tile-roofed
              villa secluded among fog-swirled trees, ivy clinging to building wings
              clustered around a stunted steeple-like tower. The first group of

              <p>By the time the tense clandestine

                      regarded as a hawk, stated that there was ‘no threat of destruction’
                      but that the attack on Egypt, Jordan and Syria was nevertheless
                      justified <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>so that Israel could ‘exist according the scale, spirit, and
                      quality she now embodies.</strong></span>’...Menahem Begin had the following remarks to
                      make: ‘In June 1967, we again had a choice. The Egyptian Army
                      concentrations in the Sinai approaches do not prove that Nasser was
                      really about to attack us. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We must be honest with ourselves. We decided

                      Sinai would not have been sufficient to launch an offensive war. He

                      1967, gave the order to conquer the Golan...[said] many of the
                      firefights with the Syrians were deliberately provoked by Israel, and
                      the kibbutz residents who pressed the Government to take the Golan

                      a tractor to plow some area where it wasn’t possible to do anything, in
                      the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would
                      start to shoot. If they didn’t shoot, we would tell the tractor to
                      advance further, until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and
                      shoot.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and

              <p>Then he [Ben Gurion] passed on to another issue. This is the time, he said, to push
                        Lebanon, that is, the Maronites in that country, to proclaim a Christian State. I said
                        that this was nonsense. The Maronites are divided. The partisans of Christian separatism
                        are weak and will dare do nothing. A Christian Lebanon would mean their giving up Tyre,
                        Tripoli, the Beka'a. There is no force that could bring Lebanon back to its pre-World War
                        I dimensions, and all the more so because in that case it would lose its economic
                        raison-d'etre. Ben Gurion reacted furiously. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He began to enumerate the historical
                        justification for a restricted Christian Lebanon.</strong></span> If such a development were to take
                        place, the Christian Powers would not dare oppose it. I claimed that there was no factor
                        ready to create such a situation, and that if we were to push and encourage it on our own
                        we would get ourselves into an adventure that will place shame on us. Here came a wave of
                        insults regarding my lack of daring and my narrow-mindedness. We ought to send envoys and
                        spend money. I said there was no money. The answer was that there is no such thing. The
                        money must be found, if not in the Treasury then at the Jewish Agency! For such a project
                        it is worthwhile throwing away one hundred thousand, half a million, a million dollars.
                        When this happens a decisive change will take place in the Middle East, a new era will
                        start. I got tired of struggling against a whirlwind. (27 February 1954, 377)</p>

              <p>The next day Ben Gurion sent Sharett the following letter:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>To Moshe Sharett The Prime Minister</p>
              <p>Sdeh Boker February 27, 1954</p>
              <p>Upon my withdrawal from the government I decided in my heart to desist from intervening
                        and expressing my opinion on current political affairs so as not to make things difficult
                        for the government in any way. And if you hadn't called on me, the three of you, yourself,
                        Lavon and Dayan, I would not have, of my own accord, expressed an opinion on what is being
                        done or what ought to be done. But as you called me, I deem it my duty to comply with your
                        wishes, and especially with your own wish as Prime Minister. Therefore, I permit myself to
                        go back to one issue which you did not approve of and discuss it again, and this is the
                        issue of Lebanon.</p>
              <p>.........<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is clear that Lebanon is the weakest link in the Arab League. </strong></span>The other
                        minorities in the Arab States are all Muslim, except for the Copts. But Egypt is the most
                        compact and solid of the Arab States and the majority there consists of one solid block,
                        of one race, religion and language, and the Christian minority does not seriously affect
                        their political and national unity. Not so the Christians in Lebanon. They are a majority
                        in the historical Lebanon and this majority has a tradition and a culture different from
                        those of the other components of the League. Also within the wider borders (this was the
                        worst mistake made by France when it extended the borders of Lebanon), the Muslims are not
                        free to do as they wish, even if they are a majority there (and I don't know if they are,
                        indeed, a majority) for fear of the Christians, The creation of a Christian State is
                        therefore a natural act; it has historical roots and it will find support in wide circles
                        in the Christian world, both Catholic and Protestant. In normal times this would be almost
                        impossible. First and foremost because of the lack of initiative and courage of the
                        Christians. But at times of confusion, or revolution or civil war, things take on another
                        aspect, and even the weak declares himself to be a hero. Perhaps (there is never any
                        certainty in politics) now is the time to bring about the creation of a Christian State in
                        our neighborhood. Without our initiative and our vigorous aid this will not be done. It
                        seems to me that this is the central duty - for at least one of the central duties, of our
                        foreign policy. This means that time, energy and means ought to be invested in it and that
                        we must act in all possible ways to bring about a radical change in Lebanon. Sasson ...
                        and our other Arabists must be mobilized. If money is necessary, no amount of dollars
                        should be spared, although the money may be spent in vain. We must concentrate all our
                        efforts on this issue ........ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is a historical opportunity. Missing it will be
                        unpardonable. There is no challenge against the World Powers in this ........Everything
                        should be done, in my opinion, rapidly and at full steam. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The goal will not be reached of course, without a restriction of Lebanon's borders.</strong></span> But
                        if we can find men in Lebanon and exiles from it who will be ready to mobilize for the
                        creation of a Maronite state, extended borders and a large Muslim population will be of no
                        use to them and this will not constitute a disturbing factor.</p>
              <p>I don't know if we have people in Lebanon-but there are various ways in which the
                        proposed experiment can be carried out.</p>

              <p>It was a classic setting for international intrigue, a
              tile-roofed villa secluded among fog-swirled trees, ivy clinging to
              building wings clustered around a stunted steeple-like tower. The
              first group of conspirators landed at a French airfield outside
              Paris and reached the wall-enclosed villa in an unmarked car during
              the wee hours of October 22, 1956.</p>
              <p>Later that Monday morning, French Foreign Minister Christian
              Pineau visited his office in Paris, then was chauffeured home to
              switch to his personal car. He soon was at the villa shaking hands
              with Israel’s 70-year-old Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion,
              eye-patched Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan and Defense Ministry
              Director-General Shimon Peres.</p>
              <p>British Foreign Minister Selwyn Lloyd, a key member of the third
              group of plotters, called his office in London to say he was
              staying home with a cold. He left England shortly after, to arrive
              at the villa that afternoon.</p>
              <p>By the time the tense clandestine discussions–which also
              included French Premier Guy Mollet and British Prime Minister
              Anthony Eden–ended two days later in France and England,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a secret accord

              <p>This has no link to the current state of tensions between Israel and Palestine. This tripartite pact was to put down Nasir. Nasir had went on a nationalisation spree, even nationalising the Suez Canal. Though they were technically at a state of war(with no ongoing actives at that time), Nasir's act of nationalising the Suez Canal and preventing Israeli registered ships from passing thru the Suez led to much frustration to the Israelis. The Suez Canal was build by the French and British at much cost. The nationalisation of the Suez Canal led to much loss to the European powers. That is why they decided to join Israel.

              <p>As i have said earlier, the Israel Egypt saga has no reference to modern day Israel Palestine problems. Israel and Egypt are now at a truce, have embassies in both countries, tourists flows between both countries, planes fly between cities of both countries. This extends to Jordan too.</p>

              <p>Why are you posting about Egypt if it has no reference to this modern day crisis? It is clear that you are against the Jewish state by all means...</p>

              <p>For years, the Arab leaders have never agreed on anything sustantial to join hands, instead, sabotages each other more often. In the theory of Sun Zi warfare, its stated that, "when a big family is disorganised, even an ants can conqueror it."</p>

              <p>Therefore instead of blaming the Israel and US or UN so to speak, the Arabs or palestian groups should get together to form a solid allies without fear, by then, Israel will be shaking. The Arabs have failed to do it, the Israel took advantages of it, in the muslims world, they called each other Brothers, but are they true brothers??</p>

              <p>Way i see it, these "unlimited supply" of guerilla forces are only dealing superficial damage to Israel.</p>
              <p>It's annoying yes, but the damage is hardly enough to cripple Israel. It's even possible that the Israel politicans even desire it, because it's so much easier to gain votes by playing the "we're the victims and we need to strike back" stance</p>
              <p>I think Israel is in more danger of being overwhelmed by cheap Muslim labourers and immigrants than of any real Middle Eastern Armies. It would be inevitable as Israel becomes more and more urbanised and its birth rate starts to fall.</p>
              <p>Already, birth rates in the Gaza Strip is almost twice that of Israel. And it's surrounded by countries who has far higher birth rates that it has.</p>
              <p>That, i reckon would be the real threat.</p>

              <p>The thing is Israel does not allow immigration into Israel if you(of ancestorial birth - father/mother/grandparents) are not Jewish. Illegal immigrants maybe, but there wouldn't be a huge influx of Arab Muslim labourers.</p>

              <p>Maybe so, but their economy will still need and will demand cheap labour. I find it unlikely they can satisfy that demand through internal employment.</p>
