              <p>Maybe so, but their economy will still need and will demand
              cheap labour. I find it unlikely they can satisfy that demand
              through internal employment.</p>

              <p>Yes. Same situation as Singapore. In need of skilled and cheap labour. But these labourers will not become Israeli citizens even if they work in Israel. Chances are that these labourers are from Egypt(Sinai) and Gaza, crossing the border daily to work. These people will definitely not become Israeli citizens. The Israeli constitution is not fair to them too, just look at the National Anthem of Israel, Ha Tikva. It is a Jewish state and neighbouring Arabs will probably not want to live there. Israel's leaders know their Israeli Jewish community well. They would not want to tip the scales towards the Muslims by increasing the number of Muslims into Israel. That would only create trouble for the ruling government. My thinking is, the most dangerous threat to Israel now is the mad Iranian government and its supporting ally, Hezbollah.</p>

              <p>It's not going to be about citizenship, but the fact that Arabs already comprised about 20% of Israel's population. That's not even including the foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Given the birth rate, it would be inevitable that their voices are going to be loud enough that the government simply can't ignore them. I don't see how you could possibly avoid letting them be integrated into the society that they couldn't possibly be rooted out without crippling the country.</p>
              <p>Yes, they could enact legislation that would slow down the tide but the end result, in my opinion is unavoidable.</p>
              <p>We don't really know what would happen in the end, so naturally i'm just going to have more faith that my opinion would be right.</p>
              <p>I disagree with your opinion that the Iranian government is mad, though. I think they are quite sane indeed. They saw how North Korea avoided being invaded by the Americans and could even extort supplies with their nuclear weapons. But i don't see the Iranians ever using it unless they have no other choice.</p>

Technically in a hush-hush manner, both Iran and Israel have nuclear weapons. Even if Israel does not have nuclear weapons, they will be supported by a nuclear armed USA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just guess the saying holds true. Push a mouse to a corner, and it will fight back with the strength of a lion.</p>

              <p>The Army has let slip one of the worst-kept secrets in the world -- that Israel has the bomb.</p>
              <p>Officially, the United States has a policy of "ambiguity" regarding
                      Israel's nuclear capability. Essentially, it has played a game by which
                      it neither acknowledges nor denies that Israel is a nuclear power.</p>
              <p>But <a href="http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2008/JOE2008.pdf">a Defense Department study</a> completed last year offers what may be the first time in a unclassified
                      report that Israel is a nuclear power. On page 37 of the U.S. Joint
                      Forces Command report, the Army includes Israel within "a growing arc
                      of nuclear powers running from Israel in the west through an emerging
                      Iran to Pakistan, India, and on to China, North Korea, and Russia in
                      the east."</p>
              <p>The single reference is far more than the U.S. usually would state
                      publicly about Israel, even though <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the world knew Israel to be a
                      nuclear power years before former nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu
                      went public with facts on its weapons program in 1986.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Several years later investigative reporter Seymour Hersh published<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "The Samson Option," detailing Israel's strategy of massive nuclear
                      retaliation against Arab states in the event it felt its very existence
                      was threatened. Israel's nuclear arsenal has been estimated to range
                      from 200 to 400 warheads.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yet Israel has refused to confirm or deny it's nuclear capabilities, and the U.S. has gone along with the charade.</strong></span></p>
              <p>As recently as Feb. 9 President Barack Obama ducked the question
                      when asked pointedly by White House correspondent Helen Thomas whether
                      he knew of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons.
                      Keeping the blinders on is necessary politically in order to avoid a
                      policy confrontation with Israel.</p>
              <p>By law, the U.S. would have to cease providing billions of dollars
                      in foreign aid to Israel if it determined the country had a nuclear
                      weapons program. That's because the so-called Symington Amendment,
                      passed in 1976, bars assistance to countries developing technology for
                      nuclear weapons proliferation.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Given the U.S.'s long history of selective blindness when it comes
                      to Israeli nukes, </strong></span>it's unlikely that the Joint Operating Environment
                      2008 report compiled by the Army amount to much more than a minor faux
                      pas.</p>
              <p>The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in a March 8 article on the report,
                      observed: "It is virtually unheard of for a senior military commander,
                      while in office, to refer to Israel's nuclear status. In December 2006,
                      during his confirmation hearings as Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates
                      referred to Israel as one of the powers seen by Iran as surrounding it

                        to leave the country. So I'm not so happy. But on the other side
                        I am very glad that I can at least enjoy some freedom. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: The Israeli government has called
                        you a traitor. What is your response to that? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well, I answer this. When I get out
                        of the prison, I am saying many, many times that I am very glad,
                        happy and proud to reveal its nuclear secrets to all the world
                        and to let all the world to see the stupidity of Israel's nuclear
                        weapons policy and the danger of a nuclear weapons policy in
                        secret by Israel. And I was not a traitor. The real traitors
                        are Israel's government who was behind this nuclear weapons policy
                        for 40 years, and continues. They are betraying the Israeli citizens,
                        and betraying the Arab community, and betraying all of humanity
                        and the world, the human beings of all the world. They are the
                        real traitors. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: What are the secrets that you reveal
                        that you think were most significant? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Excuse me, but I could not understand,
                        hear you. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Can you explain, Mordechai Vanunu,
                        the secrets you feel were most significant for the world to know?
                        You were imprisoned 18 years ago. Can you say what you were trying
                        to reveal to the world? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well, it was very open and very clear:
                        the secrets that were published by the Sunday Times in 1986.
                        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The main points were: one, the amount of Israel's nuclear weapons,
                        how many Israel had, that no one could predict or know, including
                        the CIA. They were thinking about a number like 10 or 15. But
                        I came out with a number between 150 to 200. Second point is
                        no one here could predict or know that Israel was involved or
                        started producing the hydrogen bomb -- the most advanced and
                        powerful atomic bomb that can kill millions of people. And that
                        has no justification -- no need for Israel's existence. They
                        don't need hydrogen bomb. That was my revelation that was proved,
                        with photos, to all of the world. That was the very important
                        news that I brought to the world. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And how did you know this? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I knew that because I worked in the
                        place, in the building where my job was producing the materials
                        for nuclear weapons. My job was to produce plutonium that was
                        used for atomic bomb. I knew how much they produced every day,
                        every year. So I could make out the amount and see exactly how
                        many bombs can they do. I also was producing, working on other
                        materials for the hydrogen bomb. They call it lithium-6 and tritium.
                        I was working on these and the only use for lithium-6 is the
                        hydrogen bomb. And I also take photos of hydrogen bomb, from
                        another part of the building. It was not part of my job, but
                        I succeeded to go and take photos of the hydrogen bomb. My revelation
                        was Israel [had] started producing a neutron bomb. I succeed
                        to take photograph of the model of the neutron bomb. </strong></span>This means
                        Israel was ready to use nuclear weapons in the next war, in 1986
                        if it had war with Iraq, or Iran or Syria. It could use them
                        against armies. That means the beginning by Israel using atomic
                        bomb.... That was the most dangerous point in the Middle East:
                        Israel, they could have used nuclear weapons like no other state
                        there... </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: So, Mordechai Vanunu, you say that
                        they had 150 to 200 atomic bombs, that they had developed them.
                        That they were building a hydrogen bomb, and a neutron bomb? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Yes. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And have they done that at this point?
                        It's 18 years later. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I don't know what they did in 18
                        years. We can just assume they have much more and powerful, more
                        advanced technology, all the new computers, everything could
                        be much more easier and help them to build much more and many
                        more nuclear weapons. I just assume. I don't have any new information,
                        what happened in 18 years. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Can you describe what you did at
                        that point? You took photographs, you wanted to get the information
                        out. How did you end up doing that? And how did you end up being
                        captured? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When I worked in Dimona in 1980's,
                        I decided I was going to bring this information to the world.
                        Because they were lying, cheating and no one predicted or knew
                        what exactly was happening. So, all the information was in my
                        brain. In my mind. I worked every day there, so I knew all the
                        details. But I needed only some proof. So the proof was photos.
                        I smuggled the camera, it was no problem to smuggle the camera
                        there. And I took 60 photos, two films, during the time when
                        there was no one in the control room, in the building. Night
                        shift or Saturday shift there are less people. After that I didn't
                        develop the films.</strong></span> I keep them closed because I knew that if
                        I develop them, someone can report me to the Shin Bet. So I decided
                        the only place I can speak to the world is from outside Israel.
                        So decided immediately to leave Israel as soon as possible. And
                        with the two films went on my way towards the United States.
                        But I decided then to take them to the far east because I knew
                        with speaking these secrets there would be danger to my life
                        and could end my freedom. So that was then. And I also did not
                        have much experience with the media. But on the way, I met someone
                        who brought me to the Sunday Times. And the Sunday Times made
                        the story. And I gave them the films, the photos. And that's
                        how we had the Sunday Times article. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And how, Mordechai Vanunu, were you
                        ultimately captured? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: When they heard, when they receive
                        the information about what I am doing in London. Even before
                        London they come, two agents of the Mossad come to Sydney, Australia,
                        when I first meet Peter Hounam, the Sunday Times journalist,
                        they started to follow me. They continued to follow me in London
                        and tried to stop the article by all they could do. So, what
                        they decide to do is to kidnap me. The way is to send someone
                        to bring me to Rome, because they did not want to kidnap me in
                        England. They sent an agent, a woman and American citizen working
                        for some US secret organization. They used her. They convinced
                        her to bring me to Rome. I decided that I should leave London
                        because I knew that they followed me in London. I said I should
                        run away from London. So after the Sunday Times published the
                        article I decided to go with her to Rome. When we arrived to
                        Rome, they were waiting for me in her home, and immediately they
                        jump on me and drug me and took me by car from that home to an
                        abandoned ditch -- where there was a yacht waiting in the sea.
                        From the sea came a boat with some Israeli commando soldiers
                        who took me by the commando boat to the yacht and put me on the
                        yacht. In the yacht I asked people, who are you. And they said
                        we are Israelis, French and British. I saw French men who speak
                        only French, I saw Israeli men who speak English, I never saw
                        any British. But they say there are British. There are much more
                        involved. Many more countries involved in the kidnapping. Like,
                        the Italian driver who drove us from the airport, the American
                        woman, Cindy. She is not Jewish. She is not an Israeli woman.
                        She is an American woman from Philadelphia. All these, this cartel
                        of spies who kidnapped me was the same group also involved in
                        the nuclear proliferation during the Cold War. They tried to
                        [inaudible] the man who tried to reveal their nuclear proliferation
                        to Israel and to try and stop this nuclear proliferation. So
                        they kidnapped me and sent me back to Israel. Israel silenced
                        me for 18 years. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Do you know Cindy's full name? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: No. She just used the name Cindy.
                        But if there is any real investigation, they can go to the British
                        airport and find the files they filled in 1986 in October. The
                        airplane is British Airways Flight 405 to Rome. There are files
                        that can reveal her own identity. I have the airplane ticket
                        from London to Rome with her signature. But Israel's Shin Bet,
                        the Mossad do not want to give it to me. They are holding it
                        [inaudible] at the moment. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: So you weren't suspicious of her
                        from the beginning? Are you saying that she lured you with a
                        physical relationship? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I wasn't suspecting her, because
                        I thought what they can do in Rome they can do anywhere. They
                        should not bring me to Rome. But her task was to lure me to Rome.
                        And I went with her to Rome. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: So, when they captured you, you contend
                        that they drugged you, they brought you to Israel. Talk about
                        the famous photograph of you in the back of an Israeli vehicle
                        with your hand up. You'd written a number on it. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: When I arrived to Israel, they told
                        me you are not allowed to speak about the kidnapping, just secret.
                        I was very angry. I don't accept such rule. I said the kidnapping
                        is a crime. I have the right to speak about the crime done against
                        me. They didn't like me to speak about this crime. So I decided
                        to reveal it to the public. I also was worried that they are
                        spreading lies. They tried to say that I wasn't kidnapped. I'd
                        come back. It means if I'd come back to Israel, it means I was
                        a spy, a Mossad spy who had revealed some secret and come back.
                        So the kidnapping is the proof that what I said was true... So
                        I decided to let the world know this truth. So when I had the
                        opportunity to come to talk to public after 7 weeks in the ShinBet
                        jail, I wrote on my palm hand, Vanunu Mordechai kidnapped in
                        Rome. So I used the word hijacked, not kidnapping, because I
                        didn't know English very well at the time. And then we now added
                        to the press, I put my palm on the ground, and they saw the message.
                        And that message destroyed another conspiracy to cheat the CIA
                        and many [others] who didn't know the truth about how I ended
                        up in Israel. And those spies who kidnapped me tried to save
                        their face or their game, their spy game, by cheating the world
                        telling them the men who kidnapped you would return. So I destroyed
                        another cheating by the palm hand destroyed by a very big game. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: We are talking to Mordechai Vanunu,
                        who is speaking out for the first time on a national broadcast
                        in the United States on Democracy Now!, the largest public media
                        collaboration in the country. You were imprisoned for 18 years.
                        Can you talk about your treatment in jail. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well, the Shabak Mossad, ShinBet
                        Mossad were very very angry upset with my revelations. After
                        making a mockery [of them] to all the world... They were very
                        angry and they tried to destroy this man who made them zero in
                        all the world. The spy organization who was respected in all
                        the world find themselves naked. So they decided to get him to
                        give themselves the chance to change this man to destroy him
                        to make him ... to prove that they are still strong, this spy
                        organization. So from the beginning they put me in total isolation
                        for seven weeks after my kidnapping they even didn't admit I
                        am in an Israeli prison. No one knows where I am. Only by my
                        standing against the judge and all the Israelis who wanted to
                        keep me in administrative arrest. I demanded I should be in trial-no
                        administrative arrest-- so that forced them to admit I am in
                        an Israeli prison. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Next they decided to put me
                        in total isolation. The first two years, they keep me in a small
                        room, filled with light 24 hours and camera inside. I couldn't
                        sleep for two years, they tried to break my nerves. They used
                        a lot of psychology to brainwash. I demanded to meet a priest.
                        They give me a priest, but without able to speak to him or him
                        speak to me, only through notes. A ShinBet man sitting near the
                        priest, reading the notes. I'm sending him notes, they're reading
                        them. We couldn't meet as a human being. A woman came to Israel
                        from U.S. I had a girlfriend. She came to see me. And again they
                        did not let us meet, they said only by notes, you cannot speak
                        to her, touch her nothing, so I refused to this condition. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">During the 11 and half years
                        I was in total isolation alone in a cell, only for two hours
                        everyday to go to walk in a courtyard also alone. The cell was
                        also isolated from all the prison. I was allowed to meet my family
                        every two weeks for a half hour. I wasn't allowed to use the
                        phone. My mail was delayed for three months and censored. Some
                        of it disappeared, some destroyed. The Ashkelon prison was controlled
                        by Shabak Mossad, because they have a section inside the prison.
                        Could you believe Shabak Mossad are sitting inside the prison
                        hiding themselves from the people. They used the guards to control
                        the prison so the real people who control the prison is the Shavak
                        Mossad </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Where is the Ashkelon Prison? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Ashkelon prison is... about 40 miles
                        from Tel Aviv or 20 miles from Dalia . </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: How did you maintain your sanity?
                        You were completely isolated for how many years in solitary confinement? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: 11 years in total isolation. I decided
                        from the first weeks that it's going to be a big war between
                        me and the Shabak-Mossad who are now my enemy, and they will
                        do all they can to destroy me, and I shall do all I can to survive.
                        So I use my simple brain, and my initiative. Like if they say
                        I cannot speak to anyone, I decided I can speak, I spoke by reading
                        in a loud voice from the New Testament in English... I used to
                        do a lot of psychology exercises or physical exercise, I did
                        Yoga. I hear the BBC World Service, I hear the Voice of America.
                        I read books, and I used to follow anything that happened to
                        me there, anything that come by food, by letter, anything I knew.
                        The Shabak Mossad psychologic spy are fighting me and I should
                        follow them. That was my way, and I also use the music after
                        five years, I started hearing opera, opera, it was very good
                        instrument to keep the spirit very strong because you feel like
                        you are yourself singing opera, and I used to hear a lot of opera,
                        they send me tapes. I used to hear the opera Fidelio. That was
                        similar to my story. I used a lot of psychology for my initiative. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: We're talking to Mordechai Vanunu.
                        He is now out of jail after 18 years. Are you allowed to speak
                        on the telephone? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I'm allowed to use the phone, but
                        I'm not allowed to speak to foreigners. Now when I am speaking
                        is contrary to the restriction. But I think because I have given
                        interview to the BBC and the day passed, nothing happened and
                        I think - what I'm talking is about my humanity, my human rights
                        and I think it's the government, or either a spy, who looks very
                        stupid to fight someone who is speaking about his freedom of
                        speech, freedom of movement, his human being, human rights. So
                        I don't think they will be stupid [enough] to arrest me or to
                        question. But if they can do anything - it is Israel. Israel,
                        all of the world knows, they're [able] to do anything. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Mordechai Vanunu can you talk about
                        the restrictions on you right now since you have left prison.
                        First of all where are you? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Since I left the prison April 21st,
                        I took straight car from the prison to Saint George Cathedral
                        in East Jerusalem, so I'm staying now in the Saint George Cathedral
                        guest house. The Bishop accepted me and is expecting me to stay
                        here, and since that day until now I'm sitting here, and the
                        restriction is not to speak to foreigners for 6 months, that
                        is a very stupid restriction. I can speak to any Israeli citizen
                        about anything, but not to foreigners. And I rejected this restriction
                        by speaking English to everyone. The other restriction is if
                        I want to move from Jerusalem to another city, I should [notify]
                        the police. Anywhere I want to move, I should [notify] the police.
                        If I want to sleep in other home, I should [notify] the police.
                        I am not allowed to go to any embassy, because they are afraid
                        I will go ask for asylum. Another important, very danger- or
                        important restriction is not to leave the country for one year,
                        I'm not allowed to leave Israel for one year, they are not giving
                        me a passport. So, those are the restrictions. We appealed to
                        the Supreme Court. The leader of the Supreme Court followed the
                        Shabak Mossad demand in fact they just give them another stamp.
                        The Supreme Court again proved to be injustice, and not respecting
                        the basics of democracy, the basics of human rights - to have
                        the right of movement and the right of movement and the right
                        of freedom of speech. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Would you like to leave Israel? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Absolutely. I want to leave Israel
                        after suffering seventeen and a half years in total isolation
                        and very cruel , barbaric treatment by the Mossad Shabac inside
                        the prison. Also because Israeli media damaged my image in all
                        of Israel amongst the Jewish people, and some of them hate me,
                        some of them threatened my life when I was released. Some of
                        them are anti-Vanunu because I became a Christian, so I am not
                        free and I am not safe in Israel. And I am demanding to leave
                        Israel to be free... It could only happen in a free state, the
                        United States or Europe. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Would you like to move to the United
                        States? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Yes. I would like to move to the
                        United States. I have adopted parents in Minnesota. I have many,
                        many friends in the United States, who used to write to me and
                        send me letters and cards for many years during eighteen years.
                        I read a lot of your history of United States and am very appreciative
                        of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. freedom. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: What date were you released from
                        prison, Mordechai Vanunu? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: April 21. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: So it's April 21, and now we're coming
                        on the end of August. May, June, July, August. Four months later,
                        why have you decided to speak out at this point? Which could
                        well risk your having access to a telephone or - well, it's not
                        clear what will happen now that you are violating the restrictions
                        that have been placed upon you. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: When I came out of prison, I was
                        ready to speak. But what happened is we met a very large riot
                        of rightwing people, religious Jewish people who threatened my
                        life. Then my brother was staying with me, and others say "Don't
                        speak. Stay in the center. Don't get out. Don't have any access
                        to the media." But I am now, since my two months of work
                        start speaking after the BBC interview, I am ready to speak.
                        Why does the media didn't come to me? I was ready to speak. Then
                        I start giving my phone number and meeting people... So I am
                        ready to speak because I used all my fight and want in seventeen
                        and a half years in prison was the demand for freedom of speech.
                        I believe the human being have the right to freedom of speech.
                        I don't have any secrets. All what I'm speaking about is my view.
                        My political view as a human has a right to express his view
                        in any subject. That is my risk speaking again and again, as
                        I am not speaking about secrets, because all the secrets have
                        been published by the Sunday Times. And all what I have to say
                        is my political view. And I have the right to speak them if Israel
                        is a real democracy. And I hope you in the United States will
                        support me, and support my right to freedom of speech. It does
                        not damage Israel. I have a right to say my view, and anyone
                        want to hear me, it's OK. If any one doesn't want to hear, they
                        have the right to not to hear. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: The foreign affairs and defense committee
                        chair Yuval Steinitz of Likud party, said that you should be
                        returned to prison or placed in administrative detention or house
                        arrest to prevent you from revealing more of Israel's nuclear
                        secrets. He said that you broke the law by giving an interview
                        to the Arabic newspaper al Hayat and should be prosecuted for
                        it. He said that it's unfortunate that the defense establishment
                        doesn't take the committee's recommendation to place you under
                        house arrest as was done with Marcus Klingberg who was convicted
                        of espionage. And then you have the member of Knesset, Ophir
                        Pines-Paz of Labor, who said you are playing with fire and continuing
                        to hurt Israel's security, saying I don't know why this phenomenon
                        is being treated with equanimity. He said this is a professional
                        provocateur who's making a joke of the legal system. Your response. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: My view, there is people who make
                        jokes is they - those who put the stupid restriction not to speak
                        to foreigners, that I am allowed to speak to Israel, but then
                        not allowed to speak to foreigners. If they had said I have secrets,
                        then they should say you are not allowed to speak to anyone,
                        not only to the foreigners. If there is danger, they should say
                        from the beginning, "Don't speak to anyone." So they
                        make joke from themselves, not me. Second point, Marcus Klingberg,
                        the spy, was released from freedom before ending his sentence,
                        so he was under restriction because he was freed five years before
                        the end of his sentence, so they gave him this privilege to get
                        out and to live in freedom. If they had want me, they should
                        have done the same with me, take me out of prison five years
                        ago. But in my case I am after seventeen and a half years in
                        prison, served all my sentence, and I should be free and should
                        be allowed to leave the country. And the main point is I have
                        the right to speak my views. I'm speaking my political view,
                        my analysis. I have not revealed any new secrets. I do not have
                        any secrets. All that I'm saying it was repeating what have been
                        published at least eighteen years ago. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: You said that Israel had 100 to 200
                        atomic bombs and was developing a neutron and hydrogen bomb but
                        at that point didn't have it. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: The hydrogen bomb was started to
                        be built in 1986 or 1985. I took the photo of part of the real
                        hydrogen bomb which was published by the Sunday Times. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: [And Israel] had already made 100
                        to 200 atomic bombs? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Yes. They used to produce about 40
                        kilograms of plutonium each year which is enough for 10 atomic
                        bombs. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And what was your job at the Dimona
                        plant? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: At the Dimona plant my job was producing
                        plutonium, producing lithium-6, tritium and I also worked part-time
                        in the nuclear waste area where they are dealing with nuclear
                        waste. But my main job was to produce this material: plutonium,
                        lithium, tritium. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And how long did you work there? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Nine years. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: When you spoke with your co-workers,
                        did other people share your feelings? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: No. No one. Maybe some of them were
                        concerned that Israel was producing nuclear weapons. But no one
                        there doubted what was the policy. Maybe some of them in their
                        hearts they were worried what was going on. But no one would
                        dare to go and speak. That is the difference. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And who did you see at that plant?
                        Did you see people from other countries coming through -- visitors
                        or even working there? Or government officials, perhaps from
                        the United States? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: No. I have no information about foreigners
                        working there... When I worked there they brought the prime minister
                        Shimon Peres in September 1985. In 1984 I saw... the Defense
                        Minister. Every new prime minister and new defense minister came,
                        the head of Mossad, the head of Shabak came to visit to see Israel's
                        nuclear power, not foreigners. Maybe there were but I didn't
                        know about it. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And how do you think Israel being
                        a nuclear power effects the Middle East? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: My view: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the nuclear weapons Israel
                        built make it very aggressive and powerful. In 1962 Israel was
                        ready to deal to make real peace with the Arab world after the
                        independence war in 1948... But then I believe some people had
                        the idea to get Israel nuclear weapons, to build the French reactor
                        in Dimona. That power made Israel free not to make real peace
                        with the Arabs; made Israel free not to solve the Palestinian
                        refugee problem. ... they [took] the West Bank, Golan Heights
                        and Sinai and keep them until now. Now Israel is much more aggressive,
                        not to give anything to the Palestinians or to make real peace
                        with Syria or Lebanon or Jordan or the Palestinians. So the nuclear
                        weapon is used as a political power. Without even using nuclear
                        weapons, nuclear weapons help Israel do what it wants without
                        respecting international law or respecting the Middle East states.</strong></span>..
                        But my view is that my revelation in 1986 it prevented Israel
                        from using nuclear weapons. Otherwise it is my view that they
                        were ready to use nuclear weapons in their next war, it could
                        have happened in the Cold War. My revelation let the world see
                        what they had and made it impossible for Israel to use nuclear
                        weapons. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Has Israel ever admitted that it
                        had nuclear weapons? </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: You and others can find out. I am
                        like you, reading the newspaper, hearing the media. You and others
                        can see what they said. Everyone in fact thinks they have, but
                        they are playing games. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My view is that they are cheating themselves.
                        Israel continues to cheat themselves and with the United States
                        play this cheating game -- to play like no one is watching them.
                        The king is naked but no one wants to see the king is naked.
                        That is the truth. And Israel is succeeding to impose on the
                        United States and all the world to play this game. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Did they ever tell you at the Dimona
                        plant not to speak about what you saw inside? AV: I signed a
                        secret document not to speak about anything. More than that no
                        one at Dimona were telling you that you are producing nuclear
                        weapons. No one mentioned the word 'atomic bomb.' Some of them
                        there don't know what they are doing --they are producing materials
                        without knowing exactly what those materials are used for. Everything
                        you are watching there you are not allowed to speak about. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: if they do end up putting you back
                        in detention, if they jailed you again, how do you feel about
                        that? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I would feel very bad but I will
                        continue to demand to be a human being, to believe and to behave
                        as a human being; to have the right to speak; the right to have
                        freedom of speech. And I will continue to demand my total freedom
                        to leave Israel. I hope they will not do not do such a mistake
                        and someone -- possibly from abroad, from the United States or
                        Europe -- will tell them that they should respect the human rights
                        of this man. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And to end this game of tricking the world by claiming
                        there is no atomic bombs when all the world knowing exactly what
                        they do and exactly what they saw when I gave photos to all of
                        the world. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Mordechai Vanunu, do you have any
                        regrets about what you have done? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well, what do you expect, if I am
                        strong enough to survive all that they have done to me, it means
                        that I have never regret. And much more, I all the time always
                        was convinced and convinced that I did the right thing. That
                        I was following my conscience and the right of the people in
                        all the world to know such teaching and the most danger atomic
                        bomb subject. And also when I saw the cold war ended and Russia
                        collapse and South Africa become free and the nuclear race ended
                        and the United States and Russia started destroying nuclear weapons
                        from 100,000 nuclear weapons to twenty nuclear weapons, all this
                        only was encouraging me that I did the right thing. And also
                        I think what Israel spy Shabak did to me in prison fighting me
                        that make it very clear that I did the right thing. I'm very
                        happy and glad that I revealed the true face of Israel and let
                        all the world and the Israeli people see the true face of Israel
                        who used to remind the world "holocaust, holocaust"
                        every hour, every day, but in fact Israel have a holocaust factory.
                        This Jewish state was producing holocaust weapons and they have
                        no right to speak about holocaust so I was very happy to reveal
                        this truth. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Mordechai Vanunu now your life every
                        day, are you confined to the house you are in? How do you spend
                        your days? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Now I'm staying in St. George Cathedral
                        guest house in East Jerusalem, I decided not to visit the West
                        Jerusalem, not to visit any Israel state because if I'm not allowed
                        to leave Israel, I'm not allowed to speak to foreigners, so I
                        too will not go see Israel. So I'm staying in East Jerusalem,
                        walking around, going to restaurants outside, going to the old
                        city, meeting a lot of Palestinians. Many Palestinians are happy
                        to see me, and very - appreciate what I did, they saw me as a
                        hero. I'm staying in St. George, doing emails, trying to learn
                        computer, trying to read newspaper, watching TV and this summer
                        also enjoy to go to swim - it's very good psychological treatment
                        to swim everyday. And very happy and glad to meet human beings,
                        I like to meet human beings, to speak and to eat with them and
                        to be among the people. And point - the issue I want to remind
                        you why the Shabak-Mossad will not do anything because if I am
                        staying here in East Jerusalem among the Palestinians, those
                        Palestinians who are recognized by Israel as the enemy, so if
                        I have any secrets I could have passed to this enemy. So if I
                        am staying among Palestinians for three months, four months,
                        the Shabak-Mossad give up, they cannot expect from me anything
                        - so what they can do? So I am staying here in East Jerusalem
                        among Palestinians. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Mordechai Vanunu, you said that after
                        six months they would lift the restriction on you speaking on
                        the cell phone to foreigners and after a year you could travel.
                        So you're only two months away from that restriction being lifted
                        and yet you are risking a lot now by speaking on the cell phone
                        to a foreigner. Why take that risk now? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I don't know if they will lift the
                        restriction after another two months, they have the right to
                        extend them or to end them, I don't know what they will do on
                        October 21st. Especially after the supreme court rejected my
                        appeal now they can do anything they want, no one can say anything,
                        they can extend them. The Supreme Court give them a blank check
                        to do what they want so I don't know. Again, I am not risking
                        anything because what I am telling you, I told to many Israeli
                        people here from the left who come to see me. I said the same
                        to the BBC that was broadcast in Israel TV. So all what I am
                        telling you is repeating what I already said and what I already
                        published 18 years ago. So that was the way to see it and I will
                        not see it as risking anything. I'm only trying to bring my case
                        to the United States to raise the awareness to my case in the
                        United States because I have no chance here in Israel that someone
                        will help me to get out or to receive my rights. I would like
                        that someone in the United States to do for me - to demand my
                        human rights. Imagine if a man like me was in another state.
                        Imagine, or remember what the United States - when Sharansky
                        was in Moscow. What you do, what the Congress in Washington -
                        Senate did - to Russia for nine years when Sharansky was in prison.
                        But when it comes to a man like me in Israel, all the Congress,
                        Senate in Washington is ignoring me and not doing [anything]
                        for my release, or [fighting] for my human rights. So I hope
                        you and others can bring my case and raise the awareness to these
                        situations and demand my human rights.</span></p>

              foreigners and I am not allowed to leave the country. So I'm not so
              happy. But on the other side I am very glad that I can at least
              enjoy some freedom.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well, I
              answer this. When I get out of the prison, I am saying many, many
              times that I am very glad, happy and proud to reveal its nuclear
              secrets to all the world and to let all the world to see the
              stupidity of Israel's nuclear weapons policy and the danger of a
              nuclear weapons policy in secret by Israel. And I was not a
              traitor. The real traitors are Israel's government who was behind
              this nuclear weapons policy for 40 years, and continues. They are
              betraying the Israeli citizens, and betraying the Arab community,
              and betraying all of humanity and the world, the human beings of
              all the world. They are the real traitors.</span></p>

              are the secrets that you reveal that you think were most
              significant?</span></p>

              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Can
              you explain, Mordechai Vanunu, the secrets you feel were most
              significant for the world to know? You were imprisoned 18 years
              ago. Can you say what you were trying to reveal to the
              world?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well,
              it was very open and very clear: the secrets that were published by
              the Sunday Times in 1986. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The main points were: one,
              the amount of Israel's nuclear weapons, how many Israel had, that
              no one could predict or know, including the CIA. They were thinking
              about a number like 10 or 15. But I came out with a number between
              150 to 200. Second point is no one here could predict or know that
              Israel was involved or started producing the hydrogen bomb -- the
              most advanced and powerful atomic bomb that can kill millions of
              people. And that has no justification -- no need for Israel's
              existence. They don't need hydrogen bomb. That was my revelation
              that was proved, with photos, to all of the world. That was the
              very important news that I brought to the
              world.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And
              how did you know this?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">:
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I knew that
              because I worked in the place, in the building where my job was
              producing the materials for nuclear weapons. My job was to produce
              plutonium that was used for atomic bomb. I knew how much they
              produced every day, every year. So I could make out the amount and
              see exactly how many bombs can they do. I also was producing,
              working on other materials for the hydrogen bomb. They call it
              lithium-6 and tritium. I was working on these and the only use for
              lithium-6 is the hydrogen bomb. And I also take photos of hydrogen
              bomb, from another part of the building. It was not part of my job,
              but I succeeded to go and take photos of the hydrogen bomb. My
              revelation was Israel [had] started producing a neutron bomb. I
              succeed to take photograph of the model of the neutron
              bomb.</strong></span> This means Israel was ready to use nuclear
              weapons in the next war, in 1986 if it had war with Iraq, or Iran
              or Syria. It could use them against armies. That means the
              beginning by Israel using atomic bomb.... That was the most
              dangerous point in the Middle East: Israel, they could have used
              nuclear weapons like no other state there...</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: So,
              Mordechai Vanunu, you say that they had 150 to 200 atomic bombs,
              that they had developed them. That they were building a hydrogen
              bomb, and a neutron bomb?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">:

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And
              have they done that at this point? It's 18 years later.</span></p>

              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I don't
              know what they did in 18 years. We can just assume they have much
              more and powerful, more advanced technology, all the new computers,
              everything could be much more easier and help them to build much
              more and many more nuclear weapons. I just assume. I don't have any
              new information, what happened in 18 years.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Can
              you describe what you did at that point? You took photographs, you
              wanted to get the information out. How did you end up doing that?
              And how did you end up being captured?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">:
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When I worked in
              Dimona in 1980's, I decided I was going to bring this information
              to the world. Because they were lying, cheating and no one
              predicted or knew what exactly was happening. So, all the
              information was in my brain. In my mind. I worked every day there,
              so I knew all the details. But I needed only some proof. So the
              proof was photos. I smuggled the camera, it was no problem to
              smuggle the camera there. And I took 60 photos, two films, during
              the time when there was no one in the control room, in the
              building. Night shift or Saturday shift there are less people.
              After that I didn't develop the films.</strong></span> I keep them
              closed because I knew that if I develop them, someone can report me
              to the Shin Bet. So I decided the only place I can speak to the
              world is from outside Israel. So decided immediately to leave
              Israel as soon as possible. And with the two films went on my way
              towards the United States. But I decided then to take them to the
              far east because I knew with speaking these secrets there would be
              danger to my life and could end my freedom. So that was then. And I
              also did not have much experience with the media. But on the way, I
              met someone who brought me to the Sunday Times. And the Sunday
              Times made the story. And I gave them the films, the photos. And
              that's how we had the Sunday Times article.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And
              how, Mordechai Vanunu, were you ultimately captured?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: When
              they heard, when they receive the information about what I am doing
              in London. Even before London they come, two agents of the Mossad
              come to Sydney, Australia, when I first meet Peter Hounam, the
              Sunday Times journalist, they started to follow me. They continued
              to follow me in London and tried to stop the article by all they
              could do. So, what they decide to do is to kidnap me. The way is to
              send someone to bring me to Rome, because they did not want to
              kidnap me in England. They sent an agent, a woman and American
              citizen working for some US secret organization. They used her.
              They convinced her to bring me to Rome. I decided that I should
              leave London because I knew that they followed me in London. I said
              I should run away from London. So after the Sunday Times published
              the article I decided to go with her to Rome. When we arrived to
              Rome, they were waiting for me in her home, and immediately they
              jump on me and drug me and took me by car from that home to an
              abandoned ditch -- where there was a yacht waiting in the sea. From
              the sea came a boat with some Israeli commando soldiers who took me
              by the commando boat to the yacht and put me on the yacht. In the
              yacht I asked people, who are you. And they said we are Israelis,
              French and British. I saw French men who speak only French, I saw
              Israeli men who speak English, I never saw any British. But they
              say there are British. There are much more involved. Many more
              countries involved in the kidnapping. Like, the Italian driver who
              drove us from the airport, the American woman, Cindy. She is not
              Jewish. She is not an Israeli woman. She is an American woman from
              Philadelphia. All these, this cartel of spies who kidnapped me was
              the same group also involved in the nuclear proliferation during
              the Cold War. They tried to [inaudible] the man who tried to reveal
              their nuclear proliferation to Israel and to try and stop this
              nuclear proliferation. So they kidnapped me and sent me back to
              Israel. Israel silenced me for 18 years.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Do you
              know Cindy's full name?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: No. She
              just used the name Cindy. But if there is any real investigation,
              they can go to the British airport and find the files they filled
              in 1986 in October. The airplane is British Airways Flight 405 to
              Rome. There are files that can reveal her own identity. I have the
              airplane ticket from London to Rome with her signature. But
              Israel's Shin Bet, the Mossad do not want to give it to me. They
              are holding it [inaudible] at the moment.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: So you
              weren't suspicious of her from the beginning? Are you saying that
              she lured you with a physical relationship?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I
              wasn't suspecting her, because I thought what they can do in Rome
              they can do anywhere. They should not bring me to Rome. But her
              task was to lure me to Rome. And I went with her to
              Rome.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: So,
              when they captured you, you contend that they drugged you, they
              brought you to Israel. Talk about the famous photograph of you in
              the back of an Israeli vehicle with your hand up. You'd written a
              number on it.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: When I
              arrived to Israel, they told me you are not allowed to speak about
              the kidnapping, just secret. I was very angry. I don't accept such
              rule. I said the kidnapping is a crime. I have the right to speak
              about the crime done against me. They didn't like me to speak about
              this crime. So I decided to reveal it to the public. I also was
              worried that they are spreading lies. They tried to say that I
              wasn't kidnapped. I'd come back. It means if I'd come back to
              Israel, it means I was a spy, a Mossad spy who had revealed some
              secret and come back. So the kidnapping is the proof that what I
              said was true... So I decided to let the world know this truth. So
              when I had the opportunity to come to talk to public after 7 weeks
              in the ShinBet jail, I wrote on my palm hand, Vanunu Mordechai
              kidnapped in Rome. So I used the word hijacked, not kidnapping,
              because I didn't know English very well at the time. And then we
              now added to the press, I put my palm on the ground, and they saw
              the message. And that message destroyed another conspiracy to cheat
              the CIA and many [others] who didn't know the truth about how I
              ended up in Israel. And those spies who kidnapped me tried to save
              their face or their game, their spy game, by cheating the world
              telling them the men who kidnapped you would return. So I destroyed
              another cheating by the palm hand destroyed by a very big
              game.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: We are
              talking to Mordechai Vanunu, who is speaking out for the first time
              on a national broadcast in the United States on Democracy Now!, the
              largest public media collaboration in the country. You were
              imprisoned for 18 years. Can you talk about your treatment in
              jail.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well,
              the Shabak Mossad, ShinBet Mossad were very very angry upset with
              my revelations. After making a mockery [of them] to all the
              world... They were very angry and they tried to destroy this man
              who made them zero in all the world. The spy organization who was
              respected in all the world find themselves naked. So they decided
              to get him to give themselves the chance to change this man to
              destroy him to make him ... to prove that they are still strong,
              this spy organization. So from the beginning they put me in total
              isolation for seven weeks after my kidnapping they even didn't
              admit I am in an Israeli prison. No one knows where I am. Only by
              my standing against the judge and all the Israelis who wanted to
              keep me in administrative arrest. I demanded I should be in
              trial-no administrative arrest-- so that forced them to admit I am
              in an Israeli prison.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Next they decided to put me
              in total isolation. The first two years, they keep me in a small
              room, filled with light 24 hours and camera inside. I couldn't
              sleep for two years, they tried to break my nerves. They used a lot
              of psychology to brainwash. I demanded to meet a priest. They give
              me a priest, but without able to speak to him or him speak to me,
              only through notes. A ShinBet man sitting near the priest, reading
              the notes. I'm sending him notes, they're reading them. We couldn't
              meet as a human being. A woman came to Israel from U.S. I had a
              girlfriend. She came to see me. And again they did not let us meet,
              they said only by notes, you cannot speak to her, touch her
              nothing, so I refused to this condition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">During the 11 and half years
              I was in total isolation alone in a cell, only for two hours
              everyday to go to walk in a courtyard also alone. The cell was also
              isolated from all the prison. I was allowed to meet my family every
              two weeks for a half hour. I wasn't allowed to use the phone. My
              mail was delayed for three months and censored. Some of it
              disappeared, some destroyed. The Ashkelon prison was controlled by
              Shabak Mossad, because they have a section inside the prison. Could
              you believe Shabak Mossad are sitting inside the prison hiding
              themselves from the people. They used the guards to control the
              prison so the real people who control the prison is the Shavak
              Mossad</span></p>

              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: 11
              years in total isolation. I decided from the first weeks that it's
              going to be a big war between me and the Shabak-Mossad who are now
              my enemy, and they will do all they can to destroy me, and I shall
              do all I can to survive. So I use my simple brain, and my
              initiative. Like if they say I cannot speak to anyone, I decided I
              can speak, I spoke by reading in a loud voice from the New
              Testament in English... I used to do a lot of psychology exercises
              or physical exercise, I did Yoga. I hear the BBC World Service, I
              hear the Voice of America. I read books, and I used to follow
              anything that happened to me there, anything that come by food, by
              letter, anything I knew. The Shabak Mossad psychologic spy are
              fighting me and I should follow them. That was my way, and I also
              use the music after five years, I started hearing opera, opera, it
              was very good instrument to keep the spirit very strong because you
              feel like you are yourself singing opera, and I used to hear a lot
              of opera, they send me tapes. I used to hear the opera Fidelio.
              That was similar to my story. I used a lot of psychology for my
              initiative.</span></p>

              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: We're
              talking to Mordechai Vanunu. He is now out of jail after 18 years.
              Are you allowed to speak on the telephone?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I'm
              allowed to use the phone, but I'm not allowed to speak to
              foreigners. Now when I am speaking is contrary to the restriction.
              But I think because I have given interview to the BBC and the day
              passed, nothing happened and I think - what I'm talking is about my
              humanity, my human rights and I think it's the government, or
              either a spy, who looks very stupid to fight someone who is
              speaking about his freedom of speech, freedom of movement, his
              human being, human rights. So I don't think they will be stupid
              [enough] to arrest me or to question. But if they can do anything -
              it is Israel. Israel, all of the world knows, they're [able] to do
              anything.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">:
              Mordechai Vanunu can you talk about the restrictions on you right
              now since you have left prison. First of all where are
              you?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Since I
              left the prison April 21st, I took straight car from the prison to
              Saint George Cathedral in East Jerusalem, so I'm staying now in the
              Saint George Cathedral guest house. The Bishop accepted me and is
              expecting me to stay here, and since that day until now I'm sitting
              here, and the restriction is not to speak to foreigners for 6
              months, that is a very stupid restriction. I can speak to any
              Israeli citizen about anything, but not to foreigners. And I
              rejected this restriction by speaking English to everyone. The
              other restriction is if I want to move from Jerusalem to another
              city, I should [notify] the police. Anywhere I want to move, I
              should [notify] the police. If I want to sleep in other home, I
              should [notify] the police. I am not allowed to go to any embassy,
              because they are afraid I will go ask for asylum. Another
              important, very danger- or important restriction is not to leave
              the country for one year, I'm not allowed to leave Israel for one
              year, they are not giving me a passport. So, those are the
              restrictions. We appealed to the Supreme Court. The leader of the
              Supreme Court followed the Shabak Mossad demand in fact they just
              give them another stamp. The Supreme Court again proved to be
              injustice, and not respecting the basics of democracy, the basics
              of human rights - to have the right of movement and the right of
              movement and the right of freedom of speech.</span></p>

              Absolutely. I want to leave Israel after suffering seventeen and a
              half years in total isolation and very cruel , barbaric treatment
              by the Mossad Shabac inside the prison. Also because Israeli media
              damaged my image in all of Israel amongst the Jewish people, and
              some of them hate me, some of them threatened my life when I was
              released. Some of them are anti-Vanunu because I became a
              Christian, so I am not free and I am not safe in Israel. And I am
              demanding to leave Israel to be free... It could only happen in a
              free state, the United States or Europe.</span></p>

              would like to move to the United States. I have adopted parents in
              Minnesota. I have many, many friends in the United States, who used
              to write to me and send me letters and cards for many years during

              it's April 21, and now we're coming on the end of August. May,
              June, July, August. Four months later, why have you decided to
              speak out at this point? Which could well risk your having access
              to a telephone or - well, it's not clear what will happen now that
              you are violating the restrictions that have been placed upon
              you.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: When I
              came out of prison, I was ready to speak. But what happened is we
              met a very large riot of rightwing people, religious Jewish people
              who threatened my life. Then my brother was staying with me, and
              others say "Don't speak. Stay in the center. Don't get out. Don't
              have any access to the media." But I am now, since my two months of
              work start speaking after the BBC interview, I am ready to speak.
              Why does the media didn't come to me? I was ready to speak. Then I
              start giving my phone number and meeting people... So I am ready to
              speak because I used all my fight and want in seventeen and a half
              years in prison was the demand for freedom of speech. I believe the
              human being have the right to freedom of speech. I don't have any
              secrets. All what I'm speaking about is my view. My political view
              as a human has a right to express his view in any subject. That is
              my risk speaking again and again, as I am not speaking about
              secrets, because all the secrets have been published by the Sunday
              Times. And all what I have to say is my political view. And I have
              the right to speak them if Israel is a real democracy. And I hope
              you in the United States will support me, and support my right to
              freedom of speech. It does not damage Israel. I have a right to say
              my view, and anyone want to hear me, it's OK. If any one doesn't
              want to hear, they have the right to not to hear.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: The
              foreign affairs and defense committee chair Yuval Steinitz of Likud
              party, said that you should be returned to prison or placed in
              administrative detention or house arrest to prevent you from
              revealing more of Israel's nuclear secrets. He said that you broke
              the law by giving an interview to the Arabic newspaper al Hayat and
              should be prosecuted for it. He said that it's unfortunate that the
              defense establishment doesn't take the committee's recommendation
              to place you under house arrest as was done with Marcus Klingberg
              who was convicted of espionage. And then you have the member of
              Knesset, Ophir Pines-Paz of Labor, who said you are playing with
              fire and continuing to hurt Israel's security, saying I don't know
              why this phenomenon is being treated with equanimity. He said this
              is a professional provocateur who's making a joke of the legal
              system. Your response.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: My
              view, there is people who make jokes is they - those who put the
              stupid restriction not to speak to foreigners, that I am allowed to
              speak to Israel, but then not allowed to speak to foreigners. If
              they had said I have secrets, then they should say you are not
              allowed to speak to anyone, not only to the foreigners. If there is
              danger, they should say from the beginning, "Don't speak to
              anyone." So they make joke from themselves, not me. Second point,
              Marcus Klingberg, the spy, was released from freedom before ending
              his sentence, so he was under restriction because he was freed five
              years before the end of his sentence, so they gave him this
              privilege to get out and to live in freedom. If they had want me,
              they should have done the same with me, take me out of prison five
              years ago. But in my case I am after seventeen and a half years in
              prison, served all my sentence, and I should be free and should be
              allowed to leave the country. And the main point is I have the
              right to speak my views. I'm speaking my political view, my
              analysis. I have not revealed any new secrets. I do not have any
              secrets. All that I'm saying it was repeating what have been
              published at least eighteen years ago.</span></p>

              Maybe some of them in their hearts they were worried what was going

              there they brought the prime minister Shimon Peres in September
              1985. In 1984 I saw... the Defense Minister. Every new prime
              minister and new defense minister came, the head of Mossad, the
              head of Shabak came to visit to see Israel's nuclear power, not
              foreigners. Maybe there were but I didn't know about it.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: And
              how do you think Israel being a nuclear power effects the Middle
              East?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: My
              view: the nuclear weapons Israel built make it very aggressive and
              powerful. In 1962 Israel was ready to deal to make real peace with
              the Arab world after the independence war in 1948... But then I
              believe some people had the idea to get Israel nuclear weapons, to
              build the French reactor in Dimona. That power made Israel free not
              to make real peace with the Arabs; made Israel free not to solve
              the Palestinian refugee problem. ... they [took] the West Bank,
              Golan Heights and Sinai and keep them until now. Now Israel is much
              more aggressive, not to give anything to the Palestinians or to
              make real peace with Syria or Lebanon or Jordan or the
              Palestinians. So the nuclear weapon is used as a political power.
              Without even using nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons help Israel do
              what it wants without respecting international law or respecting
              the Middle East states... But my view is that my revelation in 1986
              it prevented Israel from using nuclear weapons. Otherwise it is my
              view that they were ready to use nuclear weapons in their next war,
              it could have happened in the Cold War. My revelation let the world
              see what they had and made it impossible for Israel to use nuclear
              weapons.</span></p>

              the media. You and others can see what they said. Everyone in fact
              thinks they have, but they are playing games. My view is that they
              are cheating themselves. Israel continues to cheat themselves and
              with the United States play this cheating game -- to play like no
              one is watching them. The king is naked but no one wants to see the
              king is naked. That is the truth. And Israel is succeeding to
              impose on the United States and all the world to play this

              believe and to behave as a human being; to have the right to speak;
              the right to have freedom of speech. And I will continue to demand
              my total freedom to leave Israel. I hope they will not do not do
              such a mistake and someone -- possibly from abroad, from the United
              States or Europe -- will tell them that they should respect the
              human rights of this man. And to end this game of tricking the
              world by claiming there is no atomic bombs when all the world
              knowing exactly what they do and exactly what they saw when I gave

              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">:
              Mordechai Vanunu, do you have any regrets about what you have
              done?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Well,
              what do you expect, if I am strong enough to survive all that they
              have done to me, it means that I have never regret. And much more,
              I all the time always was convinced and convinced that I did the
              right thing. That I was following my conscience and the right of
              the people in all the world to know such teaching and the most
              danger atomic bomb subject. And also when I saw the cold war ended
              and Russia collapse and South Africa become free and the nuclear
              race ended and the United States and Russia started destroying
              nuclear weapons from 100,000 nuclear weapons to twenty nuclear
              weapons, all this only was encouraging me that I did the right
              thing. And also I think what Israel spy Shabak did to me in prison
              fighting me that make it very clear that I did the right thing. I'm
              very happy and glad that I revealed the true face of Israel and let
              all the world and the Israeli people see the true face of Israel
              who used to remind the world "holocaust, holocaust" every hour,
              every day, but in fact Israel have a holocaust factory. This Jewish
              state was producing holocaust weapons and they have no right to
              speak about holocaust so I was very happy to reveal this
              truth.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">:
              Mordechai Vanunu now your life every day, are you confined to the
              house you are in? How do you spend your days?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: Now I'm
              staying in St. George Cathedral guest house in East Jerusalem, I
              decided not to visit the West Jerusalem, not to visit any Israel
              state because if I'm not allowed to leave Israel, I'm not allowed
              to speak to foreigners, so I too will not go see Israel. So I'm
              staying in East Jerusalem, walking around, going to restaurants
              outside, going to the old city, meeting a lot of Palestinians. Many
              Palestinians are happy to see me, and very - appreciate what I did,
              they saw me as a hero. I'm staying in St. George, doing emails,
              trying to learn computer, trying to read newspaper, watching TV and
              this summer also enjoy to go to swim - it's very good psychological
              treatment to swim everyday. And very happy and glad to meet human
              beings, I like to meet human beings, to speak and to eat with them
              and to be among the people. And point - the issue I want to remind
              you why the Shabak-Mossad will not do anything because if I am
              staying here in East Jerusalem among the Palestinians, those
              Palestinians who are recognized by Israel as the enemy, so if I
              have any secrets I could have passed to this enemy. So if I am
              staying among Palestinians for three months, four months, the
              Shabak-Mossad give up, they cannot expect from me anything - so
              what they can do? So I am staying here in East Jerusalem among
              Palestinians.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">AMY
              GOODMAN</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">:
              Mordechai Vanunu, you said that after six months they would lift
              the restriction on you speaking on the cell phone to foreigners and
              after a year you could travel. So you're only two months away from
              that restriction being lifted and yet you are risking a lot now by
              speaking on the cell phone to a foreigner. Why take that risk
              now?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MORDECHAI
              VANUNU</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">: I don't
              know if they will lift the restriction after another two months,
              they have the right to extend them or to end them, I don't know
              what they will do on October 21st. Especially after the supreme
              court rejected my appeal now they can do anything they want, no one
              can say anything, they can extend them. The Supreme Court give them
              a blank check to do what they want so I don't know. Again, I am not
              risking anything because what I am telling you, I told to many
              Israeli people here from the left who come to see me. I said the
              same to the BBC that was broadcast in Israel TV. So all what I am
              telling you is repeating what I already said and what I already
              published 18 years ago. So that was the way to see it and I will
              not see it as risking anything. I'm only trying to bring my case to
              the United States to raise the awareness to my case in the United
              States because I have no chance here in Israel that someone will
              help me to get out or to receive my rights. I would like that
              someone in the United States to do for me - to demand my human
              rights. Imagine if a man like me was in another state. Imagine, or
              remember what the United States - when Sharansky was in Moscow.
              What you do, what the Congress in Washington - Senate did - to
              Russia for nine years when Sharansky was in prison. But when it
              comes to a man like me in Israel, all the Congress, Senate in
              Washington is ignoring me and not doing [anything] for my release,
              or [fighting] for my human rights. So I hope you and others can
              bring my case and raise the awareness to these situations and
              demand my human rights.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; font-size: small;">This paper is a history of the Israeli
                  nuclear weapons program drawn from a review of unclassified
                  sources.  Israel began its search for nuclear weapons at the
                  inception of the state in 1948.  As payment for Israeli
                  participation in the Suez Crisis of 1956, France provided nuclear
                  expertise and constructed a reactor complex for Israel at Dimona
                  capable of large-scale plutonium production and reprocessing.
                   The United States discovered the facility by 1958 and it
                  was a subject of continual discussions between American
                  presidents and Israeli prime ministers.  Israel used delay
                  and deception to at first keep the United States at bay, and
                  later used the nuclear option as a bargaining chip for a
                  consistent American conventional arms supply.  After French
                  disengagement in the early 1960s, Israel progressed on its own,
                  including through several covert operations, to project
                  completion. Before the 1967 Six-Day War, they felt their nuclear
                  facility threatened and reportedly assembled several nuclear
                  devices.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By the 1973 Yom Kippur War Israel had a number of
                  sophisticated nuclear bombs, deployed them, and considered using
                  them.  The Arabs may have limited their war aims because of
                  their knowledge of the Israeli nuclear weapons. </strong></span> Israel has
                  most probably conducted several nuclear bomb tests.  They
                  have continued to modernize and vertically proliferate and are
                  now <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>one of the world's larger nuclear powers. </strong></span> Using
                  “bomb in the basement” nuclear opacity, Israel has been
                  able to use its arsenal as a deterrent to the Arab world while
                  not technically violating American nonproliferation requirements. </span></p>
