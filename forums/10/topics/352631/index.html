              <div class="small color-666">
              <p>The Israeli army has been forced to open an investigation into the conduct of
              its troops in Gaza <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">after damning testimony from its own front line soldiers
              revealed the killing of civilians and rules of engagement so lax that one
              combatant said that they amounted on occasion to “cold-blooded murder”. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The revelations, compiled by the head of an Israel military academy who
              declared that he was “shocked” at the findings, come as international rights
              groups are calling for independent inquiries into the conduct of both sides
              in the three-week Israeli offensive against Palestinian Islamists.</p>
              <p>The soldiers’ testimonies include accounts of an unarmed old woman being shot
              at a distance of 100 yards, a woman and her two children being killed after
              Israeli soldiers ordered them from their house into the line of fire of a
              sniper and soldiers clearing houses by shooting anyone they encountered on
              sight.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“That’s the beauty of Gaza. You see a man walking, he doesn’t have to have a
              weapon, and you can shoot him,”</span></strong> one soldier told Danny Zamir, the head of
              the Rabin pre-military academy, who asked him why a company commander
              ordered an elderly woman to be shot.</p>
              <p>"I gathered the graduate students of the course who fought in Gaza, to
              hear their impressions from the fighting. I wasn't prepared for any of the
              stuff I heard there. I was shocked,” Mr Zamir said. “I think that the
              writing was on the wall, but we just didn't want to see it, we didn't want
              to face it."</p>
              <p>One non-commissioned officer told Mr Zamir, himself a deputy battalion
              commander in the reserves, that the army “fired a lot of rounds and killed a
              lot of people in order for us not to be injured or shot at.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"When we entered a house, we were supposed to bust down the door and
              start shooting inside and just go up storey by storey… I call that murder.
              Each storey, if we identify a person, we shoot them. I asked myself – how is
              this reasonable?"</span></strong></p>
              <p>The same unnamed NCO said that his commanding officer ordered soldiers on to a
              rooftop to shoot an old woman crossing a main street during the fighting,
              which a Palestinian rights groups said left 1,434 people dead, 960 of them
              civilians.</p>
              <p>"I don't know whether she was suspicious, not suspicious, I don't know
              her story,” the NCO said. “I do know that my officer sent people to the roof
              in order to take her out… <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was cold-blooded murder." </span></strong></p>
              <p>Another NCO recounted a military blunder that led to a mother and her two
              children being shot dead by an Israeli sniper. "We had taken over the
              house… and the family was released and told to go right. A mother and two
              children got confused and went left… The sniper on the roof wasn't told that
              this was okay and that he shouldn't shoot… you can say he just did what he
              was told… he was told not to let anyone approach the left flank and he shot
              at them.</p>
              <p>"I don't know whether he first shot at their feet or not, but he killed
              them," the soldier said.</p>
              <p>The soldiers’ accounts were submitted anonymously at a meeting at the academy
              around a month ago. The Israel army said that it had started an
              investigation, but that this was the first time it had heard such testimony,
              despite having debriefed troops itself.</p>
              <p>Breaking The Silence, an organisation of former soldiers who gather witness
              accounts from troops in the Palestinian territories, said that its own
              investigation into Operation Cast Lead, as the war was known in Israel, had
              revealed a similar picture of the fighting.</p>
              <p>“It’s definitely in line with what we are hearing,” said one of the
              researchers.</p>
              <p>Another disturbing element reported by the soldiers was the role of military
              rabbis in distributing booklets that framed the fighting as a religious war.
              “All these articles had a clear message: we are the Jewish people, we have
              come to the land by miraculous means, and now we have to fight to remove the
              Gentiles who are getting in our way and preventing us from occupying the
              Holy Land… a great many soldiers had a feeling throughout this operation of
              a religious war,” said one soldier.</p>
              <p>There were also accounts of soldiers being ordered to throw all the furniture
              out of Palestinians’ homes as they were taken over.</p>
              <p>“We simply threw everything out the windows to make room and order. The entire
              contents of the house flew out the windows: refrigerator, plates, furniture.
              The order was to remove the entire contents of the house.”</p>
              <p>The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights released the names of 1,417 Gazans
              that it says were killed in the war, saying that 926 were civilians. The
              Israeli Government contends that most of those killed were combatants or
              legitimate targets.</p>

              It's simple, if the Palestinians does not want their children and woman shot, then stop using them as human shield and suicide bombers.
              
              When you're at war and in enemy's territory, would you not shoot anyone suspicious (i.e. like a woman walking in the street when there is a curfew; whom may be carry bombs on her that could blow you and your soldiers into bits?)
              
              That's the reality of war.

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="author">Donald Macintyre</p>
              <p class="info"><em>Sunday, 22 March 2009</em></p>
              <p class="share">The Israeli military yesterday officially condemned as "unacceptable" shocking images printed on T-shirts ordered by some soldiers to commemorate the end of their basic training or field duty. The Israeli daily <em>Haaretz</em> disclosed that some T-shirts are emblazoned with "dead babies, mothers weeping on their children's graves, a gun aimed at a child and bombed-out mosques". One, which the paper says was a sharpshooter's T-shirt, shows a pregnant Arab woman with a bullseye superimposed on her belly, accompanied by the slogan "1 shot, 2 kills".</p>
              <div class="body font-null">
              <p> </p>
              <p>It adds that another shirt for infantry snipers is inscribed "Better use Durex" next to a picture of a dead Palestinian baby with his weeping mother beside him. The report quotes one soldier as explaining: "These are shirts for around the house, for jogging, in the army. Not for going out."</p>
              <p>The practice came to light following disclosures that soldiers who took part in Israel's military offensive in Gaza complained about rules of engagement allowing them to kill civilians and destroy property. The Israel Defence Forces said yesterday that the T-shirts "are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless. This type of humour is unacceptable. Commanders are instructed to use disciplinary tools against those who produce T-shirts of this type."</p>

              <p>From an IDF commander:</p>
              <p><span class="t13">"We're not doing routine security work or anything
              like that. I want aggressiveness - if there's someone suspicious on the
              upper floor of a house, we'll shell it. If we have suspicions about a
              house, we'll take it down."
              <br> <br>"There will be no hesitation," the commander continued. "If it's us
              or them, it'll be them. If someone approaches us unarmed, shoot in the
              air. If he keeps going, that man is dead. Nobody will deliberate - let
              the mistakes be over their lives, not ours." </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>That's fair enough. The IDF is fighting militants that hide among civilians.</strong></p>

              This kind of thing is very hard to judge, especially when fighting an asymmetric war against hamas which employs women and children as soldiers.  Obviously there is a small percent of Israeli that enjoy murder or taking revenge on helpless civilians, but the challenge would be how to design rules that ensure the saftey of your soldiers while not killing innocent people?  From the kind of tactics hamas uses, any child, woman or civilian can be a suicide bomber.  Even if no bomb, its easy to hide a weapon and stab a soldier when he isn't looking.
              
              Of course there is still a better way to fight a war than using violence.  Tit-for-tat killings ultimatly result in escalation when innocent civilians get fed up of being attacked and join hamas for revenge or protection.  
              
              With the objective of winning in mind, there a 3 ways to win.  Love, respect or fear, with fear being the most inferior method.
              
              1.  Love - if the enemy loves you he will surrender without a fight.
              2.  Respect - if you can win the respect of the civilians, they will be less willing to aid the enemy
              3.  Fear - this is the inferior method as it adds more fuel to the fire, the ranks of hamas will be flooded with people wanting to get revenge for the death of an innocent family member
              
              Before 1 can be achieved, 2 must be met first.  The best way is to take control of Gaza permanently and treat Gaza civilians the same as Israeli citizens.  From there, improve their quality of living.  Hamas will then be starved of people willing to be suicide bombers.  Without the help of the people its just a matter of time before it falls apart.

              <p>Would you like to count the number of beheadings of tourists and Jewish soldiers war crimes and crimes against humanity too? I am sure there are two sides to the story.

              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.	The <a href="http://www.criminalisewar.org/">Kuala Lumpur Foundation to Criminalise War (KLFCW)</a> held a special forum on Palestine.<br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. In my opening speech I stressed that the war in Palestine is not a
                  religious war between Islam and Judaism. It is a territorial war
                  resulting from the European powers carving out a slice of Palestinian
                  land in order to create the State of Israel.</strong></span><br><br> 3. It is grossly unjust for the Europeans to solve their Jewish problem
                  by taking land belonging to the Arab Palestinian to give to the Jews
                  for their homeland. It is grossly unfair that they should transfer
                  their problem to the Arabs.<br><br> </span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
                  The participants at the forum represented all races, belonging to all
                  religions. There were ethnic European Christians, Chinese Catholics,
                  Hindus, Sikhs, Malay Muslims, Arab Muslims, Chinese Buddhists and many
                  others.<br><br> 5. They came together because they were moved by the human tragedy that
                  is happening in Gaza, Palestine. That the Palestinian Arabs are mostly
                  Muslims did not lessen the feeling of sympathy felt by the participants.<br><br> 6. Two doctors from Jordan were present. They had gone to Gaza to show
                  their sympathy and brotherhood and to help treat the casualties. They
                  were not prepared to see the carnage caused by Israeli attacks.<br><br> 7. The Israeli forces appeared to be using new kinds of shells and
                  bombs which exploded after bouncing off the ground hurling sharp metal
                  shrapnel which cut deep into the bodies of the victims.<br><br> 8. Many had their arms and legs severed by the shrapnel, while others
                  died when the shrapnel cut deep into their bodies and organs.<br><br> 9.	One man was saved because the shrapnel cut into a small Quran he had in his pocket but stopped short of his chest.<br><br> 10. Phosphorus bombs scattered white phosphorus all over the victims.
                  The phosphorus sticks to the body and burn as long as there is oxygen
                  in the air. It burns through the skin, through the muscles and through
                  the bones. It is impossible to remove the phosphorus without cutting
                  deep into the tissues and bones.<br><br> 11. The pictures of decapitated bodies, shrapnel severed arms and legs
                  were horrifying. The surgeons had to operate on stretchers with several
                  operations going on in one room at the same time. There was blood
                  everywhere and yet there was no blood for transfusion.<br><br> 12. The video also showed Israeli men and women being interviewed. They
                  were quite hysterical, shouting and demanding that the Palestinian
                  children should be killed as they, the Israeli women had lost their
                  children because of rocket attacks by Hamas.<br><br> 13. The Gaza attacks exposed the horror of modern warfare. No one is
                  spared. The town of Gaza is reduced to rubble and bodies were strewn
                  everywhere. Children were buried under the rubble of fallen buildings,
                  with only their dead heads visible. There were burnt bodies of babies.<br><br> 14.	Professor Gurdial Singh spoke about how Israel could be tried by an International War Crimes Court.<br><br> 15. Then it was question time. An Englishman voiced his anger that the
                  pictures of the atrocities were not made public in the United Kingdom.
                  He wished that the Jordanian doctors could give their briefings
                  together with the pictures in London.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> 16. Responding to the remarks, Professor Michel Chossudovsky pointed
                  out that the Western media is owned by a small number of people and
                  they control the news contents. They were obviously pro-Israel and
                  their policy is to promote the Israeli cause against Palestine and
                  Muslims in general.</strong></span><br><br> 17.	Many of the questions asked showed strong sympathy for the Palestinians. The questions were from all races and religions.<br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>18. Then a young Arab man took the floor. The first thing he said was
                  to emphasise that the Palestinian war is a religious war. Muslims must
                  support the Palestinians because of their faith. There can be no two
                  ways. The Arabs must fight a holy war against the Jews. They must fight
                  because the Jews are the enemies of the Muslims, of the Arabs.<br><br> 19. I felt uncomfortable, as there were many non-Muslim supporters of
                  the Palestinians in the audience. Making the Palestinian war as a
                  religious war seem to reject the sympathy and support of the
                  non-Muslims.</strong></span><br><br> 20. A Chinese Catholic got up to reply that he has full sympathy for
                  the Palestinians who had lost their land, who had been driven out of
                  their country to live as refugees. He thought that the Palestinians
                  were unjustly treated and the Israeli killings of the Palestinians were
                  against all humanitarian values. He did not see it as a religious war
                  but a war against injustice and oppression.<br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>21. I was depressed by the attitude of the young Arab. It seems he was
                  moved only by the hatred of the Jews. On the other hand the demand of
                  the Israeli woman to have Palestinian children killed also exposes her
                  bitter hatred of the Palestinians.</strong></span><br><br> 22. This is wrong. Of course enemies must hate each other. But that
                  must not be the reason for the war. Actually it is a product of the
                  war. <br><br> 23. The real reason for the war is the seizure of Palestinian land to
                  create the state of Israel. The objective of the Palestinians should be
                  the re-conquest of the lost land, including removal of the settlements
                  set up by the Jews. The whole war must be directed with this objective.<br><br> 24. What I realised when the young Arab vehemently declared that the
                  war is a religious war was that the war would have no end. The
                  objective was to kill Jews because of their religion.<br><br> 25. On the Jewish side it is the same. They want to kill and destroy
                  the Arabs because they hate the Arabs. That explains their brutality,
                  their targeting schoolchildren, babies and old people. That also
                  explains the diabolical weapons that they use, not just to kill but to
                  cause as much pain and disfigurement as possible.<br><br> 26. The Israeli leaders, especially the military are said to welcome
                  Hamas rockets. To provoke Hamas into firing their rockets the Israelis
                  blockaded Gaza.<br><br> 27. When Hamas fired the rockets, Israelis would condemn the deaths,
                  especially of children. The people were angered by the death and
                  demanded retaliation, which the military duly obliged with massive
                  attacks out of all proportion to the damage done by the unsophisticated
                  Hamas rockets.<br><br> 28. For their part the Palestinians would show the effects of Israeli
                  brutality, the destruction of the towns and the deaths of innocent
                  children. The hatred against the Jews was fanned to red heat, and
                  Palestinians would become ready to kill the Jews in any way they can.
                  They would fire more rockets and the Jews would retaliate with even
                  greater force and brutality.<br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>29. Both sides have now forgotten the reasons for their war. It is like
                  the clan war of old, when for generations the hatred would be kept
                  alive and both sides would want to go on fighting and killing each
                  other.<br><br> 30.	The Palestinians are getting the worse deal in this "I kill your people, you kill my people," fighting.</strong></span><br><br> 31. I was asked by the Jordanian doctor, when will this war end. I
                  think it will have no end because it has degenerated into feuds of old,
                  when Semitic tribes fight each other for generations simply because
                  they were traditional enemies. The original reason for the enmity has
                  long been forgotten.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> 32. If the war is going to be terminated both sides must try to
                  remember the original cause and negotiate for peace. The backers of the
                  contestants should cease providing money and weapons so they will
                  continue to fight. Instead they should urge both sides to discuss a
                  peace not based on who is more powerful but on justice. </strong></span></span></p>
