            <div class='col-md body'>YOU suspect your wife is having an affair with a politician. So you hire a private investigator (PI) to find out more.<br><br>In the past, that may not have been a problem.<br><br>But under the Private Security Industry Bill, PIs will need to watch where they snoop, and think about who they are snooping on.<br><br>Under the Bill, which was passed in Parliament yesterday, the PI will first need approval from the Government if he wants to spy on a politician.<br><br>The bill requires all security guards and PIs to be licensed.<br><br>And anyone who wants to investigate politicians or their family members have to first apply for approval from a government licensing officer.<br><br>Those who don't, face a fine of up to $50,000, which has been jacked up from the current $10,000 maximum, or a two-year jail term, or both.<br><br>The move aims to ensure PIs do not gather information or conduct surveillance which may threaten public interest or national security, Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng explained.<br><br>But, Non-Constituency MP SylviaLim asked, what if the politician is suspected to be involved in an affair?<br><br>'That has nothing to do with national security,' she said.<br><br>'Are we erecting a firewall around politicians?'<br><br>The Workers' Party chairman also raised the possibility of 'leaks' to the politician in question, when PIs apply for approval.<br><br>Mr Wong, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, replied: 'Singaporean ministers are all open - they go to the constituencies and they attend functions and of course, people do observe.<br><br>LEGITIMATE REASON<br><br>'But if you have a specific assignment to go and case a minister, then there must be reason why you want to do that and if the reason is legitimate, there's no reason why the approval will not be given.'<br><br>Mr Wong added that the clause is to ensure 'key government people' who are 'targets of terrorists are not easily under surveillance'.<br><br>How do PIs see the new legislation? Will it make their work more difficult?<br><br>PI and former police officer Lionel de Souza said: 'I guess there's no problem when it comes to matrimonial or business matters.<br><br>'Still, in the course of investigations, the PI may enter into unchartered territory. For example, if you follow the politician to a meet-the-people session and you take photos of him and his constituents, you may be acting against public interest.'<br><br>Under the bill, approval is also needed to investigate foreign government representatives and diplomats, or if information is to be gathered or surveillance is to be done in protected areas.<br><br>Such areas include foreign diplomatic missions or consulates, government buildings, immigration checkpoints and private schools with mostly foreign students.<br><br>Mr Wong said that in the post-9/11 security environment, it is crucial to not just enhance national security, but also upgrade the professional standards in the private security industry.<br><br>'In both the Marriott and Australian Embassy bombings in Jakarta, security personnel had approached the vehicles loaded with explosives before they were driven up to the buildings,' he said.<br><br>'As a result, the suicide bombers detonated their bombs earlier than planned - before they could position their vehicles near the buildings, where the explosion would have caused many more casualties.'<br><br>Taken from Electric New Paper<br><a href="http://tnp.sg/news/story/0,4136,140194,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://tnp.sg/news/story/0,4136,140194,00.html?</a><br><br>I mean, really... what's next? And what are the chances of someone actually getting a permit?</div>
