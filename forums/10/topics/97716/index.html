            <div class='col-md body'>Dear arburthen?,<br><br>It is true that there would be opportunists in any political parties, PAP included. It is impossible to eradicate all opportunists from all political parties, PAP included.<br><br>I have always discuss this "problem" with my comrades. As far as I know, the core group we have right now, do not have opportunists; this is basically due to the highly adverse and hostile environment we work in. Who would want to take such a high risk? Most people like to identify themselves with winners, bigger players; when MNCs go on recruitment talks, there are hundreds of them attending.<br><br>If people like us are that easily "corrupted" by money or materialistic rewards, we won't be here anymore. However, we must watch out for those "opportunists" that you are talking about when we start growing stronger. Indeed, there are lots of "opportunists" out here; there are even "opportunists" seeking to be NMPs; they don't want to sweat it out but they want to speak in parliament! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>BTW, you know of any biggest "opportunist" politician in Singapore's history?<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by arburthen?:</div><div class="quote_body">give him 10mil see whether he change his tune or not?<br><br>No?
