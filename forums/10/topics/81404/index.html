            <div class='col-md body'>I've heard some analysts said that if the tension between China and Taiwan is cleared up soon, war could break out between the two in about 1 or 2 years (before year 2008's Beijing Summer Olympics).<br><br>And be warned, if this war ever breaks out, stability in Asia will be affected, greatly.<br><br>Be reminded, the repercussion of that war may be a world war in East Asia.<br><br>If war starts between China and Taiwan, who could be possibly intervening?<br><br>USA. But as we know, USA is busy with the war on terror in the Middle East as well as help watching over North Korea. If US ever intervene the war that could happen between China and Taiwan, East Asia stabily and the Middle East could also erupt into instability.<br><br>The most peaceful solution to these problems would be how Taiwan is going to communicate to with China.<br><br>The possibility of whether US would intervene if a war ever breaks out would in its elections. The US people would decide how US is going to play its world politics in the next few years.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If a war breaks out between China and Taiwan,  I don't think America can afford to interfere anyway. Do you know that America is the most indebted country in the world? The war on Iraq has already costed the USA so much money. Just imagine how much money a war with China will cost. Not to mention the fact that China besides having an advanced nuclear arsenal of its own, it has an even more devastating weapon i.e. US treasury bills. China owns 400 to 500 billion dollars worth of US T-bills so much so that if China sells them, then the US economy will be devastated.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahem. Gentlemen, first off, why the heck would USA want to back Taiwan up anyway? What can Taiwan possibly hope to offer USA now of all times? Times have changed i think. In the days of EVIL RED COMMUNISM, all you had to do to get Yanky aid was wave an anti-communist flag. Today America is not very commun-phobe anymore coz there is no threat of communism now, so why back Taiwan?<br><br>I suppose now its an age of "ANTI_TERRORISTS", if u want American backing, you gotta wave an anti-terrorist flag, or an anti-WMD flag.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Get real, my friends....<br><br>many US congressmen are in the pay of Taiwan to lobby and vote in favour of Taiwan. They could not be bothered if blood  is spilled, whether Chinese, Taiwanese or even American blood......just as long as their pockets are lined.<br><br>So the US congress will vote for war...........<br>even if it goes against reason........ or 50,000 US lives (mainly black, hispanic, or working class suckers.)<br><br>Also dont forget the arms industry-more fighting means more profits! More advertisments for weapon sales to the third word, one up against the Europeans.....<br><br>Let the Chinks kill the Chinks, so what if a few blacks also die?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Idwar i believe u are wrong its not the taiwaness paying the US congressman but actually the US arms maker....... Taiwan to the armsmaker is a cash cow coz she is always in need of newer wpn tech to counter the chinese threat. And whereelse can she get it but from America. Juz yesterday in the news, taiwan was buying new wpns from america again worth billions of dollars.<br>But seriously, the reason why america is aiding taiwan is beacause of the island's usefullness to restrict the rising power of China(the awakening Dragon). By not allowing unification now, taiwan will always be a thorn  to china and that shld there come to an impasse between USA and CHINA, taiwan could always be used as a stepping board to attack china.<br>I believe that China would not go to war unless the Taiwan tries to gain independence..... and i noe that Chen shui bian would not go for independence as he is wily enuff to noe that it is a very dangerous step and it means the end of the road for him shld he do that as both USA and China would work together to remove him.<br>PS: Blueray btw ur idea would not work coz if china does that u will see another Great Depression <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> . Coz the economy of the world is too intertwined and link. By removing the most important link in global trade and production and finance, USA, the whole system we noe would collapse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i seriously doubt war will break out between china and taiwan. at most they just play the mouth war. just threaten and forget. once in while remind other not to declare independant.<br>anyway i dont think taiwan will declare independant without USA backing. USA has stated they support 1 china policy and on the other hand even if taiwan declare independant, they dont have allies. they dont belong to any organisation and most countryin the world only recognise china. what there to gain for taiwan?<br>most taiwanese also prefer to remain what they are now. taiwan are among the big investor in china. lotsa taiwanese invested billions of dollars in mainland china. they would lose everything if war breakout.<br>on the otherhand if war break out between the two. and most likely USA will intervene not because Taiwan are his allies but to stablise the whole situation and prevent the war from spreading to other country such as N and s korea. besides USA need to protect it own interest in asia pacific region. USA will not suffer much casualties. the war is abit different from the rest. USA and taiwan will not want to invade china, that a dream. at most they deter china invasion. USA would have no problem in doing that as they have the best navy and weaponry in the world. i dont think china as the power to cross the straits into taiwan. the world would prolly restricted in days naval battle as USA sweeps china navy and follow weeks of war will be firing missles from fujian into taiwan and taiwan patriot missiles intercepting and maybe usa FIRING FEW tomahawk attack strategic location in china.<br><br>whole asia affected?? maybe some industry thrive and some suffer. those with heavy investment in china will suffer, some foreign company might reconsider pouring all eggs into china and decide to use SEA as regional HQ instead in seek of stability.<br><br>men? singapore might have more mobilisation and reservist become more siong!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like Reyes and Deism, I share the view that US will not be actively involved in the conflict Â– should a real physical war really breaks out between China and Taiwan.<br><br>From the current plight of the US internal condition, the government over there is already having a hard time trying to resolve the ongoing slaughter that is still taking place in Iraq.<br><br>To openly participate in yet another military confrontation front of a hypothetical new front with China, that would be the least option the country would like to see Â– although we can be assured that less direct efforts to back previous statements on assistances to Taiwan in the event of war could certainly come in via the supply of arms and weaponries.<br><br>The hypothetical war will be fought physically Â– PRC Chinese against Taiwanese Chinese, a regrettable and senseless tragedy should the event really take place.<br><br>At current, the most probable concern leading to the steady assurance of backing to Taiwan in face of conflict could be due to US interest for an ally base in the NE Asia region.<br><br>The current US presence in S. Korea and Japan has long faced enduring and harsh local resentment which is creating discomfort with the strategic military directives on regional interests. And Singapore though an avid ally, is further located in SE Asia Â– meaning that longer time is required for maneuvers, and the effectiveness of any potential blitz attacks hindered, as well as the further stationing Â– a reduction in military awe and deterrence to US Â‘UnfriendlyÂ’.<br><br>The location of potential conflicts is also very much near the routes of established international freight shipping, meaning that the local Singapore port and shipping industry will be affected.<br><br>In spin off, manufacturing exports and imports will be affected in turn and result in severe cashflow problems for many Singapore based organizations which usually have operations very fined tuned to peace time conditions and probably lack the necessary contingency plans to deal with events of sudden frustration.<br><br>And differing from idwarÂ’s speculation that SG will be able to make tons of money from weapon sales from the hypothetical conflict, recall that SG is committed to developing more economic ties with China, while very much dependent on US support to collaborate with in the event of security unrest / threats in the Asia Pacific region.<br><br>Either way, SG will be caught in a conflicting point where severe penalization will be incurred for the wrong moves made.<br><br>So the most optimum scenario for us?<br><br>We pray that thereÂ’ll be no war.<br><br></div>
