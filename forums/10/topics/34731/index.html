However, it has become clear that it was the Malaysian<br>FM who became uncomfortable hving to challenge Jaya's assertion<br>with the facts that he cut short the reporter questioning session.<br>Even though it was just 30 mins, the event clearly demonstrated 2 things:<br><br>1) Malaysian's media apparent interest in directing tough queries<br>to Singapore's officials on the issue (Which I welcome). Whether<br>they will publish in full the Jaya's response, is another matter<br>however. Reporters report, it is the editors who control what will be<br>published in their final print.<br><br>2) The defensive nature of responses that Malaysian FM gave<br>during the Q&amp;A session from "good fishes" round PB to Sultant<br>historical link. Didn't he know the ICJ threw out Malaysia's similar<br>arguement when presenting their case against the Indonesian ?<br>They got the 2 island based on their administrative activities<br>on the islands.<br><br>{PS: I certainly would like to see Jaya given a more senior position<br>in the next cabinet portfolio (Deputy PM ? ). Alas, like he had said<br>during the news conference, his is just carrying out his duty as a FM<br>in defence of his country's position..)<br></div>
