            <div class='col-md body'>in fact suharto aint bad, i think most indonesian miss those days than the current administration. it hard to say where we will be if we dont have the lee family? if we dont, maybe we heard of remaking singapore 10-15 years ago. afterall, i still applaud of LKY for his contribution to singapore but, if we want to be consider really transparent in our administration we need to address this issue to singaporean and not juts transparent to oversea economist and investor.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very old story liao... heard about it when I was chatting at Bukit Batok driving centre. Actually, there's nothing quite wrong except some minor proceedure what.<br><br>On the Lees' side, on our side as well, when there is something offered to you that you like and the price is affordable, as buyers would be, there's no guarantee that the then BG Lee or Mdm Kwa even would know that the seller actually hadn't done the proper proceedure to sell (or offer discount).<br><br>The only thing that makes me feel like crying is... the amount in transaction... I don't even know whether in this life, that I could even save enough to buy even half of the mentioned condo... ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>If I can buy one for my wife, that would be so wonderful... Sigh... ...<br><br>I don't really wanna think that the Lees are corrupted in such case. Given their powers at that time, they can confiscate lands and go for alot of condos at cost value. They can even build their own estate with such monies. 12% is obviously an over-zealous sweetener from an equally over-zealous seller.<br><br>How many Lees or Tans or Gohs were buying doesn't matter.<br><br>Where the case was then so sensitive and spreading in the city like wide fire, it's best it's kept low-profile back then. The more the actions to clarify of which is rather unnecesary, the more the messier, which is equally unnecessary.<br><br>Aiya... I consider this story one of rich poor gap. Sad only that I ain't rich enough, cos maybe I can become their neighbor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Kidding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a matter of fact... I knew someone who did buy a unit in Nassim Jade. She too was given the same discount as what the Lee's had...<br><br>They actually wanted her to come out and say that she too was given the same discount. But the thing was that the Lee's had their lawyers from Lee and Lee sent her the letter, but the letter was signed on their behalf by the lawyers from Lee and Lee, instead of one of the Lee's. She was pretty upset about it.<br></div>
