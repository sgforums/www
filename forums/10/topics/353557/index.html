              <p>By Kalinga Seneviratne
              																	<br> <br> SINGAPORE - This tiny island republic sits on trillions of dollars in foreign 
              																	reserves. Yet, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a BBC interview this 
              																	month that his country cannot spend its way out of the economic downturn until 
              																	the global economy heals.
              																	<br> <br> Singapore, which has no natural resources and a population of only 4 million, 
              																	has been badly bruised by the global economic turmoil and the latest figures by 
              																	the Development Bank of Singapore say 99,000 people will be laid off this year.
              																	<br> <br> For the first time since its founding in 1965, Singapore has had to dip into 
              																	its foreign reserves to help fund a US$13.7 billion "Resilience Package" announced in the budget in January.
              																	<br> <br> These measures will "help companies to remain viable but we must understand 
              																	that what we can do is to buffer the impact", Lee said in an interview on BBC's 
              																	Asian Business Report. "You must wait for the storm to pass."
              																	<br> <br> During good times, Singapore benefited greatly,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> but when the economies of its 
              																	trading partners in the West collapsed, this Southeast Asian tiger was among 
              																	the first to be hit. </strong></span>The government believes that it will take at least two to 
              																	three years for the economy to recover.
              																	<br> <br> The Asian Wall Street Journal, commenting on the emergency budget, said that 
              																	the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>global economic crisis was a wake-up call for Singapore,</strong></span> which has depended 
              																	heavily on export <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">income</span></span></a>, whose decline resulted in the growth rate declining 
              																	by 16.9% in the fourth quarter last year. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Singapore's economy would be more 
              																	resilient if it were better balanced," the Journal argued, pointing out that 
              																	consumption was only 40% of gross domestic product. </strong></span><br> <br> In response to the Journal's comments, Ministry of Finance spokesman Chin Sau 
              																	Ho argued that Singapore's economic model reflected the realities of a small 
              																	country striving to be a modern nation.
              																	<br> <br> "It is diversified across manufacturing and services, but both are heavily 
              																	exposed to global markets," he said, arguing that "as a city-state with a 
              																	population of 4 million, businesses have far greater incentive to serve global 
              																	markets than domestic consumption".
              																	<br> <br> But, the impact of the global financial turmoil on such a strategy has been 
              																	such that Lee raised the unthinkable here when he said in an interview with the 
              																	CNBC network, earlier this month, that Singapore might have to rethink its 
              																	export-led growth strategy.
              																	<br> <br> "There will have to be a global rebalancing because we cannot expect the 
              																	Americans to be consumers of things made all over the world - and with the rest 
              																	of the world as savers, lending <a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">money</span></span></a> to the US to buy things from you."
              																	<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He acknowledged that this would mean a shift away from Asia's export-driven 
              																	economic development model. </strong></span><br> <br> A few months ago this would have been blasphemous for a Singaporean leader to 
              																	say, as the city-state's economic success with a per capita annual income of 
              																	over US$24,000 is attributed to its open economy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>with about three-quarters of 
              																	its income coming from external trade and <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">investments</span></span></a>. </strong></span><br> <br> The government's investment arm, Temasek, has invested heavily overseas and 
              																	government-owned enterprises such as the telecom giant SingTel, Singapore 
              																	Airlines, DBS Bank Keppel Corporation and Semb-Corp derive a large chunk of 
              																	their incomes from overseas operations or <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">trade</span></span></a>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Their share prices and 
              																	overseas income have plummeted in the current global economic downturn. </strong></span></p>
              <p><br> "We are part of the world economy. We make chips, we make pharmaceuticals, we 
              																	make petrochemicals. We consume maybe 1% of what we make of these things. 
              																	Probably less," said Lee in the CNBC interview. "We are making for the world. 
              																	We buy from the world, for the world ... that's how we prosper."
              																	<br> <br> To override this downturn, Singapore Airlines has grounded 17 planes and is 
              																	planning to lay off about 9,000 of its workers spread worldwide. The government 
              																	in its stimulus package has allocated large sums of money for retraining 
              																	laid-off workers for possible future jobs which could be in areas different to 
              																	what they have worked in before.
              																	<br> <br> There seems to be a shift away from traditional manufacturing jobs to more 
              																	knowledge-based industries such as multimedia.
              																	<br> <br> At the recent summit in Thailand of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
              																	(ASEAN), Singapore was at the forefront of calls to resist the temptation for 
              																	protectionism. That led calls for more open markets in the region and for 
              																	accelerating the setting up of the ASEAN economic community by 2015.
              																	<br> <br> The 10 countries that make up ASEAN have a combined market of 560 million 
              																	people, but their purchasing powers vary widely, with some members like Laos, 
              																	Myanmar and Cambodia being among the least-developed countries in the world.
              																	<br> <br> One silver lining is that the financial systems of these countries have been 
              																	relatively unscathed by the global financial crisis. Other ASEAN countries such 
              																	as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines (the remaining 
              																	member is Vietnam) have been hit to varying degrees.
              																	<br> <br> Former ASEAN secretary general Rodolfo Severino, writing in Singapore's Straits 
              																	Times newspaper, recently argued that many countries in the grouping benefited 
              																	by the bubble generated by the "heavily debt-dependent spending binge of 
              																	American companies and consumers, and clung to the profit-making and 
              																	job-creating model of export-led growth".
              																	<br> <br> He argues that ASEAN should do more as a group to develop its economies and be 
              																	less dependent on such bubble economies and that it should stimulate domestic 
              																	demand with investments in the health, education and rural sectors.

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I have three points or rather three questions<br><br>1) I think it is never the protectionist tendency of Singapore. Singapore is too small or insignificant to have an impact on ASEAN. Conversely, it is the protectionist tendency and barrier to entry of our neighbouring countries all along.<br><br>2) The problem also lies not in the variable purchasing powers of the region. The problems are in their infant or non existing markets all along. The faster countries like Laos and Cam, open to competition, the faster their infant markets will die. And this will bring other set of problems.<br><br>3) A regional market of 560 million ppl vs the world of 6 to 8 billions. Which is better for us? No matter what, we will always need global trade. Our current problem lies in our over-reliance on export to the US and Europe. Regional grouping bring us insignificant benefit.

              heavily exposed to global markets," he said, arguing that "as a
              city-state with a population of 4 million, businesses have far
              greater incentive to serve global markets than domestic
              consumption".<br> <br> But, the impact of the global financial turmoil on such a strategy
              has been such that Lee raised the unthinkable here when he said in
              an interview with the CNBC network, earlier this month, that
              Singapore might have to rethink its export-led growth
              strategy.<br> <br> "There will have to be a global rebalancing because we cannot
              expect the Americans to be consumers of things made all over the
              world - and with the rest of the world as savers, lending <a style="text-decoration: underline ! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC27Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px;"> money</span></span></a> to the US to buy things from you."<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He acknowledged
              that this would mean a shift away from Asia's export-driven
              economic development model.</strong></span><br> <br> A few months ago this would have been blasphemous for a Singaporean
              leader to say, as the city-state's economic success with a per
              capita annual income of over US$24,000 is attributed to its open
              economy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>with
              about three-quarters of its income coming from external trade and
              <a style="text-decoration: underline ! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC27Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px;"> investments</span></span></a>.</strong></span><br> <br> The government's investment arm, Temasek, has invested heavily
              overseas and government-owned enterprises such as the telecom giant
              SingTel, Singapore Airlines, DBS Bank Keppel Corporation and
              Semb-Corp derive a large chunk of their incomes from overseas
              operations or <a style="text-decoration: underline ! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC27Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px;"> trade</span></span></a>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Their share prices and
              overseas income have plummeted in the current global economic
              downturn.</strong></span></p>
              <p><br> "We are part of the world economy. We make chips, we make
              pharmaceuticals, we make petrochemicals. We consume maybe 1% of
              what we make of these things. Probably less," said Lee in the CNBC
              interview. "We are making for the world. We buy from the world, for
              the world ... that's how we prosper."<br> <br> To override this downturn, Singapore Airlines has grounded 17
              planes and is planning to lay off about 9,000 of its workers spread
              worldwide. The government in its stimulus package has allocated
              large sums of money for retraining laid-off workers for possible
              future jobs which could be in areas different to what they have
              worked in before.<br> <br> There seems to be a shift away from traditional manufacturing jobs
              to more knowledge-based industries such as multimedia.<br> <br> At the recent summit in Thailand of the Association of Southeast
              Asian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore was at the forefront of calls to
              resist the temptation for protectionism. That led calls for more
              open markets in the region and for accelerating the setting up of
              the ASEAN economic community by 2015.<br> <br> The 10 countries that make up ASEAN have a combined market of 560
              million people, but their purchasing powers vary widely, with some
              members like Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia being among the
              least-developed countries in the world.<br> <br> One silver lining is that the financial systems of these countries
              have been relatively unscathed by the global financial crisis.
              Other ASEAN countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei
              and the Philippines (the remaining member is Vietnam) have been hit
              to varying degrees.<br> <br> Former ASEAN secretary general Rodolfo Severino, writing in
              Singapore's Straits Times newspaper, recently argued that many
              countries in the grouping benefited by the bubble generated by the
              "heavily debt-dependent spending binge of American companies and
              consumers, and clung to the profit-making and job-creating model of
              export-led growth".<br> <br> He argues that ASEAN should do more as a group to develop its
              economies and be less dependent on such bubble economies and that
              it should stimulate domestic demand with investments in the health,
              education and rural sectors.<br> <br> (Inter Press Service)</p>
