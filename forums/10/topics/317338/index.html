              <p>Lands in Singapore are acquired by the government (Singapore Land
              Authority) at age-old prices ranging from S$1.00 per square foot to
              values fixed by the Land Acquisition Act.<br> <br> Under the Act, minister has the right to declare any lands as required
              for public use and compensate the land owner affected by such
              acquisition a value dated back to a historic date (e.g. 1.1.1996) or
              the latest market value whichever is the lower. <br> <br> Only in April 2007 was the compensation revised to current market
              value. Even at the so-called current or prevailing market value at the
              latest amendment the SLA still refused to substantiate compensation as
              based on current market value as the compensation values are not
              substantiated by latest transacted land sale values for equivalent
              lands acquired but based on some secretive list kept by SLA's own
              valuers.<br> <br> The ministers' decision is administrative and cannot be challenged in court by any citizens. <br> <br> As the Law Minister Professor Jayakumar has told parliament in the
              instance of Geyland land acquired for 20 years not put to public use,
              time and circumstance may change after acquisition thereby requiring
              change in government's original intention.<br> <br> It is like talking nonsense and the whole parliament accepted such
              nonsense from highly paid or over-paid ministers as happened in so many
              cases.<br> <br> In other words not only has the government the power to take any land
              and paid pittance like S$1.00 the minister can under the pretext take
              the land to make profit or take any lands from any one without proving
              that it will be put to public use giving some excuses like change of
              circumstances as happened in the Geylang land which was kept empty or
              rented out to some tenants without showing intention to put to public
              use.<br> <br> When the lands are acquired whose monies were used to put the compensation?<br> <br> Your guess is as good as mine - people or taxpayers' monies were used not HDB's or ministers' own monies.<br> <br> When a piece of land was used for public housing, the land cost is zero
              but the reasonable low cost public housing should rightly and fairly be
              priced at say market price less land costs since land costs are zero or
              near zero and in any case paid for using taxpayers' monies.<br> <br> For example a three room flat should be priced at:<br> <br> Market value ($180,000.00) less Land Cost ($80,000.00) i.e. $100,000.00.<br> <br> By selling the low cost public housing at $180,000.00 the government is profiteering by $80,000.00.<br> <br> This to me is a housing tax. What else could you call it. Minister Mah
              Bow Tan has the temerity to tell the parliament "Don't expect free
              lunch, HDB flat is subsidised by the government" When challenged by
              people that it was not a subsidy but only a discount he was giving to
              flat buyer he was so far still unable to give an accountable or
              satisfactory reply after so many years of query.</p>
