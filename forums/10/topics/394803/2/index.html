              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The PAP government has come up with a most ingenious way to stop
                  Singaporeans from selling their HDB flats to make a quick buck: by
                  tying a person’s CPF to the purchase and sale of a HDB flat.</p>
              <p>Right now, flat sellers are able to obtain profits made from the
                  sale in cash so long they have repaid their CPF loans, but if the
                  PAP were to get their way, this may mean that all the profits must
                  be returned to the CPF board.</p>
              <p>During a speech made at a forum organized by REACH, the PAP’s
                  “feedback” unit, Prime Minister Lee revealed that the government is
                  concerned that “home-owners selling HDB flats to pay off debts,
                  only then to ask their MP for help in getting a rental unit.”</p>
              <p><em>“When we help people to own a home, it’s really for you for
                  life……When you’re not so old, and you’ve bought the house, and now
                  you see that the pot of gold is down there and you ignore the
                  ‘please don’t break the glass sign’ and you break the glass and
                  take the money out straightaway, then what happens to you? Or more
                  importantly, your children and your dependents? Where do they
                  go?,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>He added that’s a key reason why the government wants to
                  strengthen the CPF route in the buying and selling of flats</p>
              <p><em>“Like what we’ve been doing with the Additional Housing
                  Grant – that grant we give you into your CPF, you can use it to buy
                  a house….If you sell the house, the money goes back into the CPF.
                  So if you’re buying another house, you can use that for another
                  house. If you’re not buying another house, the money is there for
                  your old age,”</em> he was quoted as saying in Channel News
                  Asia.</p>
              <p>In the past, Singaporeans are able to withdraw their CPF
                  savings in one lump sum when they reach the age of 55. </p>
              <p>In 2003, the Minimum Sum scheme was introduced which stipulates
                  that Singaporeans must keep a minimum sum (MS) of money in
                  their CPF accounts. From July 1 2009, the CPF MS was revised
                  from $106,000 to $117,000.</p>
              <p>Now all Singaporeans are ”automatically” included in the
                  CPF Life scheme if they turn 55 from 2013 and have at least
                  $40,000 balance in their CPF Retirement Account or their CPF
                  savings increase to $60,000 by the time they reach 65 years of
                  age.</p>
              <p>The CPF Life is an extension of the MS scheme to provide
                  “lifelong” income for Singapore elderly in their retirement. It has
                  four different schemes which provide varying amount of monthly
                  payouts to Singaporeans till they reach 85 years of age.</p>
              <p>It is not known exactly to this very day how the CPF monies of
                  Singaporeans are being used by the PAP.</p>
              <p>If the PAP gets its way (which is likely to be the case) and
                  enforces a rule stipulating that the profits made from the sale of
                  HDB flats are channelled back to CPF, many Singaporeans will never
                  be able to see their CPF monies in the lifetime.</p>

              <p>What a great idea by pm.</p>
              <p>I constantly am amazed how they are able to transform a risk

              <p>risk : people reselling to profit and cause flat price to
                  skyrocket.</p>
              <p>opportunity : use this as opportunity to solve the hdb skyrocket
                  problem by putting into CPF.</p>
              <p>That is it folks, my mind is finalised. No need Cooling off. now

              <p>LOL... Cooling off. I say it's high time we let our ruling leaders cool off their brain for coming up with so many ingenious plans that "benefited" us especially during the tough times.</p>

              <p>Just wondering out loud.</p>
              <p>IF the govt wants to implement this system where 100% of the amount received from the sale of a HDB flat goes back to CPF, then wouldn't that cause certain implications to the private housing segment?</p>
              <p>I would speculate that even more people will attempt to speculate in the private market in order to get their hands on those profits, in which case, will cause prices to rise.</p>
              <p>I would think that they would have to tweak the CPF system for housing for both segments, given that both HDB and private segments have access to the same pot of $$$</p>

              <p><br>Not to mention that this probably will only be a bane to the citizen ONLY.</p>
              <p>For PRs, am pretty sure they can withdraw the $$$ the day they decide to leave this godforsaken land behind to go back to their country.</p>
              <p>Given that 20% of people in the market are PRs (probably higher in my opinion), this isn't going to do much for curbing price increases.</p>
