              <p><span class="story_text"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica; font-size: x-small;"> Singapore is brilliant at self-promotion, says an Australian analyst,
              but it is no financial dynamo. Much of the world has been deluded by
              its hollow roars of success<br>
              </span></span></p><p>Singapore,
              the modern city-state known for its authoritarian ways and conservative
              government, has a reputation for functional efficiency and capitalist
              success. <br><br>The smallest member of Asean geographically is often
              touted as one of Asia's great success stories - a gleaming city that
              emerged from the tropical swamps under a strict but wise autocrat, Lee
              Kuan Yew. <br><br>But a fascinating new book by Australian Rodney King
              looks deeper into the "the Singapore Miracle" and reveals that a lot of
              the city's supposed successes are in fact hot air. <br><br>Reports of
              Singapore being a dynamic commercial melting pot are, King says, simply
              the oft-repeated claims of a government that tolerates little dissent,
              and city leaders who may actually have stifled the sort of
              entrepreneurial dynamism you get in places such as Hong Kong, Shanghai,
              Taiwan and maybe even Bangkok. <br><br>King is a Perth journalist who lived in Singapore for a number of years and worked briefly at the Straits Times. <br><br>"The
              Singapore Miracle - Myth and Reality" casts doubt on the city-state's
              claims of cutting-edge efficiency, global competitiveness, economic
              freedom and transparency. Most Singaporeans are not as affluent as
              their government makes out, King says in his extensively documented,
              500-page tome. <br><br>"Books about Singapore usually praise its
              achievements or criticise its authoritarian rule," he writes. "But few
              ever probe its widely publicised claims that it is a brilliant success
              that other countries should follow." <br><br>King argues that
              Singapore's workforce productivity is often mediocre and well below
              that of the West and Asian economies such as Hong Kong. <br><br>"The
              country also displays endemic inefficiencies at both macro and
              micro-economic levels. The performance of the construction, financial
              and service sectors is second-rate, while Singapore Airlines does not
              deserve the top rankings it receives." <br><br>Singapore, he says, has
              "a dependent and underdeveloped economy". Multinational companies and
              state enterprises predominate, and the economy has "low entrepreneurial
              and innovative capacities and an under-educated workforce". <br><br>The city-state's supposed affluence is also largely a myth. <br><br>"About
              30 per cent of the population still lives in poverty by Western living
              standards," he says. And Singapore's Housing Development Board, Central
              Provident Fund and state-run health schemes have severe shortcomings. <br><br>What Singapore has been good at, he says, is marketing itself. <br><br>"Singapore
              has brilliantly sold itself to the world as an amazing success story to
              attract foreign investment and talent. It's managed to get most Western
              think-tanks and ratings agencies to give it top scores for such things
              as competitiveness, transparency, economic freedom, etc.<br><br>"These
              bodies reflect the interests of foreign capital and their methodologies
              are shoddy and incompetent at times. And the statistics they are fed by
              the Singaporean authorities are often dubious and designed to put
              Singapore in the best light. <br><br>"To sell itself to the world Singapore has also denigrated and patronised its lesser-developed neighbours." <br><br>Singapore
              was hardly an economic backwater when Lee Kuan Yew took power in 1959,
              says King, who has no special regard for the premier, who held office
              through his People's Action Party (PAP) for 31 years. Lee is now known
              as a "Minister mentor" and elder statesman. <br><br>"Lee is always
              carefully listened to, and rather too politely ... his views and
              lectures often receive reverential attention from opinion lenders,
              American think-tank experts and others who often have little direct
              first-hand knowledge of Singapore." <br><br>In the early to mid-'60s,
              Singapore had one of the highest living standards in Asia, with one of
              the best-educated and hardest-working populations. Its strategic
              location and magnificent harbour - with extensive British-built
              shipyard facilities - alongside one of the world's busiest sea-lanes,
              meant that it became a natural transport hub. And these features were a
              great asset for industrialisation. <br><br>The strategies Lee used to
              develop Singapore were an open-door policy to foreign capital and
              export orientation to tap into global trade. They helped the city-state
              enjoy double-digit growth from the '60s to the '80s. <br><br>But the
              Lion City became heavily dependent on foreign capital while state
              enterprises focused on infrastructure and "nation-building concerns". <br><br>Entrepreneurial
              and innovative capacities have suffered because of a lack of domestic
              competition and the predominance of state bodies. Public servants
              running state boards often have little experience of the private sector
              "and no idea how to run a business", King and other analysts say. <br><br>"The
              local private sector, normally the seedbed of innovation in most market
              economies, is stunted and starved of venture capital," King writes.
              "The country's capacity for indigenous research and development and
              entrepreneurial and innovative endeavours remains limited. <br><br>"Heavy
              state control of the economy is exercised through an extensive layer of
              state enterprises. The state imposes this control through layers of red
              tape. <br><br>"The government also manages a big chunk of the people's
              savings through forced savings … and owns 72 per cent of the
              city-state's land. Moreover, the government controls the unions and
              most of the labour force. Equally mythical are Singapore's claims to
              being transparent. Nothing could be more untrue. The operations of
              Singapore's government and bureaucracy are swathed in secrecy."  <br><br>King
              counters claims of high home-ownership levels, saying 86 per cent of
              Singaporeans rent government flats from the Housing Development Board
              on 99-year leases. <br><br>The author is provocative but very thorough. Every aspect of life in the city-state is analysed in detail. <br><br>"Singapore's
              flaws are hidden by the PAP state's vigorous marketing campaign," he
              says. And most local and foreign journalists "are usually too
              restricted or intimidated by government defamation laws and other
              penalties to challenge or refute" the "river of statistics" promoting
              Singapore's achievements. <br><br>There is a wealth of statistical and
              anecdotal material in this book to counter the official lines - or
              lies. Economists and anyone with an interest in Singapore should take
              note. This book could change the way you view our industrious
              neighbour. <br><br>But, perhaps the saddest facet of King's work is
              not what he's written, but the fact that the people who most need to
              read his book may find it hard to get, if Singaporean bookshops refuse
              to stock it, as he expects.</p>

              <p>The author seems to have read CSJ's book <em>"Dare to Change"</em> - written in 1992 - in which CSJ had also similarly analyse the weaknesses in the Singapore system : education, economy, social welfare, health, and politics.</p>
              <p>In the S21 remodellng of Singapore for the 21st Century, there were many similarities in the policy changes that were first recommended in CSJ's book written some ten years earlier.</p>
              <p>A whole ten year had transpired before this Government was prepared to change, and had it not been the economic downturn that struck Singapore in 1997 and again after the 9/11 incidences - the status quo would have continued.</p>
              <p>In the words of the retired Senior Civil Servant - Ngiam Tong Dow - the present government would have continued flying on auto-pilot.</p>
              <p>Now that an outsider has seen through the thin veil that protect the real fragility of Singapore - perhaps we can see the reasons for this Ruling Party a.k.a the Government for being so harsh and sensitive in maintaining the aura and exclusiveness of Singapore politics for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Having excluded foreigners from commenting on local politics, the Ruling Party will designed a tough set of rules that prevent Singaporeans from freely involving ourselves in the political process - requiring commentators to join political parties if they wish to be involved in politics.</p>
              <p>Those Singaporean who enter into politics by joining alternative political parties will open themselves to subtle government moves at marginalising these citizens and their families - treating the entire clan as pariahs of the State and prevented from entering into any contract that involve State security.</p>
              <p>This is the kind of pseudo 'open' society based on a self-deceiving Swiss Standard of Living and First World Status for Singapore as claimed by SM and MM.</p>

              <p>You are not welcome. More so for one who cannot even read and understand just the basic things he had written. For example:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"In the early to mid-'60s, Singapore had one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest living standards</span> in Asia, with one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">best-educated</span> and hardest-working populations."</span></p>
              <p>I didn't know that in the 60s mainly coolies and light industry workers were considered best educated. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"To sell itself to the world Singapore has also denigrated and patronised its lesser-developed neighbours."</span></p>
              <p>He is now accusing that we bully msia and indonesia, but you and i know which way it had always been.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Public servants running state boards often have little experience of the private sector "and no idea how to run a business"</span></p>
              <p>If no experience, our economy would have been in ruins.</p>
              <p>And many more i expect. I will not touch his book and dissapoint myself futher that there may be some truth in it. But as it is, just a short review, it is enough to show his flawed and subjective views. I will not contribute to his perverse aim to denigrate falsely our citizens and the choices we made as a society.</p>
              <p>Buy his book if you are the kind that enjoys alternate history or seek escapism thru hallucinatory drugs.</p>

              <p>You are not welcome. More so for one who cannot even read and understand just the basic things he had written. For example:-</p>

              <p>I didn't know that in the 60s mainly coolies and light industry workers were considered best educated. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"To sell itself to the world Singapore has also denigrated and patronised its lesser-developed neighbours."</span></p>
