              <p>Nope. None at all. For the simple reason being that he has shown outright capacity to lie and twist facts to support his narrow bigoted subjective views. It is a sign of clouded judgement. How can anyone trust any of his further perceptions? He has NO credibility.</p>
              <p>No. He has stained himself and can not be trusted. I would rather pay more for a book on more objective view than to depend on him for objective facts. Futhermore, hell, he is only a journalist, what does he know? He's not a renowned economist like Milton Friedman or Albert Winsemius, for goodness sake!</p>
              <p>I make no slander against him or anyone who follows suit. He only shows his venom thru the slandering of our society, insulting us all. If you agree with his views, i can only hope and pray you do not belong to any political group, cause if you use his arguments to win votes, you will be better off jumping down a cliff.

              <p>I am afraid so, Jojo. Espacially when he uses such twisted logic and facts to MAKE MONEY at the espense of 3.5million citizens. He would make Gopalan Nair pale in comparison. At least GP slander against us all at his own expense, but Rodnei lines his pockets.</p>
              <p>Objectivity is the hallmark of a proffessional. Rodnei failed. Mistakes is acceptable for no one is perfect, but to publish a book for the market with mistakes and deliberate lies is absolutely unforgivable.</p>
              <p>Go enjoy his book or worship his white ass, who can't make it in spore and have to hide in australia to con others, if that pleases you. Shall i also direct to you some of my thrash email to you looking for donations or prizes to be collected, since you enjoy being con and even worship or defend conmen? </p>

              <p>Objectivity is the hallmark of a proffessional. Rodnei failed.
              Mistakes is acceptable for no one is perfect, but to publish a book

              unforgivable.</p>

              <p>Sorry lionnoisy, getting angry and cursing people to hell, as well as using old arguments that have been debunked in military nuts in speakers corner is just not going to help you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore ahead by many years? Last I checked it's Australia's metalstorm technology that is touted as the next big thing in firearms that is even considered for use in the US SWORDS system?...</p>
              <p>What does Singapore have? 40mm ABMs that the Israelis and Germans beat us to inventing and putting into production by several years?</p>
              <p>Only if you believe the amazing abilities of local weapons as described by lionnoisy, such as being able to kill tanks from extreme range with puny Singapore grenades and crashing 100k SGD Singapore UAVs into way-cheaper targets which defy all common sense.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately this is simply not true, refer to lionnoisy's exploits in military nuts to get the full picture of what the military experts in there think about his opinions.</p>
              <p>Let me give you all a picture of how it goes, just observe the replies to his threads:</p>

Despite being badly pwned, he makes a desperate attempt by challanging people to show him UAVs smaller then FANTAIL (claiming it was the smallest in the world), when showed a full list of UAVs smaller then FANTAIL, he quietly slipped out from the thread and didn't dare to answer.</p>

He also tries to tout STK's technology as superior to the American next generation smart grenade format that is not only far superior, but more advanced then anything STK has come up with.</p>
              <p>When he failed to win that point, he tried to say that STK's advantage was that it had such technology in production... when showed a whole host of examples of other nations doing the same even better, and even better then STK, he was once again, lost for words.</p>

              <p>He keeps trying to argue his point until an Australian has to come in and shut him up. As usual he slips out quietly again but returns months later in an attempt to revive it using old arguments only to get shot down by old rebuttals. Same old lionnoisy, same own heavy pwning.</p>

              <p>Note his attempt to describe military tactics by coming up with a fantasy situtation in which a soldier has to cross 50meters of open ground under heavy fire... in his opinion holding the SAR-21 like a shopping bag not at the ready and unbalanced in one hand is the way to do it.</p>
              <p>Not surprisingly, lionnoisy was shot to pieces, and once again slipped out quietly.</p>

              <p>Ultimately it's for the reader to decide for himself.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately the constant baying of some people here seem to suggest that Singaporeans will be taken in by each and everything they read, suggesting in a backhanded sort of way that Singaporeans are incapable of critical thinking.</p>
              <p>Now one must wonder, why are Singaporeans incapable of critical thinking? Could it be that our educational system as well as local media breeds such a one-track mind in all our people that they are unable to view anything with a bit of common sense?</p>
              <p>My take on this guy? Take what is true and dump the rest, but even the little bit that is indeed true has serious implications for our country.</p>

              <p>A few years back, my company was looking for an accountant. There were several people who came for interviews. Young and old, with all the necessary qualifications.</p>
              <p>Then one lady came. Her CV was highly impressive. The only issue was, on the questionaire, she listed as charged in court before. Upon questioning her, she related her white collared offences honestly, or as honest as she believed it to be.</p>
              <p>I believe in the 'yellow ribbon' policy of rehabilitation, but then had to consider the company. She would be place in a position of trust within our financial system. Dare i trust her? Lightning doesn't strike the same spot the same time. Or would it?</p>
              <p>Fortunately, someone with a more impressive CV came along and was hired instead.</p>
              <p>As for her, doubts unfortunately remained. If it was in another position where trust would not be an issue, she would had been hired. </p>
