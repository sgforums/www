              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So , do you know how much marneee
                      has this author reaped so far ?How can you be so sure.. he is not
                      actually making a loss ?</span></p>
              <p>IS it my problem how much he makes or loses? Why else write a
                      book for if you don't intend to profit from it for the time
                      and effort, more so on a controversial issue such as slander
                      against a nation when proffessionals and countries around the
                      world agree and aplaud our country's growth and efforts? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are you not also slandering him
                      too ?</span></p>
              <p>Nope. My accusations of him are based on tangible facts
                      from his written and published words. And the fact is that he had
                      written lies and half truths that insulted our nation. If i have
                      evidences of his wrong doing, then how can it be i slander? Have
                      you lost your own moral compass or even have the ability to
                      understand moral values?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Please also refrain from making
                      racist remarks. We are a country that emphasize racial
                      harmony. </span></p>
              <p>I doubt if mentioning your preference for white asses is
                      considered as a racial comment. Afterall if you like monkeys, shall
                      i be considered passing 'specist' remarks?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Incase you didn't notice.. many of
                      our textbooks are written by people with white ass. And many
                      western movies you enjoy on the big screen are also produced by
                      people with white asses....</span></p>
              <p>The difference is - i dont worship or admire them unlike you
                      when they are wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So do you have proof that our
                      gahmen is not making millions at the expense of our 3.5million
                      citizens ?</span></p>
              <p>Do you have proof that they are? The burden of proof lies with
                      you, for you are making that allegation here and now.</p>
              <p>Do stop, you will only make yourself look more foolish and
                      no one will gain anything from such personal exchanges.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So you are saying nothing in his book is true ?</p>
              <p>Or are you just making a biased remark because he is a foreigner criticising our gahmen ?</p>
              <p>Just because you do not agree with his points does not means it is not true. Unless you can prove it, you are slandering his good name.</p>
              <p>So please show proof that all his points are invalid. Thank you.</p>
              <p>Again.. please refrain from making racist remarks. It shouldn't matter what color of his skin is.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or is it due to the kind of Singapore rote learning education from prepared answers that make you unable to find your own truth from questions raised, and will need the facts to be processed and regurgitated for your handicap mind to digest ?</span></p>

              <p>You are hiding what you really meant, that truth is being told, but what truth? The writer's? By writing that statement shows you agree that he is telling the truth or shows his stupidity.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">The words are printed as clear as each word has been carefully chosen to mean - is there any need to hide ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you still trying to be a 'deerHunter' trying to find your illusive deer in Singapore ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can we trust the judgment and reading ability of a juvenile ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again, you speak to a larger ghost audience that has not even selected you to represent their views ? Have you joint the crowd at IMH ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you so afraid of facing the truth - even when spoken by others who are more capable and observant then you ?</span></p>

              <h3>Singapore, 1973, 1986 and 1998 (Landsat, SPOT  Images)</h3>
              </blockquote><blockquote> The
              striking modifications of Singapore coastal areas are clearly shown in
              these three remote sensing images taken by the Landsat (1973, lower
              left) and SPOT (1986, lower right, and 1998, top) satellites. Barrages
              are built across the estuaries, converting them into reservoirs. </blockquote><blockquote>The
              large scale land reclamation has completely changed the south coast,
              from the Jurong Industrial Park to the west to the Changi International
              Airport to east. Tekong Island to the northeast has grown by more than
              30% in size and clusters of the southern islands are merging into
              larger pieces of land.</blockquote><blockquote> Despite rapid development, Singapore has
              maintained its greenery very well. While primary and secondary forests
              are preserved in the nature reserves, the lush roadside trees and
              neighbourhood parks have won for the city state the reputation of being
              a "Garden City."</blockquote>

              <p>I guess we all need to tone down our aggresiveness over the issue. Having watched the debate over the book, I believe that the issue here is because some of us has discussed the book's credibility which is arguable due to the origin of the writer as well as harshness.</p>
              <p>While I do not agree that the book is entirely filled with 'facts' nor agree that all the 'facts' are inevident. In my humble opinion I believe that the 'truths' may be harsh but not entirely correct nor wrong. It may be biased, but it has to source from some where that has uprooted such hostility towards our government. Thus if I were to place a mark somewhere, I'd say they are true to a certain extent and perhaps true but exaggerated.</p>
              <p>Disclaimer: I personally have not read the book but from what my opinions are based on what I have gathered from the users of this forums.</p>
              <p>The issues written in the book are hence highly debatable, read with discretion and readers are to deter whether they are facts how true they are or how exaggerated - every individual may differ in this respect leaning towards either but I advise readers/forumers to take it in an objective view and not personal</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Singapore population disaster</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore needs to attract foreign migrants to top up the population of the city-state whose birth rate in 2005 remained at an all-time low of 1.24 children per woman, said Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Last year's birth rate of 1.24, the same as 2004, meant only 35,600 babies were born, well below the replacement rate of 2.1 that Singapore needs in order to replenish its population naturally, he said late Saturday in a speech. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Our total fertility rate is at a low of 1.24... To replace ourselves, we should have 60,000 births each year," said Wong. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"For us, the gap is too large to fill with resident births. We have to top up our population and work force with migrants," he said.</span> </em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore’s declining birth rate</span></strong><br><br><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">By Epilogos</span></em></p>
              <p class="small"><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Incredible, but true. Singapore is too expensive a place to have a baby, so many young couples in Singapore think. This is in spite of the fact that in Singapore, both couple - husband and wife - are more likely to hold down a paid job. A new acronym, DINKS, has been invented to describe couples with jobs but no kids (Double Income No Kids).</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">This situation is not getting any better as more of the population ages. This will be a problem that our shrinking number of kids today will have to contend with in the years to come: support a greater number of aged people - people that are from baby boom generation of the 1950s and 1960s.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">If after 41 years, we have arrived at a situation where it becomes too expensive to have even one child, then we need to question our priorities in life and the way organise ourselves. Is our national education system any good at all in producing better prospects for its citizens when it doesn’t allow them to earn enough to even start a one child family? What do we mean by a better life? Is a double-income couple a desirable development for the long term? Are the pressures on performance at work putting undue pressure that inhibits procreation, in spite of the government’s best effort and generous incentives?</span></em></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Desperate for a baby boom <br></span></strong>By Kalinga Seneviratne <br><br>SINGAPORE - Alarmed by a falling birth rate and its impact on the economy, Singapore badly wants its well-educated, career-oriented women to have more babies. <br><br>Already, the government of this affluent city state has set up a high-powered committee to study ways of encouraging Singaporean couples to have at least two children. The 11-member committee, headed by top civil servant Eddie Teo, permanent secretary to the Prime Minister's Office, will look into the reasons and attitudes that hold Singaporeans back from marraige and childbirth - and ways to reverse this trend. ''The committee is in the process of gathering feedback from young people through focus group sessions to get a feel of their aspirations and problems,'' Teo told The Straits Times this week. </span></p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;">During a parliamentary debate in March on fertility rates, Community Development Minister Abdullah Tarmugi warned that if Singaporeans have fewer babies, the country will have to rely even more on immigrants. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Government MP Dr Wang Kai Yuen went even further. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">''A nation that cannot revert its declining birth rate is effectively committing collective suicide,''</span> he warned. The root of the problem lies in the perceptions of young women toward family life, he argued. <br></span></strong><br>Ironically, the dilemma facing Singapore is a vindication of the arguments put forward by many non-governmental organizations from the developing world at the Cairo population conference in 1994. There, they complained that the conference concentrated too much on birth control methods, rather than on giving women greater access to educational and employment opportunties. Many NGOs argued that if women are better educated and employed, birth rates will naturally come down. <br><br>For many young Singaporeans with well-paid professional jobs and career ambitions, child rearing, and even marriage, takes lower priority. ''Generally, Asians keep longer hours at work. If a woman has a successful career, it is likely that her job is demanding and stressful. After a long day's work she wouldn't like to start another job when she steps into the home,'' said Tang Lai-Chee, a single 40-year-old regional financial controller for a multinational media company. </span></p>

              <p>Well, Why there isn't any unsatisfied group of people (except the opposition party) voice their discomfort and unhappiness about laws or rules that are impose which affect their lives in Singapore? Because the government doesn't allow them to. Look at what happened the person who had the best reason to question the government? CHARGED! They can't really just throw him into prision simply because he is a known figure in the public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's play a senario whereby a normal citizen is angered by some law that is impose. Where can this powerless man/woman go to voice his/her concern ? Speakers corner ? ... Nah, you will need to be interviewed on what you gonna say before standing on the stage.lol. On top of that is it effective to voice out there ?... haha. So what else is left ? riot ? you may be put behind bars the moment that light bulb flickers. There are more illegal ways and i shall not eleborate more on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are left no choice, so shut up and live on. And so as time goes by... that has become our culture. "Bear with the pain and take 1 of the country".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Enough of introduction story. Below is the production of the culture:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>1) Person who sees only what is given for them to see.</strong></p>
              <p>- This category of people is like a child locked in a room since birth. Their parents will tell the child how luxurious the house is and how hard they worked to provide good life for him and prevent him from getting hurt by the others.The house is the best ! So people from outside including the neighbours equals BAD people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2) Person who sees what's given and reached out to see others.</strong> - This category of people was once locked up by their parents since birth and was living the same way as category 1 child. At a point of time, he came in contact with his neighbour and got to know the way they live. He began to explore more people living outside and do comparison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why it seem like Singaporean is always satisfied with the way of life even when there is some ridiculous rules imposed? like the ministers pay hike ? From my view, because there is the above 2 types of person. The cat2 person will see things going the wrong ways towards them and the cat1 person will rebark at them and say "you should be contented because you still have computer to use and visit forums."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think people from a cat1 are majority old folks who had gone through thick and thin with LKY and guess what ? ... we are a nation facing aging problem. Meaning majority are old people. Lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cat1 people can never accept criticism for the country and Cat2 people will always fight for the best interest for the living standards in the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe nobody understand what i've written... haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a side note: Prices of everything is rising, why didn't the garment force employers to rise salary ? Instead wants us to cope by ourselves? Dunwan to help citizens to pull through tough times?</p>

              <p>Competition is everywhere. But Extreme competition in the most densed s.e asian country is another psychological barrier. Consider the Quality of Life. Consider the workload on the child. Consider happy childhood is important.  Consider the cost involved to keep your child ahead of the pack where eventually, a basic degree of even a masters is oversupplying the market. Consider the competition from FTs , PRs, and anyone from anywhere in the world, all congregating here, in an already densest country in  S.E asia (could be the whole of asia or the world, I not sure yet). Consider the packed malls and shopping centers. Consider the chaos in PC world and expo's. Consider the rat race, the relentless competition and the oversupply of people who can easily replace you. Consider that you are encouraged to work till you die and in fact, you most probably have to. </p>
              <p>Here like no where else in asia, the competition will be the most intense and the place will be the densest.</p>
              <p>Artificial and modern facilities, buildings and amenities can be purchased even by china and vietnam or thailand. Any country willing to spend can purchase artificial stuff. Its not really difficult. But that is not the most important. The most important measure of success is :</p>
              <p>Quality of Life - your weekends in the densest, warm and humid crowded place in s.e asia , some say asia and the world. rest and relag under constant competition. Sure.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are the "$$$ in GIC" decidedly belonging to the 3.3m Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or in truth, are the "$$$ in GIC" - MM LKY's ''baby" - which he so jealously guard, even going to such lengths that will result in his own plan to be aborted - when his intention of an Elected President resulted in the Elected President demanding to know what is to be guarded ?</span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Are all these put to use for the benefit of Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or are these to used in boosting the treasury that benefit the GIC and Temasek in the hands of the First Family ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is amazing that these are not transferred to a Lee Foundation - different from that of the charitable Lee Kong Chian Foundation.</span></p>
