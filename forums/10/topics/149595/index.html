Many lah, but I dun think is all.<br><br>The way he attacked Huang Na which he demonstrated on the dummy actually matched the wounds that were found on the girl eg. head and chin injury (he stomped on her head to ensure she died, but she didn't),  If it didn't match, I trust that his defendant lawyer shld be able to spot it and bring it up.<br><br>Why I think he's guilty:<br>1) He's calm when seeing the pic of body.  Isn't Huang Na his friend?  Conclusion : He feels ok about Huang Na's death<br><br>2) His smile disappeared when they sentenced him.  Didn't the NUS A/Prof imply that the mother was behind it and Took was just a scapegoat?<br>Conclusion : If Took was willing to cover up for the real murderer, why did he break down in front of his family after the sentence.<br><br>3) The defendant lawyer could only defend him by insisting that Took has mental problem.  If Took is innnocent, isn't there a better way to defend him?  Why the lawyer didn't bring up "facts" like he is paid to dispose the body cuz he owed Ah Long debt... which has been brought up in another thread (see first msg in the thread for the link).  This way of defending is more like... no other choice, last resort.<br><br>4) If the mother is suspicious, the defendant lawyer will also bring it up at the court too.  Why didn't he?  I dun think losing the case is what the lawyer wants.<br>Conclusion : Even the lawyer won't think the mother is fishy.</div>
