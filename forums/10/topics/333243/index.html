              <p><strong>A revisionist death in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/images/Jeyaretnam-JB.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - The passing of Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, Singapore's best-known 
                          																	opposition politician, may not have been psychologically seismic enough to 
                          																	prompt Singapore's middle classes to search their souls, but it did offer an 
                          																	insight into how Singaporean institutions simultaneously constructed and 
                          																	sanitized his life for national memory.</p>
              <p>Certainly, the manipulation of personal narratives by the state and its 
                          																	apparatuses is not new, a nation-building process that 
                          																	constructs heroes and demons for citizens to revere and despise.</p>
              <p>To this end, 
                          																	the way the Singapore media and some members of the government chose to 
                          																	interpret the live and ideology of JBJ, as he is fondly referred to, is a 
                          																	reflection of how it sees opposition politics, society and, ultimately, the 
                          																	Singapore nation.</p>
              <p>Reading through the numerous 
                                                        media reports of plaudits and 
                          																	         memories that 
                          																	various prominent people have of JBJ, and the way his death was covered, it is 
                          																	clear how he was posthumously reconstructed: as a fighter, a man of idealism 
                          																	and passion, and one who never gave up no matter how insurmountable the 
                          																	obstacles or opponents.</p>
              <p>Comments in the national broadsheet, The Straits Times, included quotes from 
                          																	the dominant People's Action Party (PAP), one lawmaker observing that "He was 
                          																	like the Chinese doll, the <em>bu dao weng</em> - you knock him down, he comes 
                          																	back, you knock him down, he comes back up again."
                          																	<br> <br> Another PAP parliamentarian noted, "I have admiration for people like him, a 
                          																	person who never gives up, a person who suffered for his convictions, and who 
                          																	goes down fighting all the way." Why he needed to be knocked down over and over 
                          																	again, or go down fighting, was expediently left out of the reports.
                          																	<br> <br> A columnist of the same newspaper noted that "when both your friends and 
                          																	political enemies use the same descriptions of you, you can be sure they are 
                          																	true. In Mr Jeyaretnam's case, sincerity, tenacity and courage are words many 
                          																	have used to describe him." Other words that could have been cited include 
                          																	social justice, human rights, martyr and PAP hegemony, but you didn't see them 
                          																	used in the media.
                          																	<br> <br> In a way, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's silence about JBJ's death has been the 
                          																	most honest reaction so far. The mutual dislike between the two men was real, 
                          																	with Lee infamously promising to leave his rival on "bended knee". Lee's lack 
                          																	of a condolence message may seem uncharitable to some, but it is, at least, a 
                          																	dignified stance and more importantly spares JBJ's family and Singaporeans a 
                          																	public display of crocodile tears.
                          																	<br> <br> Of course, if the construction of JBJ is but a careful cherry-picking of the 
                          																	man's beliefs and actions, then his persona may have been turned into an 
                          																	ideological site to fulfill a specific purpose. In Singapore's politics, 
                          																	despite the country's economic success and material affluence, the one nagging 
                          																	concern amongst citizens and politicians alike has been the price of that 
                          																	success.
                          																	<br> <br> Political apathy, ignorance of national history, over-dependence on the state, 
                          																	and crass materialism winning out over idealism have all been perennial tropes 
                          																	in countless public forums and conferences dealing with local politics. The 
                          																	flight of talented Singaporeans overseas, adding to the estimated 150,000 
                          																	already abroad, is another side-effect of economic success.
                          																	<br> <br> JBJ had always been the embodiment of idealism, but he was often portrayed as 
                          																	naive and full of rhetoric against the better-grounded, pragmatic and 
                          																	dependable - and ruling - PAP. As an idealist, JBJ was seen by the authorities 
                          																	as unsuitable for the technocratic demands of modern-day governance. It was 
                          																	precisely the authorities' response to his idealism and passion for what he 
                          																	believed in that made him a walking, talking reminder for Singaporeans to stay 
                          																	out of politics. As the embodiment of idealism, he was deemed politically 
                          																	irrelevant.
                          																	<br> <br> Now, after his death, when his response is no longer possible, this embodiment 
                          																	can be fashioned for the purpose of nation-building. It was never the case that 
                          																	JBJ was irrelevant, rather he was inconvenient. Now that the negative 
                          																	connotations that came with his idealism are purged, leaving only opaque words 
                          																	like sincerity, tenacity and courage, the man can now be rehabilitated for 
                          																	national memory. We can now co-opt his idealism and passion for our own agenda.
                          																	<br> <br> And so we sanitize him. We speak of him as a fighter, but not what he fought 
                          																	for - pluralist democracy, human rights and press freedom. We speak of his 
                          																	great struggles, but not what he struggled against - PAP hegemony, 
                          																	authoritarianism, the use of punitive lawsuits in politics and so on. He was a 
                          																	fighter in a vacuum; he struggled against the unspoken; and JBJ is well on his 
                          																	way to becoming an abstract museum artifact in the halls of our national 
                          																	memory.
                          																	<br> <br> All nation-building projects are exercises in cognitive dissonance on a grand 
                          																	scale. Cognitive dissonance comes about when one's beliefs do not match 
                          																	reality, resulting in a modification of these personal beliefs because reality 
                          																	is harder to change than beliefs. And so too with nation-building: historical 
                          																	events and personalities cannot be totally erased, but they can, and often are, 
                          																	redefined and reinterpreted to match the beliefs and values of dominant 
                          																	interests.
                          																	<br> <br> If this were to happen to JBJ, then Singapore's loss would be aggravated. We 
                          																	would not only have lost the man, but also his values. We would have allowed 
                          																	his life, his struggles, and his beliefs to be redefined and reinterpreted by 
                          																	the very institutions he confronted.
                          																	<br> <br> <em><strong>Terence Chong</strong> is a fellow at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian

              <p><br> 1. Jeyaretnam, a lawyer, served as an MP for the Workers' Party of Singapore 
                          																	from 1981-86, and again from 1997-2001. He was a continual barb in the flesh of 
                          																	the ruling People's Action Party. In the course of his political career, he 
                          																	faced numerous court cases involving defamation suits and other charges, which 
                          																	led to his disbarment, disqualification from contesting elections, and 
                          																	bankruptcy, from which he was discharged last year. He leaves two sons and four 
                          																	grandsons.</p>

              <p>However, our differences were not personal. In 1993, one of you
              (Kenneth) wrote to Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then Prime Minister, to
              say that you found <span style="color: #ff0000;">employers in <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> reluctant to offer you a job, and your only explanation was that the
              employers felt the authorities would not welcome your employment
              because of your name</span>. Mr Goh replied with a letter which <span style="color: #000000;">could be shown
              to prospective employers,</span> to say that <span style="color: #ff0000;">the government did not hold
              anything against you</span>, and that employers should evaluate you fairly on
              your own merits, like any other candidate, because </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> needed every talented person that it could find. Mr Goh had previously
              made the same point to your brother Philip, whom he had invited to
              lunch. I am therefore happy that both of you have established
              yourselves in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
