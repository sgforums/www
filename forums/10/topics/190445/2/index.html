            <div class='col-md body'>I think it makes perfect sense for Gomez to setup the election department and the government. Such dirty tricks should not be in a mature political arena... Something like the Taiwan Ah Bian gunshot incident. I believe JG would do better if only he had not done this. Dispite the fact that I strongly disagree of MM Lee's sueing action I don't quite supportive of JG either. JG should be out of the politicial circle as trust is no more. Submitting a form to the election department is something quite important and urgent to forget it is rather unbelievable, and later come back to ask for it? Is he really that forgetful or so busy that such important details is forgotten? Furthermore Silvia Lim obviously was shielding him from later statement since she wasn't there at the point to see the transaction.( she was sitting behind) But it is understandable why Silvia Lim and LTK would shield him. Perhaps even they themsleves wouldn't sure of the real happening. Who does he wants to bluff? Of cause the ideal case of all political competition is the wrestle of abilities and capabilities rather than underlying tricks. So hope to see better opponent next time in the election. Sadly Alujunid was lost... but not undeservingly. Guess most people voted for WP is not for JG but Silvia Lim<br><br>I think the future of opposition is bright. The fact that Singaporean voted for PAP is not because they like PAP. But they have no other choice. If someone of equal abilities or better come from the opposition. people will likely voted for the opposition. You think Singaporeans are stupid to see that an absolute government is no good fo the country? We want a more free and better government but we won't risk it on someone lesser capable.</div>

Nobody can sue MM Lee and expect a fair trail and results in Singapore. Simple as that. It is a fact that EVERYBODY knows and singaporeans are starting to come to terms with and accept (from the fact that PAP remains strongly in power dispite its tactics).<br><br>Gomez not stupid enough to go down the path of TLH and JBJ....which is good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The circumstances of the case are such that it may be difficult to establish a criminal charge against Gomez beyond reasonable doubt and perhaps that's one reason the AGC decided not to prosecute.<br><br>However, Gomez would have a lower standard of proof if he would take a civil case against MM...just on the balance of probability. Since there are so many forumners who believe that he was innocent and that MM has defamed him by calling him a liar, why not clear his name?<br><br>So he may not win, but if he thinks he has a strong case, it would be difficult for the courts to dismiss him. An adverse judgment in the face of strong evidence in his favour will translate into more support for the Opposition.<br><br>Being silent, isn't he accepting the MM's description of him as being a liar and a cheat? Having been discredited and lost the elections, he will not have a place in Singapore politics again. If he tries to stand at the next election, PAP will point to his silence as acceptance of his guilt. This will overshadow any political overtures he attempts to make in the future. As such, he will become a liability for the WP.</div>

As for public interest, there is still public interest, but not public interest to prosecute him. The opinions in the forum well illustrate that.</div>
