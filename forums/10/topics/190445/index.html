He could have faced one year in jail if convicted.<br><br>Gomez was under investigation for alleged criminal intimidation and providing false information. Pending the outcome of the investigation, Gomez was barred from traveling to Sweden to work at a Stockholm-based research institute.<br><br>Before the parliamentary election, Gomez accused officials of misplacing his election papers. He later apologized after security camera footage showed he put the form in his bag, and claimed he forgot to file the document because he was distracted.<br><br>A police statement cited "several serious inconsistencies and discrepancies" in Gomez's accounts of the incident, and said the state prosecutor gave him a "stern warning."<br><br>The government speculated that Gomez had staged the incident in order to discredit the elections department. Opposition leaders, in turn, have accused the government, which exercises strict political controls, of trying to silence them with defamation suits and other heavy-handed tactics.<br><br>The ruling People's Action Party won 82 out of 84 elected seats, a result that left its near-total domination unchanged from the previous Parliament. But the percentage of votes won by the ruling party dropped to 66.6 percent from 75.3 percent in the 2001 election.<br><br>Gomez lost his race for office as a candidate in a multimember constituency.<br></div>

Gomez is more worried about loosing his job and paying rent instead of focusing on the rantings of the old lunatic Lee. Anyway if i was Gomez i wouldnt be worried about him, Granpa Lee may not be around during the next election. Heaven or hell might have a 1 way ticket waiting for him already by then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
