            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow's reflections (Today "A mandarin speaks his mind" 5.7.2006) on auto-piloting of policies by civil servants resulting in PTC's and NWC's sanctioning the continuing regular cost/wage increases are fully supported by forumers' various postings in this and many forums.<br><br>Past policies have resulted in high costs of living to Singaporeans because of unthinking following of ministers' and leaders' conceptual assumptions to no end.<br><br>All the policies have been exposed and answered by forumers. Robust debates were invited from ministers and MPs but none of them were able to reply various challenges to their policies.<br><br>The long and short of Mr. Ngiam's and forumers' view is without all the government support to corporatised services and GLCs to monopolistic fees' and public sector's (NWC) legalistic fee and fare increases the cost increases citizens experienced over the years will not have happened or will be moderated.<br><br>There is unfortunately a stoppage to new players entering the market to compete against new corporatised monopolies due to government megalomaniac assumption which went wrong.<br><br></div>

They rule with selfishness, self-centred, egotism, hypocrisy with crocodile tears for approving of casinos and turning singapore into a gambling den.<br>These <strong>s l u t s</strong> of singapore, all they are only caring for own pockets or the ''ceo'' have to be answerable to its ''share holders'' and to bring as much money as they can when they go to hell.<br><br>I felt very disgusting with our government nowadays. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
