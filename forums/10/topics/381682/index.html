              <h1 style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Parents: It was our last resort</strong></span></h1>
              <h2 style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: large; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Despite friends’ misgivings, NSF’s parents sue Mindef &amp; win</strong></span></h2>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">New Paper, 22 Feb 2009<br></span></strong><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,193584,00.html?"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;">TNP link</span></span></strong></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">THEIR household income is just $2,000. So how, their friends asked them, can they take on the Government?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">You will lose, their friends said. And you will be worse off because of the costs.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">But Mr Tan Kian Lee, 50, and his wife, Madam Hor Hong Kiow, 47, refused to buckle under the enormity of the challenge.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘It was a nerve-racking experience,’ said Mr Tan, of taking on the Ministry of Defence.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Their son, Chia Wee, had become an invalid after he was found unconscious while he was in National Service.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">He was their hope. He was to have gone to university and supported them when he graduated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan said in Mandarin: ‘My son began NS as a healthy soldier but he came out a vegetable. He used to jog and do standing broad jumps every day. Now, he’s like a baby.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">When four years of talks with Mindef and the Attorney-General’s Chambers came to naught, the couple sued Mindef for compensation – and took it all the way to High Court.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">On 16 Jan, the Tans’ dogged determination paid off when the High Court ruled that Chia Wee, now 26, was entitled to compensation.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘Many people have told us that we’re very brave to sue the</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> Government,’ Madam Hor, a bank teller, said in Mandarin, ‘especially when we’re not rich. But I believe anyone in our position would have done the same.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘Some people even told us we may lose the case as we were up against the Government and we’d have to pay costs if we lost.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘We’re not greedy. Going to court was really a last resort and we’re really grateful to our lawyer. Till today, our lawyer has not charged us for his work.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Their lawyer, Dr Lau Teik Soon, is a former People’s Action Party Member of Parliament for Serangoon Gardens.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Looking at photos of Chia Wee in happier times, Mr Tan, who is unemployed, sighed: ‘He had hoped to go to UniSIM to study business and support us after he graduated.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘He was enthusiastic about NS despite being a storeman. He obeyed instructions without complaint and always smiled when he left for the camp.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘Every day, we’d buy him supper so he could have his favourite burgers when he came home.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Shocked</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Chia Wee, a business diploma holder from Temasek Polytechnic, had told his parents he could do a variety of jobs with a business degree.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Mr Tan said: ‘Now, he can only stare at us when we visit him.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘We have accepted that he’ll never be able to look after us. At least, we’ll get some compensation so we can care for him.’</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The couple’s ordeal began when the Singapore Armed Forces called with the bad news that Chia Wee was discovered unconscious at the foot of his three-storey barracks at Seletar East Camp.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">He was found at 6pm on 3 Aug 2005.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan recalled: ‘I was so shocked that I could barely stand. My daughter, Chia Min, had to support me.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The tragedy affected Chia Min so much that she did badly for her O levels that year, scoring 29 points for her best five subjects.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">She re-sat for her O levels in 2006 and scored 15 points, qualifying for polytechnic courses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan and Madam Hor sought an explanation from Mindef but details were sketchy as there were no witnesses.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">One of Mr Tan’s friends, who lives in Pasir Ris, took him to a meet-the-people’s session with Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean in November 2005.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan said: ‘My friend spoke on my behalf and one of Mr Teo’s assistants wrote a letter. Within 10 days, Mindef replied, saying it was investigating.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In April 2006, Mindef officials met Mr Tan, informing him they did not know what led to Chia Wee’s tragedy as there were no witnesses. The ministry offered to give Mr Tan $500 a month for five years to help him care for Chia Wee at home.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mindef also said it would not provide additional compensation, claiming its checks showed Chia Wee was not hurt in the line of duty.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Not knowing what to do, Mr Tan delayed discharging his son, who remains in a step-down facility at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Why didn’t he just accept the monthly compensation of $500?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan said: ‘I wouldn’t get anything after five years and my son needs lifelong care. I was also worried that if I accepted this offer, it would mean I couldn’t pursue legal action against Mindef.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In March 2007, Mindef stopped paying for Chia Wee’s hospitalisation after having paid more than $30,000 for his medical treatment.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Worried</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan said: ‘I took that to mean Mindef was absolving itself of any liability. That’s unfair because my son got injured in camp, not while he was off-duty.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘At that point, my wife and I considered legal action as it was the only chance we had of getting compensation.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘It’s not that we want to leave Chia Wee in TTSH permanently, but we can’t afford to hire a nurse to care for him at home.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Madam Hor’s colleague recommended Dr Lau to the couple and he, together with Ms Rajvant Kaur, represented them for free.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In August 2007, the Tans had a meeting with the Attorney-General’s Chambers to resolve the dispute, but to no avail.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Dr Lau told The New Paper: ‘We were hoping to settle the issue of liability amicably but it wasn’t a meeting of two minds.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Soon after that, the Tans sued.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan said: ‘I spent two hours reading my 40-page affidavit every day. My English is limited and I was worried of slipping up while testifying.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">After a four-day hearing last month, Justice Tay Yong Kwang ruled in the Tans’ favour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mindef has not appealed against the verdict.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Dr Lau told The New Paper that the next step is to assess the degree of Chia Wee’s disability and, using Manpower Ministry guidelines, work out how much he should get.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan said: ‘We would have had to pay the A-G’s costs if we had lost. It was a risk we had to take. But if we didn’t take this step, we wouldn’t get any compensation.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘Of course, we’re happy to win. After such a long time, we finally got justice.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">
              <hr>
              </span></div>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>They need to buy $3,000 bed for son</strong> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">THE Tans have no proper bed of their own.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Now they will have to buy a motorised special bed costing $3,000 for their son.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The couple, who also have a daughter in polytechnic, live in a spartan three-room flat at Old Airport Road.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">It is a flat that indicates their modest income.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The family sleep on mattresses on the floor instead of on beds.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Their living room has a sofa and two armchairs, but no coffee table.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Instead of Chia Wee supporting them in their old age, Mr Tan and Madam Hor will now have to care for him for the rest of his life.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">They spend about $2,000 a year on their daughter’s school fees.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">They intend to use the compensation, which the court will assess at a later date, to hire a nurse to care for Chia Wee at home.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">His vegetative state means he has to be fed through a tube and wear diapers all the time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Tans have decided against placing Chia Wee in a nursing home as it will cost between $1,200 and $1,800 a month.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Tan said: ‘If our son stays in a home, we’d have to spend money on transport to see him every day.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘I’m not working, so I can care for him at home. We hope to use the compensation money to buy diapers, milk and a proper bed for him.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Affordable</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Bendemeer Medical Marketing &amp; Nursing Services, which provides training for home nursing, is willing to work out an affordable package for the Tans.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Its head nurse, who asked to be known as Ms Angie, said: ‘We can train Mr Tan to change the diapers, clean him and top up the feeding tube.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">She added that Chia Wee’s parents will need to acquire a nursing bed, the type used in hospitals, to prevent him from developing bedsores.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">She explained: ‘The nursing beds are motorised and have ripple mattresses which have an alternating pressure pump and a special air-mattress. These will boost blood circulation and prevent bedsores.’</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Such beds cost around $3,000 but MsAngie said the company can source for donated beds from previous patients.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">In April 2006, Mindef officials met Mr Tan, informing him they did not know what led to Chia Wee’s tragedy as there were no witnesses. The ministry offered to give Mr Tan $500 a month for five years to help him care for Chia Wee at home.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">Mindef also said it would not provide additional compensation, claiming its checks showed Chia Wee was not hurt in the line of duty.</span></p>

              <p><strong>I think it's generally accepted that you are hurt in your workplace or place of duty, it's considered as happening in the line of duty.</strong></p>

              <p>Beyond the gung-ho inspiring promotion clips of the mighty 3rd Generation SAF fighting abilities in the Air, Sea and Land - there seems little support to the SAF personnel when anyone is injured or become disabled in the line of fire.</p>
              <p>It is shocking that $500 per month is offered for a period of 5 years - which amounts to no more then $6000 a year, or a total of $30,000 at the end of five years.</p>
              <p>Is that the SAF budget to support an injured SAF personnel when the budget for equipment acquisition will amount to billions ?</p>
              <p>This seems to be the standard PAP pragmatism in exploiting human talent to the maximum, and discarding the "remaining pulp after the juice has been extracted" - as can be seen in the non-existent budget to look after aged Singaporeans who have retired and after giving the best years of their lives for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Considering that this PAP Government is now contributing SAF men and equipment to support the US military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and UN activities in East Timor - Singaporeans should make the PAP Government aware of their duty to Singaporeans injured in the line of duty.</p>
              <p>Even as there are no dedicated Military Hospitals in the scale as the US Veteran's Military Hospital, the Singapore's Government owned hospitals should form the basic framework to support injured Singaporeans serving in the SAF.</p>
              <p>The support to injured Singaporeans serving in the SAF - should be for the duration of the life of the injured, and nothing less can be acceptable.</p>
