            <div class='col-md body'>hmm..<br>SM Lee is not entirely senile.I believe his contributions to Singapore is greatly appreciated by Singaporeans. His foresight has led us to be a leading country in terms of industry and economy.<br>But now things have changed, the rise of India and China and regional competitions has led to necessary reforms in the government. The SIA pilots issue has been taken care of by SM Lee, and it has been solved,which proves til now he is still a able SM.<br>Mr Goh as his sucessor proved to be as sucessful as him. They have served the country for about 3 centuries.<br><br>the next step for our country is : is Mr(small)Lee as able. Or is he another George(small)Bush, who is disillusioned by war.</div>
