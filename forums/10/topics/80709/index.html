            <div class='col-md body'>Hello!<br><br>I'm doing a study on 'Lookism', the discrimination of people based on his/her physical appearances. Is this form of discrimination prevalent in the Singapore workplace? Do you have any experiences whereby during the course of applying of a job or promotion or salary increase, you're discriminated based on your looks?<br><br>Of course, I'm refering to Lookism in industries where good looks is not a pre-requisite for career success, such as admin and clerical work, and not in industries like sales and customer service.<br><br>Thanks in advance!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks is impt. when first applying for a job. When there are lots of competition for the same job, the employer will select those who look pleasant for the interview. That's the reason why people pay so much to go to makeover studios to have a more 'professional' photo taken. When it comes to promotion, usually it is based on performance. Where I worked, the co. promoted a mature 40+ lady cos she is very hardworking rather than younger, prettier ones.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Discrimination based on looks...<br><br>So, assume same race, same sex. whether a person's looks give him/her an advantage in life: in the workplace, and society at large.<br><br>My two cents: Looks are part of the packaging of a person, and people are attracted to good packaging. It applies to almost all social settings, so yup, even in a job which does not require one to be handsome or pretty, it helps if you look presentable. It is about presentation. Natural good looks naturally enhances the presentation, ceteris paribus.<br><br>i rem in one edition of the show 20/20, they examined this issue. How a person's looks affects his lot in life. A few scenarios were featured.<br><br>One was the job interview. They had 2 women attend interviews for the same position in the company. They had both of them similarly well-dressed, with similar resumes and they both responded to questions with the same demeanor, etc. Turns out, right from the start when the interviewer first sees the either of the ladies, his attitude was different already. No points for guessing who was treated with more respect. To the better looking lady, the interviewer was more polite, friendlier. He inquired about how her day had been and was generally more inclined to make small talk. When it came to interview proper, the ques he asked were either borderline unrelated to work, or embarassingly simple ques that she would find difficult to cock up. To the less pretty lady, his whole disposition changed. Tone was different, more gruff. When they sat down, he cut to the chase, no small talk, no asking about weather etc. Totally no effort spent to make the interviewee comfortable, unlike with the better looking lady. Mid-way through the interview, he described the job as a tough one, and that anyone hoping to land the position better be prepared for hard times. Wahkaoz, like discouraging people from taking the job like that.<br><br>Okay, this scenario involved two women interviewee and and male interviewer. So naturally he was more inclined to give the job to the chioer one. Normal what, for a man. But guess what, the scenario was replayed with 2 MEN. One had a better looking facial features and a full head of hair, and the other was a baldling chap with sunken eyes. To the former, this interviewer was definitely alot more cordial. Same rules apply in this case as in the former bw 2 women.<br><br>I think we can just look around us to see that people who are better looking tend to be accepted more readily than those who appear less impressive. From there, they gain more confidence and in turn appear to be more attractive. People are drawn to confidence. So there, the cycle continues. To anyone: how many times have we, ourselves, judged a person based on his/her looks?</div>
