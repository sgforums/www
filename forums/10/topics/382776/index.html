              <p>I am a resident of Lakeholmz condominim and I am writing to express my disappointment at Boon Lay Community Club for disbursing a fund of $3,410 for a Children’s Day cum Hari Raya celebration held inside my condominium on 3rd October 2009:</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18109" title="8th_Council_Meeting_6" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/8th_Council_Meeting_61.JPG" alt="8th_Council_Meeting_6" width="540" height="760"></p>
              <p>I felt it is not right for public funds to be used for a function held at a condominium especially during the current economic downturn which has affected many Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Attached below is a statement of account declared by the condominium’s Management Committee for the event. MP Madam Ho Geok Choo was the guest-of-honor for the evening:</p>
              <div><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18107" title="grantlakeholmz" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/grantlakeholmz.jpg" alt="grantlakeholmz" width="540" height="760"></div>
              <p>Many of us, the residents of Lakeholmz , are not even aware of such a big ‘open house’ had occurred on this day , 3rd Oct. No notice was ever put up.</p>
              <p>A fellow resident, Margaret Tan (not her real name) wrote to the People’s Association (PA) to seek clarification on 5th November.</p>
              <p>She got a reply from Mr Dennis Seah who claimed that Boon Lay CC was allowed to use its funds to host the event as it was meant to promote “community bonding” for all residents of Boon Lay followed by another reply from Boon Lay CC’s Senior Manager Miss Diana Tan who revealed that more residents from the condominium attended the event (17o) than those living in HDB flats (50).</p>
              <p>During a difficult period like this, the CC should be more discreet in spending public funds on non-essential events as such. Furthermore, it was held in a condominium outside the purview of the CC and PA.</p>
              <p>The condominium management committee should pay at least part of the expenses incurred since the event was attended by more condominium than HDB residents.</p>
              <p>The condominium management committee members who organised this event, without getting consensus from all subsidary proprietors of Lakeholmz, in allowing  Boon Lay residents into Lakeholmz, should pay for all the extra expenses incurred since the event was an ‘open house’.</p>
              <p>The disbursement of $3,410 public funds should be refunded, since the event was more by condominium members than attended by HDB residents.</p>

              <p><strong>Addendum: Official replies from PA and Boon Lay CC</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Ms  Margaret Tan,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>
              <p>This Hari Raya Celebration mentioned by you was jointly organised by the<br>Boon Lay Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC) and Lakehomlz Condominium to promote community bonding and interaction among residents.  It was open to all residents in Boon Lay, not just from the condominium.</p>
              <p>The People’s Association (PA) encourages our Grassroots Organisations to<br>organise activities cater to all and aim to bring residents of different<br>backgrounds together.  This is to allow residents to get to know one<br>another and build friendship.  The CCC also has many projects which cater<br>to helping needy residents.</p>
              <p>Once again, we thank you for your feedback.  We wish to assure you that the<br>CCC is careful with the use of its fund for the benefit of residents.</p>
              <p>If you have any other query, please do call Mr Pow Choon Ghee, Deputy<br>Director, South West Community Development Division at 63405148.<br><strong><br>Dennis Seah</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Director (Quality Management Division)<br>for Quality Service Manager<br>People’s Association</strong></p>

              <p>Dear Margaret,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>
              <p>Posters for this event were placed at the Boon Lay Community Centre (CC) ’s counter.  In addition, the Residents’ Committees also sold tickets through their volunteers.</p>
              <p>For this event, out of the 170 participants, 50 were from the HDB estates.  The rest were residents of the condominium.  We are happy that this event has created an opportunity for residents of different background to get to know one another.</p>
              <p>We welcome you to join us in our future events.  You can enquire at the CC or look out for the notices at the RC Centres.  Please feel free to call me if you need further clarifications</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
