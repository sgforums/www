            <div class='col-md body'>Hello All,<br><br>I have been a reader of this forum for the past two years, but have never really contributed until now.  I feel compelled to do so due to the declining quality of many threads which have degenerated into slinging matches. Many contributors seem to lack any real knowledge of the issues discussed, and only appear interested in complaining endlessly, portraying government policies as bad, or attacking other users. The result is a whinging culture here.<br><br>That is not to say that all policies are perfect. In fact, many deserve public discussion- but just not the sort of quality (or lack of) that appears here. There is no real effort to know the issues in-depth, and what is produced is the sort of talk one finds in kopitiams on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I also find a greater inclination to quickly label those who disagree as 'anti-govt' and those who agree as 'pro-govt'. There is no need to divide people so readily into two opposing camps.<br><br></div>

You may find my posting pretty provoking, especially the use of titles, but this is what it is meant to do; provoke your mind, a mind teaser, to let most people to think out of the box. Not everybody could do such thing....nope, I am not boasting or anything like that, but it takes someone with original ideas (these ideas might have been explored by others, but unknown to them, yet, they are capable to come up with the same ideas on their own; this is originality), perspective to come up with such thought provoking ideas. And I think only a small percentage of people could escape the intensive social engineering that PAP has setup via the mass media and education system, to become an "independent thinker" of his own right. Most people would probably "feel" that something is not right, but not able to figure out what exactly is wrong with the whole system. With some consolation, the percentage of those who managed to escape the brain washing and social engineering is getting bigger. That's how I find it, which I termed as "enlightenment" out of the MATRIX.<br><br>As normal human being, we cannot profess to know everything under the sun; I doubt LKY knows everything under the sun. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Political leaders are not expected to be so, but only to make sound judgment and decisions. It is silly to expect political parties to come up with "researches", "studies" and such; it would be making a mockery of those good fellows who many have spent almost their lifetime to do research on any issues we are talking here. Please respect them. You expect PAP to know exactly what New Water treatment is all about in exact details to sell New Water to Singaporeans? No, I do not expect them to be "experts" on ALL technical topics. They are afterall, supposedly to be leaders that have specific role to make good judgment based on the "COLLECTIVE" information provided by many people of great expertise. Thus, I think your expectation of "opposition" must be managed.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>

I feel compelled to do so due to the declining quality of many threads which have degenerated into slinging matches. Many contributors seem to lack any real knowledge of the issues discussed, and only appear interested in complaining endlessly, portraying government policies as bad, or attacking other users. The result is a whinging culture here.<br><br>That is not to say that all policies are perfect. In fact, many deserve public discussion- but just not the sort of quality (or lack of) that appears here. There is no real effort to know the issues in-depth, and what is produced is the sort of talk one finds in kopitiams on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I also find a greater inclination to quickly label those who disagree as 'anti-govt' and those who agree as 'pro-govt'. There is no need to divide people so readily into two opposing camps.<br><br></div></blockquote>Whinging occurs because people are not happy . Happens everywhere , even australia.  I do enjoy questioning  bad policies with plenty of enthusiam. However saying all these, I do feel hindered to do anything in Singapore .  About a few years back when I was a student , I once took part in a live "open" discussion where there were 2 MPs answering questions. I asked something sensitive and I think it was a direct hit on their policies- and I was asked for my ic number and name by one particular MP. How did you think I felt and of course I was told never to bring what I said out of the room - it's a sudden sensation that you could be marked down.  I was asking a simple question and imho got rail roaded despite being told to speak my mind before the start of the discussion.  It is people like me who comes into these forums to speak because there is no point in going on a face to face confrontation with people in power.<br><br>The aussies however enjoy a robust conversation and they are open ...they don't care about identification - free country as such.</div>
