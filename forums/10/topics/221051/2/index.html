            <div class='col-md body'>Happy Planet Index<br><br>Your personal Happy Planet Index (HPI) is 15.3 Sorry to say that this is below the world average of 46. For those living in the UK, youÂ’ll also be disappointed to hear your score is below the national average. Your score is below that of your country, 40.8.<br><br>Below is a breakdown of the various components that make up your HPI score.<br>You:<br>15.3<br>Average:<br>43.3<br>[Average is of all online responses to this survey - not the average for your country]<br><br>Life Expectancy<br><br>Congratulations. Your life expectancy is above average for your gender and country. Whether it's eating well, not smoking, getting regular exercise, or just being lucky enough to have the right genes, you're doing something right. However, nobody's perfect and we could all improve our health a little! Aside from getting all the above bits of your lifestyle right, there are some more surprising factors that can influence your life expect - for example, giving up your car, avoiding living alone, moving out of the city or shrugging off stress.<br>You:<br>77.7<br>Average:<br>80.8<br>[Average is of all online responses to this survey - not the average for your country]<br><br>Ecological Footprint<br><br>Your ecological footprint is 6.15 global hectares, or 3.42 planets. This is equivalent to the average in Ireland, Norway or Singapore.<br><br>Your ecological footprint is about average for the country you live in.<br><br>Oh dear! You are using between three and five times your share of the planet's resources, even assuming no resources are set aside for other species. That's well above the world average, and even above the average for most industrialised countries. Perhaps it's time to start taking action. Here are some of the most effective steps that everyone can make to reduce their footprint:<br><br>1. Leave your car in the garage. Car use has a huge impact on ecological footprint. Obviously it's more difficult for people in certain circumstances, but where possible, try to use public transport more. Or, even better, get on a bike!<br>2. It's obvious, but we have to say it. Conserve energy. Turn off the lights when you leave a room, buy energy-efficient bulbs and appliances, turn off your TV completely, rather than leave it on standby.<br>3. Reduce your waste. If there are ways to recycle where you live, try and do so. If you have a garden, start a compost heap. Re-use plastic bags. Give away clothes you don't use, rather than throwing them away. There are hundreds of little things you can do.<br>4. You don't have to become vegetarian, but cutting down on meat, particularly beef, and particularly from animals fed by imported soya feed, is an effective step to reducing your footprint.<br>5. It has to be said that air travel is one of the biggest contributors to many people's footprints. For example, flying direct from London to Sydney and back would add 5.44 g ha to your footprint - that's the average Briton's footprint for an entire year. Flights with a connection add even more polluting air miles.<br><br>You:<br>6.15<br>Average:<br>5.43<br>[Average is of all online responses to this survey - not the average for your country]<br><br>Life Satisfaction<br><br>Oh dear. You reported a life satisfaction of 3. Sorry that things aren't working out. At a national level, only one country scores as low as you - Burundi (and this score is an estimate based on objective data and reduced to account for the ongoing war in the country). Compared with other individuals, in the World Values Survey, 15% of respondents worldwide, and 4.6% of British respondents reported a life satisfaction of 3 or lower.<br>You:<br>3<br>Average:<br>6.74<br>[Average is of all online responses to this survey - not the average for your country]<br><br>Well-being<br><br>The new economics foundation (nef) recognises that there's more to life than feeling good, which is why our model for well-being is based on four domains Â– personal feelings, personal functionings, social feelings and social functionings. 'Feelings' refers to your attitude to the way you, your future and society are. 'Functionings' looks at whether you have the opportunities to do the things that bring you well-being. Like with life satisfaction, a score of 5 is theoretically the middle score, but, given the way most people respond to surveys, is below average.<br>Personal Feelings<br><br>In this online questionnaire, personal feelings are assessed with two questions Â– one testing your optimism and one testing your self-esteem.<br><br>You have some anxieties about the future or yourself which are affecting your overall well-being.

Either it is very dull and unrewarding, or it is very stressful, leaving you little time to do the things you enjoy - or a bit of both! Are they any ways you could make it a little better for you? Alternatively, one way to relieve the boredom of work, can be to find other focuses of interest.

But the ability of Singapore to fulfill these needs are very limited. You can see the difference when we compare Singapore with other developed countries. There, issues of gay rights, religion, race, abortion, euthanasia, stem cell research, freedom of speech and foreign policy are very important. Here, although we are as advanced economically as they are, we are still concerned with the 'lower-level' needs such as HDB upgrading, GST increase, employment.<br><br>I'm not saying this is bad. Actually, I find that these issues are alot more important but we do have 'higher level' needs that maybe we are surpressing. The religion guy has a point in that maybe religion could address the problems of these higher needs. But religion is not the only solution.<br><br>Another thing I find interesting/distressing is the fact that when the Governments says that Life Sciences would be a booming industry , alot of people flocked to study Life Sciences. I was wondering if they have dreams of their own. Perhaps, we should choose what we like to do, instead of what we think will bring us material comfort.<br><br>The other problem is I think is that we tend to rank people according to their wealth. So, if you are wealthy you are more well-respected than others. Other intangible things are not considered when we decide who we respect. As a  result, we perhaps sacrifice our happiness in pursuit of wealth, hoping that it would pay off in the long-run. The problem is the pursuit of wealth is a never-ending race. At some point, we have to stop and say that this is as far as we want to go.</div>
