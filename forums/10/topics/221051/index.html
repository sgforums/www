            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I am a newbie - qing duo duo zhi jiao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Today I want to discuss something.<br><br>Singapore is a economic super-success story of Asia, right? Always top 10 here and top 20 there.<br><br>We are damn rich. Last time coffeeshop - now coffeehouse.<br><br><strong>Then why are we so unhappy?</strong><br><br>Last time I always thought two mysteries of Singapore:<br><br>1. We damn rich but very unhappy. In fact the rich people are lagi unhappy.<br><br>2. We success story but yet no pride. Everyone has considered migrating, even foreign talents just want to stepping stone.<br><br>Why? Why?<br><br><strong>My explanation is related to these few points:</strong><br><br>1. We not happy because we only compare up never compare down.<br><br>2. We not happy because we study too much, work too hard and f**k too little.<br><br>3. We not happy because the weather is hot like f**k, some more got annual haze.<br><br>4. We got no pride because our national culture cannot take off. Singapore "identity" is shirts with orchid pattern that nobody really wears. Singlish also not allowed. Can only use the damn bizarre "newscaster" accent which nobody really speaks.<br><br>5. We got not pride because we never had pride to begin with. Everyone was and still is an immigrant just passing through.<br><br>6. We got no pride because army say "too much pride ah? Knock it down twenty!". Pride instantly gone. No wonder our char bor all go for foreign talent.<br><br>How to cure? How?<br></div>

This is because GDP per capita does not take into account the distribution of wealth.

These help to improve quality of life, but they are not reflected in the GDP per capita.

The gov. must later make an open move that everybody in Singapore know that they <span style="font-style: italic;">help</span> the poor as the increase of GST was intended to <span style="font-style: italic;">help</span> the poor. I dun think they can assumed rich pple will be more affected by the gst than the poor. <strong>If</strong> thats the case, it affects our economy as well while poor pple dun shop coz of gst increase.<br><br>Back to the topic, i think pple in SG are either stressed from the high standard of living or they cant be easily satisfied with life...

            <div class='col-md body'>Your post, threadstarter, is very much I like. I like to discuss about this topic.<br><br>I think Singaporeans are unhappy because they are overworked, simple as that.<br><br>Here in Singapore, students are always tops in international competitions.<br><br>Workforce, although no international competition, I think also tops in productivity compared internationally.<br><br>You often read about how the average student here spend the most hours in doing homework, or maybe top 3 or top 5 in the world, forgot.<br><br>Same too about average employees work hours in a week.<br><br>Meanwhile, the inverse is true when we read about how many hours is spent in a week for sex. Always bottom, or bottom 3 whatever.<br><br>This kind of work work work environment produces material wealth, but no emotional wealth.<br><br>Like producing material wealth takes time, producing emotional wealth also takes time. But all attention is focused on material wealth.<br><br>Singapore is unique, small country, no resources, but very ambitious. How to be ambitious? By pumping the human resource, whether in education or business.<br><br>It is true the average Singaporean is a good student and good worker, and the economy shows that as a result. The statistics show that.<br><br>But the cost is your happiness.<br><br>Unfortunately we dont measure happiness. There is no statistics for that. People wont bother to design a Happiness Index. It will be deemed as quasi science, junk even.<br><br>It is overlooked area. Therefore it suffers.<br><br>And frankly, maybe this situation will last for much longer. Simply because Singapore fundamental condition wont change much. Unless maybe if it can turn itself into a tourism haven or suddenly it find oil.<br><br>If nothing much change on the underlying level, then nothing will change in its society too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Errr.....I dont know about the pride thing / national identity thing.<br><br>I think maybe that will require a separate discussion, and maybe not so much related to happiness, although it is quite a serious issue too.<br><br>To talk more about happiness, I left out one more thing:<br><br>Religion.<br><br>Here in Singapore, many people are atheist.<br><br>It can be said a part of that is because of government policy.<br><br>Here if you take out money from your wallet and look at it, you cannot find any reference to God.<br><br>It is pretty telling.<br><br>Religion can be misunderstood, I dont want to bring out the religious 'animosity' or religious principles/ rituals and whether they are good or bad.<br><br>What I want to mention is, religion is a kind of faith.<br><br>Faith is a kind of spiritual wealth.<br><br>With faith, with religion, you can find inner peace and happiness, you will see life differently, you will view world differently.<br><br>With this kind of spiritual wealth, you will be more happy.<br><br>Here in Singapore there are many atheists, therefore there are many people who dont know why they live in this world, dont know why they are like robots everyday work work work, and dont have a direction.<br><br>I truly believe the big proportion of atheists, and lack of spirituality, contribute to the average happiness level.</div>
