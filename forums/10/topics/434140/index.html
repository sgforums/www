              <p>Member of Parliament (MP)  Denise Phua said that staff from a government agency were verbally abused by highly-educated residents in an affluent estate.</p>
              <p>The MP for Moulmein-Kallang GRC wrote in a Facebook status update on Thursday that these residents used vulgarities to scold the civil servants, who felt discouraged after the incident.</p>
              <p>Some who reacted to her Facebook post were sympathetic to the staff who experienced such behaviour from well-educated Singaporeans, with one saying, "We are a civilised society and this is uncalled for."</p>
              <p>Others have described such behaviour as part of a "vicious cycle" where "difficult" civil servants abuse their authority and consequently residents treat them poorly. The situation is then worsened when these civil servants react badly to such treatment.</p>
              <p>One netizen, <em>New Cow, </em>recalled witnessing an incident when a government officer insisted that that the co-owner in a flat application must be present for the man to collect his house keys, despite his wife being in the hospital to give birth.</p>
              <p>As a result, according to the netizen, the man gave up his chance to collect his house key.</p>

              <p>While she did know the context of the case, Ms Phua replied that she would use this incident as a learning point to work on "two of the most difficult life skills: giving and receiving feedback."</p>

              <p>Although I do agree to an extent that verbal abuse in public is mostly un-necessary and abit childish, MP's and others who work in such field-of-work should be prepared for situations like this as part of their job.....like it or not.</p>

              <p>I tell u guys one of the countless unreasonable treatment i have when i work.Last time,when i work as a pump attendant,got one fuking b!tchy Chinese auntie say she wanna pump full tank petrol.After i pump full tank petrol,n she made payment inside the Cashier counter,she suddenly tell the Cashier that she only wanna pump $20 dollars,n that i have make a mistake.</p>
              <p>I was being scolded fiercely by her,n she insist that she only willing to pay $20(the full tank petrol is $80+).I try to explain,but she simply ask me to shut up.In the end,i was forced to pay $40+ to the company after the petrol discount.And my gross salary only $1000+</p>
              <p>Now,it was not my fault,coz i know she deliberately wanna push the blame on me so that she can make less payment.I have encounter such customers before in the past while i work in other petrol kiosk.Its very hard to prevent this kind of incident since there is no eye witness n the driver who intend to cheat the petrol kiosk money n make less payment will divert the pump attendant concentration by asking alot of question.This type of drivers are determined to scam.</p>
              <p>Now,another reason its not my fault coz in other countries like Malaysia.Drivers have to make payment first,before pumping any petrol.This is to prevent the incident that i mention above from happening.Say a driver pay $20,he cannot pump $40 dollars n say its pump attendant fault n that he only want to pump $20.</p>
              <p>But in Singapore,our Pigs PAP government law is to let the drivers pump petrol first,make payment later.In the end,who suffer?Driver pump petrol n drive away without making payment,who suffer?Its the low pay workers like pump attendant n cashier suffer.The Pigs PAP ministers say they care for low pay worker,in the end,the care is like this???Without altering the rules when its necessary n out-dated?</p>
              <p>And besides,after i met such incident,who should i complain to?Which minister?LKY,LHL,or boot-licker GCT?They only care about how much money they can make although lack of money is no longer an issue to them.And as if they can bring all the money into their grave after they died.Spit!!!</p>
