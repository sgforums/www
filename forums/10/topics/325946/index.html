              <p>During his 30 yrs term as CEO,INCOME also adopted this</p>

              <p>he totally changed his mind.</p>
              <p>Now he made a 180 degree turn!</p>
              <p>Why?</p>

              <p>I am now working as a consultant to a life insurance company in

              in early 2009...</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>Generally, my advice is:<br><br>1. Buy low cost term life and medical insurance to protect your earnings<br>2. Invest your savings in a low cost fund to get an attractive return<br>3. Avoid high cost and complicated financial products<br>4. Educate yourself to make the right choice<br>5. Buy directly, to avoid paying the high commission insurance agents </blockquote>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">There are 3 points i dunt agree:</h3>
              <p>timing to buy insurance</p>
              <p>term plan(pro and con)</p>
              <p>and the amount of coverage.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.To buy a insurance after getting marry is too late.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Even there is nobody depends on u,u have to have insurance coverage</p>
              <p>NOT LATER THAN secondary graduation.</p>
              <p>Accidents and illness may strike any time.</p>
              <p>No parents want to collect insurance compensations arising</p>
              <p>from his kids misforunate.</p>
              <p>But if something really happen,who will take care of your parents?</p>
              <p>Insurability may disappear over night.</p>
              <p>When u are eligible,u are a honey to FA.</p>
              <p>When u have problems to get approval,u are just a</p>
              <p>dumped client card---not insurable or high rating.</p>
              <p>Very few FA  or their managers want to take this trouble.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">who will be most likely  eligible for insurance,ie</span></strong></p>
              <p>social and economic factors.</p>
              <p>reasonablly good health, physcially and mentally</p>
              <p>medical history of your family</p>
              <p>not bankcrupt</p>
              <p>no serious criminal records</p>
              <p>not involved in serious civil suit</p>
              <p>no high debts(who know if u do silly thing after a certain period)</p>
              <p>Nowadays,to get a insurance approved not so easy.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.Term Plan--pros and cons</span></strong></p>
              <p>Term plan is cheap.But not a trendy and very hard to tell your</p>
              <p>clients that they cant get any return or profits from insurance !!</p>
              <p>MAS and stake holders (insurance co,Insurance professional bodies etc)</p>
              <p>shall review their effort to educate public in insurance,in the past few decades.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Public just mix up insurance,savings and investment.</em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">One of the drawback of term plan is it may not be renewable</span></p>
              <p>if your health change.Or the Plan allow u to renew but with high rating.</p>
              <p>In life plan,touch wood,if u are sick after u get approval,</p>
              <p>u are still covered and without paying extra premium,ie no</p>
              <p>higher rating.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Another is the term plan may not be convertiable to life plan</span>.</p>
              <p>Even u at ,say aged 60,</p>
              <p>can afford to buy and want to</p>
              <p>leave somethings for your grandson to study ,</p>
              <p>u will feel sad if they dunt renew your term plan.</p>
              <p>there is no such problem in life plan.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.Coverage of 3 to 5 years of your
                                              income is too low</strong></span></p>
              <p>If we follow Mr Tan advices,the coverage for a man in the street will be like this.</p>
              <p>Let say Z earn a SG median income(just estimated),</p>
              <p>say S$3500 per month.5 years gross income is $210,000</p>
              <p>ok,say 250,000.Tell me ,my frens,is it enough for a widow</p>
              <p>or widower?</p>
              <p>SPOUSE DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT INSURANCE.</p>
              <p>BUT WIDOW/ER WANT COMPENSATION,THE MORE</p>
              <p>IS BETTER.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I use the replacement of insured's income concept to calculate</p>
              <p>the coverage required.With a estimated  yield or return AND the insured's</p>
              <p>net income,we calculate the insurance coverage required.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ie Net annual income divided by estimated return from</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">insurance compensation = coverage required</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net annual income</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assume Z spends 20% of his gross income,</p>
              <p>including cash and all CPF,in income tax,transport,entertainments,</p>
              <p>clothing etc.His total balance of cash and CPF will be $2800.</p>
              <p>ie $33,600 per year.ie net annual income.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estimated return from insurance compensation</span></span></p>
              <p>This is the fund to generate income to replace Z's net income</p>
              <p>for the family to survive IN LONG TERM.</p>
              <p>So the savings or investments must be almost risk</p>
              <p>free or very low risk.</p>
              <p>This is very hard to guess.Fixed deposit just 0.5 to 1.5 %.</p>
              <p>Share and funds,woooo.I dunt know.</p>
              <p>So,i just pick one from the air say 5% to illustrate.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Coverage required</span></span></p>
              <p>$33,600 / 0.05=$672,000</p>
              <p>I know u will say wa!!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">How to achieve the required coverage</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">buy a life plan plus maxium term riders,say 5 years term riders.</span></span></p>
              <p>and mortage insurance(is a must)</p>
              <p>In SG,term riders in the range of 2 to 5 times of life plan.</p>
              <p>ask FA the best options.FA is one of your important fren in your</p>
              <p>life.The future of your family is on their hands.Buy them lunch</p>
              <p>or give them gifts.Trust me,The return is very high.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">U must buy a mortage insurance .It is damn cheap,</span></span></p>
              <p>compared with life plans and even term plan.</p>
              <p>MRTA---mortgage reducing term plan.</p>
              <p>Even u dunt eat lunch few days in a month,u MUST</p>
              <p>take up MRTA.This will save your family from  a lot of pains</p>
              <p>when u cant produce income,either not around</p>
              <p>or disable.Use hamburger  to exchange for home!!</p>

              <p>A poor widow cannot choose his job or the man she will</p>
              <p>sleep with.</p>
              <p>But a widow with reasonable insurance pay out</p>
              <p>can choose NOT TO WORK to stay at home</p>
              <p>to take care the kids 24/7 or choose her job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #99cc00;">The best is she can choose no need sleep with another </span></p>

              <p><br>Buy terms plans and invest in low cost funds?</p>
              <p>This is something the investment savvy people would do. <strong>There is only conflict of interest when there is a better alternative and he gave advice against the interest of the client.</strong> Where is the conflict when most independent financial advisers would recommend term plans and low cost funds? That is the smart way to maximise retirement savings.</p>
              <p>The real conflict of interest lies with commissioned based agents who recommend poor products with high commissions for clients.</p>

              <p>I agree with lionnoisy on your point of view. However, I would like to correct some of your wordings.</p>
              <p>1) Term plans Renewability</p>
              <p>There are term plans which are GUARANTEED renewable. Which means that you can renew your policy, despite your health deterioration.</p>
              <p>2) Term plans Returns</p>
              <p>If you survive the period of coverage, the premiums paid will be FULLY RETURN to the client.</p>
              <p>3) Whole Life plans</p>
              <p>Term plans offer a cheaper premium and a higher coverage than whole life plans.</p>

              <p>I think that one should be selective in accepting advises.</p>
              <p>Be it a 30 year veteran or a 1 year rookie. It does not naturally means that advises from 30 year experience is correct and a 1 year is wrong.</p>
              <p>Both parties are from different era, with an age gap of at least 30. Both parties have different perspective, and i don agree with the saying where 'the old ones are always correct'.</p>
              <p>Financial planning is a process that utilises theory and application technique. You can agree with all the things he said, but it does not mean that it applies to you.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your replied. Greatly appreciated.</p>
              <p>MediShield is the basic medical insurance that covers large hospital bills. It is automatically enrolled as long as you contributed to CPF or choose to opt out.</p>
              <p>If you have purchase any CPF-approved medical insurance with AIA, Prudential, Great Eastern, Aviva or NTUC, you will be able to enhance your coverage to as-charged for most of the benefits. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is how Medishield works.</span></p>
              <p>Example: You are admitted to restructured hospital, class C ward for 10 days (including 8 days of ICU) for a heart operation, the total bill will come up to $5,850.</p>
              <p>Assumed that the claimable amount is $5,850. You wll be required to pay a deductible amount of $1,000.  Next, you have to contribute 10-20% of the co-insurance, which comes to $785.</p>
              <p>So in total, you had claimt $4,065 from MediShield and only need to pay $1,785.</p>
              <p>Above example extracted from the 'Enhancing MediShield' Booklet.</p>
              <p>If you had not purchase the cheap Medishield, you would have to come up with the full sum of the bill, which is $5,850. That translate to your total medishield premium up to age 65.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, on top of the benefit and claims, one important factor to consider is the eligibility to make the claim.</p>
              <p>If you were unlucky to undergo the heart surgery without any medical insurance, you will be unable to make ANY claim that is related to your heart, even if you buy it the next day. As it is considered a pre-existing illness, it will be excluded.</p>
              <p>Hope that can help you understand more about MediShield.  </p>
