              <p>Just took a holiday back to Singapore and I must say I was very impressed with Clarke Quay ... however I found that the majority of the crowd were Ang Mohs and malay girls (think they are there cause of the Ang Mohs).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The drinks were pricey which could be reason why the crowd consisted of mostly foreigners and the well heeled Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sad thing is that when i went over the river to get smokes VOILA! there were my fellow Singaporeans ..... all huddled in groups along the river drinking alcohol bought from convenience stores (7-11 ... ?) and looking on at the party happening before their eyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I might be mistaken but is the SG govt doing anything to make entertainment/drinks more affordable for the youth in SG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there a more affordable (meybe not so classy) nitespot for Singaporeans in SG?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whilst it is a good way to create revenue from foreigners (Clarke Quay) .... there should also be a cheaper alternative for locals instead of having to sit across the river looking at others party themselves silly.</p>

              <p>Hiya bud ..... is there a less costly spot available for youths? And I don't mean for underage drinkers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also visited Boat Quay and its empty ..... which used to be one of the places I used to visit for cheap drinks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And those people huddled in groups across the river... they don't look underage.... some with motorcycle helmets and I don't think convenience stores sell alcohol to people unless they are of the right age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But maybe I'm overreacting cause it comes across to me that they can't afford the entertainment there which is why they chose that option (huddling in groups across the river with alcohol from 7-11) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"><br>and thats disgraceful!! Setup a damn place to cater for their needs at affordable prices.</p>

              <p>Well.... local all over the World will know of some spot away from their own countrie's ''Tourist Spot'' to get affordable entertainment or drinks.....</p>

              <p>Come to think of it..... I don't see much local Thai around the Go Go Bars I visited when I'm at Phuket.... also all foreginer..... too expensive for the locals. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>

              <p>to be fair ... you know that many of those sort of joints in Thailand are "foreigners only" eh ?  some places are "japanese only", "Koreans only".. or even "whites only".... something that'll never fly in Singapore, but perfectly fine in Thailand, and nobody kicks up a fuss ... ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>of course ... what kind of clientele the businesses want to draw in is their own business ....</p>
              <p>how come nobody asks if the pubs at golden mile's for Singaporeans or not ? .... or orchard towers ? .....</p>
              <p>just go find some place else to party, what's wrong ? ....</p>

              <p>I'd say that alot of rich kids go to Zouk/MOS .... saw a whole row of Ferraris when i was at velvet.</p>

              <p>Nvr tried St James, IndoChimes.</p>

              <p>If you think its affordable then no complaints my point is invalid to begin. So long as you're happy. It doesn't bother me.</p>

              <p>hmm. i agree.. we do need to have abit of the mindset. if ang mo can earn big bucks, why can't we? are we any inferior to them? this mindset is good to motivate us and remind us that we're all equal..</p>
              <p>but of course this mindset must be coupled with humility and contentment, or else you'll get sucked into the never ending cycle of money making, and you won't enjoy life</p>

              <p>Just took a holiday back to Singapore and I must say I was very
              impressed with Clarke Quay ... however I found that the majority of
              the crowd were Ang Mohs and malay girls (think they are there cause
              of the Ang Mohs).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The drinks were pricey which could be reason why the crowd
              consisted of mostly foreigners and the well heeled
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sad thing is that when i went over the river to get smokes
              VOILA! there were my fellow Singaporeans ..... all huddled in
              groups along the river drinking alcohol bought from convenience
              stores (7-11 ... ?) and looking on at the party happening before
              their eyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I might be mistaken but is the SG govt doing anything to make
              entertainment/drinks more affordable for the youth in SG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there a more affordable (meybe not so classy) nitespot for
              Singaporeans in SG?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whilst it is a good way to create revenue from foreigners
              (Clarke Quay) .... there should also be a cheaper alternative for
              locals instead of having to sit across the river looking at others
              party themselves silly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have the feeling the govt is catering to the needs of
              foreigners ( more $ ) and neglecting our youth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*I made this post from what I feel .... and in no way went out
              of my way to attain facts.... but what I saw and what I felt is
