On top of that , we should get  Singaporeans training in the lacking skills so that a singaporean can take over the foreigner's job when he/she has the capabilitiy to do so.<br><br>As for scholarships - I say restrict it to foreigners - some of the foreigners are just using us to jump to USA or Australia. I met a few in Australia who used Singapore as a jumping board.  We have been screwed over on that aspect . That's the reason why I am anti-foreign-talent-policy nowadays.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Chun Yong,<br><br>It is really disheartening to read your posting here.<br><br>We are not only voting for someone who is only in charge of our sector (i.e. Town Council), definitely not someone that is just to switch off the lights after the lesson ends. MPs' responsibilities are much more important than that. Though the overwhelming domination of PAP in parliament has practically turn the parliament into something like a "rubber stamp" in law making, but it is still important to have proper parliamentary debates on every issues. MPs are law makers and they are supposed to pass laws that would eventually affect our daily lives.<br><br>To belittle the role of the MP and thus the vote in your hand is to make a mockery out of the democractic process we have at the moment. PAP links the governing of the ward via Town Councils to the selection of MPs, has deliberately sidetrack the original importance of the role of MPs as law makers. Voting is a matter of struggle between social role vs self interests. This link only tries to enhance the considerations on the "self interests" by each and everyone, playing down the importance (supposedly to be a more important role) of the social role of lawmakers. I call this "rule by materialism". Subsequently, to enhance such materialistic self-interests considerations, they added HDB upgrading into the equations.<br><br>Is this healthy for Singapore's long term development? After I read your posting here, it has confirmed my fear that the success of such tactics have done great damage to our fabric of society.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chunyong:</div><div class="quote_body">well, we are already slaving out guts out liao, where got so much time and energy go think about what the gahment is doing. if they wanna do something, its hard to change their decision to do so. there is a cap to number of opposition people in the cabinet, so even if they manage to hit the cap, they also can't really do much in my opinion.<br><br>further more, we are only voting for the guy in charge of our sector, not someone high up there who could change the way SG operates.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nelstar,<br><br>There are advantages and disadvantages of taking "hasty" approach. Efficiency comes with a price; At what Price?<br><br>To have a "stable" system and vision, we should not be afraid of people "catching up" with us at all.<br><br>We must realize that we are part of Souteast Asia, not America. We must also realize that our neighbours could well be our strength, not "enemies". For the past decades, we have tried to live and strive out alone, without the need of taking our neighbours into considerations. We are encaged in such an "unfriendly" mindset that the only considerations we have is how fast our neighbours are "catching up"! This is a source of tension and unhappiness sowed in our relationship with our neighbours. This will have to resolve ultimately.<br><br>Whether we like it or not, we are stuck down here, a little red dot in SEA. The vision of Singapore would be a stronger, united ASEAN; ASEAN UNION should be the long term strategic aim, with economic Free Trade Zone as the mid term aim. What we lack as a small nation, we could establish it in economic unison with our neighbours. We lack economic depth and we cannot expect to find it in some far away places like USA!<br><br>I am risking sensitive strategic political views to state it here. The total population masses we have in this ASEAN economic union will make us a formidable entity with great bargaining power, as comparable to China, India, EU or even USA. We should enhance economic development and union with our neighbours instead of taking them as a form of egoistic comparison, which has been done again and again by PAP leadership, so insensitive to the feelings of our neighbours.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nelstar:</div><div class="quote_body">The Government had become conservative since LKY stepped down. We see actions done slowly instead of with more haste. We are losing every portion of our industry if we keep allowing our neighbours to crawl and attempt the same feat. Is Singapore gearing down? Yes to me. We need another leader with good vision like LKY such that the country will improve further. We must not let our country slacken more.</div></blockquote></div>

Readers give their views on the SDP and the overall state of the opposition.<br><br>'IF THE opposition parties really want to see a check-and-balance mechanism to the ruling People's Action Party, then they have to work extremely hard to gain support and draw members. You just cannot be active, and want to be seen and heard, only when the General Election is around the corner.<br><br>In fact, whether there is an election or not, a responsible opposition leader should be on the ground most of the time.<br><br>It takes years to win the people's trust and confidence, and this is what most opposition parties lack.<br><br>For them to prove their worth, they should first put their house in order and show greater interest in domestic issues.'<br>- Jeffrey Law Lee Beng<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'DR CHEE spends his time on airy-fairy ideals on Western-dictated 'human rights' and 'democracy', globetrotting and shaking hands with representatives of Western non-governmental organisations.<br><br>I don't understand why SDP members do not realise that the public has lost interest in Chee... A politician who does not know how to prioritise his political battles and win the public's hearts and minds is useless to us.<br><br>That he spends most of his time overseas and in organisations like Alliance for Reform and Democracy in Asia further upsets me. How can he say he is fighting for us when he is not among us?'<br>- Jeremy Tan<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'I WISH to urge our opposition politicians to focus on building the nation for future Singaporeans rather than propose policies which are either short-term, or worse, to the detriment of Singapore.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once said that whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him or give it up.<br><br>Our opposition politicians need to display the same steel resolve and ability to govern, to their fellow countrymen, if they hope to win our hearts.'<br>- Bernard Ee (Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'Although the article was mostly equitable, it insinuated that the party faced an ominous future.
