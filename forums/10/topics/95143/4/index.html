Leadership is another considerations, whether you could inspire others to understand and identify themselves with your visions and dreams.<br><br>I think the "easier way out" from your situation is to join a party and try to change from within. My lecturer and mentor has ever mentioned to me that it would be better for me to join PAP and try to work my way up and change the party from within. But I find it too bulky and clumsy to evoke changes.<br><br>Somehow, it is true that you could trust your life, political life, with Mr. Low TK. That's how I feel when I first met and chat with him. There is no doubt in my mind, after that meeting, that I could trust my political life with him. The rest is history.<br><br>And it is easier to make things works and progress in alternative political parties. There is already a basic mechanism and we just work on it, we get satisfactions when we see the effects. It is truly exciting, in some sense.<br><br>Hope you got your political party set up soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div></blockquote>I heard this from some guy in Sintercom...<br><br>many people think they can change the party from within, unfortunately the moment they get embroiled with the Inner COmplexities, they encounter a sudden change of heart, and stop desiring to change the party, and actually I think that is rather true. Earlier this year, on i-contact, Raymond Lim was saying how he used to be against the PAP and all that, until he joined it and "received enlightenment". I have no idea what kind he received, but Judging by what he said at i-contact, not just the bland replies to the students' questions but also his comic promotion of YPAP which got most students laughing at him, I don't think it was very beneficial in any way.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

There is no way one could try to change it as it is deeply entrenched with its root all stretches to the fullest. It is just like using one individual's spade, trying to remove the whole old tree to somewhere else.<br><br>It is however, easier to change an opposition parties which are not very much deeply entrenched in any particular practice or ideological encagement. It is slightly more challenging to influence Workers' Party as compared to other alternative parties because we have a relatively stronger, bigger veteran group than other younger alternative parties. But I am not saying it is not possible. The younger generation of WP members did successfully implemented reforms and changes to the party in one way or another.<br><br>So for people like Raymond Lim or Vivian, thinking that they could possibly move or change anything within a party like PAP, they must be daring and dreaming but it will never work out that way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>No harm trying though, but when you find it impossible, then better back off and try something else, instead of being "co-opted" into the "mainstream" eventually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pikamaster:</div><div class="quote_body">I heard this from some guy in Sintercom...<br><br>many people think they can change the party from within, unfortunately the moment they get embroiled with the Inner COmplexities, they encounter a sudden change of heart, and stop desiring to change the party, and actually I think that is rather true.
