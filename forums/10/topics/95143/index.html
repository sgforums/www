There is no need to wait for people to invite you to help. We should encourage people to take their initiative to get involve actively in the political process, to experience and see for themselves how the political system is being formed. How "imbalance" it is.<br><br>It may sound strange that opposition members like us are asking PAP supporters to participate actively in the political process.

The first is to remove the damn BB price hike made by Singnet, Starhub and PI. Improve the damn infrastructure so much that it is made easily available and fast for everyone.<br><br>However, that may take over a course of 4 years and the danger of running our national reserves low may creep in.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Government had become conservative since LKY stepped down. We see actions done slowly instead of with more haste. We are losing every portion of our industry if we keep allowing our neighbours to crawl and attempt the same feat. Is Singapore gearing down? Yes to me. We need another leader with good vision like LKY such that the country will improve further. We must not let our country slacken more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The current opposition only tackles the daily problems, not the future. Their lack of vision was appalling. I attended one session of such talks before. It was infuriating that the opposition are but a pool of scattered sand lacking ideas and angry with the Government. They can only keep pointing fingers at mistakes committed by others, and when challenged to foresee the future they suddenly lost their voice.<br><br>They keep talking about checking on the PAP but they are so lightweight that I cannot even trust my future in them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nelstar,<br><br>It is great to hear someone so bold and ambitious to want to form his own political party! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> It demonstrates that we still have people with bold visions and ideals in Singapore which most people are apathetic politically.<br><br>Forming a political party is not difficult anyway; we already have "one man show" party in Singapore! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But to run the party effectively, making it grow and such, needs lots of commitment, perserverence, mental strength and of course, sarcrifices. Leadership is another considerations, whether you could inspire others to understand and identify themselves with your visions and dreams.<br><br>I think the "easier way out" from your situation is to join a party and try to change from within. My lecturer and mentor has ever mentioned to me that it would be better for me to join PAP and try to work my way up and change the party from within. But I find it too bulky and clumsy to evoke changes.<br><br>Somehow, it is true that you could trust your life, political life, with Mr. Low TK. That's how I feel when I first met and chat with him. There is no doubt in my mind, after that meeting, that I could trust my political life with him. The rest is history.<br><br>And it is easier to make things works and progress in alternative political parties. There is already a basic mechanism and we just work on it, we get satisfactions when we see the effects. It is truly exciting, in some sense.<br><br>Hope you got your political party set up soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nelstar:</div><div class="quote_body">I got no time at the moment to engage in politics, not that I'm not keen.
