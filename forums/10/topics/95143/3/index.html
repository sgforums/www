Not reported in the news.<br><br>The MP being tasked to run Town Councils was a move invented by the PAP (when they lost four seats in 1991) and it was intended to burden opposition MPs into the day to day exigencies of HDB town living and detract them from the role of checking the Govt in parliament.<br><br>Now this has backfired.

You just have to look at the way they carved up Eunos and Cheng San after getting the result they didn't like. The WP was disqualified in Aljunied last election and Aljunied comprises remnants of the old Eunos and Cheng San wards, which makes this whole business all the more fishy</blockquote>well i think u have just hit the nail on the head. this proves that the govt is cunning, smart and able to adapt to the times. instead of being afraid of it, i'm glad that at least my govt is run by pple who knows how to defeat the opposition.<br><br>btw the govt has a purpose as well u know, which is to ensure the survability of their very own party. you tell me got any party ownself zi xiang chuan sha just to give the opposition a place in the govt meh? u think wad, some kind of nursery rhyme where everything is so peaceful and serene izzit?<br><br>instead, if the opposition is able to stand up and defeat the people in white up there, than i would recognise it's quality. instead what i see in opposition is the very fact that most of them instead must rely on foreign organisation(amnesty international), which only speaks much about the self-dependency. and on this point, i rather admire JBJ for his guts and balls.</div>
