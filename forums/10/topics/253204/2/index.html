These wide 3-lane roads restricted to 70 kmh include Lornie Road, Adam Road to Queensway; Holland Road from Clementi to Tanglin; AMK Avenue 3 to Hougang Ave 3 through Defu Road - Jalan Eunos; Sembawang Road -Upper Thomson-Thomson Road; Bukit Timah Road going north and Dunearn Road going south.<br><br>It is stupid of the Traffic Police to plant and shift the location of the Speed Cameras along the CTE, PIE, ECP and BKE, as the drivers merely slow down before the cameras and speed off about 100 meters after the camera.<br><br>During peak hours when traffic flow is at its heaviest, the sudden slowing down of the vehicles at the front - from a steady 90kmh to a sudden crawl at 70kmh - will cause vehicles behind to step on their brakes, with those less responsive causing bumper-to-bumper multiple vehicle collisions.<br><br>Expressways that are designed to carry a heavy volume of vehicles, and fitted with cameras will only cause traffic to go slower then necessary - by nervous drivers afraid that they will exceed the 90 kmh speed limit on our expressways, and they would prefer to be on the safer side of the law by slowing to below 80 kmh.<br><br>LTA and TP seems to prefer having more traffic on the road rather than moving vehicles faster to their destination at a CONSTANT safe speed.<br><br>Traffic Police are obssessed with speeding cars and pick-ups, instead of watching for the slower vehicles road hogging.<br><br>How many times have we seen the Traffic Police - zooming pass us on a powerful motorbike - ignoring the cargo vans and trucks travelling on Lane 2 or Lane 3, while Lane 1 is choked with cars, and Lane 4 is rarely used ?<br><br>It is common to see motor bikes riding on the dotted white lane markings between Lane 1 and Lane 2, slowing other vehicles behind on both lanes as the cars will simply scrape them as they passed on both sides of the motor bike.<br><br>LTA should be chastised for their inconsistent design in the width of the Singapore roads - as can be seen in the tight width of the lanes along Lornie-Adam Roads, compared to Hougang Ave 3 and AMK Ave 3 both roads being wider, but will become narrower as these roads merged into Jalan Eunos.<br><br>The CTE lanes are narrowest amongst all the expressways.<br><br>Upper Thomson Road and Thomson Road has inconsistent road width, to the extent that even the width of the SBS Bus will leave little room on both sides of the bus.<br><br>Should we be surprise that all these inconsist road designs and ill considered traffic speed management can only make a bad situation worst with the bad driving habits of Singaporeans ?<br><br>Should the Heads of the LTA and TP be the only ones to be chopped, or should not the responsibility be given also to the Minister and his Master's Political Voice too ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">Too busy to do research today, so just say whatever comes to my mind first</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Gazelle:<br><strong>[quote]Originally posted by wisefool83:<br><br>[b]So what if I did or did not? I mean what is the implication with regards to the topic whether I choose to consider the road lenght or not? Given the small land area, the length of road is not going to make major difference. </strong><br><br>Cars travel on road is it? and if road length is not a factor when you are comparing car density on the road, then what is?<br><br>Singapore<br>Total road length : 3,234km<br>Land Area : 700 km2<br>Road/km2 : 4.62km<br><br>New Zealand<br>Total road length : 92,494km<br>Land Area : 268,680 km2<br>Road/km2 : 0.34km<br><br>Noticed the contrasting difference?<br><span style="color: darkblue;">Indeed, NZ has such long roads which allows vehicles to spread out. I bet the roads in some of these places are so long and isolated that one can drive for 15mins without being able to find anything to crash into. I mean in terms of traffic, having shorter roads would be a challenge instead and if we can have few casualties per 100,000 pop, then doesn't it shows that we are doing better despite of greater challenges?</span><br><br><strong>I did consider that actually and I find that the argument goes both way. Lots more Sg are taking public transport than countries such as NZ, Australia and US, but which side of the argument would you list this stats? Is it a failure or success for LTA and TP chief that more Singaporeans are on public transport? And public transport may not always lower stats because if a bus of passenger go bang and everyone on it dies, the stats are going to rocket sky high. </strong><br><br>If you want to dig further, maybe you should also consider the % of foreign workers or cheap labour in Singapore vs, the % you find in Australia or NZ, because these are the people that will dilute the result when comparing fatality per 100,000 population.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">These foreign workers still need to travel on road don't they, even though they don't drive but LTA and TP are in charge of traffic, not only drivers and cars. If we can find other means of transport which allow these people to get to where they need without driving, it's also a form of success</span><br><br>So far, have you read or heard of any SBS bus that killed all its passengers? If no, then there is not point talking about it.<br><span style="color: darkblue;">Nope, but if I do, I find that that would probably be a stronger reason to sack them.</span><br><br><strong>Ya, that's my point, it meant that more people will share a single vehicle, which meant if the particular vehicle crashes, there are more people in it to die.

            <div class='col-md body'>One practical way in which the LTA can improve road safety is by improving traffic light sequencing.  The sequencing in Singapore is dreadful (you get a green light then another set of lights 200 metres ahead turns red immediately).  In fact, I don't think there *is* any sequencing in Singapore, yet other developed countries have it for decades.<br><br>What do I mean by sequencing?  I mean intelligent programming of lights so that if you travel at the speed limit you will encounter a continuous run of green lights.  With sequencing, traffic in general reaches the destination faster, and the average number of vehicles on the roads decreases.  Add to that a decrease in frustration, and fewer cars running red lights.  Without sequencing LTA is responsible for a huge waste of commuters time.<br><br>Further improvements to sequencing<br><br>* reduce prolonged green arrows in off peak periods.  Such green arrows help nobody when traffic is light, and only serve to waste the time of traffic trying to go proceed directly through intersections<br><br>* giving pedestrians higher priority - increase the frequency of pedestrian lights, so that pedestrians don't give up waiting and jay-walk instead<br><br>* also on pedestrians, don't assume they have all the time in the world to cross three sides of a cross intersection because the 4th doesn't have a pedestrian crossing, and don't assume pedestrians have all the time in the world to navigate barriers and overhead passes.  The intersection of Nicoll Highway and Middle Road is a good case where pedestrians simply give up and jay walk instead.<br></div>
