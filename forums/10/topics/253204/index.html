The ERP solution is no solution at all beyond a certain size of vehicle population.<br><br>To make matter worse, the citizens are being made to pay double and triple road congestion fees namely (1) excise duty - 110% of OMV (2) COE and (3) ERP.<br><br>Citizens are paying needlessly to LTA supposedly to price road congestion through usage but the old ownership fee i.e. excise duty and COE were still being retained needlessly only to make monies out of people's misery.</div>

Personally I would like to see pri and sec school kids to be expose to highway code instead of waiting till they turn 18, reason being is that there are just too many school kids that were killed while crossing the road because they are not aware of the danger on the road.<br><br>The other issue with our highway code is that it doesnt explain too much about the logic behind the rules and that is the reason why we still see car tailgating and road hogging in our highway.<br><br>Personally I would like to see Lta and TP putting more effort in educating singaporeans in making singapore road safer.

In general, I am in the firm opinion that society in Singapore, lack greatly in Cultural Mannerisms - unrefined raw 'Me-First' mentality and attitude brought on by decades of 'No Free Lunch' governance. A system that basically tells you to handle your own sorry ass and problems, you die your business.<br><br>Hence, this is reflected when people drive on the roads here. This lack of and prohibition of people's RIGHTS to EXPRESSION here has boiled over into the way people "express" themselves on the roads.
