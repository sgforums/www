Not on the roads  </span><br>Summonses up as more S'poreans disregard road rules<br>By Hedy Khoo<br><br>January 27, 2008  </strong><br><br>MEET the demons that turn the Singaporean driver into a devil - impatience and inconvenience.<br><br>Both have played a part in the spike in traffic offences.<br><br>Between 2006 and last year, there was a close to 14 per cent increase in the number of driving offences, from about 132,000 in 2006 to about 150,400 last year.<br><br>These include speeding, beating red lights, careless driving, inconsiderate driving, reckless driving, dangerous driving and driving while using handphones.<br><br>These statistics are a reality for me when I drive along Upper Serangoon Road on numerous occasions.<br><br>I have come across drivers who make illegal turns from the main Upper Serangoon Road onto a one-way street, driving against traffic flow to get to their houses which are located near the junction.<br><br>HAPPENS AT NIGHT<br><br>It always happens at night, when they think there is no traffic on minor roads.<br><br>But of these offenders, drivers who beat red lights take the cake.<br><br>They accounted for an astounding 86 per cent jump from about 13,000 summonses issued in 2006 to about 24,300 last year.<br><br>That the traffic demons are at work is also evident in the number of parking offences.<br><br>These jumped 22 per cent, from about 211,500 in 2006 to about 260,000 last year.<br><br>When confronted, most motorists usually say they flout the law because they are in a rush.<br><br>One 37-year-old manager with a logistics firm, who has been driving for almost 20 years, said: 'I know it's wrong, but I have no choice. When I am rushing for a meeting, or in a hurry, I have to save time. I make sure the roads are clear when I speed or make illegal turns.<br><br>Is trying to save time an acceptable justification of traffic-rule violation?<br><br>Mr Noah Hon, chairman of the Singapore Kindness Movement, has this to say: 'Whether in a hurry or not, a mistake done at high speed could be fatal, cause injury to someone innocent, or even to the driver.<br><br>'The car is a high-powered machine, and damage to life or property could be significant.<br><br>'The question is, 'Is saving a bit of time worth these risks?' he asked.<br><br>Mr Hon observed that Singapore drivers often like to change lanes just to get a few feet ahead.<br><br>'They tend to be more aggressive and more inconsiderate than those in other countries,' he noted.<br><br>'Discourtesy on the road is definitely against the concept of a gracious society.'<br><br>Assistant Commissioner Ng Guat Ting, the Commander of the Traffic Police, said: 'Ungracious, impatient or reckless motorists not only make motoring a stressful experience, they are also endangering the lives of other road users, including themselves.'<br><br>When it comes to parking their vehicles, Singapore drivers need to improve on that too.<br><br>Drivers often cite the same excuses for parking illegally: The lack of parking lots and time.<br><br>'Sometimes, I just need to drop off or pick up a cheque from my clients, so I would just park for less than five minutes,' one driver said.<br><br>'It's not that I don't want to pay for parking, I am just saving time.'<br><br>She admitted that while such unthinking behaviour is ungracious, she felt that it is all right.<br><br>Another driver, a bank officer, 28, said: 'Everyone else parks illegally, it is almost a norm. I park illegally only when I cannot find proper parking lots. For example, at the prata shops along Yio Chu Kang Road.'<br><br>He added: 'I know it's not okay, but I have no other option.'<br><br>Another motorist, Mr Andrew Kwong, 29, a sports marketing executive, disagrees with this view.<br><br>He said: 'It's irresponsible. We are an educated society, we should have some courtesy. Parking for free is one thing. But parking illegally inconveniences others.'<br><br>Mr Hon said enforcement is important to signal to motorists that the authorities are serious about the traffic rules.<br><br>'People do get away, so it is important that they are educated to have an innate sense of responsibility to be considerate, not just on the roads, but to everyone,' he said.<br><br>The Traffic Police is also aware of the importance of public education.<br><br>Assistant Commissioner Ng said: 'Ultimately, roads are meant to be shared. Motorists should never see the roads as places where they fight for space. It should not be seen as who wins or loses. In an accident, everyone loses.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think most singaporeans like myself never ask to be brand gracious. all this gracious thingy are brainwash into us by the media and the PAP.<br><br>we are not asking to be gracious but neither are we that ungracious i feel<br>.<br>On the average we are deinitely better than to malaysia, thailand, indonesia, philippines, Taiwan, China, vietnam. i think we are among the top 4 gracious driver in the Asia pacific region.<br><br>Yes the traffic offences has gone up, could be due to 2 reason.<br>1. traffic police or LTA/ HDB has subcontracted these illegal parking to subcons. i bet these are commisions base. meaning more offences, more income. thus the offences rate actually din go up, just more ppl are patrolling the streets these days.<br>2. The nos of car are increasing. Thus the rate of offences should also go up.<br><br>It is no big deal. we are born here, i am use to all these. let not try to be somebody we are not. just be overselves. Uniquely singapore!!<br><br></div>
