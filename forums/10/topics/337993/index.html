              <p><br>Is there a difference between a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drama%20queen"><strong>"Drama Queen"</strong> </a>and a "Whore" ?</p>
              <p>Surely the "Drama Queen" revels in attention seeking through all the drama created that is similar to the attention grabbing methods used by whores plying their trade ?</p>
              <p>The more drama or exaggerated dramatic actions, the more attention will be given.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the Drama Queen has learnt the same attention seeking methods from those whom he deride as whores, and who seek attention for their services by being as dramatic as they can possibbly be ?</p>
              <p>Are CSJ and Ah Bian "<em>attention seeking whores</em>" - or are both being dramatically exaggerated by the Bear to satisfy the Bear's troubled need for attention through his exaggerated statements ?</p>
              <p>Circus bears have been trained to put up good clownish acts.</p>
              <p>Clowns make exaggerated acts as an art from, and the Bear in this Speaker's Corner has consistently displayed his exaggerated clownish skills as a <strong>Drama Queen</strong> that are no different from those whom he deride as "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>attention seeking </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>whores</em></span>".  </span></p>
