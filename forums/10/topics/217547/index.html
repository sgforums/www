            <div class='col-md body'><br>Rethink capital punishment. No one benefits from the death penalty<br><br>Is it time to rethink the issue of capital punishment?<br><br>I am writing in response to the imminent execution of Took Leng How, who was found guilty of killing eight-year-old Huang Na on 10 October 2004 and was given the death sentence on 26 August 2005 after a 13-day trial.<br><br>While the execution seems inevitable, I hope to highlight the risk of wrongful executions and the wider implications of the death penalty on the family and the community.<br><br>We should rethink our position on a form of a punishment that is deemed 'barbaric' and 'unconstitutional' by a majority in the world today.<br><br>In the UK, cases such as Timothy Evans and Derek Bentley in the 1960s highlighted the susceptibility of the criminal justice system to human errors and the risk of wrongful executions.<br><br>Similarly, in the US, the 123 exonerations since 1973 have led to the abolition of the death penalty in several states. John Ballard's exoneration in Florida last February is a reminder that wrongful convictions and executions are not problems of the past.<br><br>Rather, it is a consequence of a legal process which cannot guarantee that all guilty people will be convicted and all innocent people will be acquitted.<br><br>In the case of Took, the fact that the judges were divided on whether Took is 'guilty beyond reasonable doubt' is a good illustration of the uncertainties inherent in the process of obtaining a conviction.<br><br>Despite the uncertainties and reservations the court had, the entire trial process from conviction to the date of the forthcoming execution in Took's case is swift.<br><br>In the US, the long custodial sentence, sometimes for decades, prior to the execution date have led to numerous exonerations due to fresh evidence surfacing while the prisoner is on death row.<br><br>Perhaps, more important is the impact of a death sentence on the family and loved ones of the prisoners on death row.<br><br>While little research has been done to assess the impact of state executions on the children of executed prisoners or prisoners on death row, studies on children of incarcerated parents have shown that the children can suffer from psychological and emotional problems because of it.<br><br>There is a need for our criminal justice system to acknowledge the impact of parental executions on children and the effects of state executions on the family.<br><br>Took's case is an illustration of the futility of the death penalty. While the severity of the crime of murder has to be acknowledged, I am doubtful of capital punishment's deterrent effect on cases like Took's that are often crimes of passion or a tragic result of an untreated mental illness.<br><br>While I respect the court's decision, the imposition of the death sentence in this case can only result in a loss of a father, son and husband to his family.<br><br>Gabe Tan Si Han (Miss)<br><br>---<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:9ab38c9f4088e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:9ab38c9f4088e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also dun really approve of capital punishment one. What happen if you punish the wrong people? But again, it is another byproduct of our self-proclaimed perfect and compassionate system. One Chinese Emperor abolish tattooing onto criminal's face because he thinks that they should have a chance to repent for their wrongdoing.<br><br>But think this way har, you throw those condemned in jail for life hor, you must waste taxpayers' $$ to feed them. Then if too many prisoner how? Build one more prison meh? Where got space for you to build new prison?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to Wikipedia,<br><br>Capital punishment is a contentious issue. Supporters of capital punishment argue that it deters crime, prevents recidivism, and is an appropriate punishment for the crime of murder.<br><br>Opponents of capital punishment argue that it does not deter criminals more than life imprisonment, violates human rights, leads to executions of some who are wrongfully convicted, and discriminates against minorities and the poor.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Death for a criminal is the worse punishment he can ever get for those hideous crime he committed...but have this thought ever flash across our mind that if he were given life imprisonment he may be able to gain enlightment...In usa there are several case of the criminal getting enlightment..Enlightment in a sense he realised his mistake but whether will he commit crime again that is very hard to say...to conclude..i hope capital punishment can be reduce to add in more life imprisonment...HOBO</div>

Such cases definitely exist and imagine u are the person who's facing death for something u didn't do.<br><br>Sometimes if u follow certain court cases, u will really find that it's not the evidence that counts everytime, but which side the judge choose to believe, even if the evidence does not fully prove it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We should abolish capital punishment, coz there are better ways to use them.<br><br>We should sentence them life imprisonment; make them work for us (like military construction or repairs) in return for food and lodging.<br><br>Also make them do community work (under cuffs and supervision) until they become guilty of what they had done.<br><br>This way, we can make them contribute back to society.<br><br>But the life imprisonment stays even after they repented.

            <div class='col-md body'>So it seems that a few of you out there think that took leng shouldn't die? Then shld the little girl die of nothing? Don't the little have family also? Come on.. If a murder are to let off so easily don't you think is unfair to someone who is dead? At the same some unfair to us as taxpayer? I think Capital punishment maybe be crude but it does have its effect to make ppl think twice before doing it.</div>
