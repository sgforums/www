              <p>an extract from CNN,</p>
              <p>http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/16/AIG.bonuses/index.html?eref=rss_topstories</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The president said he has asked Geithner to "pursue every single
              legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers
              whole."</p>
              <p>Obama spared AIG's new CEO, Edward Liddy, from
              criticism, saying he got the job "after the contracts that led to these
              bonuses were agreed to last year."</p>
              <p>But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics. "It's about our fundamental values," he said.<span class="cnnEmbeddedMosLnk"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/16/AIG.bonuses/index.html?eref=rss_topstories#cnnSTCVideo"> </a></span></p>
              <p>"All across the country, there are people who are working hard and
              meeting their responsibilities every single day, without the benefit of
              government bailouts or multimillion-dollar bonuses. You've got a bunch
              of small-business people here who are struggling just to keep their
              credit line open," Obama said.</p>
              <p>"And all they ask is that
              everyone, from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, play by the
              same rules. That is an ethic that we have to demand."</p>
              <p>Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again.</p>
              <p>Then, coughing, he added in jest, "I'm choked up with anger here."</p>
              <p>Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa didn't appear to be joking,
              however, when he spoke with Cedar Rapids, Iowa, radio station WMT.</p>
              <p>"I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little
              better toward them [AIG executives] is if they follow the Japanese
              example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and
              say, 'I am sorry,' and then either do one of two things: resign or go
              commit suicide," he said.</p>
              <p>"And in the case of the Japanese, they usually commit suicide."</p>

              <p>Its up to the management to see to go with the contract or not. I do not think its a hard line, people can always argue around it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The americans should boycott AIG. They are looking more at short term money than the long term reputation. I guess the management are there just for the money and not for the business. Something that always happen when they are the power house with a certain degree of monopoly and so they should fall and the names of the management be condemned by the industry they are in.</p>
              <p> I am going to boycott the AIG in singapore but then I think they are not related ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">.</p>

              <p>frankly no pt grilling eddy liddy as he is ask to come out of retirement to lead AIG. i think he was paid only $1.00 for his public service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>American govt spent over 150billion to bailout AIG, would it let it anger derail the purpose to saving it in the first place.</p>
              <p>if i was obama , i would ask liddy to hand over the name of exec who wouldnt give back the bonus, like it or not. and put the name of such person on national newsapaper and sell the namelist to TV talkshow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these top exec are not afraid of lawsuits, they are afraid to be shame!!</p>
