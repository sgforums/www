              <p>The issue here is : we are being told constantly we are paying top dollar for top talent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then why are there so much problems in society and the economy if the top talent is managing the country properly?</p>

              <p>Without even refering to specific issues, if the case was we are being managed by the best talents that are better than the governments of other countries, we would expect that singapore have less problems on average than the rest of the countries.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, singapore is a small country.  Managing it should be even less of a problem than say managing the US.</p>

              Hurrah..manage to buy 10,000 of Citibank shares in March at USD 1.22 and still holding for the long haul..let's not quarrel whether GIC make or lose $$$..got a safe bet from a banker and fund manager...to buy and collect as many EPURE shares as possible before May 18 ex dividend date and EPURE will pay SGD $8 per lot,and base on its current share price of 44cts that works to a yield ofabout 1.8% better than the miserable bank's deposits of 0.8% considering the fact that one will receive dividends of $8 on May 29..
              
              
              So far the banker and fund manager has asked me to buy Cosco,China Aviation Oil,Straits Asia Resources and after their respective ex-dividend dates all counters listed above soar..not bad got capital gains and dividends..
              
              Hurry if got spare cash can consider buying EPURE and price below 50cts and unlikley U'll lose $$$..EPURE ever hit a high of $2.52 before its 1 for 3 stocksplit..and with its contracts worth &gt; 1 Billion,this waste treatment/specialist firm is set to soar again

              that investment without really knowing the real details. So let's
              set the record straight. If you cannot understand what is written,

              <p>When GIC invested in Citi, it was to buy preferred stock
              yielding 7% a year. It is more akin to a bond investment than
              a stock investment, as people invest in preferred stock more for
              yield than capital gains, unlike common stock investments. To
              repeat, preferred stock is NOT the same as common stock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In late February 09, GIC converted the preferred stock holdings
              in Citi into common stock at an exchange price of US$3.25 a share.
              This deal was cut when the US government injected capital into
              Citi. The Citi stock price that GIC invested in is US$3.25.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As of last night closing, Citi common stock was trading at
              US$3.81. Hence, there has been a PROFIT of 17% in the Citi
              investment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, the UBS investment is still underwater. But at least our
              national wealth has been increased in the Citi investment, as of
              today that is. But with the US government now actively supporting
              Citi, I do think the worst for the company is probably over.</p>

              <p>Charlize, you raise a fair point. As I have mentioned, I do
              sympathise with the thought that GIC's investment portfolio should
              be a lot more transparent. At the very least it would cut down on
              some of the crazy ignorant posts about how much this or that
              investment is losing money. On the other hand, the Temasek
              portfolio and returns are relatively very transparent. You can find
              their annual financial statements online. So it's not a totally
              empty glass problem. Perhaps a glass one-third or half-full. But
              yes, things could be much improved on this count.</p>
              <p>On your point of grouses "on the ground." I will say I
              understand, but it is also something I do not share partly because
              of my situation and partly because of what I have seen
              globally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have lived in 3 continents. When I say lived, I mean staying
              put in a country for more than 12 months straight. I also have a
              relatively good life, some might even say I'm "rich" though I don't
              feel rich for sure. I have a good and interesting career that has
              allowed me to travel and live around the world. Right now my
              apartment is in the middle of a major global city, just across the
              street from a park. Spring is out where I live. The sun is shining,
              the birds are chirping and flowers are sprouting. So unlike maybe
              other people I'm not in a constantly angry state of mind, thinking
              that the world owes me a living. Incidentally, I wasn't born rich
              but have come where I have come through intelligence and
              ambition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What am I trying to say? Anyone who has lived in NY, London, HK
              or any major global city finds the same sentiments among the, let's
              just say, "lower middle classes and below." People compain about
              immigrants taking their jobs, about an unresponsive government,
              about their low wages, about the inadequacy of public service,
              about the "elites" perpetuating themselves etc etc. At least in
              Singapore, you don't complain that much about taxes as they are
              relatively low for a developed country, but I admit there are other
              different grouses. People in Singapore also take for granted the
              superior public amenities they enjoy. For example, good luck if you
              have no health insurance in the US! Have you ever tried waiting for
              outpatient treatment at public NHS clinics in the UK?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I'm sorry to say that what people "on the ground" complain
              about in Singapore is, in my perspective, nothing really special. I
              have seen it all overseas. It's largely a function of the world we
              live in nowadays. Economic globalisation implies a lot more
              immigration and greater social divide. This is true around the
              world, and not just Singapore.</p>

              <p>The market cap you see only captures the value of the outstanding common equity at present. Once the conversion of the preferred stock into common equity has been finalised, the market cap will jump. The relevant part of the press release by Citi on this matter is below (I have pasted the full press release in an earlier thread):</p>
              <p>"This transaction could increase the TCE (Tangible Common Equity) of the company from the fourth quarter level of $29.7 billion to as much as $81 billion, which assumes the exchange of $27.5 billion of preferred securities, the maximum eligible under this transaction."</p>
              <p>So the deal to convert at US$3.25 a share has been formally announced, but it has not been affected yet. There is usually a lag of a few months between the announcement and the implementation in these sort of deals. Lots of legal matters to finalise and documents to file with the relevant authorities. Hence, the market cap you cite does not capture the conversion yet.</p>

              Don't think of the short term loss lah..over the horizon of 3-5 years or may be longer Citibank shares will definitely recover..investment carry risks otherwise put with banks better although other countries' bank may also collapse..
              
              I bought Citi at USD $1.22 also intend tohold long term..now consider another stock which hope to share with those interested.
              
              One or two rotten apples doesn't mean the rest are bad..rg Cosco,YZJ,and Epure esp the latter..I attended the AGM and spoke to the directors during the session and teabreak...they also got auditors on hand to testify the cash on hand..since ipo has been paying dividends,anyway the major shareholder is the International Finance Ltd..also bankers and fund managers also highly rate this counter..low risk at about 44cts...ever even bought at $1.20 and sold at $2.10 too..the counter has beeen adjusted 1 for 3 stock splilt to increase its liquidity so continue to remain high on institution's radar

              <p>TS is expecting us to accept a new beginning for these Preferred Share to be converted to Ordinary Shares at a price of US$3.25 per Ordinary Share.</p>

              <p>At US$26.35 per Preferred Share that cost Singapore an original investment of US$6.8 Billion - Singapore had received 258,064,516 shares.</p>
              <p>This conversion is a ONE-for-ONE share exchange that will result in <span style="color: #ff0000;">a total loss of US$5 Billion</span> to Singapore.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">This is not a situation that Singapore will get US$6.8 Billion worth of Ordinary Shares valued at US$3.25 that will inflate our holding from <span style="color: #0000ff;">258,064,516</span> to some wrongly hoped for stock volume of <span style="color: #0000ff;">2,092,307,692</span>.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The fact that should not be forgotten is that the original lot of 258,064,516 Preferred Shares - which originally cost US$26.35 per share - will no longer have the status of being "Preferred" - but will be downgraded to "Ordinary Shares" valued at US$3.25.</p>

              Share to be converted to Ordinary Shares at a price of US$3.25 per
              Ordinary Share.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At US$26.35 per Preferred Share that cost Singapore an original
              investment of US$6.8 Billion - Singapore had received 258,064,516
              shares.</p>
              <p>This conversion is a ONE-for-ONE share exchange that will result
              in <span style="color: #ff0000;">a total loss of US$5
              Billion</span> to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">This is not a situation that Singapore will get US$6.8 Billion
              worth of Ordinary Shares valued at US$3.25 that will inflate our
              holding from <span style="color: #0000ff;">258,064,516</span> to
              some wrongly hoped for stock volume of <span style="color: #0000ff;">2,092,307,692</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The fact that should not be forgotten is that the original lot of
              258,064,516 Preferred Shares - which originally cost US$26.35 per
              share - will no longer have the status of being "Preferred" - but
              will be downgraded to "Ordinary Shares" valued at US$3.25.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">TS is telling us to forget about the original value paid, and to
              rejoice at the current increases in the value of the shares - with
              the current advancement of the stock values from US$3.25 to US$3.85
              per share.</p>

Citi anticipates launching the public exchange offer in early April, subject to completion of the required SEC review process. </span></span></span></p>

One preliminary proxy proposes to amend Citi's Charter to, among other things, increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock and authorize the Board of Directors to execute a reverse stock split of its common stock. Shareholder approval to increase Citi's authorized shares is not necessary to complete the exchange of private preferred shares for interim securities or to exchange the public preferred shares for common shares. The conversion of interim securities to common shares will be completed upon adoption of the amendment to authorize additional shares. The other preliminary proxy proposes to amend the Charter and the certificates of designation of each series of its public preferred stock to amend the rights of holders of public preferred stock.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Daddy!!,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The market cap you cite only relates to the common equity part of a firm's capital structure. But firms, in Singapore or US or UK etc., are capitalised from many other types of capital. There is common equity, preferred stocks, senior debt and junior debt. These are the four main categories of funding for a listed company. You see them on the right-side of the balance sheet, if you understand accounting. For a bank, the common equity portion of the capital structure usually tends to be very small. That is why banks are typically viewed as being highly "leveraged" companies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In the case of Citi, its total assets according to its latest fourth quarter 2008 financial statement is US$1,938,470 mln. Obviously this could not have been funded out of only the common equity pool alone as it would have been much too small!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">What this means is that there is no change to the total equity number on the right-side of the balance sheet when you convert existing preferred stock into common equity. In an accounting sense you are simply changing the categories of equity. There are legal and economic consequences however. Common equity, for example, has a lower claim on the company's assets than preferred stock or debt, so common equity owners loss everything in a bankruptcy.</span></p>
