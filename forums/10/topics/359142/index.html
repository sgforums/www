              <p>There are lots of "financial experts" who comment about this or that investment without really knowing the real details. So let's set the record straight. If you cannot understand what is written, then I'm afraid I can't explain it any simpler.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When GIC invested in Citi, it was to buy preferred stock yielding 7% a year. It is more akin to a bond investment than a stock investment, as people invest in preferred stock more for yield than capital gains, unlike common stock investments. To repeat, preferred stock is NOT the same as common stock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In late February 09, GIC converted the preferred stock holdings in Citi into common stock at an exchange price of US$3.25 a share. This deal was cut when the US government injected capital into Citi. The Citi stock price that GIC invested in is US$3.25.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As of last night closing, Citi common stock was trading at US$3.81. Hence, there has been a PROFIT of 17% in the Citi investment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, the UBS investment is still underwater. But at least our national wealth has been increased in the Citi investment, as of today that is. But with the US government now actively supporting Citi, I do think the worst for the company is probably over.</p>

              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">SINGAPORE, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth fund the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) said on Friday it will convert its Citigroup preferred shares into common stock in a bid to shore up the troubled U.S. lender.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">GIC said it would exchange its convertible preferred notes to common stock at a price of $3.25 a share. Based on Citi's opening share price of $1.67 on Friday, GIC has realised a loss of around half its investment. This also compares with the conversion price of $26.35 under the terms of the original investment.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">GIC said its stake in Citi would rise to an estimated 11.1 percent.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">"It now means GIC are in the real danger zone. Equity holders are the first to absorb any losses. Or if the Treasury decides to inject more capital, they will get diluted," said an analyst at an investment bank, who declined to be indentified.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">GIC is </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">'s largest wealth fund with an estimated $300 billion in assets. Its sister fund Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], which also invested in global banks and lost over $2 billion on Merrill Lynch, saw its portfolio drop 31 percent in the eight months to November.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> has only said GIC outperformed global equities in 2008. The government tapped its reserves for the first time for a budget stimulus package in January to try to cushion the country from its worst ever recession.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">GIC bought in January 2008 about $6.88 billion worth of perpetual, convertible notes in Citi that pay a 7 percent annual dividend. At that time, the notes could be converted into about 4 percent of Citi's expanded capital.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Preferred shares are similar to bonds in that holders received a fixed dividend instead of dividends that may vary depending on the firm's performance. By getting preferred shareholders to convert their holdings into common stock, Citi would be able to reduce its quarterly dividend payment.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">"GIC supports the initiative by Citigroup and the </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">U.S.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> government to strengthen the quality of the bank's capital base," GIC said in a statement.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Shares in Citigroup were trading 32 percent lower at $1.67 in early trade by 1445 GMT on Friday after announcing a deal that would increase the </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">U.S.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> government's stake in the bank's common stock. [ID:nN27210042].</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">"Citi needs support right now and that is what the U.S. Treasury and investors are providing," said David Cohen of consultancy Action Economics.</span></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">"Hopefully they (GIC) can be rewarded as they are trying to help clean the mess in the global financial system. If you are not willing to take a risk, you can't achieve a return."</span></span></p>

If the Citi share price is above US$3.25, there is a profit. No need to think any harder than that. It is much simpler now that the investment is entirely in common stocks.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">If you think about it objectively, the Citi investment was well structured. The 7% yield on the preferred stock provided good returns last year as bank stocks (including Citi) plunged. And the conversion into common equity in February as the US government went in to support Citi means a lot of upside potential is possible. Of course, there remains the risk that Citi could go bankrupt, and the share price drops to 0. But I think the US government support gives good risk-reward to the Citi investment.</span></p>

              the Citi investment is at US$3.25 a share. If the Citi share price
              is above US$3.25, there is a profit. No need to think any harder
              than that. It is much simpler now that the investment is entirely
              in common stocks.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">If you think about
              it objectively, the Citi investment was well structured. The 7%
              yield on the preferred stock provided good returns last year as
              bank stocks (including Citi) plunged. And the conversion into
              common equity in February as the US government went in to support
              Citi means a lot of upside potential is possible. Of course, there
              remains the risk that Citi could go bankrupt, and the share price
              drops to 0. But I think the US government support gives good
              risk-reward to the Citi investment.</span></p>

              <p>I also understand the part that if the market price is higher than the price you bought, you will make a profit.  But by converting the preferred stock to common equity, it states that they realised a loss half of their investment ie. they are already down 50%.  This 50% loss has to be taken into account when factoring whether they are making a profit or a loss. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At $1.67, they realised a 50% loss compared to $3.25.  Hence The 50% loss is equivalent to a price difference of $1.58.  Thus, the stock needs to hit $4.83 ($3.25 + 1.67) for them to recoup the 50% loss ie breakeven.  Anything above that price should then be considered profit. Right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again, I am no financial expert but basing my simplified calculations based on this report you posted.   Not even taking into account things like conversion price and what nots about the convertible notes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I don't mean to be rude, but your post only reveals your lack of understanding of the financial deal. Let me try to explain again in very very simple language. The Reuters article was written on Feb 27. On that day, the Citi common share price was at US$1.67. Given the GIC's Citi investment is at US$3.25, there was a paper lost ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY (namely Feb 27) of 49%. After all, 1.67/3.25 = 0.51. Got it?</p>
              <p>Hence the article stated correctly that ON THE DAY of the preferred to common conversion, GIC essentially suffered a paper lost of 49% (1-0.51 = 0.49). Got it?</p>
              <p>You can think of this as a cost of the conversion, but NO CASH was paid. It was a purely paper cost. Understand? I repeat, NO CASH was paid for the transaction.</p>
              <p>However, since Feb 27, the Citi common share price has rallied. It is now above the US$3.25 level. Hence there is a PROFIT. Got it?</p>

              <p>But what is the reason for the preffered to common stock conversion ?</p>
              <p>According to the latest US banks stress test scores.. Citi still needs 5.5 billion to survive a worsening of economy.</p>
              <p>Isn't GIC taking a big risk for the conversion ? I mean GIC is a sovereign wealth fund.. is it prudent for them to do this at all ?</p>

              <p>One of the condition of the Obama's Administration offer to bail out Citibank was that there will no other Preferred Shareholders except for the US Government, and all existing Preferred Shareholders will have to convert theirs to Ordinary Shares.</p>
              <p>Even before the forced conversion, the Singapore GIC had already seen their 2008 investment plummet from a value of US$6.88 Billion to a value of US$1.5 Billion.</p>

              <p>The share prices will have to climb much higher then the present market performance before GIC can recover the full US$6.88 Billion that has been poured into Citibank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As matters stand, the original investment was based on Convertible Notes that was suppose to pay a 7% annual dividend.</p>
              <p>With the US Government imposing a conditional aid package to Citibank that will help to guarantee US$306 Billion of troubled mortgages in Citi's portfolio, and with the US Treasury Department injecting US$20 Billion of cash into the firm - what are the other conditions that has been imposed on Citibank besides the main condition of no other Preferred Shareholders in Citibank ?</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"Citibank will issue preferred shares worth US$27 Billion to the US Government and pay a dividend of 8% a year.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The cost of the bailout will result in Citibank having to pay a dividend of US$2.16 Billion per year to the US Government on the preferred shares. It will also have to pay US$1.25 Billion @ 5% on the US$25 Billion it received through TARP. This means the bank will have to make a profit of more than US$3.41 Billion before the shareholders can take home anything."</span></p>

              original big numbers that cost <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/singapores-gic--5-bn-loss-on-citi-investment/428919/"><span style="color: #000000;">- </span></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/singapores-gic-faces-5-bn-loss-on-citi-investment/428919/">‘Singapore’s GIC faces $5 BILLION loss on Citi
              investment’  </a>?</p>
              <p>Have we lost sight of the value of our original investment ?</p>
              <p>The original investment of US$6.88 Billion had fallen to a
              present value of US$1.5 Billion - causing the Financial Experts to
              place our loss at US$5 Billion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the condition of the Obama's Administration offer to bail
              out Citibank was that there will no other Preferred Shareholders
              except for the US Government, and all existing Preferred
              Shareholders will have to convert theirs to Ordinary Shares.</p>
              <p>Even before the forced conversion, the Singapore GIC had already
              seen their 2008 investment plummet from a value of US$6.88 Billion
              to a value of US$1.5 Billion.</p>
              <p>The original price paid per share was reported to be
              US$26.35.</p>
              <p>Should we be elated and be satisfied to see the present Ordinary
              Share valued at US$3.25 rise to a new market price of US$3.81
              ? </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/singapores-gic-faces-5-bn-loss-on-citi-investment/428919/">‘Singapore’s GIC paper loss for Citibank stands at
              89.6%’  </a></p>
              <p>The share prices will have to climb much higher then the present
              market performance before GIC can recover the full US$6.88 Billion
              that has been poured into Citibank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As matters stand, the original investment was based on
              Convertible Notes that was suppose to pay a 7% annual dividend.</p>
              <p>With the US Government imposing a conditional aid package to
              Citibank that will help to guarantee US$306 Billion of troubled
              mortgages in Citi's portfolio, and with the US Treasury Department
              injecting US$20 Billion of cash into the firm - what are the other
              conditions that has been imposed on Citibank besides the main
              condition of no other Preferred Shareholders in Citibank ?</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"Citibank will issue preferred
              shares worth US$27 Billion to the US Government and pay a dividend
              of 8% a year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Citibank will be prohibited
              from paying common stock dividends of more then US$0.01 a share per
              quarter for the next three years without the approval of the US
              Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The cost of the bailout will
              result in Citibank having to pay a dividend of US$2.16 Billion per
              year to the US Government on the preferred shares. It will also
              have to pay US$1.25 Billion @ 5% on the US$25 Billion it received
              through TARP. This means the bank will have to make a profit of
              more than US$3.41 Billion before the shareholders can take home
              anything."</span></p>

              <p> We will be lucky if we can recoup the original sum
              invested PLUS the interest sum incurred annually - and forget about
              opportunity costs.</p>

              <p>Don't throw lingo at us. </p>
              <p>Why emphasize on Citi, which is making money now...for the time being...maybe in the long run. Why not Shin Corp, ABC, Ocptus, etc that you failed to mention?</p>
              <p>Why the charitable act to educate us on Citibank? I do support Citi. I believe in Citi. But why is it I can wait and buy Citi at $1.03? The thing is, when they bought Citi, the market condition was damn bad. Their cronies with their framed 1st class honours should know. Why not collect their 7% dividend for the time being? </p>
              <p>Granted, nobody can make a 100% profitable investment. We shouldn't complain.</p>
              <p>However, do remember 1 simple thing. We work hard for our money. I don't blame anybody if I have to "save" 20% of it every month. I just don't want people telling me I should work till 82 years old then can I take my money out because you incurred losses. Even so, it is only a portion of it.</p>
              <p>Get this clear, in every company, the board has to answer to their SHAREHOLDERS. Because we voted you to the board doesn't mean I made you GOD. You are not GOD. Even GOD has to have believers.</p>

You have no choice but to curse evil when you see it. You can stay silent about it but then silence means consent. It is not as bad as active support but you must not stay silent!</span></p>

              <p>I'm not silenced. I just live overseas, so I had to sleep. Anyway, this post is not about the investing prowess of SWFs, whether Singapore or otherwise. It's about the Citi investment by GIC. Not everybody makes money every year in every investment. Even the great Warren Buffett lost money in his company's latest financial year. Even George Soros losses money in some investments. How you judge investment ability is about how the entire portfolio AS A WHOLE has performed over a number of years. Nonetheless, that was not my goal. I merely wrote this post to correct uninformed speculation about GIC's Citi investment.</p>

              <p>I would have thought people would actually be happy that their country's wealth had gained!! Instead, it seems that there are people who so hate the government that they would rather have their country's wealth fall. Very sad indeed.</p>

              <p>Everyone has a right to their opinion. I respect that. I agree that there are certainly lots of things in Singapore that could be improved. Singapore is no utopia. Then again neither is the USA, UK, China or Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT not everyone has a right to their own FACTS. Facts are facts. Anyone who understands the details of GIC's Citi investment also understands that the investment has been very profitable. It gained 7% from the preferred stock dividends last year. And this year it has gained 23.6% alone from the capital appreciation of the common stock. Citi's stock last closed at US$4.02 in New York, so 4.02/3.25 = 1.236.</p>
