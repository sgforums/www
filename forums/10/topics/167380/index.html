            <div class='col-md body'>The following article was taken from the New Paper, about a youth being attacked by some other youth/s with a 30cm machete, and almost lost his left hand. In it, I read that a cab which the desperately injured boy flagged down, denied him service by saying he's changing shift when he can clearly see the boy's injury.<br><br>I ask, what kind of society is Singapore becoming??? What kind of "Public" transport do we have???<br><br>===========================================<br>WHEN two youths attacked him and his three friends, Siva's first reaction was to run - and he did.<br><br>While they were fleeing, one of his horrified friends asked him: 'Where is your left hand?'<br><br>Siva (not his real name), 17, looked down and was shocked that his hand was indeed missing.<br><br>It had been chopped off at the wrist. Yet, he had felt no pain.<br><br>--Dominic Ying<br>Said Siva, a right-hander: 'All that was left was the bone sticking out.<br><br>'My skin and flesh were hanging downwards and my left arm was covered in blood.<br><br>'I told my friends to go and look for my hand. I then held my arm up and pressed the stump tightly to try to stop the bleeding.'<br><br>He said the attack happened suddenly, soon after a staring incident at a traffic junction near Blk 421, Jurong West Ave 1 at about 2pm last Wednesday .<br><br>He and his friends were viciously attacked by a youth wielding a 30cm-long machete.<br><br>One of the blows struck Siva so hard that it sliced through his bone.<br><br>RE-ATTACHED<br><br>But the good news is that his severed hand was found later, and Siva underwent a 2-hour-long emergency operation last week to re-attach it.<br><br>One of Siva's friends required 16 stitches after being slashed on the back of his head and on his back.<br><br>Police spokesman Stanley Norbert said police are making all efforts to hunt the assailants down.<br><br>The New Paper spoke to Siva and his parents at his hospital bedside yesterday.<br><br>His parents requested we not use their son's real name because his attackers are still at large.<br><br>Recalling the horrific incident, Siva claimed that he and his friends were walking along the road when he noticed two boys in their late teens staring at them.<br><br>He said they hurled vulgarities at his group.<br><br>One of them then pulled out a long weapon from his black jacket and charged at him.<br><br>'It happened so fast. I thought he had pulled out a metal pole.<br><br>'He was aiming for my head so I naturally raised my left arm to block the blow,' said Siva.<br><br>After that, he and his friends fled in the same direction.<br><br>The attackers chased one of his friends and slashed him from behind.<br><br>At that time, Siva did not realise what had happened to his hand.<br><br>'I just ran after the attack, not knowing that my hand had been chopped off,' he said.<br><br>'I didn't feel the pain at all.'<br><br>ALERTED BY FRIEND<br><br>It was only when his friend, Adam, yelled after seeing his bloodied stump that Siva realised how badly injured he was.<br><br>Said Adam: 'My mind went blank and I couldn't believe what I was seeing.<br><br>'I went back along the path we had taken but couldn't find the hand,' he said.<br><br>He guessed that the blow was so hard that the severed hand flew 'quite far'.<br><br>Siva, who is waiting for his N-level results, said he then started to feel giddy and collapsed by the side of the road.<br><br>'We decided to go to a doctor first because I was bleeding very badly,' said Siva.<br><br>But more drama was to follow.<br><br>A taxi they hailed drove off after the cabby was told that Siva's hand had been chopped off.<br><br>The driver told them he was changing shift and could not pick them up, Siva said.<br><br>'I was in a panic. As I held the stump, I could feel my skin and flesh slipping down because there was nothing to hold them together,' he said.<br><br>'And I kept thinking about my missing hand. Where could be it be? I also started to feel the pain.'<br><br>They managed to stop a passing car a few minutes later.<br><br>The driver drove them to the nearby Jurong Polyclinic.<br><br>On hearing what happened, a doctor rushed to the scene and searched for the hand.<br><br>By a stroke of good luck, the doctor spotted it in the bushes and returned about 10 minutes later with the hand in a box packed with ice.<br><br>Siva was then taken to the National University Hospital.<br><br>There, he underwent a 10-hour operation that night to re-attach his hand.<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper yesterday, Siva, whose left arm was heavily bandaged, said he can now wriggle his left fingers.<br><br>'I don't have any feeling in my hand at all. But doctors said that I should be making a full recovery,' he said.<br><br>'I was still groggy after the operation, but I turned to look at my left hand and was so happy to see it was back where it's supposed to be.'<br><br>Siva's father is hoping the attackers will be caught soon.<br><br>'They are so daring to do this in broad daylight. I want to know why they did this to my son,' he said.<br><br>On the operation, he said: 'It's just amazing how the doctors managed to re-attach his hand.'<br><br>Siva still gets the shivers when talking about the incident.<br><br>'I'm so thankful that I got my left hand back.<br><br>'In my panic, I forgot to thank the doctor who found it and ask his name.'<br></div>
