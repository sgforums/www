A British newspaper said the show scaled new heights of kitsch.<br><br>But the event, seen by about one billion people worldwide, highlighted its ability to stage big business gatherings.<br><br>Despite boasting one of the world's top-ranked airports and impressive convention entrees, industry experts say the country -- which bans the sale of chewing gum and Playboy magazine -- stumbles when it comes to the fun factor.<br><br>"Singapore has the image of being boring and authoritarian. For business travelers, it's like visiting your parents rather than going to somewhere fun," said Patrick Wilkerson, Regional Brand and Business Development Director of ad agency Leo Burnett.<br><br>Wilkerson, who has helped neighboring Thailand sell itself to tourists, said Singapore must overcome its unexciting image if it wants to attract more business travelers.<br><br>Such visitors contributed S$2.4 billion ($1.45 billion) to the country last year, or 30 percent of total tourism revenue.<br><br>Competition is intensifying as other Asian cities boost their infrastructure -- Singapore has about 36,500 hotel rooms but Shanghai and Bangkok already have about two times that number.<br><br>Convention and incentive travel is key to the government's plan to triple tourism revenues to S$30 billion by 2015. Tourism, hit by the SARS virus outbreak two years ago, is increasingly important for the tiny island's $110 billion economy as it loses more manufacturing jobs to low-cost neighbors.<br><br>"Whether it's attracting larger events such as the Olympic meeting or smaller industry conventions, it's all about creating jobs," said CIMB-GK Goh Economist Song Seng Wun.<br>Breaking the mould<br><br>Once described as "Disneyland with a death penalty" by science fiction writer William Gibson, Singapore has taken steps in recent years to rectify its reputation for being bland, allowing bar-top dancing and street busking.<br><br>Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong told a gathering of conference operators last month the state was ready to "break the old mould" to become one of the world's top meeting places.<br><br>It is set to legalize casinos and is in the process of picking developers for two casinos worth an estimated $5 billion.<br><br>Singapore, which only lifted a ban on the risque U.S. television show "Sex and the City" last year, will also soon have its own branch of Paris's Crazy Horse cabaret, famous for its erotic nude dance performances.<br><br>"We're all human -- we would all like to attend events in places that have prestige or glamour," said Sophie LeRay, Managing Director of naseba, a Monaco-based events organizer.<br><br>But she added that Singapore's predictability is a strength in these uncertain times.<br><br>While neighboring Thailand and Indonesia have suffered militant attacks, the city-state has remained unscathed.<br><br>"Singapore's drawbacks are the usual cliches that you can't smoke, can't chew gum and you can't jaywalk here. But once people arrive here, these cliches disappear," she said.<br>MICE are key<br><br>Singapore was ranked sixth for the number of international meetings hosted in 2003, after Paris, Vienna, Geneva, Brussels and London and ahead of Barcelona, Copenhagen, Berlin, Rome and New York, according the Union of International Associations.<br><br>The only Asian destination among the top-ranked cities, Singapore aims to lure more such gatherings, known in industry jargon as "MICE" travel -- Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions -- to its shores and hopes this kind of travel will see average growth of 15 percent per year in the next decade.<br><br>"We want to grow this portion because the MICE visitor spends more than the average tourist," Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Lee Boon Yang, told Reuters.<br><br>MICE visitors made up 26 percent of Singapore's 8.3 million tourist arrivals last year and the country wants this portion to rise to 35 percent by 2015.<br><br>Like other business travelers, MICE visitors typically spend two or three times more than leisure tourists. On average, business travelers fork out S$1,500 ($904) to $1,800 per trip, figures from the Singapore Tourism Board show.<br><br>Singapore's reputation for efficiency has attracted a series of high-profile events, including July's IC meeting, the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Asia Security Conference in June and the World Economic Forum in April.<br><br>Next September, it will host 16,000 delegates for the six-day annual meetings of the boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. Larger still will be Asian Aerospace 2006 in February, expected to draw 27,000 visitors.</div>

But there's always demand for porn, despite the fact it's against our value system.<br><br>Why? Because its abt sex basically. Every human being, once they grow up, will know abt sex. Sex is part of life and death. So why people crave porn? Because the system, which takes a dim view of sex, doesn't mention sex. That's why porn exists as an alternative channel for people to know abt sex.<br><br>Porn itself isn't a good sex education channel, I do agree. But as long as people suppress sex as sinful and refuses to discuss it openly and honestly to themselves and to their kids, people will always turn to porn as to fullfill their knowledge about the opposite sex and sex itself.<br><br>In short, people do have a pervert dark side- that includes everyone. Porn, in its most perverted manner, reaches to that dark side of people in order to get popular.<br><br>If we want to master that perverted monster in our soul, then we need to be open when comes to sex.
