Even if she has done no wrong, if there's an impeachment trial, all the dirt on her and her allies will be dug out to undermine the confidence in her government.. whatever the outcome, she will be on the losing end.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jul 5, 5:21 PM EDT<br><br><strong>Philippine Leader Ready to Face Trial</strong><br><br>By PAUL ALEXANDER<br>Associated Press Writer<br><br>MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is ready to face an impeachment trial and confident that she can refute the allegations of election fraud against her, her spokesman said Tuesday.<br><br>The allegations against Arroyo, which stem from wiretapped recordings of phone conversations between her and an election commissioner, have set off rumors of another "people power" revolt or a coup, either of which could destabilize the Philippines' nascent democracy.<br><br>Arroyo has acknowledged talking to the official and apologized for "a lapse in judgment," but denied influencing the outcome of the polls and dismissed opposition calls to resign.<br><br>"The impeachment is uncalled for and will just be a waste of the people's time," Arroyo's spokesman, Ignacio Bunye, said in a statement Tuesday. He added, however, that the trial is welcome if it is "the only way to put a stop to the prevailing political grandstanding and mudslinging."<br><br>On Tuesday, two key witnesses who supplied the copies of the recordings agreed to surrender all their tapes to a House of Representatives inquiry.<br><br>Separately, two lawyers filed impeachment complaints against Arroyo, claiming she rigged the election. The issue can be taken up only after Congress resumes on July 26.<br><br>House Speaker Jose de Venecia, a close Arroyo ally, said he would endorse an impeachment complaint against the president because it was his constitutional duty.<br><br>Arroyo's predecessor, President Joseph Estrada, faced an impeachment trial on corruption charges in 2000-01. Pro-Estrada senators blocked what was considered crucial evidence against him, triggering street protests that toppled him.<br><br>The Arroyo government, which has a strong majority in the House and a narrower margin in the Senate, appears to believe it could prevail in an impeachment process. A trial also would buy time for the crisis to pass and for Arroyo to shore up her credibility.<br><br>Opposition lawmakers suspect the impeachment complaints, which they believe to be faulty, were orchestrated by the administration to ensure that no other impeachment motion is filed within a year, a constitutional limitation.<br><br>"We are still wondering if President Arroyo will waive her rights under the anti-wiretapping law and her rights to privacy for us to proceed because any impeachment may be rendered useless if she won't," said Rep. Francis Escudero, the House minority leader.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. they are a lot of ppl offering themselves to lead the country, all hungry to ascend the seat of power but without intelligence or wisdom to govern. It is indeed a sad situation, especially so if you are a pinoy, watching events unfold the way they do.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>MANILA : The Philippines' influential Roman Catholic bishops criticised embattled President Gloria Arroyo over a political scandal but said they would not join mounting calls for her resignation.<br><br>The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, after a four-day meeting, said Arroyo had further eroded public trust in the political system.<br><br>"In the spirit of humility and truth, we declare our prayerfully discerned collective decision that we do not demand her resignation," the conference said in a statement read by its president Archbishop Fernando Capalla.<br><br>"Yet, neither do we encourage her simply to dismiss such a call from others."<br><br>Any demand by the 85 bishops for Arroyo to quit would have sealed her fate in the overwhelmingly Catholic country. Arroyo is clinging to power after eight ministers and two other cabinet officials resigned last Friday and urged her to follow suit.<br></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><br>Seems like the nail in the coffin for Arroyo. Either she step down peacefully, or sooner or later, it will turn bloody. Military is still on her side, but its a matter of time b4 some the officers will break rank to stage a coup.<br></span></div>
