            <div class='col-md body'>I guess many of us has at least a reason or a cause to choose a incument MP to serve you better.<br><br>For me, I would ask for the MP to look far ahead of the future and seek for long term benefits for his people.<br><br>Looking one of social issues will be on the teenagers. I have been observing that many of them have engaged themselves in BGR r/s as young as 13-14 years old, not even their early adulthood. That means that given the trend now and the trends in the future, it can be a big socialogical problem that give rise to high teen sex and abortion rate.<br><br>I wonder if anyone of us, being a parent one day will not want this to happen to your child or children. I hope our minsiters, esp our educaiotn minsiter can look into this problem and provide proactive solution now.</div>
