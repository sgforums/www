            <div class='col-md body'>Not to worry too much. What will happen will happen. It is better to take some proactive actions by building up the economy and making our services and products competitive. Japan is so far away without locational advantages yet its services and products are in demand. Scandinavian countries too are very far away and they do not experience such fear. If we can work with Southern Malaysia states and Indonesia closely and make the regions competitive and vibranc, the ocean liners will have to call on our ports because of critical mass in southern part of archipalago.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's hard to tell whether will we survive or maybe we will survive but our economy growth might decrease. Remember suez canal? before it was opened all ships from europe to Asia have to pass through the Cape of good hope, thus south Africa was somewhat properous then. However when the Suez canal opened up, all ships preferred to pass through the suez cause it is shorter and less dangerous than cape of good hope where lots of accidents happened.(in our case it may be the problem with pirates though)<br><br>For those who studied european history or social studies, remember venice? Venice's downfall came when a new trade route was found(though there were also other factors) they depended heavily on entrepot trade(like sg) in order to maximise the potential of their services and manufactured product.<br><br>Therefore, I think this kra canal issue shouldn't be taken too lightly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A risky undertaking, it will take years and years to build and at huge cost overruns, and they will have to deal with a lot of protest.<br><br>Protest from wildlife preservation groups, protest from greenpeace groups, protest against loss of habitat for certain animals or even some aquatic sea mammals, protest against loss of land rights of certain ethnic minorities, protest from ecological rights groups, complains against corrupt government officials trying to line their pockets.<br><br>Then there is the unrest in the south that might sabotage the project in a bid to preassure central thai government to allow self rule in the south. Or they may even see it as the government trying to "annex" their land thereby paving the way for ethnic migration(like indonesia) to other parts of thailand forcing them to disperse which will may make them even more determined to undermine the project.<br><br>Then there's malaysia who might not be very happy since more shipping now goes thru thailand kra canal and may even start levying "special taxes" for all cargoes that cross into overlapping malaysian waters is one possibility.<br><br>Another possibliity that during the early clearing and digging of the canal and construction on the west coast it may cause water levels in the tight straits to drop making it dangerous to heavy ships to pass thru causing security problems, huge delays for merchants shipping  resulting in losses of billions.<br><br>in the end it will cost both legs and arms of many thai presidential administrations.</div>
