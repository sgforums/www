The last known case of probable transmission of the disease through neurosurgical instruments in Australia was during the 1970s.<br><br>There have been five reported cases world-wide of CJD being transmitted via contaminated neurosurgical equipment.<br><br>Professor Kaye said CJD was one of the few diseases which "can withstand normal sterilisation processes". If a patient was known to have or have had symptoms of CJD, then disposable surgical instruments were used.<br><br>The man who died of the disease was originally admitted to the hospital for treatment for malignant brain tumours, a condition not associated with CJD.<br><br>The last operation performed on the man at the hospital was six months before the symptoms of the disease became apparent.<br><br>"This has not arisen because of any breach of protocol or guidelines," Professor Kaye said.<br><br>Diagnosis of CJD was only possible during an autopsy via a test which took two months to complete.<br></div>
