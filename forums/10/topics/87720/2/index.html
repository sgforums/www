            <div class='col-md body'>Of course. Hookers cheap at least. For those less successful guys when they feeling down, where got people around for them. Singapore ladies only eye guys with money or degree. You poor or low educated or not successful they keep away. Got some "stuff" they all run after you. Then after that say their famous line. Its not bout the money or paper. Make me want to puke. I think only a 18 year old would fall for that kind of talk. I seldom see singapore lady marry down. Where got. Even at all the temp jobs I took, they only good to handsome degree holders with money! At least even China girl better.

But they get along very well, but what i think is both party must be willing and don't mind gossips. And another important factor is their parents. Coz some parents kinda look down on others that with no degree or wat so ever. Then the parents don't want their daughter or son to stead with the other party.</div>
