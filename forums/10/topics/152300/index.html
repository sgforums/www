            <div class='col-md body'>Christian Science Monitor<br><br>New Al Qaeda tape hints at frustration<br><br>In the tape, 'Azam the American' threatens attacks against Melbourne, Los Angeles.<br><br>By Gretchen Peters and Howard LaFranchi<br><br>KABUL, AFGHANISTAN Â– Al Qaeda has marked the fourth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington with a warning of future strikes in Los Angeles and Melbourne, and this rebuke to the American people: You don't get what we're fighting for.<br><br>The 11-minute message, purportedly from Al Qaeda and produced by its video production house As-Sahab, was delivered to ABC News in Pakistan and seen by the Monitor in Kabul. In the video, a masked combatant identified as Azam al-Amriki, or Azam the American, speaks in American-accented English; Arabic subtitles are included.<br><br>Mr. Azam says Western leaders have misled the public about Al Qaeda's motivations.<br><br>"Four years after the blessed raids on New York and Washington, we find the people of the West continuing to speculate about their causes and objectives," he says. "We see no acceptable excuse for this continuing uncertainty, especially since the mujahideen have been unambiguous in stating their methodology on justice and the reasons for their armed struggle against the crusaders, and they have not heeded anything."<br><br>For the rest..go here..<a href="http://csmonitor.com/2005/0912/p06s01-wosc.html" rel="nofollow">http://csmonitor.com/2005/0912/p06s01-wosc.html</a><br><br>------------<br><br>Yes Azam, you and your bunch are double-headed snakes who wage war on little kids and expect the world to transform into your Wahabbi caliphate?Dream on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON (AFP) - The British army said it had rescued two of its soldiers from Shiite militiamen in southern     Iraq following fears local police had colluded with the militia amid a mounting breakdown in order.<br><br>British authorities said Tuesday their troops stormed an Iraqi police jail in Basra the day before in a bid to rescue the pair, but only after talks for the men's release failed.<br><br>Defense Secretary John Reid said the military had been "absolutely right" to stage the dramatic rescue mission, noting that it was "very worrying" how the pair ended up in militia hands.<br><br>"But we don't know whether the police, for instance under threat of their own death, handed two soldiers over or what was the degree of collusion," Reid told BBC television.<br><br>Brigadier John Lorimer, commander of the 12 Mechanized Brigade in Basra, said in a statement that he did not know why Iraqi police had not handed the two soldiers over to multi-national forces, as London says is required by law.<br><br>Iraqi officials said the two soldiers, who appeared to be working undercover, were dressed in Arab clothes and driving a civilian car. They were detained after firing at a police patrol, Iraqi police said.<br><br>The rescue operation followed a shooting incident and riots in which two British armored vehicles were torched as their crews fled for safety in the southern Iraqi city of Basra.<br><br>Reid said the soldiers seen emerging from a burning tank under mob attack suffered only minor injuries. Photographs of the attack were splashed over the front pages of British newspapers.<br><br>Lorimer said British forces had repeatedly asked police to free the men.<br><br>"From an early stage, I had good reason to believe that the lives of the soldiers were at risk and troops were sent to the area of Basra near the police station to help ensure their safety by providing a cordon," he said.<br><br>"As shown on television these troops were attacked with firebombs and rockets by a violent and determined crowd," he said.<br><br>"Later in the day, however, I became more concerned about the safety of the two soldiers after we received information that they had been handed over to militia elements.<br><br>"As a result I took the difficult decision to order entry to the police station. By taking this action, we were able to confirm that the soldiers were no longer being held by the Iraqi police."<br><br>The pair were unharmed and now back with British forces, Lorimer added.<br><br>An Iraqi member of parliament, Ali Dabagh, said the Shiite militiamen from the Mehdi Army had attempted to take the British soldiers hostage to exchange them for two militia leaders arrested on Sunday by British forces in the town.<br><br>Independent defense analyst Paul Beaver said in London that the problems appeared to have been caused by a British intelligence operation to infiltrate insurgent forces going wrong.<br><br>Britain's defense secretary said it had taken time to train and build trust with the Iraqi authorities installed following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein during the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003.<br><br>Reid refused to give a definite time for British troops to leave the country.<br><br>"We have said all along that our troops will stay there as long as they are needed and requested by the Iraqis, that when they withdraw... it will not be an event, it will be a process," he said.<br><br>Reid acknowledged that as the interim Iraqi government and coalition forces seek to cement democracy in Iraq, the insurgency was likely to grow even "more frenetic, more frantic."<br></div>
