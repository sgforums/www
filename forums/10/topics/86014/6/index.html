"you should never ever tell others how to behave."<br>what's the problem? As long as your behavior affects someone else, there will be someone telling you how to behave. I even heard somewhere in the world people use a whip to tell.<br>You do not put your big nose into other's muffin then say"you should never tell me how to behave" and expect nothing bad will happen, do you?<br>2. "Secondly, I resent the high-handed ways that the PRC chooses to treat others. blah blah blah"<br>you pointed your finger at china's behavior but said the others should not do that to SG?

However, it is very different for those "best of best" in the government bodies.<br><br>To the general singaporeans, they think it is not a big deal and china over-reacts. it is just a "personal visit". However, it is not true.

At this sensitive moment, the DPM visited Taiwan. To us, you send a wrong signal to Chen Shui Bian and you regonize them and you are standing the same line with them to prevend china taking back Taiwan.

Taiwan is just like the symbol for the past 100 years sad history to china. We just can't forget it.<br><br>6) As for myself, I strongly against that Chian sells missile to Malasia and let them threaton other chinese. Just think those chinese in Indonesia. We can solve the problem through other ways.<br><br>7) Both parties need to be cool down and talk faithfully. Forget about the "FACE".

            <div class='col-md body'>I really appreciate kenken's views.<br><br>I found this from the Chinese foreign ministry website.<br><br><a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/xwfw/fyrth/t143616.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/xwfw/fyrth/t143616.htm</a><br><br>If you can read chinese, there is a style in the way that these statements are drafted.<br><br>For one, i remember that in the very first statement, that the feelings of the 1.3 billion chinese people are hurt by the visit.<br><br>now, the foreign describe that in the visit, their "core interest" had been violated.<br><br>It always seems to me that the words are carefully chosen to maximise their impact, which appeals to very nationalistic feelings. I personally would have found it very difficult to appreciate what "core interest" mean, though I think it means that Taiwan must be isolated from contacts with other nations. In that aspect, LHL did do the Chinese a disfavour.<br><br>One must also ask if the visit by LHL was absoloutely necessary?  If so, what about the timing? And is it necessary for such a high level official to go? Would not someone more junior in rank have sufficed?<br><br>LHL made a calculated move to visit Taiwan, knowing full well China will not be pleased with the visit. And it is true that it backfired. Singapore suffers the brunt of the consequences, not China. But how badly has it backfired? Not too much I feel.  The cost of the consequences do not seem to be too big, that is for sure, only high level visits have been cancelled. So it should not have too big of an impact.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is interesting to note, MFA has said that if Singapore were to accept China's request not to go to Taiwan, it would have affected Singapore's international standing as an independent sovereign nation. That I totally agree. But the point of threading on someone's toes is also valid. LHL was received by the highest level officials, befitting a head of state visit. It is an unofficial visit, says the singapore government, but is the substance of the visit unofficial? I think the Singapore govt wanted it to be, but the taiwanese did not want it to be. If unofficial and private, then there should have been absoulutely a media blackout on the visit. The singapore press did not report, which is the right thing to do, but the taiwanese press did. How should the taiwanese press know about Lee's visit? Your guess is as good as mine. It is no wonder that Lee has inadvertably been used by the Taiwanese to promote independence, by giving his visit blatant media coverage. Chen Shui Bian gave his visit the same kind of treatment that any foreign dignitary to taiwan would receive - which is bound to infurate China. Lee has said he did not speak to the Taiwanese media. So the stories about Teo Chee Hean visiting with LHL must have been made up by the Taiwanese then. My point - China is simply upset that Lee's visit had given a boost to independence advocators, of which LHL had absoloutely no control of. LHL's visit has only given Taiwan an advantage. In fact, LHL played right into Taiwan's game, and the Taiwanese made full use of it. China, I guess, had very good reasons not to have LHL go to Taiwan. It is then no wonder, that the "core interest" has been violated.<br><br>So my question is, what could have been the reason that made the visit absoloutely unaviodable (to the extent that China says "Why must China's sovereignty and core interests be harmed as a price to support Singapore's rights and international standing?", read the chinese foreign ministry statement for its exact phrasing)? Lee's explaination that he is there to understand the situation in Taiwan seems to me to brush only the surface of a deeper cavity. His answer is too vague. It is no wonder the Chinese did not accept his explanation. So i guess, LHL must be there to settle some other critical issues, which could not have been revealed.<br><br>I suppose if there was a media blackout, then China would probably not have made too much noise, since the Chinese was notified beforehand that LHL was going. But the taiwanese media made reports a few days into the visit, so I suppose China had no choice but to announce her displeasure, otherwise, China would be seen to be condoning the visit, which is the last thing she would want.<br><br>In any case, I believe Singapore should and would have made calculations into the kind of impact that would affect Singapore should China reveal its displeasure. I guess we should be lucky that the impact has not been too harsh, like what I mentioned above.<br><br>It is my opinion that the Taiwanese have a motive in having media coverage of LHL's visit. But LHL should not be exonerated from responsibility I feel. He could have requested the Taiwanese side that his visit should receive total media blackout. Of course, that would benefit Singapore, but not Taiwan. In any case, does the Taiwanese government have any control over the media? If LHL had known that the taiwanese government could not control the media, then the singapore government should have prepared to do some damage control , so that it would not further erode the relationships between the Taiwan and China.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My view is that China has a right to reintegrate Taiwan and we cannot dispute that Taiwan is a legitimate province of China. Saying you want independence after 50 years of warfare doesn't make it right, just or happen. Singapore needs to continue to play an intermediary role and be viewed as a negotiator in a peaceful reunification process by both sides, that is the palatable position to be in. Technically they are still at war and one nation simply divided by the course of recent history. The United States carried out its Civil War when southern states wanted to separate over a matter of diffenet lifestyles and politics...and at massive cost the victor ensured the country remained together...China has the same right to prevent Taiwan from independence, for the US to prevent it is hyprocrisy.<br><br>With respect to China's rise...China is still nothing without access to the U.S. and European markets, though this may moderate over the next 25 or so years. If the US were to shut access tomorrow, China would be screwed. China has become a trading and manufacturing nation reliant on trade routes, raw materials and the excahnge of goods and services, it is not a self-sufficient inward looking nation able to sustain simply on its own demand. With this freedom comes international responsibilities to behave within acceptable order and civilized boundaries, such are the conditions it accepted by joining the WTO and GATT. It's leaders know this.<br><br>China will be a regional power in 25 years, not a global power. Unlike the U.S. which straddles the two major oceans, and the USSR which straddles two major continents, China is geographically isolated to the north east coast of Asia and will never bring to bear sufficient influence outside its immediate sphere to challenge the US and its global allies. Moreover, China has numerous competing interests in its immediate vicinity which collectively will strain its ability to venture too far afield, including India, Russia, Japan, and the US. Any two together would likely be able to contain and defeat China. It is not in China's interest to be an aggressor, except when it comes to finalizing the chapter on its civil war and reclaiming the renegade province of Taiwan.<br><br>China will however be an economic powerhouse and probably have considerable influence in capital markets just as Japan had in the 80s, which in many respects may give them more implicit control over affairs than military aggression might. It's probable China will become the world's biggest economy within 30-50 years with roughly three times the population of each of North America and Europe.</div>
