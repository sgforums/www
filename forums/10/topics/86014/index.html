            <div class='col-md body'>sorry about im going off topic with regards to ICBM<br>and Aegis...<br><br>ICBM and Aegis is enemy lor<br><br>its just like icbm is a stone<br><br>u throw icbm which is a "Stone" at ur enemy's house<br><br>the enemy use a "rubber band" which is aegis to hit the stone , so that the stone won't hit the house<br><br>ICBM is inter continental ballistic missile with a range of 6000-12000 KM<br><br>Aegis is operated with satellites , which explain the sibei super huge radar they got above thier ship's hull<br><br>the satellite den later scan the area...satellites can scan a huge area at once<br>once they detect heat from launch..they will alert Mr.Aegis..<br><br>den mr.Aegis will launch PAC-III missiles..to do missile-missile interception<br>The Anti Missile Missile has sometimes failed alot of times..thats why pple question the reliability<br><br>or maybe a land based platform lor..<br><br>about Arrow its some sort like Aegis but more of land based i think<br><br>and we got oso the Aster-60 or 90 ar..<br><br>Oh ya...About the US's...they got every way to counter every move of the enemy..Even though US's armed force may be stretched..they can still win china easily..<br><strong><br>Last time there was a project , called satellite killer which is designed to operate as a space fighter ...to destroy enemy satellites some sort like X-Wing ba in star wars</strong><br><br>They keep on saying 20 years china will overtake USA<br>but what i feel it is in terms of.. Economic stuff<br><br>but not Military..US has FAR invested billions of dollars into military stuff<br>trust me even by 2025 ..China's military tech won't be even at USA at 2001<br><br>The Cold War HAS Caused FAR Too Many Black projects which is designed for a super WWW III conflict..<br><br>The normal F-22 and F-16 and Apache are only weapons of conventional warfares..<br><br>The weapons which u see in those Starwars movie are the real weapons which is going to be developed...<br><br>Don't be surprise if YF-35 has space capabilities to go beyond 100 KM of altitude ..<br><br>The US has always been wary of China and Russia's Secret Military Cooperation..<br><br>Therefore the US and NATO cooperation..<br>My bet is on the Euro fighter + F-22 for NGF..<br><br>Eurofighter is like a beginning of F-15..which faced many problems too at its early stage..<br><br>I will surely take Euro Fighter..can slowly upgrade and with avionics..even though at early stage will encounter problems..<br><br>which project don't encounter problems?<br><br>Singapore has been supporting China and US+Taiwan<br>won't be surprised if Singapore support more of US after this..<br><br>US has backing of NATO and Taiwan , South Korea and Japan and quite a no. of allies in the middle east and the world<br><br>China is just appearing on the world's list..<br>The amount of allies China has on Europe is lesser..<br><br>and if any conflict breaks out , more will support the yanks<br>don't forget singapore is a critical port..in terms of exports and imports<br><br>alot of major shippings is done thru PSA..if China wants to be unfriendly well..OK..<br><br>But singapore might support china cause' we're all chinese<br>but hey whats up with the treatment of HongKong and Taiwan and Singapore?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Especially when you have the USAF to brass talking about the need for a dedicated space command by 2030, developments like the Common Aero Vehicle for rapid deployment of space assets and counterforce.What we see in the current US military inventory is developed in the 60s and 70s, even the F-22 was developed in 1975 thereabouts onwards.The United States had the ability to perform an heavy scale amphibious and airborne assault on Normandy in WW2, and China is only beginning to show some ability to do limited force projection right now.What does that say about the gap in military superiority?</div>
