            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>My view is that China has a right to reintegrate Taiwan and we cannot dispute that Taiwan is a legitimate province of China. Saying you want independence after 50 years of warfare doesn't make it right, just or happen. Singapore needs to continue to play an intermediary role and be viewed as a negotiator in a peaceful reunification process by both sides, that is the palatable position to be in. Technically they are still at war and one nation simply divided by the course of recent history. The United States carried out its Civil War when southern states wanted to separate over a matter of diffenet lifestyles and politics...and at massive cost the victor ensured the country remained together...China has the same right to prevent Taiwan from independence, for the US to prevent it is hyprocrisy. </blockquote>I don't really think so... As I said before, Taiwan is still under chinese Gov, except tat it is KMT and not Communists. Looking from a history prospect, I don't really see any right for China to force taiwan to be part of the state. They r not at war anymore... No one is attacking the other. And this has carried on for many years. Even if u classified tat they r still having a war, they still have sovereign of their own country unless they surrender. It is like malaysia being occupied by japan during WW2, unless japan carry on its attack and conquer singapore (which it did), singapore is still under the british.<br><br>U can say about South and North forces in America war, but before the war is finished, the south remains under the jurisdiction of the south while the north is under its own control. Unless they complete the war, which america did, it remains as such. So unless china really occupied taiwan, then taiwan is very much its own nation.<br><br>Singapore better don't be kaypoh and do anything to both parties. Tis is not appreciated work and may develop potential problems.</div>

LMAO i cant believe this...making the news so HARD when they kept sooooo very quiet abt SARS and only admitted when they cant hide it any further!...LMFAO! what a sham and full of Shame! Im not trying to say they created Sars or anything..at least they could have shared and alerted the world that a new deadly virus has surfaced! maybe PRC giovt wanted to get nobel prize to be the first to find a cure lol! how wrong and it killed many. what can u say abt that?....thats a crime for covering up too but the world is more forgiving to overlook PRCs misgivings!....so PRC govt.....stfu, grow up.<br>Dont make ppl see you as little children in a man suit. We, Singaporeans have every RIGHTS to visit when and where we want to. Not to sound bias, the Prc ppl also hav every rights to go where they want to. But talking (S.H.I.T) and trying to decide which nation can visit which country, its as good as trying to undermine Sing govt's decision and intelligence. so thats &lt;---BS (BullS h i t!)<br>we maynot be united in our countrie's policies but thats for our own singaporean to say or bear abt it...but Alien verbal threat and abuse?...Its A F u c k i n g BIG NO NO!...so shut it PRC and get on with life...unless if this is the only kinda life u love living  going around ordering ppl bla bla bla...=SAD<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/quote]</div>

Their economy is fast recovering. HongKong may appear chaotic to many of you but that's because they are a matured democracy.

Bear in mind that China took over in 1997, the same yr financial crisis struck Asia and HK was hit in no way lighter than any other country.<br><br>HK has actually done well. What they were facing were much worse than Singapore: 1. Properties prices went down, Shenzhen and other Chinese southern cities grew stronger and really threaten their position. Many HK ppl now go to these places for properties. 2. Ports in Guangzhou and Zhuhai are taking away HK business. 3. Taiwanese can now go into China via Macau, hence reduce reliance on HK airport. 4. HK have to continue to depend on trade, services and finance, without manufacturing. 5. Shanghai threatening their financial center position.<br><br>With so much against them, they have done well.<br><br>What is interesting to see is that they are moving a step further, going for more political freedom. We see year after year over half a million ppl take to the streets. Even in Indonesia we saw a big election with 5 parties involved went on peacefully. In Singapore, our government is still afraid that any strong opposition will jeopardise our political stability, any political rally will fraighten away investors.<br><br>Sigh!!

            <div class='col-md body'>it seems a lot of people in Singapore appears to understand China? But is it so? Truelly speaking, many of you dont know what china is.<br><br>I am self a Chinese, I confess I dont know much about Singapore. Despite that, whenever Singapore is mentioned in China, Chinese people would mostly fondly take it as a country, with which we share a common cultural and historical root.

If Prince Lee went to TW and the mainland government vioced no complaint(just as you wish), that would indeed be strange.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the issues here is all about sovereignty.. Every state in the world is very protective of their soversignty... After all it is the very reason for their (the state) exsitence.<br><br>Sad to say, protecting one's sovereignty in this interconnecting world often means that we will have to infringe upon other's sovereignty...

Indonesia has the right to say "it's my forest we are burning what.." or something aloong that line.. (Don't flame me.. as I know that this issues can well lead to another round of debate..

He is the son of Singapore' s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, and shares his father's measured, practical and technocratic approach to government. He also shares a somewhat condescending, didactic bent, and a tendency to chide and admonish rather than charm and encourage. His speeches brim with grim economic prognoses and stern injunctions to Singaporeans to tighten their belts. After a 14-year interval under the affable Goh Chok Tong, most Singaporeans will find the reversion of leadership to <span class="large"><strong>the Lee dynasty </strong></span>more like a cold shower than an exhilarating leap into the unknown.<br><br>Mr Lee senior, now 80 years old, still sits in the cabinet (as senior minister, rather than prime minister), and supervises the Government Investment Corporation (GIC), which manages Singapore's foreign reserves. Meanwhile, Mr Lee junior's wife, Ho Ching, runs Temasek, a government holding company that owns stakes in Singapore's biggest firms, while his brother, Lee Hsien Yang, runs Singapore Telecommunications, the biggest local firm of all.<br><br>Fans of the family argue that this concentration of power stems simply from its members' remarkable talent, not their connections. They claim the younger Mr Lee's rapid ascent through the ranks of the army to become a brigadier-general by the age of 32 rested purely on merit, as did his promotion to the post of deputy prime minister after only six years in politics.<br><br>The prime-minister-to-be certainly projects great intelligence and determination. He has survived a bout of cancer and stoically endured the death of his first wife. While in the army, he directed the dramatic rescue of passengers stranded in a disabled cable car. As finance minister, he has presided over a much-needed and much-delayed liberalisation of the financial sector. His father says that he would already be prime minister were it not for misplaced concerns about nepotism.<br><br>But many Singaporeans assume that Mr Lee pÃ¨re struck a deal with Mr Goh, engineering his rise to power in exchange for a promise that he would eventually give way to Mr Lee fils. At any rate, Mr Goh made the younger Mr Lee his deputy from the moment he succeeded the elder Mr Lee as prime minister, in 1990. The new man has never had any rivals. The members of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), which controls all but two seats in parliament, selected him unanimously as prime minister, as did the party's executive committee and the cabinet.<br><br>The new Mr Lee appears to see nothing wrong with this sort of arrangement. He fiercely defends the PAP's more underhand election tactics, such as threatening to put districts that vote for the opposition at the bottom of the list for public spending. He claims to want a more vigorous public debate, but promises to Â“demolishÂ” any critic who undermines the government's standing. The threat is real: in recent years, one opposition figure found himself bankrupt after losing a defamation suit, while another wound up in jail.<br><br></div>

Although war is a bit too heavy, but then the concept is the same. China refuse to obey Japan in letting them search for the soldier, thus Japan can have the right to launch a war ? We cannot resort to threats such as claiming the ties will be off and start a series of actions or war to force other people to do wat u want. Tat is threathening.
