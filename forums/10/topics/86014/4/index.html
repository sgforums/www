Chinese Chinese? they won't hesitate to use the missiles on Taiwanese and on singaporeans , by letting our potential adversaries use it..<br><br>LOL , if we lose some economic opportunities overseas never mind,cause wun affect much stuffs locally..<br><br>But if it threatens our national security it is certainly a cause for alarm...especially if the short range missiles which they are going to sell to m'sia is those which are pointing at taiwan..haiz<br><br>Who is petty now? lol...see for urself ba...<br><br>THIS is a major cause of of concern now!<br>This is definitely going to be very heat up ! IMAGINE missiles which they are pointing at taiwan are now going to be pointed at us..in the future.<br><br>Please lor chinese chinese...just think CN's civil wars so many chinese kill chinese u think they give a damn? LOL.<br><br>I believe those missiles are from those russian tech and if our potential adversaries fire it on us..there will not be any time to react or whatever..<br><br>unlike Taiwan who got AEGIS and ARROW and some time to react..we got none..and when the missile is fired...u will know that lives will be lost.<br><br>Must protest against the sales!<br>Cause its a new form of introduction of new weapons in SEA!<br><br>LoL anyway 7 trillion in debt is indeed very huge. But anyway they are prepared for a super scale conflict.<br><br>Anyway , i just wanna tell u all something , i studied history and cold war..<br>NATO and USA have a agreement in which 1 of their main duties is to prevent countries from being swallowed by communism.(as long as NATO exists)<br><br>They dared to intervene against Soviet union and China together..(previously<br>at afghanistan, at taiwan, at korea, at vietnam , and give out plenty of monetary aid..what makes you think that US won't intervene?<br><br>If US don't intervene, that will be the day whereby freedom dies..<br>Why? Cause pple in tW don't have the right to choose whether they wanna be with CHINA/STATUS QUO<br><br>PLEASE lor..if u say that USA is under local debt of 7 trillion<br>den lemme tell u something , about 5 years before WW II , they were also in debt and thats the Great Depression , in which their economy is experiencing<br>trouble and guess what saved the Economy ? WAR. if u want me to explain about it can.. i can go on for ages.<br><br>Anyway if china+russia and taiwan and jap and sg and blah blah blah<br>go challenge US + Nato , the latter will win. Why?<br>US believes in a policy of overwhelming , and im not following against the side of biased against who ever or whatever..<br><br>Anyway China is not really as tough as SU during the peak of the cold war..<br>cause Russia at that time already has conducted tons and tons of space launch and spy satellites..lol...and developed tit for tat counters for every plane made..like MIG-21,MIG-23,MIG-25,MIG-27,MIG-29,MIG-31,SU-27,SU-24,<br>SU-30,SU-33 and those T-60 , T-91 and blah blah ,HIND  and don't forget Kiev and Typhoon class subs..i can go on for ages<br><br>China got some jets some J-6 sheng yang, F-7 and J-10<br>just look at the variety of planes which could be manufactured by SU..<br>Do you know how much resources has to be dedicated any how much production has to be achieved in order to get something called "RESULT"?<br><br>The famous RPG-7 and AK-47 is oso invented by them.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>USA and SU that time is very very comparable in terms of military size..<br><br>if compare the time between 1st space manned craft and CN's 1st manned craft its about 40+ years..LOL<br><br>anyway CN is still using cold war technology..which is the decomissioned stuff, enuf said. ECONOMICALLY i admit they are like a roaring dragon ,within 10 to 20 years, NGF will appear and those aircraft like SU-30 and SU-33 will be obsolete..and btw there' isn't a aircraft to rival on F-22 and YF-35  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  , aiyah i just wanna know the results of a dogfight between J-10 and YF-35 and see the results..<br><br>Anyway You need NEXT Generation Craft to fight in a enviroment right?<br>Say that China's NGF is equivalent to the F-16 C/D , and that means to draw with the F-22 they must make NNGF to challenge.. and to Win they need NNNGF , Next next next generation fighter which will take many years<br><br>Still though 3 million cannot be underestimated , but the quality and morale of the troops must be there , ground forces should be reduced , cause no adversary will ever land in Chinese soil !! a very big risk , naval forces should quadruple in size and the if possible Europe should have more military contact with CN , the reason why pple rather choose MIG cause they have been tested in various wars.. and some conflicts =/ ...anyway overall MIGS vs US-made jets , i believe overall MIGs get downed more..wonder why?  I rather take a battle proven's country jets to the test or French Rafale , thank you , at least i know about the specifications and the arnaments ..rather den a country whose jets are not really tested and technology based on a previous superpower =)</div>

Because if you do, I don't think you are entirely correctly...<br><br>The Aegis system is a phased array radar system, unlike our ordinary rotating radar system. The beams are directed by phase differences which can only be worked out by a sophisticated computer. The huge radar above the hull is probably another fire control radar? The phased array normally consists of 4 panels mounted in the radar tower.<br><br>The satellite link is available in almost any vessel with a good Command and Control System/Action Information System and a satellite antenna. Nothing to do with Aegis really. Aegis is powerful because the phased array radars can track multiple targets simultaneously, something that most fire control radars are limited by the speed of the servo-motor systems and the number of radars itself.<br><br>Of course, if there's another Aegis system that I have never heard of, consider myself as having spoken rubbish...and I apologise.</div>

Its weapons can be trained on targets at a wide range of altitudes from wave top to directly overhead, and is capable of engaging anti-ship cruise missiles and manned aircraft flying in all speed ranges from subsonic to supersonic. The AEGIS system has been employed in all environmental conditions, having both all-weather capability and the abilitt to operate in chaff and jamming environments.<br><br>The surface Navy's AEGIS system provides area defense for the battle group as well as a clear air picture for more effective deployment of F-14 and F/A-18 aircraft. AEGIS enables fighter aircraft to concentrate more on the outer air battle while cruisers and destroyers assume a greater responsibility for battle group area defense. Technological advances in missile and computer battle management systems make it possible for AEGIS equipped ships to join carrier air assets in outer air defense, and the increased accuracy of AEGIS weapon systems results in minimizing the expenditure of assets.<br>The heart of the AEGIS systems is the AN/SPY-1, a multi-functional phased-array radar capable of automatic detection and tracking of targets. This high-powered (four megawatt) radar is able to perform search, track and missile guidance functions simultaneously with a capability of over 100 targets. The first Engineering Development Model (EDM-1) was installed in the test ship, USS Norton Sound (AVM 1) in 1973.<br><br>The system's computer- based command and decision element is the core of the AEGIS combat system. This interface makes the AEGIS combat system capable of simultaneous operation against a multi-mission threat: anti-air, anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare. [/img]</div>
