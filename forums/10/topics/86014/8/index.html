            <div class='col-md body'>As a Singaporean Chinese, i guess it would be the most appropriate race and nationality to comment on this issue.<br><br>Taiwan is an instrumental ally to us, this cannot be doubted. They provided us with land for our military exercises, and provided us with economical and technologcal security in the midst of China's Cultural Revolution, and Big Four's chaos. Hence historically, we are indebted to them, for they did not turn away a ailing small nation.<br><br>China in turn, has become something like a two-faced man. Relations blow hot, blow cold, and this is something not promising for a country dependent on global trade(Singapore). Singapore has so far done nothing that should infuriate China. And even though we have a population of 70% Chinese, we are not subordinated to any Chinese Govt. Taiwan has remained our ally through these years, due our American relations, and due to our commitments there.<br><br>But i have to say that, China-Bashing is no answer. No matter what govt is in control of China, our roots are still in the land mass of China. We are still Chinese, and we'll still support one another. Why let politics destroy your roots?<br><br>The Communist Party had their Cultural Revolution and other upheavals. But what makes you think we're so much off better? We had our dialects waved away in order to make the political climate in Singapore more favorable for the ruling party, and we had so many other customs, cultures taken away in order for us to feel nothing for China, as during the 60s-70s, China was communists, and we're non-communists.<br><br>But all these posts by so many of us proves something, that after all of that "Speak Mandarin Campagin", "Speak English Campaign", we're still fundementally Chinese at heart.<br><br>So leave the Taiwan Politics to still chair-throwing and pie-slinging, and leave the China Politics to their threats to curb their insecurity. We're still Chinese at heart.<br><br>However, beneath all this. There is but one clear winner. As Chinese throw one another at each throat, who stands to gain?</div>

It is funny to treat a shield as threat.<br><br>China never forgets those who have ever helped us, we always try our best to return even with double. Just as we never forget it is the singaporean who offered us an ambulance to finght with japanese in 1940s, and lots of aid from many countries during the big flood in1998.<br>If you review the relationship between singapore and china before and after<br>establishing diplomatic relation, you will see, no other country can have the same convenience as singapore's leader to visit China before establishing diplomatic relation. After that day, no other country can have the same convenience as singapore's leader to visit Taiwan. (See http://www.zaobao.com/yl/yl501_240704.html, http://www.zaobao.com/yl/yl504_210704.html). Certainly, it is not strange to singapore, but very strange to any other country. This is only because we treat Singapore as a trustable friend, and Singapore did push all things to good side in the past. But now, see, does your DPM visit bring any positive influence to the local relationship?<br><br>Now, it still is a very tough time for China and chinese. We are so poor during the past 100 years, so as to be discriminated even including some overseas chinese. As your said: chinaman.<br>Whatever you are a chinese or not, since you expressed your stupid arrogance and the ignorance in some basic knowledge, you are not worth for us to make a friend!

"private visit" becomes a word only in speaking. So, if there are somthing out of control, whose fault? </blockquote>Looking from another light, we r victims of circumstances ourselves. As i said before, it is meant to be low-keyed. Even in our newspaper and news we do not know tat our DPM has travel to taiwan. Only when it has blown big in taiwan then do we know about it...<br><br><blockquote>Now Singaporeans have free entrance permit to China for fiften days, do chinese obtain the same right from Singapore? </blockquote>I believe tat singapore is one of the easiest and cheapest visa to obtain for chinese or for most of the world. I had a China chinese friend who had much much trouble trying to obtain visa for a business trip to japan or germany. For a visa to japan, they demand a guarantor from a japanese resident residing in japan. For a visa to Indonesia it costs $70 US too.</div>

The Mongolians then took over the Chinese system of government and formed the Yuan dynasty (that was when Marco Polo came). The local Han Chinese overthrew the Mongolians and formed the Ming dynasty.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a citizen of PRC. This topic interests me. In China nowadays, ADSL, broadband and BBS are part of people's life, and we spend a lot of time lingering in our favorite forums. Yes Chinese government controls the access to foreign media including websites such as CNN and forbides private installing of satellite TV equipment. You can watch CNN news only in three-star hotel or above. But you know anybody with some experience of internet know how to use proxies.<br><br>People in mainland China only know general information about Singapore. To many, she is a city state with an area less than Hong Kong, and keeps a busthling economy. Singapore investment in China is not big and noisy enough to raise our attention. Before Li HianLong's visit of Taiwan, many people thinks Singapore government is pro-PRC instead of pro-Taiwan. Some liberalists in our forums attacks Singapore as a dictatorship that appeases the Chinese government. Now I read some posts about Singapore, accusing her two-face agitating in ASEAN over Na Shan Islands (or the Spratly islands), her yearly exercise with 4 nations against "submarines from northern socialist big nation", her eagerness to drag US military force based in her port, the ex-PM Mr. Wu's call for abandoning mainland China when the Chinese government was fighting against SARS, the unspoken support of Taiwan independence (?), against her weird arrogance over mainland Chinese developed from decades of white man's colonist rule.<br><br>Unfortunately, after reading the posts here, I found some Singaporean does inclines to Taiwan independence.

Even Nepal is seperated from china by the himalayas. If just because a country is close to china gives justification for war, then slowly china can swallow up the whole world. They can attck taiwan, vietnam, korea, nepal, russia and after tat they can attack hawaii, laos, middle east, europe and so on and so forth since the newly acquired country adds to the perimeter of china.<br><br>If one justify the reason for war just because conquring it will make its own country richer or better, than we r really going back to the 17 century where there r such a post called minister of war and people launch war so they can get some benefits from it. Japanese is right to attack China u know, they want to get its resources and its path toward the mainland. When the 8 nations united to fight china, they r right too as they get to profit from it and force china to open out its port. In tat case maybe US is right when it fight Iraq so tat they can get to control its oil. Heck, maybe malaysia is right to attack singpore in future as they can utilise our island for a port. Wat happend to international law and order, justice and freedom ?<br><br>BTW the official stand from our politicians maintain the one china policy.

In China nowadays, ADSL, broadband and BBS are part of people's life, and we spend a lot of time lingering in our favorite forums.

You can watch CNN news only in three-star hotel or above.

To many, she is a city state with an area less than Hong Kong, and keeps a busthling economy. Singapore investment in China is not big and noisy enough to raise our attention. Before Li HianLong's visit of Taiwan, many people thinks Singapore government is pro-PRC instead of pro-Taiwan. Some liberalists in our forums attacks Singapore as a dictatorship that appeases the Chinese government. Now I read some posts about Singapore, accusing her two-face agitating in ASEAN over Na Shan Islands (or the Spratly islands), her yearly exercise with 4 nations against "submarines from northern socialist big nation", her eagerness to drag US military force based in her port, the ex-PM Mr. Wu's call for abandoning mainland China when the Chinese government was fighting against SARS, the unspoken support of Taiwan independence (?), against her weird arrogance over mainland Chinese developed from decades of white man's colonist rule.<br><br>Unfortunately, after reading the posts here, I found some Singaporean does inclines to Taiwan independence.

That I agree.<br><br>Taiwan I guess is "unfinished business" because if Taiwan continues to exist, there will always be the problem of 2 Chinas, which is itself an ideological THREAT to the fact that there must and should only be one China. There cannot be 2 "middle kingdoms". Independence of Taiwan is therefore unacceptable to PRC, and is a matter of principle and national pride to the government in the PRC. Not only would there be a severe loss of face by China if Taiwan becomes independent, it would mean the breakdown of the fundemental chinese identity of a common people, common values and common social norm, none of which the govt in Beijing is willing to accept.<br><br></div>
