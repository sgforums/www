The JSF program is a US-led multi-nation project to develop an advanced, cost-effective multi-role stealth strike fighter that can perform air defense and ground attack missions with precision engagement, enhanced combat survivability and lower cost of maintenance.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s bilateral SCP arrangement with the US provides an early opportunity to assess the JSFÂ’s ability to meet the Republic of Singapore Air ForceÂ’s longer-term operational requirements for a multi-role fighter. Singapore will have insights into the JSFÂ’s development progress and be able to conduct studies for integration of SingaporeÂ’s requirements into the JSF. As an SCP, Singapore can also request early purchase of the JSF for delivery from 2012 onwards.<br><br>Singapore is the only Asian country to sign an SCP Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the JSF program. The LOA follows a Letter of Intent signed in February 2003, which laid down the broad principles for the SCP arrangement.</div>
