He lost the civil war so he retreated to taiwan. He say he is part of china, but he probably meant himself (he is from china too mah) or he intend to attack back central china instead.<br><br><blockquote>But about the current TW, Li Denghui and Chen Shuibian have defiantly deviated from the policy, and thus betrayed TW and China. What is more, in order to get TW seperated from China, they are even licking the ass of America and Japan to trade for support from the two. In this sense, Li and Chen are traitors, not only to China as a nation, but also to the Jiangs. </blockquote>practically speaking, taiwan has really no links with china now... taiwan is under intense pressure since they can't go to WTO, WHO not allowed to visit and other pressure tat forbid them to integrate with the world body. All this pressure will ultimately force them to declare independence, not integration.<br><br><blockquote>So, can u understand that Mainland China's sovereignty and reputation will also inevitably take the precedence when your PM visited TW and hurt China?</blockquote>I don't know wat is central china right to have taiwan.

Sure, there r no people punching each other but then we do see cases such as corruption, massacre of students, withhelding of information, banning of movies and a lot of other unpopular policies. At least when democracy is around, people have the power. Otherwise only the Gov have power.
