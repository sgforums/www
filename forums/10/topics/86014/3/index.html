            <div class='col-md body'>Ahem do u really think that US would really want to go to war with china for whatever reason in the first place? In case u don't know, America is one of the most indebted country in the world with more than 7 trillion dollars in debt? The war in Iraq had already caused US so much money and lifes, can u imagine how much it will cost the US if it goes to war with china? China ain't no Iraq or Yugoslavia. Secondly one must not forget the fact that China has nuclear weapons capable of hitting cities in west coast of America. Thirdly China owns billions of dollars of US T-Bills thus influencing the mortgage value in the USA so much so that even US Treasury Secretary John Snow has to travel to Beijing to beg chinese leaders to re-evaluate the Yuan dollar in order to save US economy. Look at the growing influence China has on the US.  Lastly if u look at recent history, China despite having a backward and ragtag army(virtually no air force) managed to hold the US to a draw in Korean War.

Just what are u talking about? Your English is becoming more and more difficult to understand.... Where I stayed I get to watch CNN freely. One fine example: I visited Urumchi, provincial capital of Xinjiang years ago. I stayed in hotel and I remembered I watched a CNN broadcast of then Governer Patten's arrival in HongKong. the content of the broadcast was extremely anti-chinese but it was broadcast without interruption.<br><br>One simple question to u: if China is so bad and repressive like u said, why are there more and more Taiwanese emigrating to China? Taiwan is supposed to be a democracy. Why would they want to emigrate to a land where there are no freedom and human rights?
