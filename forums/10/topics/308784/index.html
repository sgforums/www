              <p>There have been attempts by netizens to compare WP leader Low Thia Kiang to Malaysian Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang, who is from the Democratic Action Party. See for example:</p>
              <p>http://wayangparty.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/malaysia-opposition-leader-lim-kit-siang-puts-low-thia-kiang-to-shame/</p>
              <p>To quote from the Wayang Party Club webpage: <em>&lt;&lt; <br></em></p>
              <p><em>According to The New Paper article below, 67 year old Malaysian
              opposition leader Mr Lim Kit Siang runs 3 blogs which are updated
              meticulously daily. Mr Lim Kit Siang also has a facebook account which
              he uses to connect with young voters. He is a vocal critic of the
              government in Parliament, making over 500 speeches in a year and in
              between serving his residents of Ipor Timur with a population of
              710,000, he still has the time and energy to galvanize the civil
              society of Malaysia by leading the recent Bersih campaign to call for
              free and fair elections.</em></p>
              <p><em>We applaud Mr Lim Kit Siang for his tireless efforts to  promote and
              further opposition cause in Malaysia. On the contrary, Mr Low Thia
              Kiang who is the leader of the Singapore’s opposition and MP of a small
              SMC of 22,000 people is seldom seen in public other than making a few
              speeches in Parliament a year and praising the PAP government in the
              media. The WP website was not updated for the past 3 months since their
              anniversary dinner in November last year ! And not surprisingly, we
              don’t expect Mr Low to have his own personal blog or facebook since we
              never seem to receive a reply when we emailed him! &gt;&gt;</em></p>
              <p>But I feel such a comparison is very unfair. This is because they have greatly
              differing roles to play in their respective societies.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim Kit
              Siang is an opposition stalwart who has challenged the ruling BN
              coalition party of Malaysia on many issues, and has a lot of
              credibility to his name. Low Thia Kiang on the other hand is meant to
              play supportive role, providing a bridge between voters who want an
              alternative voice in Singapore and the ruling party. You are comparing
              apples to oranges.</p>
              <p>The PAP government (may the PAP progress!) has
              a solid track record of outstanding governance, has created wealth and
              prosperity for our nation since our independence, and put Singapore on
              a firm footing as we venture into the 21st century. It is not afraid to
              enact unpopular policies which are for the long term good of our
              nation, and has avoided the pitfalls of pandering to the electorate in
              the short term.</p>
              <p>Given the excellent track record and performance
              of the PAP, and its high level of integrity and incorruptibility, there
              is not much scope for Opposition parties in Singapore to credibly
              challenge them. However, the PAP reluctantly acknowledges that there is
              still a role for Opposition in Singapore. Opposition parties can play
              the role of middle man, connecting voters who want an alternative voice
              or who are not yet convinced that of the soundness of PAP policies,
              with the ruling party. That is where parties such as the WP come in.</p>
              <p>By
              putting up a moderate and non-confrontational voice in Parliament, Low
              Thia Kiang and Sylvia Lim have added to the already lively and robust
              debate that goes on in those hallowed chambers. When PAP MPs rebut them
              decisively on issues they have raised, they are quick to acknowledge
              the validity of the PAP's stand. When Low Thia Kiang returns to his
              constituency, he can then bring the PAP's argument and point of view
              back to his people, and lay out the good points of PAP policies. That
              is the valuable role the WP plays in Singapore's political scene.</p>
              <p>The
              PAP hopes that eventually, it will win back the two Opposition seats
              and secure 100% of the seats in Parliament. This is because it believes
              that its policies are robust and sound, and will stand the test of
              time. In the meanwhile, the PAP acknowledges the role the WP is trying
              to play and will continually try to win back the hearts and minds of
              the voters.</p>
              <p>Majulah PAP! Majulah Singapura!</p>
