U'll make a good western journalist! Did i ever say that the singapore model is the best in the world???<br><br>Of course a single page of provocative article does not represents the view of the entire nation. But the thing is, it is available for the whole nation to read and not to forget some of the foreigners that is in that country. Some people like to take things at face value, and a wrong message would result in widespread condemnation from them.<br><br>It's the exposure dude! not the dumb journalist's opinion<br><br>My oh my!

There are also laws in democratic countries to curb graffiti crimes. SingaporeÂ’s loan sharks pour paints on house doors. ThatÂ’s also a vandalism. I would say itÂ’s not very common in the west. Singapore also has its fair share of heinous crimes. Heard of an Indian murdered and cooked in curry?

Our criminal laws are amended to serve and to protect those in power. On the other hand, punishment for criminals is too severe. A paedophile was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment.
