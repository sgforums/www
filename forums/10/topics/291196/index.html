            <div class='col-md body'>Excerpts from ST free story.<br>Nov 12, 2007<br>MM: Making Western media happy is not S'pore's business<br>By Li Xueying<br><br>THE Western media wants Singapore to 'listen to them' - to introduce more democracy and public protests, said Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew yesterday.<br><br>But does Singapore want to make them happy, or to ensure that investors remain confident in this country?<br><br>The Minister Mentor posed this question to his Tanjong Pagar constituents at a Queenstown ward event last night - he was the guest of honour at its annual tree-planting day.<br><br>Speaking in Mandarin, he revealed how each week, he received one to two letters from Westerners wishing him well, and congratulating him on Singapore's 'extraordinary' success.<br><br>But this was not a sentiment that the Western media dared to repeat, he said. For their editors will then 'come down on them'.<br><br>'They want me to listen to them, have more democracy, more protests like Taiwan - that's a democracy.<br><br>'But you calculate yourself, do you want us to make them happy or to have the investors have confidence in us? Which is good for us?<br><br>'I think, where do they (the investors) put their money? If they think Singapore is a...chaotic country, we won't have such investments.<br><br>'So I hope that everyone will appreciate the benefits you have, and understand that if you want such a life, you need a capable government and administrators, and hardworking people.'<br><br>At the event yesterday, Mr Lee also shared his sentiments on Singapore's economic prospects in the next five to 10 years.<br><br>While the country is likely to face inflation and a recession, it will continue to grow, thanks to good government.</div>

Western media don't need him to make them happy, they just report the facts and reality that the old man, son and PAP run the country.<br><br>The government who allows democracy in the country does not need to fear no foreign investments.   The presence of democracy is not the absence of foreign investments.   I think democracy is not allowed for protection of the selfish interest of the gahmen.  A power crazy gahmen will not allow democracy.<br><br>Old man is using propaganda to encourage people to have negative thoughts about the western media.   No thanks, Mr KY Lee, we are mature to know what are facts, reality and propaganda.<br><br>Just read what he said below, he excludes the people of Singapore and always as usual gives credit to his damn gahmen only.   So who is ungrateful?  He is ungrateful to exclude the people of Singapore.   Without us, there is no KY Lee running the country called Singapore.   Old man simply refuses to be grateful to the hands that feed him.   We all know PAP is producing substandard performance yet he dare have the cheek to give credit to his substandard team.  Just look at the gradual drop of winning percentage of votes for the last two elections we know they the PAP have not being performing well.<br><br><span style="color: cyan;">While the country is likely to face inflation and a recession, it will continue to grow, thanks to good government.</span></div>
