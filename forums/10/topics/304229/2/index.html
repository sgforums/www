The work you are required to do is mainly fixed can't change that. Salary is variable. Therefore <strong>if you find less Sg's NOT wanting to do a particular job raise its salary and it becomes more attractive</strong>.... if everyone wants to be say fer example accountants .... then reduce its salary to reduce demand.

Labour costs go up means wages go up too leh.... as for companies recouping their increased costs they can always raise the prices of their goods right? If its sold in Singapore only the $ stays in the country so nvm that.... but if the goods is also sold internationally? we stand to gain no?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Now what if the companies decide to move their business elsewhere due to lower labour costs over there..... we can always tax the rich abit more those income/year above "X" to reduce the tax for companies to operate here and maintain the high wages? Or some similar way to channel the $ from the super earners to the low income group.<br><br>Also I find it really dumb this paper chase.... im throwing a generalisation here... everyone wants to be a doctor accountant etc...  construction work? u siao earn what?<br><br>How about we narrow the wage gap.... so that not every banana walking down orchard road wants to be a XYZ.... and once in awhile i get to hear comments like "accountant? dowan lar brother .... i rather use hand to work meybe i be a plumber and the pay also not bad"<br><br>Dont flame ar..... flame ....I KEEEEL YOU ROFL</div>

I thought I'd share my view with you with regards to labor cost and housing.<br><br>I believe that the economic models are very useful as an approach to understanding economics. The supply and demand model is especially useful to understand how a free market works. However bear in mind the following.<br><br>HDB prices are not set by cost of the construction.<br>HDB prices are not set by the demand of the market.<br>HDB prices are not set by the supply of housing.<br>HDB prices are set by HDB.<br><br>HDB does not follow free market principles.</div>

However, my assumption is that these old people grew old at the worst possible time! When the market is packing with foreigners! And what happens? Horns locking and fender banging. lol As proven, you will lose if you bang horns with FTs. Its the fact. Well, maybe 50/50 but their side will somehow receive more support.<br><br>I believe our parents or grandparents made a very terrible mistake. They chose to live here thinking its the best place on Earth. They fail to forsee the dire future. Flame me all you want but that's the truth. Well, the past is the past.

I would like to share my point of view about your idea that our parents or grandparents making mistakes.<br><br>The early chinese populace in Singapore comprised a fair number of laborers.<br><br>They set up homes here because they could not "commute" to work.<br><br>They did not choose to come here to become Singaporeans as there was no such thing then.<br><br>Singapore gained independence.<br><br>They stayed and continue working for a livelihood.<br><br>These were manual laborers with no pretentions to politics. It is possible that  they did not fully understand they were becoming Singaporeans or what that meant.<br><br>Our identifications still show "Chinese", "Indians", "Malay".<br><br>Other Countries still scratch their heads over this distinction.<br><br>More immigrants came over in the first years after our independence but they were the onces with the choice. They were the educated ones. They were the foreign talent. </div></blockquote>You are right. But I cannot believe I am here right now. Seems like the worst possible time.</div>

Current population stands at 4.7million. 1.8 more millions to go!<br><br>When that time comes, the gahman will be happily collecting the taxes while proclaiming that the economy is doing well and Singaporeans are getting richer and more happy. We know these are packs of lies from the government but the qn is: what can you do?</div>
