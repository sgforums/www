I never told my parents to carry bag for me and they would need me to carry my own things too. Most of my friends that i know are similar to me, we do our own things, meet obstacles ourselves and try to improve. Not the perfect generation, but I feel sad for those born in mid/late 90s, some are so much pampered by parents, even have 'personal maids', what a shame not to develop their lives themselves.<br>Choosing the kids own paths; not a wise move. Let the kid choose what he needs; echos the upbringing of the parents. Not bending in to the children's requests all the time; lets him develop his natural capabilities.</div></blockquote>x2</div>
