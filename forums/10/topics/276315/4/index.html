I never told my parents to carry bag for me and they would need me to carry my own things too. Most of my friends that i know are similar to me, we do our own things, meet obstacles ourselves and try to improve. Not the perfect generation, but I feel sad for those born in mid/late 90s, some are so much pampered by parents, even have 'personal maids', what a shame not to develop their lives themselves.<br>Choosing the kids own paths; not a wise move. Let the kid choose what he needs; echos the upbringing of the parents. Not bending in to the children's requests all the time; lets him develop his natural capabilities.</div></blockquote>I absolutely agree. I was born 1984, and i noticed that children of the 80s always respected the teacher no matter how mischievous or ignorant we are. We may argue with them from time to time, but never will we immediately threaten to sue the teachers or call our parents to complain to MOE.<br><br>And kids from the 90s? Love to play their MP3 music on the train/buses. Once, I even saw 3 kids from a secondary school refusing to give up their seat on the crowded train for 2 elderly persons. I tried to reason with them and instead I was scolded "Kaypoh" and to F--- off. Only when I threaten to report them to their school (their names were sewed onto their school uniform) did they quickly change their tone and gave up their seat.<br><br>That's not to say we frm the 80s are angels and those from the 90s are devil. But parents should know when too much pampering is bad, and when to stop giving in to their kids.</div>
