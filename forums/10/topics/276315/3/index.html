Another Gazelle flight of fantasy ?<br><br>Was the $100,000 COE price due to the economic boom, or the blind rush to desparately own a car as a result of a new policy being implemented for car control ? How did you arrive at the brilliant general remark that the high COE was a reflection of economic boom across the period from the 80s to the 90s ?<br><br>If you are more realistic with your use of statistics, you could have picked up the following information and perhaps would have been more careful in relying only on one piece of data produced by the Department of Statistics.<br><br>Are you not aware that the statistics that you gave is only a general indicator of the state of the economy, and even if the economy is seen to be booming - not all sectors are performing in sync.<br><br>An extract from a 1998 Report prepared by the <strong><a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/staff_papers/MAS_Occasional_Papers_No__5__May_1998.html" rel="nofollow">Monetary Authority of Singapore</a></strong> had indicated that </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">''<strong>Between 1981-1985, GDP growth was derived entirely from growth in services, while the rest of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the economy reeled from the effects of world recession in the early- and mid-1980s</span>. While the service sector provides that extra boost to GDP growth. The manufacturing sector has been the swing factor behind the GDP growth from one year to the next.</strong>''<br><br>''<strong>The greater stability of services growth rates as a whole <span style="text-decoration: underline;">belies wide fluctuations in growth within certain subsectors</span>, however.
