No policy implemented is "perfect" or should i say some will benefit and some will be in a disadvantage. Com'on, what goes up must come down someday. If you have a better policy that can be implemented, why not voice it out then? Being in their shoes is not easy. In this world, there are bound to be contented and discontented people. Instead of just questioning the government, why not question youself and ask how you can adapt to these changes.<br><br>And i kindly request that when you wan to speak or vent your anger, refrain from using vulgarities.
