              <p>This is from someone who believe Hitler is a great leader.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="essay">
              </span></p><p>In my opinion, being a good leader firstly he
              should be able to take full advantage of favorable circumstance, able
              to rule the country under a chaotic situation. Besides he made
              attractive promises to gain popular support, skilled in using of
              propaganda, amoral. Moreover he should have the organizational ability
              and has the ambition to make his country powerful in the world. In
              addition, he could use his words to twist and manipulate the minds of
              people into believing that what he was saying. Using this power, he
              could get people to do anything for him, which prove his amorality. He
              should be skillful in carry out successful policy to bring the country
              to economic prospect, since economy is very important to a country.</p>
              <p>I think Adolf Hitler is the one. Adolf Hitler was one of the
              20th century’s most powerful dictators. He was responsible for World
              War II and the death of millions. Hitler saw a nation in despair and
              used this as an opportunity to gain political power. He saw a nation of
              unemployed and hungry citizens and promised them economic prosperity in
              return for absolute power. Someone once said “The Nazis rose to power
              on the empty stomachs of the German people”. Although he did not live a
              very long life, during his time he caused such a great deal of death
              and destruction that his actions still have an effect on the world
              nearly 50 years later. I am sure that he is a great leader.</p>
              <p>Adolf Hitler joined a small political party in 1919 and rose to
              leadership through his emotional and captivating speeches. He
              encouraged national pride, militarism, and a commitment to the Volk and
              a racially "pure" Germany. Hitler condemned the Jews, exploiting
              anti-Semitic feelings that had prevailed in Europe for centuries. He
              changed the name of the party to the National Socialist German Workers'
              Party, called for short, the Nazi Party. By the end of 1920, the Nazi
              Party had about 3,000 members. A year later Hitler became its official
              leader Führer. From this, we can see his potential of being a leader
              and his development in his propaganda.</p>
              <p>In about 1923 Adolf Hitler's attempt at an armed overthrow of
              local authorities in Munich, known as the Beer Hall Putsch, failed
              miserably. Hitler, were subsequently jailed and charged with high
              treason. However, Hitler used the courtroom at his public trial as a
              propaganda platform, ranting for hours against the Weimar government.
              Hitler was released from prison after one year. Other Nazi leaders were
              given light sentences also. While in prison, Hitler wrote volume one of
              Mein Kampf. This shows how he good at making speech to the people.
              After Hitler was released from prison, he formally resurrected the Nazi
              Party. Hitler began rebuilding and reorganizing the Party, waiting for
              an opportune time to gain political power in Germany. At that time,
              Germany was already suffering a post-war depression and was greatly
              affected. Hitler used the suffering of the masses to gain political
              support. He gained a strong following from the middle class, the
              workers and the unemployed by promising to improve the economy. As
              economic conditions worsened, the Nazis gained more support. Hitler
              staged huge rallies and parades. His speeches called for a strong and
              proud Germany. He attacked the Jews, making them the scapegoats for all
              of Germany’s economic troubles. His energy on stage and his
              motivational style of speaking made the masses believe that they were
              the master race and destined to rule the world. With the fall of
              Stresemann, the Nazi party became the largest party in the Reichstag.
              In1933, Hitler was appointed as the Chancellor. This is the evidence of
              getting people support although there were still many opponents. He
              promised stability, glory, economic security, the suppression of
              communism and employment. He satisfied the need of different classes.
              Actually he is able to take full advantage of favorable circumstances
              created by the WWI.</p>
              <p>After he became the Chancellor, he controlled the mass media
              and the textbook, all German books, plays, film and art were strictly
              censored. Also at that time, all German youth had to join the Hitler
              Youth Movement to learn Nazi ideas. On the other hand, the German
              workers were forced to join the German Labour Front instead of trade
              unions. Other religious beliefs were all banned. Moreover, Hitler
              formed the Gestapo to supervise the life of the German ordinary people.
              Complaints against the government were illegal. Under Hitler’s rule,
              Germany became a police state. From the above, we can see he could use
              his words to twist and manipulate the minds of people into believing
              that what he was saying.</p>
              <p>With Hitler such amoral people and willing to do anything, he
              would do what he could to benefit his countries, Germany. He started
              with suspended all civil liberties and used violence to crush all
              opposition. He actually started to carry out his promise of economic
              recovery by employing people in war industries as Germany prepared for
              war. He introduced pupil project schemes like housing scheme, road
              construction to absorb the unemployment. The Nazi removed the Jews,
              Communism and other enemies from their present employment to create
              vacancies for the German. Besides, he promised to rebuild the Glorious
              Germany of the past. First he started to build up the Wehrmacht.
              Germany was not allowed to have more than 100,000 men, but Hitler broke
              the treaty and gave orders to increase that number. Factories started
              putting out weapons and people now had jobs. To the Germans this was a
              very good sign. Mass rallies were held, where Hitler continued to use
              his powers of speech on the German people. Hitler succeeded in making
              his countries strong once again, at least for a while and he was
              skillful in carry out successful policy to bring the country to
              economic prospect .</p>
              <p>As he was not self interested and always considered the country
              first. He want to expand Germany in order to raise the nation status of
              Germany, he carried out the aggressive expansionist policy. Germany
              withdrew from the League of Nation and began to violate the Versailles
              Settlement by rearming the country in secret. In 1936, Italy and
              Germany jointly intervened in the Spanish Civil War. Later on, Hitler
              and Mussolini signed the Berlin-Rome Axis with Italy. In March 1938
              German troops occupied Austria, which was a German speaking state. In
              march1939, another German-populated area, the Stdetenland of
              Czechoslovakia, was occupied by Germany. In September 1939, Germany
              invaded Poland to enlarge her German territory. Again we can see
              Hitler’s organizational ability and the ambition to make his country
              powerful in the world.</p>
              <p>Adolf Hitler was a great leader; his overall success must be
              attributed to the conditions, which existed in Post War Germany, and
              Hitler's great talent as a speaker and a politician. His rise to power
              was not inevitable, it must be noted that he greatly used the
              conditions of the time in his favor. The power that he held was total
              .he was gifted in the ability to use propaganda and brainwash people,
              which in turn proves that he was unethical, and desired to make his
              countries better and stronger. As Germany can recovered so soon after
              the WW1 and joined the WWII, Hitler contributed a lot. Therefore, he
              was a great leader .</p>

              <p>I don't think he's a great leader mainly because his idea of government was to subordinate the individual's will to his.</p>
              <p>The problem with this mentality is that the country can only be as great as he was and would have all the weakness he had. No one man can ever fulfill all the needs of a country and that is the greatest weakness of all dictatorships.</p>
              <p>In my view, a great leader would have to inculcate in his citizens the virtues necessary to keep them great after his own death and Hitler didn't manage that. Historically speaking, most of the great leaders managed it by creating some form of social system with portions of the populace in servitude to others whether though class, caste or feudial systems. I'm still waiting for the leader that will buck this trend.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Hitler was a great leader in the sense that he united the German ppl and rebuilt a war ravage Germany after WWI and the great depression.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But he was a bad leader when he tried to return Germany to its former glory by the way of guns &amp; bullets.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY's legacy would very much be known only after his passing...... Like Hitler, he did bring little known S'pore to where it is now...... But like Hitler, he did it in ways that most of us find un-tasteful......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hitler's control and legacy last no more than 20years...... from the beginning.... to the end. S'pore has lasted more than 40years..... This at least prove that LKY has done more rights than wrongs.....</p>

              <p>To call him a coward is equivilent to the man who has already won a chess game, but refuses to acknowledge his opponent's defeat, just so he can draw out the torment.</p>

              <p>Germany sustained high military casualty in World War 2, perhaps a good leader like Hitler designed it this way. Germany's high military casualty is only surpassed by Russia, which was ill equipped and the soldiers were more like suicide squads with little or no armaments (if you watched "Enemy at the Gates" you will get the picture).</p>

              <p>Popikachu I'd think the opposite that even if US didn't attack Germany on the European continent the Red Army would obliterate Germany's Third reich in due time.</p>
              <p>You know the US only invade the Nazi Germany on European continent to race against the Red Army onslaught to Berlin. That's why they only invaded in 1944....when it was obvious that the Russian was going to defeat the Germans back all the way to Berlin. So I regard the US invasion of Europe was to stop the Red Army from taking over the whole European continent under its communism banner. Which resulted in a stand off during the cold war and the rest was history.</p>
              <p>You know 1944 is 5 years from 1939 when WWII started.</p>
