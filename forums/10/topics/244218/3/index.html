            <div class='col-md body'>At the height of the last recession, we were constantly reminded of the virtues of a "flexible" wage system and how we should have KPIs and move away from a seniority-based system.<br><br>In the last GE, I vaguely remembered an opposition member's suggestion of pegging our minister's pay to 10X the average salary of the lowest 10% of our working class...or something along that line.<br><br>I personally don't think that is a bad idea... but with some refinement.<br><br>1stly, KPIs. As a government, much as the aim is to increase our GDP, it must now also aim to close the gap between the rich and the poor. Just as all organisations use their reward systems to help achieve their organisational goals. these changes as organisational goals changes. Likewise, the remuneration system for the top echelons of our civil service must change to meet this new need.<br><br>2ndly, flexible wage system. How do we fit these KPIs to a fixed and variable component of a flexible wage system? Well, to attract and retain the able to the top echelons, the fixed component needs to be fair, but certainly not exorbitant to the extent of being indecent! Perhaps, the current salary that these people draw can be "defaulted" as the fixed component. Any intended increases should go to the variable component, but tied to the KPI of closing the gap between the rich and the poor. This way, the population can see the "soul" of the people at the top working for them, and will be less resistant to any increase to their remuneration.<br><br>Above is a rather simplistic suggestion, but I think it captures the essence of what the government has been telling its people. When we see them doing what they tell us to do, the support comes naturally.<br><br>I remember in one parliament seating, when an opposition member asked the manpower minister what the governments' long term target was in terms of the unemployment figure, the opposition member was flabbergasted at the go-around he was given and turned to the speaker of the house and said...he did not answer my question! The people are told to have KPIs and have their pay pegged to it. But when we ask for the unemployment KPI, we are not given an answer.<br><br>So, perhaps, this is a good time to show that they can walk their talk.<br><br>Just my thoughts.<br></div>

The average Singaporean only can own one house, and it does him no benefit having his value raised, coz end of the day, he only has one house!<br><br>That's so different from the past, when HDB was for everyone, and CPF was for everyone.<br><br>So I ask again, what achievements does he have?

            <div class='col-md body'>as one of my friends rightly put it.<br><br>We, from the private sector, are working with all the risks and pain bringing in the money for Singapore. We face possible retrenchment or cut of wages based on the risks the private sector faces in their competition.<br><br>THEY, the govt, are the people who aren't facing all these risks, and insisting they should be paid better than us. They don't face retrenchment, and all the risks we are facing.<br><br>Where is JUSTICE?<br><br>I told my friends. Whatever career I take, there is always the danger of getting retrenchment. The safest job is the PM or minister's job. Pay high, 0% chance of getting fired. The best jobs in the world</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree that most ministers do not deserve a pay rise, they already earn ten times what average Singaporeans earn, how much more do they need?!?<br><br>HOWEVER, if this pay rise is for civil servants THAT ACTUALLY serve, in particular teachers, then I think they deserve it. Now, I'm not a teacher but I am a student who will be taking a national exam soon.<br><br>EVERYDAY, i see my teachers who are really dedicated to what they are doing, but their salary is really meagre compared to those in the private sector. My teachers come to school at 6 to start teaching (those who need it) and end at 6.30. i mean, most of them are earning btw $2500-$5000, but for the amount of work they are doing, their salary definitely is LESS than what they should get. As a teacher, don't forget that you bring home work to do. Worksheets,essays to mark, exam papers and tests to set and the list goes on. They work longer than the private sector (9-5) but this is what they get? I really pity some of my teachers. Most of them would even voluntarily come down on Saturdays to give us tuition....<br><br>So, in conclusion, though i think the ministers do not deserve the pay rise, I think people like our teachers who work long hours, some passionately, do deserve a pay rise.

            <div class='col-md body'>we may as well hand them a blank cheque book! if LHL thinks he is worth more than he is current salary wonder how much Ho Ching is getting paid. So she screws up on Shin Corp, does this mean she takes a pay cut? any evidence she did? we did well for voting the pap back! For a few peanuts we are distributed annually they take a bigger chunk back in return! we call this democracy!</div>
