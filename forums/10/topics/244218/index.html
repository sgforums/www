            <div class='col-md body'>You mean this article?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Top govt salaries far behind private sector's<br><br>PM discloses the wide gap and urgent need to retain talent in public sector </strong><br><br>TOP private-sector salaries have surged ahead of those in the public sector and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed last night just how far the pay of ministers and civil service leaders has fallen behind.<br>A minister should be drawing $2.2 million a year or more, according to benchmarks approved by Parliament in 1994 to ensure competitive salaries for a competent and honest government.<br><br>But their actual salaries have fallen to 55 per cent of the benchmark, that is $1.2 million, and 'we have to close this gap', Mr Lee said last night.<br><br>He did not say if ministers' pay will be raised fully to this amount, or when it will go up. Details of the salary changes across the civil service will be announced in Parliament on April 9 by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean, who oversees the public service.<br><br>Speaking at the annual Administrative Service dinner, Mr Lee explained that salaries had to be reviewed so the public sector can keep its share of talented Singaporeans.<br><br>'This is an urgent problem. We have experienced on previous occasions the painful consequences of responding too slowly when the private sector surged ahead,' he said.<br><br>In the 1990s, this led to the Administrative Service, the key service from which most public sector leaders are drawn, losing entire cohorts of young and good officers.<br><br>Administrative Officers (AOs) in their early 30s are at a 'critical decision point' in their careers, and the Government must keep their salaries market competitive to retain the able ones.<br><br>Today, their salaries are in line with the private-sector benchmark created for this group. But with salaries for young professionals moving up, especially in the financial sector, Mr Lee expects salaries in this group to 'soon come under pressure'.<br><br>Fast-growing salaries explain why the Government has embarked on a review of civil service salaries covering all services where pay has fallen behind the private sector.<br><br>Also important is to review the salaries of ministers, judges and statutory appointment holders such as the Attorney-General and Auditor-General, said Mr Lee.<br><br>'It is even more critical for us to keep these salaries competitive, so as to be able to bring in a continuing flow of able and successful people to be ministers and judges.<br><br>'Unless there is a first-class political leadership and judiciary, the Civil Service, however capable and dedicated, will not be able to function properly,' he said.<br><br>Ministerial and top public sector salaries have been pegged to those of top private-sector earners since 1994, when Parliament debated and approved the use of benchmarks to ensure the public sector continued to attract its share of talent, and to provide for regular adjustments to keep pace with private-sector earnings.<br><br>There are two benchmarks or formulae spelling out how the salaries are to be pegged.<br><br>The first is the MR4 benchmark for ministers and senior permanent secretaries.<br><br>Yesterday, the Public Service Division released data on the median incomes of the top eight earners in the six professions to which MR4 salaries are pegged. Lawyers earned the most, with a median income among the top eight of $4.29 million.<br><br>The second benchmark is the SR9 benchmark for top AOs in their early 30s.<br><br>Mr Lee mapped out how in the years since 1994, the 'scramble for talent' has become a global phenomenon.<br><br>Talented Singaporeans are now being head-hunted by top global companies as well as by other governments keen to replicate the Singapore success story.<br><br>Top students are turning down government scholarships as their families or universities were willing to fund their education.<br><br>At the same time, the demands on high-quality governance have gone up, as a result of globalisation and a more advanced economy, he said.<br><br>With Singapore now operating near the 'leading edge' in public policy, public-sector leaders cannot rely on the best practices of other countries, but have to break new ground and find fresh solutions.<br><br>First-class people are therefore needed to anticipate problems, come up with creative solutions and lead teams.<br><br>He said 'first-class governance' which can be provided only by a top-grade public sector was a 'sustainable advantage' that Singapore should 'zealously uphold'.<br><br>While public officers must serve from a sense of idealism and duty and not be motivated mainly by financial reward, they should not be expected to make 'unreasonable financial sacrifices' to be in public service, he added. </blockquote>I'm not exactly sure where PM Lee is coming from, making wild claims of a drop by 55% benchmark with regards to the 1994 parliament ruling that ministers should be drawing a wage parity equivalent to top earners in the private sector.<br><br>There was no indication which industry he was refering to which is now earning 2.2 million annually, but i can safely assume the reference is to the finance/banking sector.<br><br>That being said, if these professionals lose their value add and their wages nosedive, does the same apply to our ministers, given the pegged rate?<br><br>Boosting one's salary by a convenient peg whilst ignoring other factors that justify its monetary aspect is surely not good for our government? It is very easy to say: look the private sector rates have gone up, let's up ours to match. But how is it justified with P &amp; L? And in what equivalent context is it applied in the govt sector?<br><br>More psychological conditioning directed at Singaporeans so when the time comes, we do not begrudge their VERY HIGH salary?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just something i found rather amusing which was mentioned by PM Lee:<br><br><blockquote>'Unless there is a first-class political leadership and judiciary, the Civil Service, however capable and dedicated, will not be able to function properly,' he said. </blockquote>Is our political leadership first class? Is our Civil service first class?<br><br>What is wrong with the current wages paid to top ministers? Is it not exhorbitant enough?

            <div class='col-md body'>From Animal Farm<br><br>"Comrades!" he cried. "You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers.<br><br>The whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.<br><br>Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? Jones would come back! Yes, Jones would come back! Surely, comrades," cried Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his tail, "surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?"</div>
