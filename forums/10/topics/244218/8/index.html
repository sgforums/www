            <div class='col-md body'>I am only asking general questions to see if there will be integrity, accountability and transparency by those who are in position of trust or privilege in avoiding paying themselves their own salaries and bonuses after appointment as after-thought. Our practice whereby ministers can give themselves any salaries they like is the same as issuing our ministers who are in a public position of trust of privilege a blank cheque to be filled as they like.<br><br>One would have thought that to avoid conflicts or shenanigan, as disclosed in Enron and Worldcom such matter like ministers' and civil servants's salaries especially bonuses should be pre-determined with support of the people prior to or during the election as one total package.<br><br>If this is not so, then any one could simply use one's power to pay himself any amount he likes as after-thought. It is the normal professional HR practice to determine salaries of CEOs only during the interviews not not give the CEOs the after-thought to compare and increase salaries thereafter.</div>

These figures are a dip from the average of 3.8 per cent predicted by it in its 2006 report.<br><br>On the whole, this year's salary increase predictions Â— taken after adjusting for inflation Â— are modest compared to the rest of South-east Asia. Of the other five countries in the region, Indonesia is likely to see the highest increase of 4.7 per cent, followed by Vietnam (4.5 per cent), Singapore, Malaysia (2.7 to 3 per cent), the Philippines (1.5 to 2.5 per cent) and Thailand (1.9 to 2 per cent).<br><br>When benchmarked against the rest of Asia, the expected pay increase for Singapore's professionals, for instance, lags far behind that of China (7.8 per cent), India (5.9 per cent) and South Korea (4 per cent).<br><br>Shedding some light on this, Hay Group's reward information services managing director (Asia) Roland Ruiz said Singapore's current salary levels are already among the highest in the region, which explains the smaller percentage growth.<br><br>Even so, the findings buck the trend set by recent surveys that said workers in Singapore could look forward to better bonuses and bigger pay hikes, in light of a healthy economy and record job creation last year.<br><br>Employers here, said Mr Ruiz, are "cautious" about raising salaries because regional economies remain a source of risk, with "economic and political instability, potential interruption in regional production chains and financial weakness".<br><br>"Singapore employers (have) not taken an immediate response on salaries to align with a clearly more buoyant economy in 2006, partly because they take a longer term view when it comes to increasing their fixed costs to the business," he told Today.<br><br>On pay matters, private sector employers also usually take their cue from the civil service. The National Wages Council, meanwhile, is due to deliberate on wage guidelines for 2007/2008 later this month.<br><br>Still, he said, things were looking up thanks to the tightening labour market. "There are many jobs chasing after a smaller pool of people, so there is now a much clearer case for employers to act on salary growth," he said.<br><br>Job sectors likely to face pressure to increase salaries are those that saw significant growth last year, such as marine and offshore engineering, biomedical manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade and financial services. "There will be continuing pressure to increase wages for critical positions in these industries since continuing growth is expected from them," said Mr Ruiz.<br><br>The Government's latest figures spell growing employment prospects. Last year more than 176,000 jobs were created Â— the highest since data was first compiled in the late 1970s. More than 450,000 jobs are expected to be created in the next five years, with the latest unemployment rate standing at an all-time low of just 2.7 per cent. - TODAY/sh</div>

Our external trade is 3 1/2 times that of our GDP, higher than Hong Kong. And if this economy ever falters, that's the end of Singapore and its First World status. Denmark, Switzerland and Finland are part of Europe. You can fail and you're still caught in the European situation. If you fail here, you go back to a Southeast Asian situation. Just look around you," said MM Lee.<br><br>"So is the Minister Mentor saying that without paying such a high salary, we are bound to fail? And even if we pay top earners' salary, can the present government bring Singapore up to superpower (status), as what he has mentioned for those in Denmark?" challenged Mr Low, MP for Hougang.<br><br>"I am putting a simple question and asking for his clarification. He has compared Singapore as if it were Denmark, Finland or Switzerland. Their systems and governments never produced the kind of transformation that we have, and their system and government have a broader base and can afford a mediocre government," said the Minister Mentor. - CNA /ls<br><br></div>
