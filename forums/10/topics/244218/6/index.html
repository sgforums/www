So too is the worth of our leaders if they have the collective wisdom to help us weather relentless global competition and regional neighbourly crankiness.<br><br>The fact is, Singapore has no right to be a First World city, yet we almost are. The fact is, not being exposed to the political shenanigans of First World countries, their system of pork-barrel politics and opaque financial rewards for politicians, we are not in a position to claim that we are paying a premium for our political leadership.<br><br>I, for one, would far prefer a transparent and finite quantum of remuneration for our leaders rather than indulge in the hypocrisy of leaders serving selflessly for small salaries while habitually reaching into the country's till to enrich themselves.<br><br>Till the day comes that our politicians are found to have acted without financial probity and can no longer speak with moral authority, I believe the present pay system is equitable.<br><br>I have experienced the palmy days of the 1980s and early 90s when Singapore was uniquely successful due to a confluence of congenial factors, not the least being a government quick to exploit opportunities.<br><br>Come the late 90s and the early part of the new century when we almost sank due to the Asian financial crisis, Sars, haze and bird flu, and seeing that competing Third World countries were imitating our formula for success to death, that China had become the chief focus for investments and that our geographical region had lost its allure for both the tourist and manufacturing dollar, I thought that the halcyon days of Singapore were history. But lo and behold, have we not risen like a phoenix from the ashes? Isn't Singapore now more financially prosperous, more aesthetically pleasing, more a haven for the arts, more tolerant of view divergence?<br><br>No society can be totally egalitarian. It is all that the Government can do to create opportunities for those with panache to risk it all and get rich, to create jobs for those who are risk averse and want nothing more than a steady if unexciting salary, to provide the needy with charitable relief and to keep the destitutes to a minimum level.<br><br>On all counts, the present Government, as the previous ones that fortunate Singaporeans have had, has succeeded and has lots to show for it.<br><br>Dr Yik Keng Yeong </span><br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:263b490d298b1110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">Source: ST Forum</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For all Dr Yik's grandiose claims and superfluous writings, he failed to addressed crucial points that Ng mentioned. His response is therefore once again, like many others who defend the pay hike as justifiable, skirting the issues and addressing things at a tangent. I will try to break it down in detail:<br><br>#1: Ng asked why we should pay a premium for first world quality when others (possibly more established first world cities) do not?<br><br>Dr Yik responded, and quite superficially too, that <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">we are not in a position to claim that we are paying a premium for our political leadership</span></strong></span>. Yet he made no attempt to go into detail exactly why we have no such 'right'.<br><br>By comparing the obvious gap of ministerial wages between equally developed countries such as NZ, Denmark and Australia against those of Singapore, it does lend considerable weight to Ng's argument - that we are being forced to pay (through taxpayer's monies) a 'premium' price for supposedly 'brilliant' leadership, when in comparison, these countries and cities have equal if not better amenities and leadership.<br><br>#2: Ng mentioned that <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">the pact of mutual benefit which has been used more often than it should, is fast losing faith among Singaporeans who find their salaries relatively unchanged in a decade when ministers, in good times or bad, continue to earn millions. </span></span><br><br>Instead of addressing whether the ministers truly deserved their millions, he skirted the issue and instead provided yet another superficial statement of <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">'Till the day comes that our politicians are found to have acted without financial probity and can no longer speak with moral authority, I believe the present pay system is equitable. '</span></span><br><br>In essence, he openly supports the millions that ministers earn, on account of their 'transparency' and 'moral values'. But how transparent has our govt been when it comes to ministerial salaries?<br><br>How much is too much?<br><br>PM Lee has been quoted many times as saying that ministerial wages is first and foremost - a non-discussion topic. The next thing that irks many singaporeans is that our govt conveniently pegs the salary to the median of the top 8 private sector professionals.<br><br>It is clear that these top 8 are more than likely to change each year, but the earnings are unlikely to fall. Hence, Ng's argument: that <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">'in good time or bad</span></span>' ministers will continue to rake in millions, despite the relatively stagnant pay of the average singaporeans, is surely a valid and important claim against the pay hike.<br><br>In short, they write their own paychecks, as and when they like. (or when they preceive themselves to have done a good job...)<br><br>It should also be noted that, had this furore not erupted, our govt is unlikely to have produced more information concerning the upcoming pay hike and pay structure of senior civil servants, including the fact the those directly affected are individuals in the  SR9 and above catagory. It should also be noted that they have still not revealed anything of significance in terms of the formula concering how ministers are paid, further reinforcing PM Lee's claim that such items are 'non-discussion'.<br><br>#3: Lastly, Ng mentioned that in comparison to the previous generation of leaders, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: red;">What has our present generation of politicians to show? </span></strong></span><br><br>To this, Dr Yik provides perhaps the meekest answer: <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>On all counts, the present Government, as the previous ones that fortunate Singaporeans have had, has succeeded and has lots to show for it.</strong></span> </span><br><br>Ironically, he offers <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely nothing </span></span></strong></span>to back up his outrageous claim. Instead, he prefers to sprout rhetoric which implies the same govt line: that singaporeans are a bunch of ungrateful ingrates who only know how to complain.<br><br>For a doctor who probably ranks among the top earners locally, such an unconvincing response is surely by all accounts, substandard?<br></div>
