            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body">Defence Minister Teo's comment implies 2 very worrying mindsets:<br><br>#1: that if we pay our ministers any less, they will simply become corrupt and the system collapses. Is there any logic in his reasoning?<br><br>If a minister was paid, say a 6-figure sum annually, in comparison to equivalent ministers in developed countries like New Zealand, Norway and Denmark, it will already cover his cost of living and that of his family considerably, in addition to the almost unlimited perks stemming from lifetime pension, free membership to various associations and clubs, medical expenses...these are all taken care off which are totally transparent to the average Singaporeans; to say nothing of a 1.2 million salary they are already receiving, which will surely rank within the upper echelons of the private sector.<br><br>#2: that a 'reasonably good pay' is needed to attract talent.<br><br>While this is a fair statement on its own, it becomes rather absurb when it is linked to a proposed wage package of 2.2 million per minister, not including govt-releated perks of the highest order.<br><br>They are already being paid 1.2 million. Is that not enough to attract elite talent? If it isn't, then what is?<br><br>How much is too much?<br><br>Such a mindset adopted by the ministers will only influence our locals to shortsightedly link pay directly to workscope, each time asking for more. It's like Oliver (the orphan child) returning for more food, only this time he brings a bigger bowl. This type of approach is surely worrying in the long run, with Singaporeans swapping their passion for extravagent pay.<br><br>This implies that those who have the best talent and the right passion are not doing what they do best. By this, we can assume that the next crop of ministers won't join the civil service because they are driven by a desire to serve their country.<br><br>Such a notion has already been forsaken...for money. </div></blockquote>Well after the fact, they ARE SAYING that they are all very prone to become corrupted if they don't constantly receive a big fat pay raise ever so regularly.<br><br>This just simply mean our gov are made up of those sort of people, and that the pledges they made and swore into in serving the public, holds no water.<br><br>Isn't this it? It sure does sound that way...<br><br>Sad.. we are being led by corruptible leaders...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

NZÂ’s ministersÂ’ salaries = S$240,000 to S$180,000/year.<br><br>SÂ’poreÂ’s ministers pay =  S$1,200,000/year (but they say they are worth up to S$2,200,000/year).<br><br>According to <a href="http://www.finfacts.com/corruption.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.finfacts.com/corruption.htm</a>, NZ is ranked one of the 3 least corrupt countries in the world, and SÂ’pore is ranked 5th (i.e. NZ is perceived to be less corrupt than SÂ’pore).<br><br>SÂ’poreÂ’s PM Lee and other ministers have used the argument that they need to be paid closer to S$2,200,000 per year so as to keep corruption at bay.<br><br>With NZÂ’s ministers earning 7-10 times less than SÂ’poreÂ’s ministers, and being able to keep NZ the least corrupt country in the world, I wonder how come NZÂ’s ministers can keep such a clean govt for so much less money? Conversely, why do our SÂ’poreÂ’s ministers need so much more pay to stem corruption, when a clean govt like NZ could be had for much lower salaries?<br><br>In the interest of getting foreign talent for SÂ’pore, I propose we hire the entire NZ cabinet to replace the SÂ’pore one. All things considered, we can pay the NZ cabinet Â‘peanutsÂ’, and theyÂ’ll still ensure that SÂ’pore remains wealthy and corruption-free.<br>[/url]</div>

This does NOT include bonuses<br><br>We are NOT LOOKING at the bonuses. Read somewhere that their bonus is 6 months' MINIMUM, regardless of performance.<br><br>THEREFORE, raising their pay to 2.2m is NOT JUST a 1m difference.

            <div class='col-md body'>Riches are never affected by GST because they have pay rise and more than enough to cover up whatever cost increased. The poor is different the pay rise is not even enough to cover the cost of living. They will also cut pay first if something happen and even get fired. They can get foreign worker to replaced you and even cheaper.<br><br>When compared GST with other countries, they will said other is higher than Singapore. But when talk about their own salaries, they never said their is the highest. I don't think they even worth that much. Durai saga is coming back.<br><br>And keep on saying high pay prevent corruption, even  million dollar salary per year is not enough for these ministers, so greedy. Such a pay is enough to let them pay for few cars, few houses and many other things without credit, installment PER YEAR. And have more than million to save for their retirement. That why our CPF is never enough. A lot of the poor is suffering while they enjoy life.<br><br>Since they always say other offer higher pay for them in private sector, why don't they just give up their post??? The answer is easy, private sector job are unstable, you may be replace, pay cut, fire due to poor performance. Etc when MP George Yeo almost lose the GRC to opposition, he scared like hell. Because such a stable job with high pay will be gone and he will work like hell in private sector and can't get high pay like it used to be. If someone question how can it be a stable job, think about MP Khaw who failed to keep check on Durai who run NKF. His poor performance did not result for him being fired. Instead, he just apologise and resolve this issue. He can just say outside offer him higher pay and give up the post.<br><br>When helping other countries, they give money so easy, but to our own poor Singaporeans, so many barriers and restriction, and take so long to process</div>

Why must we pay a premium for what everybody else has?<br><br>All the things that are collectively provided by Singaporeans are collectively worth the whole of Singapore and the prize goes ultimately to all Singaporeans, not to one or two politicians.<br><br>The quality of our government would be nothing without the quality of its people, and the strength of the Singapore brand ultimately rests with Singaporeans.<br><br>Paying my politician top dollar may not dent my pocket, but it angers many ordinary Singaporeans who have to pay more for everything without having the freedom to write their own paycheck.<br><br>What the politicians have to show of late doesn't demonstrate the talent they claim to have, and certainly not the justification for their millions.<br><br>The pact of mutual benefit, which has been used more often than it should, is fast losing faith among Singaporeans who find their salaries relatively unchanged in a decade when ministers, in good times or bad, continue to earn millions. </span><br><br><strong>Ng Kok Lim</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:9cbf1c2839da1110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">Source: ST Forum</a><br><br>A no-frills straight to the point article that i would like to see our govt answer.

            <div class='col-md body'>The system has become a total autocracy now.<br><br>Even as it has been proven that government has been over-taxing on public housing and essential services and there is enough surpluses and tax monies to lower costs of living, government will not do so and even if there is no justification to increase GST, it will still go ahead and increase GST.<br><br>Now essentially government is behaving like it is too powerful with all the GRCs and legalistic wrangling of laws and regulation which it regards as world's best leadership, it could get away with any wrongful acts and policies like paying the ministers any salary increments or benefits without justifications being accepted by the people which only benefit themselves and not the people.<br><br>Government has basically taken people completely for granted.<br><br>It is a "No Contest" situation where the leaders have proven to be too powerful with abuses like: "I will call you a liar and if you do not sue me you are a liar." or "I will do lift upgrading first only for my loyal supporters and what can you do to me" "With GRC there is no way you could vote me out and that is why I am rewarding myself with higher salaries and doing all these and so what can you do"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another more docile response to the exhorbitant increase in an already exhorbitant ministerial salary:<br><br>April 3, 2007<br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>The flip side of high Civil Service pay</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">WHILE it is important to have good and honest top civil servants and ministers, there may be a flip side to the continued large increments in their salaries that seem to be necessary to retain them.<br>Firstly, there may be a secret pool of potential entrepreneurs among our top civil servants and ministers. By paying them so highly, we may be inhibiting them from striking out to start their own businesses.<br><br>Secondly, by making the pay so attractive, we will inadvertently encourage our top scholars and other young talent to make the Civil Service their career choice. Surely, we do not want to propagate a system similar to that in ancient China when top scholars vied with each other in the imperial exams in order to join the civil service. This may be the reason why China continues to trail the West in technological innovation. What we need instead is to cultivate a culture of enterprise among our best brains so that they can create high-tech businesses that in turn will provide jobs, by making the Civil Service less attractive than private enterprise, as in the West.<br><br>Finally, by saying that we need to pay top dollar for top talent, we are saying that certain people are indispensable. This may breed complacency. In truth, nobody is indispensable and if more people knew that their services were dispensable, more of them would be on their toes.<br><br>Top civil servants should also be rotated between ministries every five years or so in order to bring in a fresh perspective. If they are not satisfied with their pay or their jobs and wish to leave, let them go. We can always bring in cheaper and perhaps better foreign talent. After all, some of our first-generation ministers were not originally from Singapore and yet they served us well.<br><br>It is true that one of the reasons why Singapore's Civil Service is free of corruption is the high pay enjoyed by top civil servants and ministers. However, a balance must be struck between paying enough and paying too much.<br><br>Top civil servants must also be made to realise that the attraction of work in the Civil Service does not lie in remuneration. Rather, the attraction should lie in the opportunity to contribute to the well-being of the country and its people, to 'make a difference'.<br><br>Dr Anne Chong Su Yan </span><br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:f445195c9b2b1110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">Source</a></div>
