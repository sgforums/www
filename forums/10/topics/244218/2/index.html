            <div class='col-md body'>I think our PM is nuts to announce the intention for a pay rise at this time, or any other time for that matters... Why?<br><br>1. This is not the best time to do it. At least not when the GST hike is still fresh in people's mind. A better time to do it will be when the general mood of the country is better. Honestly I think the PM is really asking for it. What are his advisors doing?<br><br>2. Backlash from the public. Somehow his announcement cheapened the image of the civil service. So now they are all money minded individual huh.. Perhaps the country will be better off after those 'top civil servants' left. Did he mention why they resign? If it is money then good riddance. I am not saying we should not let our ministers enjoy high salary for the same reasons stated by LKY back then...ie a clean and honest govt. But how much is enough? Earning more than $1million per yr in Singapore virtually guarantees u a damn good life. Try telling those people who live on  $1 a day, or even $10 a day, that you deserve more peanuts.<br>Those top ministers, imho, have been in their ivory towers far too long...so long that they cannot even gauge the public's reaction to this. Dun think S'poreans are going to stomach this news well.<br><br>And lastly, well a pay rise should still happen, but not for those top ministers. A pay rise, and mind you a huge one at that, should be given to those in the civil service who are slogging so hard everyday to make the country a better place. Teachers for instance. And let's not forget others like nurses and social workers who work tirelessly everyday to help those who are in need (and those are the ones the MIW in the ivory tower will never see).<br><br>Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading.</div>

If the US president had been paid more, you probably would have a more competent president leading the USA as compared to a numbskull who invaded Iraq because of Oil. And guess what?

The USD has been falling against many currencies. its the weakness of the dollar rather than the strength of the SGD. So if SGD fall in future can blame him?

The lower level are easily replaceable... When there are higher profits, its due to the brilliance of the management... Time to raise pay or the "Top Talent" get headhunted.</div>

They made alot of major investment blunders like Global Crossing, Shin Corp, Suzhou Industrial Park, etc. Why are they still around?<br><br>Singapore dollar hitting a new high against the US dollar is no big deal. It comes from our current account surplus. If you have a current account surplus (Singapore) match against a current account deficit (USA), the USD will depreciate against the SGD, so as to make USA products more competitive and reverse the current account imbalance.<br><br>Where do you think our current account surplus and reserves come from? GST, CPF, high priced transport, high priced HDB apartments, high priced electricity &amp; water, etc. The difference between what a country imports and exports is the current account balance. If they tax (GST) more from us, the less we will be able to consume, as Singapore is 99% reliant on imports, the less we consume, the higher will be Singapore's reserves (not your reserves, but the government's). Maybe they should implement 50% GST, I am sure our currency will hit an all time high with the USD.</div>
