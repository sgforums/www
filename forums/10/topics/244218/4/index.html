So we decided, 'why not we do something to cover up the gap?'"<br><br>So the group of third-year students spent several afternoons researching at MRT stations before coming up with a prototype.<br><br>The one-metre prototype costs about $1,200 to build and it is designed to be attached to the bottom of train cabins.<br><br>It is timed to work in tandem with the opening and closing of train doors.<br><br>Chua Thiam Koon said: "It will raise automatically once the door (of the MRT) opens and it will retract once the door is fully locked. We use about four months to build everything, plus research and stuff."<br><br>For their effort, the Land Transport Authority gave them the best project award of Temasek Polytechnic in 2006.<br><br>It is part of the annual LTA-polytechnic collaboration which recognises the top five student projects in all polytechnics.<br><br>It will take a while before the project is implemented in reality.<br><br>LTA says it will have to consider several factors, such as durability and costs.<br><br>More tests will also be conducted on the prototype before it is adopted.<br><br>For now, the gaps will remain, to minimise contact between the moving trains and the passengers standing on platforms. - CNA/ir<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by simnatic:</div><div class="quote_body">HOWEVER, if this pay rise is for civil servants THAT ACTUALLY serve, in particular teachers, then I think they deserve it. Now, I'm not a teacher but I am a student who will be taking a national exam soon.<br><br>EVERYDAY, i see my teachers who are really dedicated to what they are doing, but their salary is really meagre compared to those in the private sector. My teachers come to school at 6 to start teaching (those who need it) and end at 6.30. i mean, most of them are earning btw $2500-$5000, but for the amount of work they are doing, their salary definitely is LESS than what they should get. As a teacher, don't forget that you bring home work to do. Worksheets,essays to mark, exam papers and tests to set and the list goes on. They work longer than the private sector (9-5) but this is what they get? I really pity some of my teachers. Most of them would even voluntarily come down on Saturdays to give us tuition....<br><br>So, in conclusion, though i think the ministers do not deserve the pay rise, I think people like our teachers who work long hours, some passionately, do deserve a pay rise. Just my 2cents worth... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Hope I'm not being overly presumptious when I say that it is students like you that make teachers want to go to work everyday! Not many students today will make and appreciate the kind of observations you have made. I volunteer at my daughter's school and I share your observations. Your teacher has done well..<br><br>Just as the culture of an organization depends on the guy on top, so too the relationship between a government and its people.<br><br>One wonders how many of these top echelon people are still single? How many are holding multiple portfolios that they donÂ’t even have time for any social live? How many are parents who donÂ’t even know what are their kids favourite pastimes? Or are they so stretched that they donÂ’t even know when their kids are writing about poor souls and asking them to get out of their elitist face.<br><br>Is this what the Â“HappinessÂ” or Â“Quality of LifeÂ” index is flagging out? Could this be one of the reasons why people at the top are leaving? How many more Directors/DD/M/AM/SOs can be hired to share the load, with the intended salary increases? Even if the existing pay can only attract the 2nd best, a team of 2nd best can certainly out produce a lone maverick! Indeed, team dynamics may even ensure that the lone political-maverick-of-a-boss does not get away with a good-on-paper, tough-but-necessary policy but which is out-of-touch and impractical to implement!<br><br>If these top guns are recipients of such enlightened approaches to their own dilemmas, instead of continuously being thrown with more money and then told Â“you are paid enough, so solve the damn problem!Â”, or Â“We will rotate you and provide you with more challenging tasksÂ”, they in turn are more likely to do the same for their own departments. Who knows, the outcome may be better-thought-out-but-still-tough-and-necessary policies which are accepted with less outcry from a more forgiving population. More forgiving because when the private sector takes the cue from it, the whole nation is less stressed and may even find some of its other problems (like lower fertility, juvenile delinquency, etc) resolving itself! Too simplistic?<br><br>If the government really does so, pushing the envelop with this World Class approach, instead of the traditional Â“throw-money-to-solve-the-problemÂ” approach, showing the rest of the world how small countries can better solve issues using non-traditional methods, they will have my vote on this issue.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Defence Minister Teo's comment implies 2 very worrying mindsets:<br><br>#1: that if we pay our ministers any less, they will simply become corrupt and the system collapses. Is there any logic in his reasoning?<br><br>If a minister was paid, say a 6-figure sum annually, in comparison to equivalent ministers in developed countries like New Zealand, Norway and Denmark, it will already cover his cost of living and that of his family considerably, in addition to the almost unlimited perks stemming from lifetime pension, free membership to various associations and clubs, medical expenses...these are all taken care off which are totally transparent to the average Singaporeans; to say nothing of a 1.2 million salary they are already receiving, which will surely rank within the upper echelons of the private sector.<br><br>#2: that a 'reasonably good pay' is needed to attract talent.<br><br>While this is a fair statement on its own, it becomes rather absurb when it is linked to a proposed wage package of 2.2 million per minister, not including govt-releated perks of the highest order.<br><br>They are already being paid 1.2 million. Is that not enough to attract elite talent? If it isn't, then what is?<br><br>How much is too much?<br><br>Such a mindset adopted by the ministers will only influence our locals to shortsightedly link pay directly to workscope, each time asking for more. It's like Oliver (the orphan child) returning for more food, only this time he brings a bigger bowl. This type of approach is surely worrying in the long run, with Singaporeans swapping their passion for extravagent pay.<br><br>This implies that those who have the best talent and the right passion are not doing what they do best. By this, we can assume that the next crop of ministers won't join the civil service because they are driven by a desire to serve their country.<br><br>Such a notion has already been forsaken...for money.</div>
