            <div class='col-md body'>Go Mel U. No question. So what u do 6mths more.<br><br>1) Melbourne is more fun, period.<br>2) MelU's rep is unbeatable.<br>3) Canberra is f*ck boring.<br>4) If u decide to switch unis, esp with ur faculty (biz) u can consider other unis established in biz, eg Monash and RMIT, both also in Melb. Being in MelU, u have no problems transferring.<br>5) Employers here and there will both view MelU higher than ANU. Employers here will also see ur 1.5yrs as possibly a "shortcut degree". Being in MelU helps buffer this misconception. Being in ANU won't.<br>6) Melbourne is more cosmopolitan, with more asian students. You won't feel as alienated as if u went Canberra.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>both r very good Unis, at least within Asia &amp; Oceania (i.e. Asia-Pac) region.<br><br>Both are Group of 8 Unis of Australia, the most prestigious and toughest Unis in terms of examination standard (difficulty) , entry requirements, research and other important criterior - i don't mean 'graduate satisfaction' or ' employment outcome in 2002 or xxxx year' since these the former is just something the Aust Good Uni guide come up so that EVERY Uni can have at least 1 or 2 category of full 5 star grading and the latter fluctuates<br><br>I am from neither so actual details i dont know that much but you may get additional views from<br><br><strong>http://www.cylist.com/Reviews/400300044/</strong><br><br>which includes the ranking of UK and US unis too!<br><br>the ranking of the australian universities is as follows:<br><br>1.australian national uni(ANU)<br>2.melbourne university<br>3.sydney university<br>4.UWA(university of western australia)<br>5.University of Queensland(UQ)<br>6.UNSW<br>7.University of adelaide<br>8.Monash<br><br>These are my rankings even though they are all suppose to be equally as good since they are the top eight universities in australia(Go<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>In research(very important) the top three are:<br>1.ANU<br>2.melbourne university<br>3.UWA<br><br>And in the number of cited articles(very important):<br>1.ANU<br>2.UWA<br>3.University of Sydney<br><br>Review by : Lisa<br><br><strong>PLUS not to forget the Annual ranking by ShangHai JiaoTong Univ  </strong><br><br><strong>http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2004/top500list.htm</strong> which is very well regarded world wide BUT was not <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">even mentioned in Singapore Papers because NUS and NTU ranked outside 100</span></strong>!  out of world top 500 Unis!  this is a very good result already but because S'pore media and govt want people to believe that NTU and NUS are the best in the world (top 20, beating even Cornell and other top US unis), they used the UK Times Higher edu supplement ranking which was <strong>conducted ONLY for the 1st time </strong>and based on how many foreigners a uni accepted - without considering the quality of the foreigners.  Hence RMIT of Australia can be ranked 55 and NUS can ranked top 20 in some category!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep,<br><br>4 get to add that despite ANU outrank U of Melb in some 'international' ranking, this is mainly due to the fact that ANU has unfair advantage in that it is more like NUS to Singapore - she receive more extra and additional funding from Aust Govt and are tasked to do some specialised research items NOT open for other Unis to compete in, hence in certain ranking when research forms a criteria, the difference in that explains why ANU outranks U of Melb and other Go8 like UWA and Sydney.<br><br>Look in terms of <strong>Per capita (researchers) </strong>too, by that account, UWA usually wins of other Group of 8 - over ANU too at times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks alot rob, i agree with wat ya saying ...<br><br>=) anyway can i say in short be it mel uni or ANU , both bachelor will be somewhere the same as in on the top level .<br><br>Its still up to my own after i grad and my performance and how i handle things in life next time matters ritE?, btw , ANU offers 1 1/2 yrs exemption..so if i chose ANU, i'll be only studying 1 and a half years in canberra... would my future employees mind this that i did not even spent two years if i were in other Uni ? ( anu believes in giving 1 1/2 yrs exemption) ..i'm afraid  that this would be a fallback next time as they would see it as a short cut degree..would it?  or would the brand of ANU makes it irrelevent because its not that easy to study?</div>
