            <div class='col-md body'>---------------------------------------------------<br>Dear thinkloud2004<br><br>I like to thank you for reading my posting and happy that you have responded with some interesting remarks.<br><br>Though your arguement that I should join a political party is correct but sad to say the political ground is still a pro-PAP one. That's the reason why the topic here is "Singaporeans are fools"! So the subject is not about me but about how we as Singaporeans should change to be smarter and not continue to be foolish. Yes I may join political party or even form my own party one day but for now it is to change the mindset of people first.<br><br>I take offense that you suggest me to the leave the country. If ever I want to leave this country, I would not have bothered even raising such a controversial topic. As such I disagree that all talk and no action brings me nowhere. Singapore and even PAP profess that we are a democracy with freedom to speak. Your implied notion to ask me to shut up is an insult to yourself. Surely you have decided to suffer and there again fits the bill of this topic of " Singaporeans are fools".<br><br>Therefore, thinkloud2004, as your name implied that you are able to think loudly, stop your suffering and you may like to start joining a political party. You seem pro-PAP and maybe you can line up all the way to the back to join them.<br><br>Thank you again and I welcome further challenges.<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br><br>Quote :<br>&lt;&lt; That's the reason why the topic here is "Singaporeans are fools"! So the subject is not about me but about how we as Singaporeans should change to be smarter and not continue to be foolish.&gt;&gt;<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>My reply :<br><br>Who gave you the right to conclude that Singaporeans are fools?<br>You owe all Singaporeans an apology by making such a blatant statement. By the same token, can I call you names? Singaporeans will be fools indeed if they they don't respond to your baseless allegation and thats why I am writing.<br><br>Just because you have a personal grudge or have some negative opinions about our Government does not give you any justification to make such a sweeping statement. I am a Singaporean and I certainly am not a fool. There are many other things in life besides politicis, or whatever your perception of politics is. I have a good job, a happy family, a safe place to live in and a forseeable stable future for my children - am I a fool to be enjoying all these? Put me in any other country and would I be better off ? Thats why I am suggesting, if you think there is a better place, go try it and then tell us the difference. After all anything good or bad, preferred or otherwise; is but a matter of comparison. Nothing is absolute. Nowhere is perfect. Of course if you choose to ignore all the positive aspects and drill deep into the negative, then I think there is no place in this world suitable for you. Name me a place where you consider good and I can name you at least 10 bad things about it.<br><br>It is always easy to throw stones on the sideline. While watching a soccer match with a friend, each time after a player missed a shot this friend of mine would say, "he should use his left foot", "he should pass to so-and-so" or "he should turn around and swing" or whatever.......My reply to him each time was, "go to the field and play and let me comment on you".<br><br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to think loud.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asking a fellow citizen to leave a country is what I would call a knee-jerk reaction.<br><br>Americans who criticized the Iraq war have met with the same kind of knee-jerk reaction.<br><br>It is counter-productive and only exposes your own shallowness of thought if you do that.<br><br>However, calling somebody a fool, or even calling the entire population of a country fools, is somewhat sweeping and cannot be possibly correct.<br><br>Overall my opinion is that, like citizens of many so-called "developed" countries, citizens of this country simply have not woken up to certain realities in this world.<br><br>There is an apt comparison that can be made between Singaporeans, Americans, British and citizens of many such countries to the overall population as described in the Matrix trilogy.<br><br>They have not woken up, and by and large, most of them might choose not to wake up, even if given such a choice.<br><br>It is inaccurate to describe them as "fools".

All these to make SIngaporeans POOR so that we have no choice to to squeeze ourselves here. Worst of all PAP always justify their pay increment to keep good man. Good man are good because they are willing not when they are not willing and have to be seduced. When good man refused to expose evil man, that 's when a nation will ultimately fail.

Where are they financial and performance records? If they are so clean, why are they not publishing the performance of GIC and Temasek holdings? Where are our money and how are they performing? Isn't Singapore Tech, Singtel, SPH, SIA all public companies that belong to Singaporeans? Why are we not getting any dividents from these companies.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Who gave you the right to conclude that Singaporeans are fools?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Based on those points I have raised. You may like to re-read my first posting.<br><br>Just because you have a personal grudge or have some negative opinions about our Government does not give you any justification to make such a sweeping statement.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Disagree, I have no personal grudge against PAP government. I am only concern about our future, how relevant are we in a competitive world where globalisation and freedom of the minds and ideas are the key ingredients to our survival. At the moment because of our foolishness and blind obedience- we have lost out alternatives views as well as other better ways of managing our country. We do not have strong political institutions to ensure that should PAP fail us, we have an alternative. We have no one to challenge the government by power of VETO in the parliament to prevent unfavorable policies (especially long term ones) from being implemented. We have no one to check if our investments are in order. We have no one able to get the Ministers to disclose their wealth and assets. We have no way of knowing how commited our new MPs are- given that they won so easily under the GRC system. All these are serious important matters. My families, your families and our Singaporean's families's lives are NOW fully dictated by PAP. If we are not sure if these men and women are the Best of the BEST, if you are not worried, I am.<br><br>Ask yourself why there is so few private sector talents in Parliament? How is public sector ministers who have so easily climb the ivory tower, able to to appreciate the lives of private sector people who are always living in fear of losing their jobs when investors leave SIngapore. How are they able to appreciate how their policy affects the poor and the middle income group?<br><br>Have you NOT forgotten how our government encourage businesses to move to Batam, Bintan and Johore under the triangle trade agreement. Was that a good policy? Sometime I wonder if this policy in the mid-1990s resulted in our lost of our manufacturing base today.<br><br>Without a strong manufacturing base, why would any services such as suppliers and customers want to come to Singapore to invest? Its just so child play and naive to think that investors will make Singapore the HQ. So what if they make Singapore the HQ of their operation- its only 1 HQ versus so many other companies that will come in because of this manufacturer. If I am a businessman I will station my HQ in Hong Kong or Shanghai or even Jakarta because its so much easier to manage my business.<br><br>Was that seriuosly wrong policy, challenged? Today no one in PAP talks about it anymore. Ever wonder why?<br><br>I am a Singaporean and I certainly am not a fool.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am glad that you think you are not.<br><br>There are many other things in life besides politicis, or whatever your perception of politics is.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry, in Singapore today the power of PAP is close to unlimited. If you look around you, whether community centre, People's Association, bureaucracy, business groups and mindset of people. There is only the omni-presence of PAP. How different are we from Communist China? In order to have a better life, political change is necessary. We cannot afford to have blatant decisions make that affects our lives without proper scrutiny of policy making.<br><br>Don't you agree that our current economic problems of declining investors is a result of PAP's dracognian policies? If you don't believe how bad our economy now- go to orchard road Ngee Ann city Tower A and check the offices- 50% unoccupied,  Republic Plaza - 30% unoccupied and many more buildings are close to 50% unoccupied. The occupancy rate of our prime building is so much lower than those day when our economy was healthy. I am really worried for those who bought private properties and think that they can still rent out to investors and expats.<br><br>I have a good job, a happy family, a safe place to live in and a forseeable stable future for my children - am I a fool to be enjoying all these?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am glad you have a great life today. Are you confident to say that this will last forever? You are surely not a fool to enjoy but potentially is one to just place all your hope on one party rule without considering and allowing alternative form of government from emerging. Materialism is a very myopic view  of our future.<br><br>At the rate China, India and Malaysia is developing, you and I may lose our jobs in the next 5- 10 years with the current PAP economic policy. HDB, PSA and other government agency's retrenchments in the last 1 year is showing us that. Even once upon a time Iron rice bowl jobs have been broken, what more to say about our job security?<br><br>Put me in any other country and would I be better off ?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are going OUT of point. We are NOT talking about other country. I am talking about how we can continue to have a sustained comfortable life. We can never compare ourselves with others. Geographically, poilitcally, econolically and even socially. before we think that we are better than others, think how we can be better than what we are today.<br><br>Thats why I am suggesting, if you think there is a better place, go try it and then tell us the difference.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you for your suggestion - Its NOT ACCEPTABLE!! Don't try to trap me. I am not going to that area. I am a Singaporean - flesh and blood. I want to have a better and stronger Singapore NOT just happy that we are better than others BUT better than what we are today!<br><br>After all anything good or bad, preferred or otherwise; is but a matter of comparison.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Disagree. NOT comparing with others because we can never compare different fruits. Even apples are different from where they come from. SO there is NO comparison!<br><br>Nothing is absolute. Nowhere is perfect.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have just contradicted yourself: Wonder who says this-  ("I have a good job, a happy family, a safe place to live in and a forseeable stable future for my children - am I a fool to be enjoying all these?")<br><br>Of course if you choose to ignore all the positive aspects and drill deep into the negative, then I think there is no place in this world suitable for you.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Negative. Let me NOT repeat myself. I am NOT saying Singapore is no good. I must be crazy to say that. I am saying that we are foolish to ignore alteratives and that we put ourselves at risk. We allow PAP government to have a very easy time without a strong challenge. We allowed them to place obstacles in the last 44 years to prevent this strong challenge so much so they are now everywhere. That's why we are fools!<br><br>Name me a place where you consider good and I can name you at least 10 bad things about it.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You missed the point.<br><br>It is always easy to throw stones on the sideline. While watching a soccer match with a friend, each time after a player missed a shot this friend of mine would say, "he should use his left foot", "he should pass to so-and-so" or "he should turn around and swing" or whatever.......My reply to him each time was, "go to the field and play and let me comment on you".<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you - when the time is right. For now you are not the only one needs convincing. There are close to 3 million of people like you (taking the 70% votes won by PAP). It wil take some time to do the convincing.<br><br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to think loud.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am honoured.<br><br>[/b][/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Dear Thinkloud2004,<br><br>Thank you for giving me this opportunity to clarify my pointers. The following are my point-by point refutation of what you have rasied.<br><br>Who gave you the right to conclude that Singaporeans are fools?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Based on those points I have raised. You may like to re-read my first posting.<br><br>Just because you have a personal grudge or have some negative opinions about our Government does not give you any justification to make such a sweeping statement.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Disagree, I have no personal grudge against PAP government. I am only concern about our future, how relevant are we in a competitive world where globalisation and freedom of the minds and ideas are the key ingredients to our survival. At the moment because of our foolishness and blind obedience- we have lost out alternatives views as well as other better ways of managing our country. We do not have strong political institutions to ensure that should PAP fail us, we have an alternative. We have no one to challenge the government by power of VETO in the parliament to prevent unfavorable policies (especially long term ones) from being implemented. We have no one to check if our investments are in order. We have no one able to get the Ministers to disclose their wealth and assets. We have no way of knowing how commited our new MPs are- given that they won so easily under the GRC system. All these are serious important matters. My families, your families and our Singaporean's families's lives are NOW fully dictated by PAP. If we are not sure if these men and women are the Best of the BEST, if you are not worried, I am.<br><br>Ask yourself why there is so few private sector talents in Parliament? How is public sector ministers who have so easily climb the ivory tower, able to to appreciate the lives of private sector people who are always living in fear of losing their jobs when investors leave SIngapore. How are they able to appreciate how their policy affects the poor and the middle income group?<br><br>Have you NOT forgotten how our government encourage businesses to move to Batam, Bintan and Johore under the triangle trade agreement. Was that a good policy? Sometime I wonder if this policy in the mid-1990s resulted in our lost of our manufacturing base today.<br><br>Without a strong manufacturing base, why would any services such as suppliers and customers want to come to Singapore to invest? Its just so child play and naive to think that investors will make Singapore the HQ. So what if they make Singapore the HQ of their operation- its only 1 HQ versus so many other companies that will come in because of this manufacturer. If I am a businessman I will station my HQ in Hong Kong or Shanghai or even Jakarta because its so much easier to manage my business.<br><br>Was that seriuosly wrong policy, challenged? Today no one in PAP talks about it anymore. Ever wonder why?<br><br>I am a Singaporean and I certainly am not a fool.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am glad that you think you are not.<br><br>There are many other things in life besides politicis, or whatever your perception of politics is.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry, in Singapore today the power of PAP is close to unlimited. If you look around you, whether community centre, People's Association, bureaucracy, business groups and mindset of people. There is only the omni-presence of PAP. How different are we from Communist China? In order to have a better life, political change is necessary. We cannot afford to have blatant decisions make that affects our lives without proper scrutiny of policy making.<br><br>Don't you agree that our current economic problems of declining investors is a result of PAP's dracognian policies? If you don't believe how bad our economy now- go to orchard road Ngee Ann city Tower A and check the offices- 50% unoccupied,  Republic Plaza - 30% unoccupied and many more buildings are close to 50% unoccupied. The occupancy rate of our prime building is so much lower than those day when our economy was healthy. I am really worried for those who bought private properties and think that they can still rent out to investors and expats.<br><br>I have a good job, a happy family, a safe place to live in and a forseeable stable future for my children - am I a fool to be enjoying all these?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am glad you have a great life today. Are you confident to say that this will last forever? You are surely not a fool to enjoy but potentially is one to just place all your hope on one party rule without considering and allowing alternative form of government from emerging. Materialism is a very myopic view  of our future.<br><br>At the rate China, India and Malaysia is developing, you and I may lose our jobs in the next 5- 10 years with the current PAP economic policy. HDB, PSA and other government agency's retrenchments in the last 1 year is showing us that. Even once upon a time Iron rice bowl jobs have been broken, what more to say about our job security?<br><br>Put me in any other country and would I be better off ?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are going OUT of point. We are NOT talking about other country. I am talking about how we can continue to have a sustained comfortable life. We can never compare ourselves with others. Geographically, poilitcally, econolically and even socially. before we think that we are better than others, think how we can be better than what we are today.<br><br>Thats why I am suggesting, if you think there is a better place, go try it and then tell us the difference.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you for your suggestion - Its NOT ACCEPTABLE!! Don't try to trap me. I am not going to that area. I am a Singaporean - flesh and blood. I want to have a better and stronger Singapore NOT just happy that we are better than others BUT better than what we are today!<br><br>After all anything good or bad, preferred or otherwise; is but a matter of comparison.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Disagree. NOT comparing with others because we can never compare different fruits. Even apples are different from where they come from. SO there is NO comparison!<br><br>Nothing is absolute. Nowhere is perfect.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have just contradicted yourself: Wonder who says this-  ("I have a good job, a happy family, a safe place to live in and a forseeable stable future for my children - am I a fool to be enjoying all these?")<br><br>Of course if you choose to ignore all the positive aspects and drill deep into the negative, then I think there is no place in this world suitable for you.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Negative. Let me NOT repeat myself. I am NOT saying Singapore is no good. I must be crazy to say that. I am saying that we are foolish to ignore alteratives and that we put ourselves at risk. We allow PAP government to have a very easy time without a strong challenge. We allowed them to place obstacles in the last 44 years to prevent this strong challenge so much so they are now everywhere. That's why we are fools!<br><br>Name me a place where you consider good and I can name you at least 10 bad things about it.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You missed the point.<br><br>It is always easy to throw stones on the sideline. While watching a soccer match with a friend, each time after a player missed a shot this friend of mine would say, "he should use his left foot", "he should pass to so-and-so" or "he should turn around and swing" or whatever.......My reply to him each time was, "go to the field and play and let me comment on you".<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you - when the time is right. For now you are not the only one needs convincing. There are close to 3 million of people like you (taking the 70% votes won by PAP). It wil take some time to do the convincing.<br><br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to think loud.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am honoured.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>found this article from the posting "Should Singapore put all its eggs in an unguarded basket?"<br><br>Is this another testimony?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Rising surplus - Who should control?<br><br>US$100b asset topped by another US$23b this year, an unmatched gain which raises tough questions. Richard Hubbard. Reuters<br><br>Dec 7, 2003<br><br>The tiny island nation of Singapore is set to end 2003 with a weak economy and high unemployment but a very fat bank balance.<br><br>Singapore's reserves, already estimated to exceed US$100 billion in a nation of just over 3.3 million citizens, are set for a top up from a record current account surplus the country has in its balance of payments with the rest of the world.<br><br>But as the reserves mountain grows analysts are questioning whether the current system of control by a large and secretive institution, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC), is in the best interests of the country.<br><br>"It is highly risky for Singapore to place virtually its entire reserves under the management of a single entity, particularly one marked by low transparency," said Manu Bhaskaran, a partner in Centennial Group Inc.<br><br>Owing to the government's dominance in the city-state's economy, a large slice of the current account surplus - the gain from exporting more goods and services than are imported plus net investment income - is likely to end up in the coffers of either the central bank or the GIC.<br><br>The surplus for the first three quarters of 2003 stood at S$35.1 billion (US$20.36 billion) - the highest ever recorded, according to the Department of Statistics.<br><br>A strong final quarter will easily push it above S$40 billion for the whole year, a level never seen before.<br><br>"It's a crisis of plenty," according to P.K. Basu, managing director of Robust Economic Analysis in Singapore.<br><br>Basu said the surplus, running at around 30 percent of gross domestic product, was a result of a reluctance by the government to increase spending as the economy slowed down.<br><br>When a government increases spending, people generally have more money to buy imported goods and the current account surplus would normally shrink.<br><br>Analysts said the surplus also partly reflected Singapore's weaker currency after the central bank eased monetary policy mid-year, which would have made imports more expensive.<br><br>With the manufacturing and service sectors hit by the Iraq War and the deadly SARS outbreak, Singapore's GDP is expected to be only one percent higher this year than in 2002, when it showed 2.2 percent growth.<br><br>Investments abroad<br><br>A current account surplus must be invested in foreign assets, such as foreign exchange, stocks, bonds, and real estate overseas.<br><br>In Singapore some of this will be done by private sector firms, but the bulk would be handled by the GIC or the central bank.<br><br>The GIC manages funds that come from the government's accumulated budget surpluses, including the profit of investment agency Temasek Holdings, and some of the assets of the central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore.<br><br>Chaired by modern Singapore's founder and current senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, the GIC said last year it had around US$100 billion in assets, but does not make public its accounts.<br><br>The central bank, chaired by Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong, currently has official foreign reserves of over $90 billion, mainly held in foreign exchange and gold.<br><br>Temasek, whose executive director is married to Lee Hsien Loong, earns income from stakes worth more than $45 billion in about 40 major Singapore companies.<br><br>The agency's stable of companies includes well known names such as Singapore Telecom, Singapore Airlines and DBS Bank, and the port operator PSA Corp.<br><br>The GIC invests its funds in everything from outright purchases of hotels and hospitals in Australia to heavy investments in US equities and bonds.<br><br>Temasek uses its money principally to build local companies, but recently has begun making direct investment abroad as well, including buying stakes in two large Indonesian banks.<br><br>Some analysts argue that, after years in which this government-led investment has turned Singapore into a highly developed country, it may be time for the state to step back.<br><br>"What needs to be done is that the government has to decide whether to pass the investment decision back to the people," said Joseph Tan, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank.<br><br>"The wealth in a sense doesn't belong to the government."<br><br>Basu of Robust Economics believes the concentration of the management of the country's wealth has also contributed to the country's lack of entrepreneurship.<br><br>Centennial Group's Bhaskaran said the GIC was most in need of reform and suggested a statutory board be set up to oversee its management, and that the group's various fund management divisions be broken up and sold off.<br><br>"For a small country, do we want to put all our savings in one fund management house?" he said.

What have you done after waking up? Simply agreeing to "orators" who cry their hearts out is easy.

            <div class='col-md body'>I have just watched a documentary on the A-bomb.<br><br>Actually the Japanese were about to surrender. They have to because towards the end of world war II, the American were flying in and out of Japan at will.<br><br>The A-bomb was dropped so that the Americans could end the war with Japan unconditionally so that the Japanese would not surrender to the Russians.
