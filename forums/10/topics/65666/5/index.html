            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by dead_clone:<br>[<strong>umm guys, i was just wondering...<br>why is it that some of you can commit yourselves to statements where do you all get facts and figures to back that up?</strong><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">I think fact and figures are hard to find and NOT necessary in this case. You need not be an expert, scientist, lecturer of academic to know the truth. The fact is the PAP has been in FULL control over the last 44 years with virtually no oppositional voice in Parliament. Over the last 20 years oppositional forces have been reduced to a sorry state. Their predicament is NOT because PAP does a great job but rather because of the unfair use of the PAP majority parliamentary power to legislate the use of the GRC system to make oppositional forces weak and uncompetitive. At the same time the PAP's use of legality to limit the liberty of oppositional political parties in contrast to our constitution as laid out by the British before we went independent. How democratic and fair can our leaders be, compared to the British who has more than 300 years of democratic parlimentary system? Also the recent year's use of accounting system as well as donation rules and laws to limit the opposition, are signs of a panicked PAP and their inability to feel the sentiments of the ground. I think the PAP knows that should the opposition be funded, they be be stronger and the PAP will lose the government to them. The truth is that PAP is no longer a strong party.<br><br>In short, facts and figures are the language of the PAP to limit the ability of the opposition. How do you measure if people are foolish? No prideful human will admit that they are. But the truth is painful if you look at our history that we allowed the absolute power of the PAP to take place today. In the end they legislate unfovarable policies and make our lives difficult especially the high jobless rates and the high cost of living. We complain and cry over it- some say this is life, some relent and say no choice, some shout and ask for alternatives ( when they know they are the ones who gave them up during balloting)  and some say live with it.<br><br>So don't you think Singaporeans (we) are so...lost or in other words so...f_______lish??? Complain and still vote for PAP.<br></span><br><br><strong><br>what makes you think that you are the only one in this island who has "awaken" or "discovered the ultimate truth"?<br><br>i'm sure there're many others who had seen it coming much earlier than you all have but most have come to realise that this is a "suck thumb" kinda thing so they don't bother to voice out like you all have and that doesn't mean they are all for the government.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, being quiet is one thing, being f'___'d is another. Let me tell you why PAP won 70+% in the last election. It is because of the ERS, fear of the ballot because the election tickets has numbers and serial numbers, upgrading of the flats. In Japan and in Malaysia, the press would have called this "vote buying".<br><br>Well those people who gave PAP unchallenged majority in the 1960s, 70s and 80s may be forgiven because they were less educate then and were probably easier to Be f_______d. But even today we are so much more educated, surely we are not so f_____lish isn't it?<br><br></span><br><strong><br>as far as i can comprehend what thinkloud2004 was trying to say, he agrees with all the "bad stuff" you all have dug up about the government but is that all you can do? posting "noble thoughts" endlessly in hope that someone will take notice &amp; do something for you? where's all the action despite the violent reactions</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Well I guess it is to educate, to be more informed, to be have all these thrown to the open so that we will not be so f_______lish and so blind to what we see, hear, listen and say. We would not be so easily indoctrinated and would not be so easily swayed by the PAP.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...<br><br>British and Japan were mentioned briefly on their political situation, however r they really good political system we should look forward to ? British do have a more powerful opposition, however they r still weak compared to the main political party. And also how does British fare recently ? After the building of the crystal palace, they seems to be declining very gradually over these 300 years... They r also known as being too conservatives in certain areas.<br><br>How about Japan ? Sometimes I pity Koizumi because there r too much rivalries inside his party and outside. Within the same political parties, there r already bickering and forming up of their own clip. When u talked about argument within different political parties, they can go as far as fighting and rioting. The decisions made by koizumi r at most moderate, since there r always pop out some oppositions to bold ideas. Nobody wanna sacrifies their interest for the common good. In short, painful decisions tat will aid their country in the long run r seldom carried out in Japan. Thus Japan isn't preforming well these few years too.<br><br>If u want, u can talk about French. How does their Gov fare ? Not well too. In trying to gain polls, they made many decisions tat favours the people and punish the industries. In French, they only need to work very minimal hours a week and their welfare and medical welfare r enormous. However wat does it leads them to ? Industries leaving the countries for somewhere cheaper and better. Take note tat tis is now a globalised world, one have to make decisions in reference to wat other nations r doing.<br><br>And one last thing about these few countries is tat... they were already rich and powerful before the political situation now. Is Singapore rich and powerful now ?<br><br>In a certain sense, LKY is wrong about filling stomach amd dulling the brains. According Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,  people r initially concern with "stomach" and "shelter" first. When tat is satisfied they will aim for "security". In the end if all these r satisfied, they will start to aim for higher attaiment such as personal fulfilment, justice, freedom etc. Thus in actual fact when people r "fed" and "clothed" and having a good life, then they will seek for things such as freedom and justice, thus the brain r "sharpened" instead. Guess it is a good sign tat people r looking into this last aspect now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking for freedom and justice is one thing brother... getting it is another thing entirely.<br><br>I've no illusions about American-style democrazy being even ever planted here, but then again, the curret system is pretty much a cop out as it is.

So there.<br><br>Is there a need to come down on any kind of opposition to their rule, be it from political or civilian quarters, with overwhelming, ham-fisted, overkill firepower that is typically their style. Is there is need to dehumanize and discredit anybody opposed to their opinion?

What's up with all that?<br><br>The PAP in essence imposes their brand of political thinking on the populace, they define behaviour, culture and basically what it means to be human.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahhh.... Animal Farm reminds me of my secondary days where we r forced to take it as literature. Since animal farm is mentioned, lets talk about animal farm<br><br>In the past, there were 2 pigs politician. One called Napoleon, who turns out to be the bad politician tat used dogs as tools to control and made the animals worked too much and starving. There were another pig called snowy. He is supposed to be the ideal politician tat propose to build a windmill for electricity, warming the barns at winter and lights at night. Under him , I suppose they will be well fed and though still work a lot for their survival in buliding up the windmill (it is suppose to be an ardous task for them, but their hard work is for the common good)<br><br>Wat is the difference between them ? Napoleon takes all the rewards for themselves. Snowy shares the reward with the animals. If snowy ever get into power, he probably will live in the Man house too and enjoy a slightly better lifestyle then the animals. This is much like the CEO for a company take probably take in 20-200 times more pay than the average worker. They have their ills too. Living under a stressful life gives them white hairs at a younger age, they cannot go out to public as and when they like it, their lives is scrutinised in the public.<br><br>So now, Is Singapore under Snowy kind of management of Napoleon kind of management in the past ? We probably r 'well fed' and enjoy 'lightings in the night and heater in winter' though "overwork" to build the windmill. But of course there is an element of Napoleon management in it in the using of "dogs" to chase away political opponents. I guess tis is the greatest ill I find in the politics arena we r in.<br><br>The animals in the book never get to be under snowy management, much like china never get to be under Sun Yat Sen management for long. (At least it is true for Yuan Shi Kai) Because too soft a politician will always get pushed off by someone tougher.<br><br></div>

If anything, ministers taking a 10 percent pay cut as a sign of sympathy is an amazing demostation of how in touch they are with the general Singaporean condition.<br><br>One can argue that the relationship between Singaporeans and their gar'men is a symbiotic one, with both parties feeding off each other, however it this relationship is hardly equal, where both parties share in the gains. In this case, this relationship greatly favours the gar'men at the expense of the people, where the people are just kept barely alive on lifesupport in order to carry on the gar'men life cycle of elite ruling class people. Akin to the face hugger in Aliens, we are strangled but kept indefinetely and barely alive by the gar'men to serve their purposes, and once that purpose is served, like the alien that bursts forth fataly from the hosts' chest, you are discarded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Animal Farm is a great book. I studied it for literature too.<br><br>However, now it is becoming clearer to me that the book that George Orwell really wanted to write was 1984.<br><br>In his own words, why he wanted to write a book like 1984 :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"...I write because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. ... Of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more exactly. ANIMAL FARM was the first book in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole. I hope to write another fairly soon ..."</span><br><br>We can therefore consider 1984 to be the proper sequel to Animal Farm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh... I am back...<br><br>About fat cats, there r many other fat cats as well. The CEO's, own company boss and very competent engineers or insurane agents r fat cats themselves too. They have 5-7 digit salary and enjoy perks tat were out of the whim and smell of local Proletariat. Can the local Proletariat have a chance to be fat cats ? They do, if they r good. They can try to set up their own business or climb up the corporate ladder or work hard. I believe tis is a fact of life tat 20% of the richest population in the world holds 80% of the total wealth. Few country has suceeded in closing the weath gaps between the rich and poor. (frankly the only countries tat suceeded is the old USSR, North Korea and China)<br><br>Wat is the difference between being a MP and being a COE ? They all have stress, they all had to make good and critical decision and they r in a general sense capable. If some members of the Elite and Party Cadres of the Ruling Party do not enter the field of politics, do u think they will fall and become a local Proleteriat like most of population in Singapore ? Not likely, they will still excel in their own chosen field and became Fat Cats too. Remember most of the politician have a hard time climbing up to such a high position. Any Tom Dick and Harry won't make it.<br><br>So the question is, if u r a COE caliber person, will u work as a politician with a very average pay or will u prefer to work as a COE of some companies getting 10-100 times more pay ? In Singapore, sad to say, people r just too "meritocracy" and look at the practical things in life. If u don't pay them well, they rather emigrate or venture into private firms.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes life in Singapore can be expensive, but it does not need to be unnecessarly expensive. How many of our gar'men extorted expenses are truly and fairly priced? If anything, they have been making a quick buck off the peasants for quite some time.<br><br>If Singapore really wanted to compete, the gar'men should seriously loosen up on driving the peasants (aka. us) as if we were nothing more then machines and allow them to think for their own. Because now the only way we can compete is not to outwork the competion, but to outsmart it. And they have been slowly opening up to this apparent truth. As long as they will keep meddling and doing what they think is right for us, and preventing us from steering our own ships, their dreams of a creative force are pretty beached.<br><br>As of CEO's working their way up there, it's sometimes pretty laughable. Some of them may have worked their way up there, but the truth is, this Singaporean system is run on CONNECTIONS. Get into the "top" school and get the "top" grades and you'll be the "top", and have friends in high places. But as to weather they actually having anything inbetween their heads on how to run things, that's another story altogether. Are theiR excessively high pays and lifestyles deserved? While ordinary Singaporeans labour to support their opulent status quo? I doubt it. But I'm not here to argue about the injustice, it is almost self-apparent. The problem here is not that we have no concept of equality, apparently we have the notion that some people are apparenly born MORE EQUAL.<br><br>The sad thing is that, while they want us to think out of the box, they want us to do so while being in the box. This means they want a comformist way of non comformist thinking. Yes by all means be as creative as you want, but don't do anything to upset or question the status quo. In the end, this is a system that has gone bad from it's orginal aspirations... it may still work, but in the end, you realize that it is tremedously unfair to the average peasant...</div>
