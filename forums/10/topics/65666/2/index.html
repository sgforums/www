Having a constanly strong and credible opposition is a good thing, as it keeps PAP on the edge and maintain proficiency in whatever they are doing. In that way, PAP wouldnt be slacking as it is now.<br><br>Having cases like the 2SG Hu case or the RSS Courageous case are not enough. These are merely antsy cases in PAP eyes. They are just disasters waiting to happen, and when it does, the gahmen just have to solve them. If it doesnt, everyone will be left clueless.<br><br>If a credibly strong opps rises up , it can tell the PAP "Hey look, we are here to kick your ass, if you dont perform, we will be able to throw you to oblivion."<br><br>Now, here it is a matter of survival already. PAP is threatened, and it will then seriously do self examination to see whats wrong. Grievances will then be solved, instead of merely explained. Whether or not the oppostion  is enough to take over gahmen, it doesnt matter. It keeps the gahmen on the edge. If its stronger, we have better gahmen. Good deal though.<br><br>What I meant by strong doesnt mean having lots of opp members who knows how to KBKB well. Singaporeans are smart, and it doesnt take an idiot much to discern a strong opposition or a credible opposition</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>Let me add on to how absolute power will fool Singaporeans.<br><br>Do you know what is the definition of Tyrants?<br><br>Tyrant is a cruel lord who by force or by craft.. has obtained power over the realm or country... they love rather to work their own profit, though it be to the harm of the land, than the common profit of all. (Alfoso the wise)<br><br>PAP fits this definition. By craft in enacting GRC so as to prevent oppositional forces from winning elections. In this way they prevent good man from being elected through 1 man 1 vote system under a single representative ward.<br><br>GRC has failed. Those MPs elected under the skirt of Ministers has been ineffective in taking care of the residents. They are unable to stand by themselves. Surely they must be weak to require a team of people. We need representatives of the people NOT representatives of the government- especially representative of PAP echelon!<br><br>PAP surely loves to profit themselves especially political games and increase the government's revenue rather than to care for the people's profitability. The GST increase to 5% is a great testimony. The government has so much money but the people are always struggling. Why? Something is surely wrong!<br><br>So why are we still so foolish to let them fool us?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by relevation:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear All,<br><br>I have found that SIngaporeans are fools from various episodes.<br><br>Let me elaborate with the following:<br><br>1) We allow an absolute party to rule us for 44 years without any opposition to ensure an alternative government<br><br>2) We readily agree to take unfavorable measures like CPF cuts, higher cost of payments for HDB, and any increment of fees by our government without question or protest.<br><br>3) We fight among ourselves - trying to gain favors from the PAP echelon.<br><br>4) We laugh and cheer when oppposition leaders fail.<br><br>Now the supporting details:<br><br>1) I think other than Japan's LDP and Taiwan's KMT, Singapore is the only state that gives up oppositional power willingly. What makes us so sure after LKY's demise, Singapore is as safe and as uncorrupt? Who will guarantee us that the Lee Family will continue to be honest and will continue to give us the prosperity that was delivered for the last 44 years?<br><br>Next, we are a full fledge democracy with full democratic institutions with 1 man 1 vote and we willingly surcum ourselves to unfavourable policies to make us poor and less rich. We willingly surcome under a democratic dictatorship where there is no force or coersion like Taiwan who was under martial law. Why are we so willing to listen to the PAP and refuse to give oppositional forces a chance to develop. Very much we laugh at them and seem to want them to fall from grace.<br><br>Do remember they are our hope if PAP ever fails us. They are also working for our national interest. Without them what is the difference between Singapore and Communist China?? Just so much similarities- ONE PARTY STATE and RULE OF MAN. LKY&gt;GCT&gt;LHL- all MAN. So we are fools- all of us whether smart or stupid, including me because I am not there to prevent this. But whether me or any oppositional forces are useless without the support of the people and worse when Singaporeans are naive and foolish. Look at how happy we are to see JBJ, CHIAM SEE TONG, Chee Soon Juan and STeve Chia fall from grace.<br><br>2) Whay are we so happy to take pay cuts. Let me define happy. Happy is a state of happiness to the extend of having become contented with the situation or relent with the situation without any action taken to prevent it. That's happy. CPF cuts, increase fees during our worst times, SIA pliots being bullied by the government and LKY, ERP and COE to increase our running cost, artificially inflated property prices  to satisfy developers like Far East and CDL. All these to make SIngaporeans POOR so that we have no choice to to squeeze ourselves here. Worst of all PAP always justify their pay increment to keep good man. Good man are good because they are willing not when they are not willing and have to be seduced. When good man refused to expose evil man, that 's when a nation will ultimately fail. We are all so foolish!<br><br>3) You won't believe it, so many people are happy that Steve Chia falls. Do we know that for every oppoistional force that fails, it makes Singapore worse off. How are we so sure that PAP is really doing a great job. They are good in cosmestics- upgrades, $ in CPF etc, how are we sure that they are really that good. Who in us audit them? Where are their statements? Where are they financial and performance records? If they are so clean, why are they not publishing the performance of GIC and Temasek holdings? Where are our money and how are they performing? Isn't Singapore Tech, Singtel, SPH, SIA all public companies that belong to Singaporeans? Why are we not getting any dividents from these companies. What have they done to make us better in our livelihood? Are we not fools? We have lost people are who there to help us and make our lives better. PAP had given us a standard life but never a comfortable one! They always make our lives difficult.<br><br>4) Singapore is the only country where political awareness is the lowest. Without oppositional forces, tehre is no way we can ever ensure that our interest are secured. We will only have the PAP's views and actions. We lost the chance to explore issues and ensure that our ineterest is secured. How are we so sure that the decisions the PAP make is not Pro-PAP and their members or pro-a certain group of people? So stop cheering and being so happy when our opposition leaders fail and fall, because we all will lose out. Let us see things beyond what is show to us by the PAP and learn to see things in our own way. Lets be open minded and accept diversity. Its only when there is choice that we have the power. For now we are all just FOOLS , all to willing and happy to be fooled.<br><br>Relevation.<br><br>Poor chap....you must have been suffering all these years. Two options for you my dear friend -<br><br>1. Join an opposition party and articulate your grievances to the whole nation. I am sure there are many like minded individuals out there who will worship you......."No action Talk only" will bring you nowhere.<br><br>2. Leave the country and throw stones from afar, hopefully it will hit some people you hate very much.<br><br>Of course the other option is to continue staying here and suffer. What is the word for a person who enjoyed suffering ???<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Where is the free exchange of information? By shutting down the station, PAP has demonstrated that it is weak and incompetent. It is unable to withstand the challenges and the pressure information brings.<br><br>If PAP is smart, it should not shut dissent down but challenge the dissent.

That's the reason why the topic here is "Singaporeans are fools"! So the subject is not about me but about how we as Singaporeans should change to be smarter and not continue to be foolish. Yes I may join political party or even form my own party one day but for now it is to change the mindset of people first.<br><br>I take offense that you suggest me to the leave the country. If ever I want to leave this country, I would not have bothered even raising such a controversial topic. As such I disagree that all talk and no action brings me nowhere. Singapore and even PAP profess that we are a democracy with freedom to speak. Your implied notion to ask me to shut up is an insult to yourself. Surely you have decided to suffer and there again fits the bill of this topic of " Singaporeans are fools".<br><br>Therefore, thinkloud2004, as your name implied that you are able to think loudly, stop your suffering and you may like to start joining a political party. You seem pro-PAP and maybe you can line up all the way to the back to join them.<br><br>Thank you again and I welcome further challenges.<br><br></div>

Our PAP government waited for 20 years before they acted on it and only when our economy is now suffering as our highly depended MNCs moves to China and other low cost countries.<br><br>In the 1980s, our government's response was that SIngapore's survival largely lies with the MNCs and even Mr Goh acknowledge and use MNCs investing here as a threat to entice Singaporeans to vote for PAP in the 1991, 1997 and to a lesser extend in 2001's general election.<br><br>Had we have a strong opposition, we would not have waited 20 years to start singing the entrepeurer song.<br><br>Let me remind all Singaporeans, Singapore is a small nation. Any mistake that is made by the government has serious consequences. Issues that are not well thought of and due to ease of majority in Parliament and the PAP WIP (where members of PAP backbenches are NOT allowed to express differing opinions), result in many failures. The failures of Investment in Suzhou, 2 child policy, dependency on MNCs, COE, ERP and GST have now seen serious consequences.<br><br>Had we have a dual party system in parliament, we may have a better chance of preventing these failures.<br><br>So far we are lucky to have survived all these failures.
