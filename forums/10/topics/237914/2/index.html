But when we want to work together on combating corruption, they don't want to," Mr Kalla said.<br><br>Singapore has said that Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesian president, and Lee Hsien Loong, the Singaporean prime minister, agreed in 2005 that any extradition treaty could only be signed together with a defence co-operation agreement. But Mr Kalla dismissed that claim.<br><br>"They're thinking on the business side. If this treaty is signed then the corrupt Indonesians won't want to live in Singapore any more. That's all it is. It strengthens Singapore's economy."<br><br>Mr Kalla's predicted growth rate is well above the government's stated goal of 6.3 per cent growth this year in south-east Asia's largest economy. Most independent economists have predicted growth of about 6 per cent after last year's 5.5 per cent.<br><br>"Our growth this year can be above 6 per cent, up to 7 per cent," he said. "Perhaps it's too optimistic but with all the conditions that are now in place it should be achievable."<br><br>Mr Kalla has long been one of the most bullish figures in Mr Yudhoyono's government, which took office in 2004 with a mandate to accelerate reforms and boost economic growth.<br><br>One Jakarta-based economist said the vice-president's prediction was unlikely to be met for years because "the pace of reform is just moving too slowly".<br><br>But Mr Kalla said the resolution of ethnic conflicts in places such as the tsunami-ravaged Aceh province, a reduced threat of Islamic terrorism and accelerating infrastructure development were all positive for the economy.<br><br>"In 2000 there were all kinds of risks, political, security, conflict everywhere," he said. "Now there isn't any of that...But the bottom line is that no country's image is going to be good if the economy is not in good shape. For example, China used to be bad. But now people are not talking about democracy there. They think the place is great. So in Indonesia the economy has to take priority."<br><br></div>

We don't live in thailand - we don't know the whole story about thaksin so we should not be commenting on their military junta . The thai people respect the thai king and he is not ousted  but instead gave the junta his blessings.<br><br>As for Malaysia , sure there is the bumiputra policy which discriminates against non bumiputra but does it really cripple them ? No. Malaysia is progressing slowly because of it , it is not stopping . I also happen to know that despite the bumiputra policy , their consulate always send representatives if their consul cannot make it to a scholarship presentations in one university regardless of whether the scholarship holder is a non bumi or not. I also know that alot of rich malaysian chinese don't act like some Singaporean spoilt brats whom I personally met and detest.<br><br>As for Indonesia, once a mess always a mess - still remains a mess. However if they do not wish to trade a commodity with Singapore - there are always other willing parties to trade sand with.<br><br>So really , does Singapore have the right to criticise anybody especially when they choose to fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck up on the wrong turf especially someone elses ? We will be making noise like the thais if Temasek was sold to a foreign country.<br><br>Remember Suzhou park? How about SIA falling from the best to rank number 7 airline? Retrenchment of local staff in SIA?  Temasek overpaid 10 billion for optus in Australia?  Bearing in mind, you cannot even look at what other big mistakes which has been made openly and transparently until much later when the news breaks.<br><br>It is good to be nationalistic but not  when the government or its agencies makes one big mistake and muddies the transparency issues that many citizens would like to have .</div>
