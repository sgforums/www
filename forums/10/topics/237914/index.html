            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore Indonesia border dispute built on sand</strong><br><br>Mark Forbes, Sydney Morning Herald Correspondent in Jakarta<br><br>February 17, 2007<br><br>Sand is stirring up a diplomatic storm between Indonesia and Singapore, exposing rifts over disputed borders and Indonesian graft suspects seeking refuge in Singapore.<br><br>Indonesia has banned sand exports that are vital to the Singaporean construction boom. Earlier this month, Indonesia claimed sand mining was erasing small islands, shrinking its territory, while Singapore was using the sand to reclaim land and expand.<br><br>But senior Indonesian officials yesterday confirmed the ban was also aimed at forcing Singapore to sign an extradition treaty. Several Indonesian businessmen accused of large-scale corruption have fled to Singapore to escape prosecution.<br><br>The admission provoked a rebuff from Singapore's Foreign Minister, George Yeo, who said the link was counter-productive and suggested shortcomings in Indonesia's judicial system were hampering the extradition treaty.<br><br>Mr Yeo said negotiating the treaty was difficult because if Indonesia sought extraditions, Singaporean courts would consider the conduct of the resulting trials. "Which means that, inevitably, a judge in Singapore would have to examine the conduct of their police and their judges," he said.<br><br>The Indonesian Foreign Ministry's director general for Asia, the Pacific and Africa, Primo Joelianto, said Singapore had to understand both countries needed each other. "Besides concern about rising environmental deterioration in the areas, the ban also aims to push them in extradition and some border negotiations."<br><br>Indonesia had become very impatient with the slow progress of extradition and defence agreements, as well as border negotiations, Mr Joelianto said. The extradition treaty was vital to anti-corruption crackdown, Indonesia officials have claimed.<br><br>Several Indonesian bankers accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars are believed to be hiding in Singapore.<br><br>The ban has been applied to all sand exports, but is focused on Singapore, the largest importer. Indonesia has reportedly sent eight warships to monitor its border with Singapore and enforce the ban.<br><br>Mr Yeo has denied Singapore was using Indonesian sand imports for land reclamation, stating it was utilised for construction. The sand came from inland areas, not island beaches, he said.<br><br>Singapore is releasing sand from government stockpiles to minimise the impact of the ban, which analysts have warned could have serious implications for its construction industry.<br><br>Meanwhile, Indonesia has also objected to Singaporeans buying islands in the neighbouring province of Riau. Navy commander Djoko Sumaryono said the purchases raised security concerns.<br><br>Vice Admiral Djoko said he had ordered an investigation into the illegal and "rampant" sales. "If the local administration is found to be incapable of safeguarding its areas we will take over security matters there."<br><br>Under a presidential decree, the administration must erect a name plate and raise the national flag on each of the Riau islands to signal they were Indonesian territory and subject to local regulations, he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we better quickly get ready the LNG and have a huge storage for it. Else that's real big disaster if those countries go crazy and wana play a big game. maybe the govt has whatever strategic reserves but pls don't let the citizen worry by telling us our natural gas all from north and south ONLY. But haven we had enough of their nonsense? These neighbouring country govts don't care about law and order and contract agrreement. Not everyone think like us.<br><br>Perhaps MP Mdm Ho is right. We should not go around to help them too much during disaster else they see us as pity them and look down on them so they "lose face".  If we give aid costing only $50K or $80K... aiya so little might as well don't give. Look at the place the indon receive the cheque and reporters... so very grand... maybe that 1 chair in that room cost more than the aid. Our govt should really cut down or even stop all this publicity and lay low and look else where. Get closer to the rest of the world and ignore these neighbour lahhh... since they don't like us.<br><br>And why the hell Temasek go buy that Shincorp shit. Why wana touch people's sensitive parts so itchy hand. Now really in deep shit and let see if the Thai military govt dare to rob our billions.<br><br></div>

Other nations can tank a couple of hits and still make it through. Can we even tahan more then one? What's to stop a fanatical leader from letting his nation take a couple of hits as long as we were totally destroyed?<br><br>Thirdly, these are weapons of last resort. We cannot use them over simple things like border disputes or minor international incidents. So if we totally remove NS for nukes... whoes going to take care of these little things? What's to stop other nations from testing system with us as long as they don't cross the line to nuke? Would we nuke malaysia over them cutting water? If anything Singapore would be in a weaker international position then before if we decided nukes were enough... it actually allows you to be bullied because they know that you can protect your own existence with a great fail-deadily... but little else.<br><br>Not to mention, our allies like uncle Sam or just about any country will be on our butts in short order if we ever get the bomb. This is not to mention that getting nukes in the first place entails a lot of diplomatic and economic fallouts... can we tank this?<br><br>In short, no matter how we look at it... getting nukes means we are screwed.<br><br>Man, this sounds just like the compressed-air-in-MRT-tunnels-generating-power scheme.</div>
