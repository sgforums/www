              <p>As long as our abang has not 'come home', i am not comfortable to endorse that the pore is the best place to live in, in the sense that terror has eyes on the pore and abang has not 'come home' and has gone UnTraceable in not just a country but a city and not just that but a tiny little dot , for over 5 weeks and still counting.</p>
              <p>1. is there any Trace that he IS still in the pore, for sure, absolutely sure in the scientific and legal sense?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. How long will it take for our leading men to capture this limper? yes, he has disabilities. and is UnTraceable in a tiny town city.</p>
              <p>But have no fear, with my confidence in the leading men, I optimistically think the re-capture will be in 6 months time, i.e. 24 weeks       or less.</p>
              <p>this means can be tomorrow lah, doon ya get it ;)  .</p>

              <p>while all the many good news is attributed to our leading men, who on earth wants to accept the baby called the ills of the system, if any?</p>
              <p>With Casino,  how many can dare to come up here and say, ZERO problems will be created ?  Zero social ills will be created ?</p>
              <p>I believe less people will be bankrupt due to Casino because more people will win money than lose. U believe me right? Based on the poreans choice, I think you believe me. No money illegal laundering. No murders. No drug and sex and gambling addicts. No marriage problems due to gambling. No prostitution due to owing money to gambling. No family problems and breakups due to it.</p>
              <p>Sure. no problem wan.</p>
              <p>Economy gain wan. All the glory.</p>
              <p>anyone wants to take the blame for social ills?</p>

              <p>MSK... it is really a big cock up. I think he manage to escape liao. However because he escape doesn't means singapore is gonna face a big terrorist attack...</p>
              <p>About casino, I thought it is a cut and dried topic liao. It do bring in social ill but it also bring in wealth and tourists. Every decision there r pros and cons. Countries like malaysia, japan, british, america and korea also have casinoes. R they facing a big social problem now ? If u talk about casino, Geylang have a lot of illegal casinoes now.</p>

              <p><strong>The Reliably Unreliable Government</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When reading an article (Straits Times, Saturday, April 4, 2008 - Prime pg.3) highlighting Mas Selamat’s escape and linking it to complacency, I can’t help but voice out the upsetting unfairness and…let’s face it…bullshit of the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here is the golden response from MM Lee in an email interview:<br>“The people on the whole believed that the Government will take care of all security matters. But no government can be 100 percent on the ball 100 percent of the time. A government needs the active support and cooperation of the people.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That’s what he said. And yet, how is it that the people is not rewarded the same way the government is? If indeed it is a collaborative effort to ensure the safety and security of this nation, and more so in the part of the people to be vigilant at all times, then why have the government so proudly raised their salaries without the people’s validation or approval and pat themselves on the back for doing such a good job? Since this Mas Selamat affair is a big deal and is a major compromise of Singapore’s security, then it’s only right and fair that the government decrease their ridiculous salaries for doing a shitty job. Don’t just blame it on the custodians. Ever since this whole mess started, we Singaporeans have yet to see any politician or state figure or high-ranking uniformed personnel stepping down because they’ve failed to re-apprehend Mas Selamat in a country that’s slightly over 647 sq km, where almost all exits have been tightly sealed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, after all the claims of always delivering to the people and even having the cheek to act as consultant to countries like Russia when the government can’t even find one fugitive on this tiny island, is it still fair for the people? Is it still fair that the people have to tolerate the government’s high salaries when we are stuck with more taxes and 7% GST? Most importantly, is it still fair that after all the work the people have done, the government enjoys the fruits of our labor and let us fend for ourselves and ask we help them in cleaning up their mess, but when it comes to the glory, we have no say in it?</p>
              <p>Seriously, is it fair?</p>

              <p>With today's taxes.. . yes we pay to maintain the environments and pays for the services..</p>
              <p>It is also use to improve or build better infrastructure be it structural, educational or lifestyle.</p>

              <p><br>Money you have to depart with is not your money. if you don't decide how the money would be spent for the future, then that is not your investment. Tax payment is different from your CPF investment. Government's revenue is not your money. you can influence the way money is to be spent only via your vote to select the right government to handle the money. Even then, you don't always have what you wish. Not all american agree with the government's policy on iraq, not only money is spent, their young men are sent to fight other people's war!</p>
              <p>the budget debate is just over, how government gets their revenue and how the money would be spent are all there. you may not like it, don't have to agree with it, what is good use to you may not be good use to others, you may even want to think that they were not telling the truth, there are ways through which you can question, but you are not likely to get any answer here in this forum.</p>
              <p>MNC are free to recruit anybody, in Singapore and in many other countries, will stopping recruitment of foreigners help the locals? think again. The only organisations I believe MUST employ singaporeans are the government and related organizations, the civil service, the SAF....then the heads will know the problem of and with the locals. and in that way the government would be looking after its people, especially those who can't find jobs among the MNC.

              <p>And yes.. we vote to choose who governs our life.. but I'd also like to have the right to impeach/fire lousy leaders ? Fair right ?</p>
              <p>And.. if the government's revenue is not her people's money.. then who does it belong to ? LHL ? Lee family ?</p>
              <p>Why is there no propositions for the people to choose how they want the money to be spent ? Shouldn't they let the public decide what the public want ?</p>
