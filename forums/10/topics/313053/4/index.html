              <p>if you want 60s, try India. I will attest to it that most parts of India is still in that kind of era. you need to be quick though as it is fast disappearing. you will still find ambassador cars aplenty there, enfield bikes and cows/cattles on road co-existing with motorbikes and cars. you can start with delhi.</p>

              <p>I look at the survey for the mercer one, which rank singapore as the 34 city in the world, and still find singapore as the best city to live in asia <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Of course if u wanna compare with countries which more resources, history and advantages, singapore cannot win them. We r just a small country with little or not resources.</p>
              <p>If u talk about infrastructure, singapore is really offering a lot compared with other countries. The income compared with cost of living is generally on the high side. Despite a lot of grudges, there is no poverty here. No one is dead because they have nothing to eat or they cannot study. The pollution, political stability and safety in singapore is probably unbeatable compared with other countries. System-wise the gov do build good roads, paint the building so regularly everything look new and make the gov system so corrupt free tat red tape and complaints r their biggest problem. They also come out with system such as temasek which had brought additional income to the country (contrary to popular belief in forums)</p>
              <p>The problem however is tat the Gov squash opposition so hard tat is not considered as a democratic nation. Another good point to note is the minister pay is too much while all the gov sector pay remain stagnant. Another potential problem is the Lees are having positions tat seemed to be dubious. Singapore also tend to favour PRs and foreigners more than wat other countries r willing to do. These create a lot of unhappiness among its people.</p>
              <p>It is not a perfect country. The gov poke their nose into too much things. It is a good thing and a bad thing. They scared people r too fat and started to build gyms and swimming pools. (very few countries offer cheap gym services) They scared healthcare and old age and therefore force CPF. (either the countries let private sector manage all the hospital and their costs r more ridiculous or the gov hospitals suck big times) They scared people have no place to live then build HDB. (no homeless people in singapore). They scared the companies provide lousy services and force business to let their employees attend free servicing improvement classes. But the more they do, the more singaporean felt they r controlled and tis bred unhappiness.</p>
