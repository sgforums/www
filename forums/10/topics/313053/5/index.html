              <p>Just a question huh Uncle Ver SG,</p>
              <p>Do u really think singapore is so lousy, so terrible, so cruel and have nothing good to mention at all ? Do u really think the Gov of singapore r actually inept, stupid, greedy despots tat do not churn out any good idea or any good policies and sit around loafing and collecting million dollar pay ?</p>
              <p>I just have tis idea tat a lot of people here have tis mentality <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>When they win youth olympics, they complain it is nothing and waste of money. When they come out with any policy they say it is the world's most stupid policy and will surely lose money. When they get voted to be a good place to stay they try to find ways and means to say it is kelong and singapore is the worst place to stay. When they have something to be proud of, they say it is all gov propaganda. When MSK escape, they say singapore gov is useless and they should have a mass resignation and tell the whole world about it.</p>
              <p>I really feel tat singaporean have no pride being singaporean... They felt tat tis is probably one of the worst place to live in and all the achievements etc r overrated.</p>

              <p>"Do u really think the Gov of singapore r actually inept, stupid, greedy despots tat do not churn out any good idea or any good policies and sit around loafing and collecting million dollar pay ?"</p>
              <p>Yes. Their "good ideas and policies" are not unique. And they impose unnessary burdens to the citizens.</p>
              <p>"Do u really think singapore is so lousy, so terrible, so cruel with nothing good to mention at all ?"</p>
              <p>Well theres the food, the PAP propogandists to keep myself entertained with, the high pay not matching the level of competence across the board. These are the good things. PAP also employ a lot of people that would not be employed in private sector that is good too, like Mediacorp shows that ONLY the islanders can watch. As to how cruel Singapore can be, ask <strong>Van Tuong Nguyen's family</strong> (remember him?) and Francis Seow.</p>
              <p>"When they get voted to be a good place to stay they try to find ways and means to say it is kelong and singapore is the worst place to stay."</p>
              <p>Well if Singaporeans are NOT included in the survey.</p>
              <p>"When they win youth olympics, they complain it is nothing and waste of money. When they come out with any policy they say it is the world's most stupid policy and will surely lose money"</p>
              <p>It is up to the GOVERNMENT in any part of the world to prove that any policy will NOT lose money. IF they lose money, who is willing to take the responsibility.</p>
              <p>Youth Olympics is another money-spinning exercise for the Olympics so I wont call it nothing. Just that a lot of people won't watch it. However thats the IOC's problem not Singapore's,  unlike F1 night race which has cost, safety and environmental issues.</p>
              <p>I do approve of the casinos though. Thats the MOST astute move made by the Government I am willing to admit.</p>
              <p>"When MSK escape, they say singapore gov is useless and they should have a mass resignation and tell the whole world about it."</p>
              <p>Please dont exaggerate only the minister in charge WKS. Let me also ask the question: are you happy that MSK escaped and the boss in charge of security is also scot free?</p>
              <p>"They felt tat tis is probably one of the worst place to live in and all the achievements etc r overrated."</p>
              <p>Its not the worst place to live in. In another survey, Changi Airport came in third whereas KL airport came in second kelong right?</p>
              <p><strong>To each his own.</strong></p>

              <p>it is always the policy of the law maker to catch the people who had established/supply the crime and not the people who get drawn by these crimes. The illegal gambling operator is worse than the gamblers, the person selling vcds is worse than the buyers, the person selling contraband cigerrettes is worse than the smokers, the prostitude get it worse than the customers. Similarly for drug abuse, it is the drug trafficker tat should get the heavier punishment and not the drug addict. If u remove the supply, the system collapse. As long as there is supply, there will always be demand</p>
              <p> IMO, drug addict r the victims and drug trafficker distribute poison to society for profit. Furthermore if u punish drug addict, then how to convince them to come to the authorities for help with the addict ? If u talk about morphine addicition for certain sickness such as terminal cancer, then they can get their hand on the drug through legal means.</p>

Their crime rate is notorious too and I met 3 pickpockets within 6 months there. Yeah... and napoli have a infamous mafia reputation as well as gabbage problems.

              <p>if the supply is there, they will easily convince other people to try drugs. Teenagers or troubled youth r vulnerable and peer pressure can easily make them go for drugs. Own freewill does not apply to these vulnerable people.</p>

              <p>Pollution is not about CO2 or electricity consumption. It is removing the smog and smoke from the air. Where do u based your 1% on again ? Singapore, I believe, do support protecting the environmental and is pretty vocal</p>

They are part of same demand and supply equation.  The laws should deter people from taking drugs. Or are you pro drugs?

              <p>My mistake Singapore signed the Kyoto Protocol and when there is NO emmissions target to be met as a DEVELOPING country. I tot PAP like boast that Singapore is already a developed country.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Under the Protocol, countries listed under Annex I are required to reduce the emissions of six greenhouse gases on average by 5.2 per cent below the 1990 levels during the first commitment period from 2008 to 2012.<br><br>There are no emission-reduction targets for non-Annex I countries such as Singapore. However, the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol allows industrialised countries to achieve part of their emission reduction commitments by conducting emission-reduction projects in non-Annex I countries.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So, really.. we should just stop improving already.. time to rest on her laurels.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>That.. will help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They say.. take the good with the bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree.. let's just close our eyes to the bad,... out of sight out of mind .. OK ? Good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like men.. they complain we don't appreciate the good stuff.. only know how to complain about the bad stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like men.. they don't like to be told how to do it.</p>

              <p>Lets settle the drug addicts first. The drug addicts r punished in singapore. They get to be jailed and caned if they r repeat offenders. If u think tat is not harsh enough, then do u advocate them to be hanged ?</p>
              <p>Now comes to drug trafficker. If u ask me, they deserve the death penalty. Why ? Because it is too lucrative. If someone manage to bring in a large amount over, they have enough money not to work forever. If it meant a simple 1-2 years jail, I myself will start drug trafficking and gamble by drug trafficking. If I manage to bring over once, then I can retire. Logically, it is not a stupid choice.The deterent is not enough to deter people</p>
              <p>Secondly, drug caused a lot of social problems. U can see drug addicts can become so desperate they become prostitute or commit serious crime such as robbery or murder. In fact, drugs really redefine the word "desperate". People do anything when they r desperate, even killing their family. Just because we want to be kind to traffickers who don't care about others, we r ruining innocent people life. Who do u want to protect ?</p>
