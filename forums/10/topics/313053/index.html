              <p>Make no mistake, the FTs', after making enough monies, will take flight. Only a very small minority few will stay. this whole policy rationale of having foreigners replacing Singaporeans who leave Singapore is not sustainable.</p>
              <p>Singapore remodelled itself to be attractive to the foreigners, which is different from if foreigners like Singapore for what it is.</p>

              <p><strong>[News] Singapore Dominates Asia Region as Best Place to Live</strong></p>
              <p><br> <span class="body">
              </span></p><p><strong>Expatriates continue to rank Singapore as
              the top place to live in Asia, above Hong Kong and many other cities.
              The city-state is economically strong and environmentally safe, when
              compared with many other cities in Asia. But when it comes to rights
              issues, Singapore lags behind in a number of areas. Naomi Martig
              reports on how Singapore has managed to attract its expatriate
              population, despite its restrictions on some civil liberties.</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's reputation as one of Asia's best economic performers
              continues to attract a large number of foreigners to it shores. Nearly
              one-third of its 4.6 million residents were born in other countries.</p>
              <p>The country's economy grew 7.5 percent in 2007. Its financial
              service sector is strong, its education system is considered among the
              best in the world and it is regularly ranked as a favorite among
              expatriates living in Asia.</p>
              <p>A new report by ECA International, the world's largest organization
              for international human resource professionals, says Singapore
              maintains the highest quality of life for foreigners in Asia.</p>
              <p>Lee Quane is general manager of ECA International in Hong Kong. He
              says the group's annual report compared living standards in 254
              locations, globally.</p>
              <p>"Singapore comes in as number one because of the fact, unlike other
              Asian cities where we indicate their infrastructure levels are of a
              developing status and they score quite poorly in some areas such a
              health care, such as infrastructure and such as pollution levels.
              Singapore, on the other hand, scored exceptionally well in all of these
              locations, comparable to many Western cities," said Quane.</p>
              <span class="body">Since
              the Asian financial crisis a decade ago, the city's economy has
              outperformed its rival, Hong Kong. It now holds one of the highest per
              capita gross domestic product in the world.</span><p></p>
              <p><span class="body"></span><span class="body">
              </span></p><p>Quane says another major factor that makes Singapore attractive is its very low level of social unrest.</p>
              <p>"It has very low crime rates, a complete absence of social and
              political tensions, which makes it very good location for Asian
              expatriates to reside in," added Quane.</p>
              <p>However, having an absence of social and political tensions does not
              necessarily mean Singapore is free from human rights concerns.</p>
              <p>In the ECA report, Singapore was outscored in one respect. Quane
              says, in terms of the media, cities such as Hong Kong far outranked
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>There are tight limits on freedom of expression in Singapore. In
              2007, Reporters Without Borders ranked Singapore 141st out of 167
              nations in its Worldwide Press Freedom Index. The government restricts
              public protests and censors films and television shows. And, critics of
              the government often find themselves facing tough libel lawsuits and
              other restrictions on their comments.</p>
              <p>Homayoun Alizadeh is the regional representative for the Office of
              the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights in Thailand. He
              says Singapore's effort to sustain social stability has often led to
              excessive censorship.</p>
              <p>"Last year, for example, when the World Bank had its international
              conference in Singapore, some of the Singaporean civil society
              organizations intended to carry out a demonstration, express their
              views. But, of course, they were not allowed to have these kinds of
              activities," said Alizadeh.</p>
              <p>Analysts say, for most expatriates living in Singapore, these sorts
              of rights issues are not a concern, because the problems have not yet
              reached a point where they severely affects their lives.</p>
              <p>Alizadeh says Singapore is trying to improve its rights record. For
              example, he says officials in the country were instrumental in
              establishing a human rights commission within the Association of
              Southeast Asian Nations.</p>
              <p>"Singapore played a major role, especially when the charter was
              signed in [on] 20th November 2007 in Singapore, in convincing countries
              like Burma, Myanmar, to ensure that the ASEAN Charter is signed,
              especially in regards to the provision Article 14 regarding the
              commitment of ASEAN member states to establish an ASEAN human rights
              body," continued Alizadeh.</p>
              <p>Several rights groups argue that the new human rights body does not
              do enough to address concerns in the region. But Alizadeh says
              Singapore's push to create the commission is significant, because the
              country's officials realize that making progress on human rights is key
              for long-term stability. And, the Singapore government considers
              stability as essential for building a safe and economically prosperous
              city.</p>

              <p>U.K.-headquartered
              ECA International's annual location ranking, which compares living
              standards in 254 international locations, found that Singapore is an
              ideal place for Asians to live in because of the quality of its
              infrastructure and health facilities.</p>
              <p>The city-state's low health
              risks, air pollution, crime rates and cosmopolitan population added to
              its appeal, Lee Quane, ECA International's general manager in Hong
              Kong, told The Associated Press.</p>
              <p>Quane noted, however, that while
              Singapore scored consistently well in most of the 15 categories used to
              asses each location, it saw a deterioration in some factors.</p>
              <p>"Air
              pollution in 2007 was slightly higher than 2006, primarily due to the
              haze in 2007," Quane said. Haze from forest fires in neighboring
              Indonesia has become a major problem Singapore, where air quality
              levels have worsened every year during the dry season.</p>
              <p>Sydney
              came in second, followed by Melbourne, Australia, and Kobe, Japan,
              which tied for third place in the ranking that combines data collected
              by ECA International with results of a survey of expatriates.</p>
              <p>While
              Sydney and Singapore scored similarly well in criteria such as
              pollution levels, the quality of goods and services available,
              transport and infrastructure, the Australian city's geographical
              distance from Asia made it a less favorable location than Singapore,
              Quane said.</p>
              <p>"For Sydney, Japanese or Chinese assignees will have
              to travel relatively long distances, and so it's much more difficult to
              maintain contact with family," Quane said. He added that cultural
              differences were also a factor.</p>
              <p>The fifth-best city for Asian
              expats was Copenhagen, Denmark, the survey found, followed by Canberra,
              Australia (6th), Vancouver, Canada (7th), Wellington, New Zealand
              (8th), Yokohama, Japan (9th) and Dublin, Ireland (10th).</p>
              <p>Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong and Tokyo were tied at 15th place.</p>
              <p>Hong
              Kong made improvements in personal security and healthcare
              infrastructure but air pollution was likely to remain a problem, Quane
              said.</p>
              <p>"People feel safer in Hong Kong than they have in recent
              years," he said. "But looking at the main reason why Hong Kong still
              lags behind Singapore is the issue of air pollution."</p>
              <p>Quane noted, however, that Hong Kong scored better than Singapore in one respect: the media.</p>
              <p>"In news and media, we regard Hong Kong as much more free and fair than in Singapore," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              survey showed that Baghdad, Iraq, remains the least favorable place to
              live for Asian expats, followed by Kabul, Afghanistan and Karachi,
              Pakistan, because of the high risk to personal security and lack of
              suitable facilities for expatriates.</p>
