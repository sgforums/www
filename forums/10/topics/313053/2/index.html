              <p><br>It really depends what you are comparing. If you say quality of life, qualify of air, qualify of space, then Singapore is definitely going to fare pretty bad. To be fair, since Singapore is Singapore why should we be talking about something which by default is small.</p>

              <p>Why Singapore is not the best place to live:</p>
              <p>1)  The island is too small.  Got nowhere to go on weekends.</p>
              <p>2)  The houses are small, ugly and expensive.  We own only four walls for 99 years (too bad for our grandchildren)</p>
              <p>3)  The weather is hot and humid.</p>
              <p>4)  Electricity and water bills are expensive.</p>
              <p>5)  Market is too small and competitive.  Not a starting place for entrepreneurs.  You start a business and two months your next door is your competitor.</p>
              <p>6)  Education system is outrages.  From a young age, you are streamed into clever or stupid classification.  Henceforth many late starters are doomed for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p>7)  Incompetence security forces.  Let terrorist escape via toilet.</p>
              <p>8)  Potential danger.  Escape terrorist will come back for revenge.</p>
              <p>9)  Irresponsible leader.  The person responsible for the terrorist escape, escaped himself unscratched.</p>
              <p>10)   No room for talent.  Company hires foreigners with government support, to replace even the blue collar workers.</p>
              <p>11)  The government favours the foreigner by given them free education.</p>
              <p>12)  No chewing gun.</p>
              <p>13)  Expensive cigarette.</p>
              <p>14)  Cannot smoke in the pub (it's like banning pork in a restaurant that has only 10% non-pork eating customers, since people who frequent pub tend to also smoke).  Remember few years ago the government grant pub licenses so easy and pubs mushroomed throughout the country within a short period.  Now they are making the pubs close down before they change policy and start granting new licenses again.</p>
              <p>15)..........can anyone continue......i too sad to continue........</p>

              <p>May I point out to you that it was you who told us</p>
              <p>"If you say <span style="color: #ff0000;">quality of
                                      life</span>, qualify of air, qualify of space, then Singapore is
                                      definitely going to fare pretty bad. "</p>
              <p>Yet you are tell us again that</p>
              <p>"Singapore being one of the best place to
              Live AND work."</p>
              <p>And you are not denying that quality of life does not include [Live AND work].</p>
              <p>If you are going to be so contradictory in your statements, and till now still refusing to point out to everyone your actual source of information, why are you even starting this discussion?</p>

              <p>Which other survey are you referring to?</p>
              <p>Maybe you can post a link so that we can judge for ourselves?</p>
              <p>The propaganda which the Straits Times and ChannelNewsAsia mentioned last year was the Mercer survey.</p>
              <p>In terms of sanitation and health, Singapore is ranked 50th, losing out to all the major Australian and New Zealand cities.</p>
