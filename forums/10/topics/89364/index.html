            <div class='col-md body'>Tonight's TV news reported LHL comments that he chose to touch on people issue in his inauguration speech and not policies or economic issues. He added that people already knew about government's policies.<br><br>Well said. But will he soon announce changes to old policies that cause high costs and loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>If there is no such changes to fundamentals in his administration we can only assume that he will be an extension of the past administration. That will mean more fee increases and more suffering for the lower-strata of society.<br><br>It will mean that there will be more discontent among people affected by high costs and the poor will get poorer. Is such a life worth living for most of the people who are disadvantaged?<br><br>GLCs are doing well now. Even government-protected public transport companies like Degro-Comfort are making good profits this year negativing government's assumption that they should be entitled to gradual fare adjustments to give good service.  Town councils are protected in the same way.<br><br>Isn't it time to admit there has been boo-boo in past high cost policies and put a stop to further fee increases which might lead to profiteering. It will be double standard to ask pilots to lower salaries but support Town council's high pay and high fees. What are your views dear all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
