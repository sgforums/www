            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Contribute to the cause</strong><br><br>Dear friends and supporters,<br><br>If you've been following the work that we've been doing, you will see that we've been pounding (grinding, if you prefer) away at it over the last several years.<br><br>We've been using this website, especially in the past year or so, to disseminate information and to raise awareness about the need for an open, democratic Singapore.<br><br>We have also put our words into action: organising seminars and forums as well as initiating public civil action all in the effort to push back the oppressive limits that the PAP has placed on our people.<br><br>We believe that we have made progress. Our campaign has grown and is growing. Our aim is to turn it into a veritable movement.<br><br>One worry that we have, however, is that the momentum will stall and die. We must not let that happen.<br><br>And it will without your support. No democracy movement has ever gone anywhere without the people's support.<br><br>We have hitherto resisted making a concerted effort to ask for financial support because we had wanted to build up our track record first.<br><br>Today, we have defined who we are, we've been unambiguous about what we stand for and we have a clear strategy on how we're going to succeed in making our dream of a democratic Singapore come true.<br><br>We have members and followers who are willing to persevere, go the extra mile, and take the knocks.<br><br>The next step is for us to expand our work and to make our campaign really come alive. In other words we need to more than just survive, we need to thrive.<br><br>For this to happen, we need funds - funds for advocacy work, research and training.<br><br>So if you believe in what we stand for, if you support what we are trying to achieve for Singapore, if you believe that we can make a difference in our nation's politics then please contribute to the cause.<br><br>As difficult as things are at the moment, we have never been more hopeful because we know that we stand on the right side of history.<br><br>The question is not whether change will come but rather when and how.<br><br>So please join us and contribute to the cause. You can make your contributions either by:<br><br>Directly depositing your donation into our account:<br><br>Account No: 025-006978-1<br>Bank Name: DBS<br>Address: 6 Shenton Way, Tower 2, DBS Building, Singapore 068809<br>Swift Code: DBSSSGSG<br><br>(You can make an anonymous contribution by going to the bank in person and depositing cash into the above account via a deposit slip.)<br><br>or<br><br>Sending your cheque (payable to Singapore Democratic Party) to:<br><br>Singapore Democratic Party<br>Yishun Central P.O. Box 0025<br>Singapore 917601<br><br>If you have any questions, please feel free to write to us at:<br>speakup@singaporedemocrat.org<br><br>Support the party that stands up and speaks out for you.<br><br><strong>SDP - Your Voice, Your Party</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/donations.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/donations.html</a></div>
