There is early redness of the skin in some patients; usually for 3  to  4  days  after  the  beginning  of  fever,  a  rash presents  with  small  discolored  raised  spots  or closely   aggregated   bright   red   points.   Minute hemorrhagic or purpuric spots may appear on the feet, legs, axillae, or palate at about the same time the temperature returns to normal. Patients with dark  skin  often  have  no  visible  rash.<br><br>The infectious agents are the viruses of dengue fever  (types  1,  2,  3,  and  4).  These  viruses  also cause  dengue  hemorrhagic  fever  (discussed  later).<br><br>The reservoir is either man-mosquito or monkey- mosquito,   depending   on   the   geographic   area. Dengue is endemic to tropical Asia, West Africa, parts of the Caribbean, and several countries in Central  and  South  America.<br><br><strong>The virus is transmitted to man by the bite of mosquitoes  belonging  to  the  genus  Aedes.  Mos- quitoes  acquire  the  virus  by  biting  man  and,  in some  areas,  monkeys.  The  incubation  period  is usually 5 to 6 days.<br>Patients are normally infec- tive to mosquitoes 24 hours before the onset until the fifth day of the disease.</strong><br><br></div>

Preventive  measures  require<br><br>(1)  implementing mosquito   surveys   in   affected   communities   to determine the density of vector mosquitoes, iden- tifying breeding places, and eliminating the vec- tors where practical; and<br><br>(2) making information available  to  the  public  concerning  methods  for protection  from  the  vector  mosquito  bites  such as the use of repellents, screening, and bed nets.<br><br>Management  of  patients,  contacts,  and  the nearby  environment  includes  (1) <strong> precautions  with patient  blood  by  denying  mosquitoes  access  to  the patient for at least 5 days after attack by using screens,  an  approved  residual  insecticide,  or  by the use of bed nets; and </strong><br><br>(2) investigation of a case including the place of residence at the time of in- fection (3 to 15 days prior to the onset) and search for unreported or undiagnosed cases. There is no requirement  for  quarantine  or  immunization.<br><br>Epidemic measures, when necessary, include<br>(1)   surveying,   locating,   and   eliminating   all manmade  Aedes  mosquito  breeding  places;<br>(2)  en- couraging   all   persons   who   are   occupationally exposed  to  the  vectors  to  use  repellents;  and<br>(3) air dispersal of approved insecticides to stop epidemics. International measures require strict enforce- ment  of  all  existing  international  agreements designated to prevent the spread of this disease by  man,  monkey,  and  mosquitoes  via  ships, airplanes, and land transportation from endemic areas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Current fogging practices ineffective in killing the Aedes mosquitoes<br>SINGAPORE : In the war against dengue, current fogging practices may be ineffective in killing the Aedes mosquitoes.<br><br>The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised that fogging at dawn is most effective.<br><br>But according to the Singapore Pest Management Association, most fogging here is carried out after 10am or in the afternoons when most Singaporeans are at work and away from their homes.<br><br>Mosquitoes may be killed when they come into contact with the fogging fumes but fogging done during these times is not very effective for several reasons.<br><br>One, ambient temperature is higher in the day and hot air causes the fumes to dissipate faster.<br><br>Two, more air drafts in the day carry the fumes away from intended target areas.<br><br>"You can actually fog anytime during the day because the Aedes mosquitoes are active during the day time and they bite throughout the day. But of course, peak biting is during dawn and dusk. So, it is more beneficial to fog during these periods because you have a bigger abundance of mosquitoes around," explained Christina Liew, a medical entomologist at the National Environment Agency (NEA).<br><br><strong>So is fogging as it is currently done just a smokescreen?</strong><br><br>"The end user insists that fogging be done because he is being harassed by mosquitoes. So when he sees that there is lots of smoke going on, he is happy that something is being done.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pest company knows it is ineffective doing it. I have heard stories. Some just add kerosene to water so that when you fog, you still get white smoke coming out. In fact, it's all for show, "</span> said G. Surajan, president of Singapore Pest Management Association.<br><br>Responding to Channel NewsAsia's query, NEA says it does not know of any pest control companies which have been adding kerosene to water. And it will take action against any who has done so.<br><br>So why don't pest companies carry out fogging at dawn or dusk?<br><br>They say cost is an issue. Pest companies have to pay their workers one and a half times more in overtime pay if fogging is done outside the standard nine to five work day.<br><br>And most town councils, private condominiums and construction companies will only award fogging contracts to the lowest bidder.<br><br>There is another reason why fogging is done when the sun is high - pest management companies say Singaporeans complain of noise pollution from fogging at dawn.<br><br>Biologists have also warned that fogging, if conducted at sub-lethal dosages, will cause mosquitoes to develop resistance to the pesticides used.<br><br>But it is not known if all fogging carried out here is at the appropriate lethal dosages.<br><br>- CNA /ls<br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stor.../164775/1/.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Permethrin is used to kill pest in-sects in agriculture, home pest control, forestry, and in public health programs, including head lice control. It was first marketed in 1973. Worldwide, the dominant use of permethrin is on cotton, accounting for about 60 percent (by weight) of the permethrin used.1 In the U.S., al-most 70 percent of the permethrin used in agriculture is used on corn, wheat, and alfalfa.2 Over 100 million applications of permethrin are made each year in U.S. homes, and over 18 million applications are made in yards and gardens.3<br>Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid. Like most members of this family of insecticides, it has four isomers, molecules made up of the same atoms with different three-dimensional structures. (See Figure 1)<br><br>Mode of Action<br>Permethrin, like all synthetic pyrethroids, kills insects by strongly exciting their nervous systems. Permethrin makes the nervous system hypersensitive to stimuli from sense organs. Rather than sending a single impulse in response to a stimulus, permethrin-exposed nerves send a train of impulses. This excitation occurs because permethrin blocks the movement of sodium ions from outside to inside of the nerve cells. PermethrinÂ’s mode of action is similar to that of the organochlorine insecticide DDT.5<br><br>Acute Lethal Dose<br>PermethrinÂ’s LD50 (the amount of permethrin that kills 50 percent of a population of test animals) is variable. In a summary of nine oral LD50 tests using rats, the LD50 varied from 430 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) to over 4,000 mg/kg. Some of this variability occurs because the proportions of isomers in the test materials vary. The cis isomers are about ten times more toxic than the transisomers.6<br><br>Neurotoxicity<br>In mammals, permethrin has complex effects on the nervous system. As in insects, it causes repetitive nerve impulses. It also inhibits a variety of nervous system enzymes: ATPase, whose inhibition results in increased release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine 7; monoamine oxidase-A, the enzyme which maintains normal levels of three other neurotransmitters 8; and acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.9 (Two large families of insecticides, the organophosphates and the carbamates, are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.) In addition, permethrin inhibits a nervous system receptor, the GABAA receptor, producing excitability and convulsions.10 Finally, permethrin inhibits respiration (the process by which cells use sugars as an energy source) in a manner similar to other neurotoxic drugs.11 It is therefore not surprising that permethrin causes a wide variety of neurotoxic symptoms.<br>At relatively high doses, these neuro-toxic symptoms of permethrin include tremors, incoordination, hyperactivity, paralysis, and an increase in body temperature. These symptoms can persist up to three days.12 Other behavioral effects have been observed at lower doses. For example, sublethal exposure of mice to the permethrin-containing insecticide Ambush increased activities like chewing 13 ; sublethal exposure of rats to permethrin increased aggressive behavior, agitation, and resistance to being captured 14 ; and permethrin disrupted a learned feeding behavior in rats at doses of about 20 percent of the LD50. 15<br><br>Eye and Skin Irritation<br>Permethrin-containing products can be irritating to both eyes and skin. For example, the agricultural insecticide Pounce 3.2 EC Â“causes moderate eye irritation.Â”16 Ortho Total Flea Control 2 and Solaris Flea-B-Gon Total Flea Killer Indoor Fogger both cause Â“tearing, swelling, and blurred vision.Â”17,18 They also cause Â“redness, swelling, and possibly blisteringÂ” of the skin.17,18 Adams 14 Day Flea Dip Â“causes eye injuryÂ”19 and Â“may cause al-allergic reactionsÂ”19 on skin.<br><br>Effects on the Immune System<br>Experiments with laboratory animals indicate that the immune system (used by living things to defend themselves from disease) Â“appears to be a sensitive target for permethrin activity.Â” Ingestion of permethrin reduces the ability of immune system cells called T-lymphocytes to recognize and respond to foreign proteins. Doses equivalent to 1/100 of the LD50 , inhibited T-lymphocytes over 40 percent. Permethrin ingestion also reduced the activity of a second type of immune system cell, natural killer cells, by about 40 percent.20(See Figure 2.) In tests using mouse cell cultures, permethrin had similar effects on the immune system, inhibition of two kinds of lymphocytes.21 Researchers concluded that Â“the immune system is exquisitely sensitive Â… at exposure levels that cause no overt toxicity.Â”20<br><br>Effects on Reproduction<br>Permethrin affects both male and female reproductive systems. It binds to receptors for androgen, a male sex hormone, in skin cells from human males, causing researchers to Â“advise protection from any form of contact or ingestion of the pyrethroids.Â” 22 Permethrin also binds to a different receptor, called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, that stimulates production of the male sex hormone testosterone.23 In addition, permethrin caused reduced testes weights in a long-term feeding study of mice.24 In females, permethrin exposure has caused embryo loss in pregnant rabbits24 and in pregnant rats.25<br><br>Mutagenicity<br>Permethrin was mutagenic (damaging to genetic material) in three tests with human cell cultures, one with hamster cells, and one with fruit fly larvae. In cultures of human lymphocytes (white blood cells), permethrin exposure caused an increase in chromosome aberrations, chromosome fragments,26 and DNA lesions.27 In hamster ovary cell cultures, permethrin exposure caused chromosome aberrations.28 Exposure to Ambush (a permethrin-containing insecticide) during larval development increased sex-linked lethal mutations in fruit flies.29<br><br>Carcinogenicity<br>According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), permethrin is a possible human carcinogen (chemical that causes cancer).30 EPA found that permethrin increased the frequency of lung tumors in female mice, and increased the frequency of liver tumors in male and female mice.24 The World Health Organization reports that permethrin increased the frequency of lung tumors in females in two out of the three mouse studies it reviewed. (See Figure 3.) Lung tumors increased with increasing permethrin exposure in the third study, but the increase was not statistically significant.31<br>There are no publicly available studies of the carcinogenicity of permethrin-containing insecticide products.<br>There are two molecular mechanisms which could explain permethrinÂ’s carcinogenicity. First, permethrin reduces the activity of an enzyme involved in the breakdown of the amino acid tryptophan. This can lead to the buildup of carcinogenic tryptophan breakdown products.32 Second, permethrin inhibits what is called Â“gap junctional intercellular communicationÂ” (GJIC), chemical communication between cells. GJIC plays an important role in the growth of cells, and some cancer promoting chemicals inhibit GJIC.33<br><br>Other Chronic Effects<br>The liver is a sensitive target for permethrin effects. When EPA summarized 17 medium- and long-term laboratory studies that exposed rats, mice, and dogs to permethrin, effects on the liver were noted at the Â“lowest effect levelÂ” in all of them.24 Other chronic effects in laboratory tests include enlarged adrenal glands at all doses tested in a rabbit feeding study, and increased kidney weights at all doses tested in a rat feeding study.24<br></div>
