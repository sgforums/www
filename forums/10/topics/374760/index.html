              <p><strong>Most people in China and Taiwan might think they know what
              happened after the long and bloody civil war between the Chinese
              Nationalist Party and the Communist Party ended in 1949.</strong></p>
              <p>But
              recently declassified government archives have revealed a previously
              unknown secretive plan by Taiwan's late President Chiang Kai-shek to
              take back mainland China.</p>
              <p>Chiang and his troops had fled to
              Taiwan after losing the war to the Communists but, despite great
              obstacles, he was obsessed with the idea of taking back the land he had
              lost.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>According to these newly-revealed government documents,
              by the 1960s Chiang thought the time was right to launch a
              counter-attack, given the devastating famine Mao Zedong's leadership
              had unleashed and the possibility China would soon have a nuclear
              weapon. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The US was fighting the Vietnam War then, and Chiang
              knew he needed US military assistance if he were to succeed so he
              offered to help the Americans fight the war in Vietnam in exchange for
              US support.</p>
              <p>Washington objected to Chiang's suggestions, but Chiang went ahead with his preparations anyway.</p>
              <p><strong>Top secret</strong></p>
              <p>The
              declassified information - photocopies of which went on public display
              in Taiwan for the first time in May - show that Chiang's planned
              offensive, called the Guo Guang [National Glory] Project, involved 26
              operations including land invasions, special operations behind enemy
              lines and raids against the enemy.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chiang also instructed his son Chiang Ching-kuo to come up with a
              plan to launch an airborne attack on southern China's Fujian and
              Guangdong provinces. </strong></span></p>
              <p>All of this was top secret at the time.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In
              1965, the plans were ready. Soldiers and officers drew up their wills,
              while the top brass were trying to choose the most suitable "D-Day" to
              deploy their troops, according to the archives. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But Beijing had
              discovered the plan.</strong></span> On 6 August 1965, two Taiwanese naval vessels
              assigned to transport troops on a reconnaissance mission were sunk by
              Communist forces. About 200 soldiers were killed.</p>
              <p>In November
              the same year, another vessel sent to drop off supplies for soldiers
              stationed on one of Taiwan's outlying islands was hit by Communist
              torpedoes, killing some 90 soldiers.</p>
              <p>The heavy loss of life
              surprised Chiang Kai-shek. He then realised China had significantly
              improved its naval capability. Chiang was forced to scale back and
              eventually abandon his plan.</p>
              <p>But according to Gen Huang
              Chih-chung, who was an army colonel at the time and was part of the
              planning process, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chiang never completely gave up the desire to take
              back China. </strong></span></p>
              <p>"Even when he died, he was still hoping the
              international situation would change and that the Communists would be
              wiped out one day."</p>
              <p><strong>Shift in focus</strong></p>
              <p>The failure of Chiang's plan changed the course of Chinese and Taiwanese history.</p>
              <p>The
              Taiwanese "shifted the focus to modernising and defending Taiwan
              instead of preparing Taiwan to take back China," said Andrew Yang, a
              political scientist specialising in Taiwan-China relations at the
              Taipei-based Council of Advanced Policy Studies.</p>

              <p>Chiang's son, who later succeeded him as president, focused on maintaining peace between the mainland and Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Details
              of this chapter in history were kept secret for 44 years, and were only
              revealed when the tourism department in Taoyuan County managed to
              convince the ministry of national defence and the national library to
              give it access to the archives.</p>
              <p>"There were 26 planned
              operations, but the department of defence only kept documents on 10 of
              them. The others were all destroyed," said Hsieh Shyang-ling, a
              spokeswoman for the Taoyuan tourism department.</p>
              <p>"Chiang Kai-shek didn't want people to know. What we have access to are only some of the documents."</p>
              <p>It remains unclear how many soldiers died in the preparations leading up to the plan that was never actually carried out.</p>
              <p>"To this day, some of their families might not even know how they died," Andrew Yang said.</p>

              <p>The documents are now displayed in what was once a secret command
              centre in the scenic mountains of Taoyuan, which the tourism department
              opened to the public for the first time in May.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of tourists visit the area each day, including some Chinese tourists.</p>
              <p>"We
              feel that since this history existed, we should not hide it. We want to
              tell people there was this part of history," Ms Hsieh said.</p>
              <p>The now elderly Gen Huang said he hoped lessons could be learned from history.</p>
              <p>"Relations
              between Taiwan and China have totally changed now. I hope it will
              develop peacefully," he said. "There's no need for war."</p>

              <p><strong>Montgomery:</strong> Do you agree with the talk between me and Zhou Enlai on the several principles that the United States should abide by? That is, first, the United States should recognize that Taiwan is part of China; second, the United States should withdraw from Taiwan; third, the Taiwan question should be negotiated between China and Chiang Kai-shek.<br><br><strong>Mao:</strong> I know and I agree. We do not want to solve problems with the United States by means of war,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but it is different with Chiang Kai-shek.

We have to wait and see if the statement is reliable or hypothetical. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But Chiang Kai-shek has not made such a statement and he objects to negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party, whereas we long ago expressed our desire to solve problems through negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek.</span><br><strong><br>Montgomery:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you know Chiang Kai-shek?</span><br><br><strong>Mao:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He is my old friend. How could I fail to know him? Chiang Kai-shek came into power with help from us. Before he came into power, we had had contacts with Sun Yat-sen.</span><br><br><strong>Montgomery:</strong> Chairman Mao and Chiang Kai-shek cooperated during the resistance against Japan, didn't you?</p>
              <p><strong>Mao:</strong> We cooperated for eight years in fighting the Japanese. Later he cooperated with the United States to fight us.</p>
              <p>In the past, Britain and Japan were in an alliance to deal with Tsarist Russia. At that time the Far East was yours and China was mainly under your spheres of influence. When did it change? The change started in the First World War. After the Second World War, Britain was not able to influence Japan, which went under the influence of the United States. Britain and the United States have a gentleman's agreement to let China be under the sphere of influence of the United States. Mrs. Cripps informed me of this when she visited Yan'an. She said that Britain did not have a say on China issues. From then on, the Chinese people got rid of their hatred of Britain and turned the hatred toward the United States. After Japan's surrender, the United States had 90,000 troops in China.</p>
