              <p>Hi  Friends,</p>
              <p>Singapore is a sunny island. Looking at this land from the sky, you see roof of apartments or flats and office buildings.</p>
              <p>In opposition wards like Potong Pasir, there are some small implementations of solar-powered lamp-posts.</p>
              <p>Why stop there?</p>
              <p>I urge WP to champion the implementation of solar panels on all ROOF TOPs of HDB flats.</p>
              <p>This power is channelled back to the grid.</p>
              <p>Imagine whole island is covered by solar panels the amount of free electricity that can be produced. It will be astonishing! believe me.</p>
              <p>I know some can say that solar panels are expensive. Not as before. Take into consideration the economies of scale, even less expensive. Take into consideration the minimum maintenance required for the panels,  you will start to get the picture. Consider how long these panels can last, your eyes and minds shall begin to open up.  Expensive? What is expensive?  Going green, what is expensive? Longterm view, what is expensive? Waste of solar energy, is that not a HUGE WASTE? which is worse?</p>
              <p>I hope the WP champion this and make it their contribution to singapore.</p>
              <p>Do the needful. Do the right thing.</p>
              <p>Go for the green vote.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p><br>That is taking too long. Solar panel is a matured technology.</p>
              <p>What are they waiting for?</p>
              <p>Privatisation of something?</p>
              <p>WP should be the catalyst to speed things up.</p>
              <p>Both are working for the people.</p>
              <p>WP can speed things up. WP should demand the reason for the non implementation on the roofs.  Solar panels existed since decades ago.</p>
              <p>HDBs are somehow priced very high even though its a leased living space. Solar panels for the roof of a block of flat is cheap compared to the price of a block of flats. You can even say its free.</p>
              <p>I am not surprised this is being considered.</p>
              <p>Considering is one thing. Doing it and successful realisation of it is another completely.</p>
              <p>WP has a great opportunity to contribute to society in this aspect.</p>
              <p>Act now WP!</p>

              <p>You know solar panels technology how expensive and terribly inefficient a not, till it is not very economically feasible to implement it on a large scale.</p>
              <p>The plan is to research into ways to fabricate it cheaply and make it more efficient. And the future vision is to have solar trees too, not only just placing on top of roofs.</p>

              <p>i did a simple research (2-3k words) on this last year for my sec 4 research work. singapore's sunlight is not A LOT like what most people think, due to frequent cloudy/rainy days. in fact if i remember correctly singapore gets less sunshine (as in light intensity/energy) in a year compared to perth.</p>
              <p>then there is also the rooftop area on hdb blocks. it isn't very significant, i used google maps to estimate the area lol. water tanks take up quite a large area already on the smaller blocks. plus the fact that you cannot fully cover area available (for maintenance), you would be lucky to cover 50% of rooftop area. moreover, this amount of solar panels would only power a few average size flats for each block. compared to the rest of the block + energy consumed outside residential areas, it might be significant in absolute numbers, but quite insignificant relatively.</p>
              <p>by numbers i found around the net, solar panels also take about 15 years average to pay off. you might be earning so to speak after the 15 year period, but it can be view as quite a long term investment.</p>
              <p>i emphasise again that my research was more of clobbing numbers available in a logical way, there was minimal primary research. large assumptions were made, but the main gist i got from it was that solar panels on hdb blocks is not as great an idea as most people would think it is. there is a reason why solar power plants cover large amounts of land, land that would be hard to find in singapore</p>

              <p>think of the potential bird shit the gahmen have to clean up, literally.</p>
              <p>every piece of bird shit effectively reduce the efficiency of the solar panels. not really realistic.</p>
              <p>yeah, you will save on ur power bill, but ur conservancy charges will also be upped, since they now have to send cleaners up to the roof everyday to clean the panels.</p>

              <p>Guten Tag, you should have started this thread earlier mah, because if WP start to bring up this topic now, I am sure PAP will say that you are already a few years too late.</p>

              <p>solar panel today need not only be those panel on roof top.</p>
              <p>those solar film stick on window glass, now they only repl sun-light into building,</p>
              <p>new technology is they esbort the sun-light, filter light into building, instate of repl away others lights, they work like solar panel on roof top.</p>
              <p>so now is start sticking these solar film that work like solar panel.</p>
              <p>even car can be solar energy, just stick the new techology solar film that work like solar panel.</p>
              <p>and with more battery now running on Lithum ion, those Metal hi diut will be history.Ni-Cd or Ni-MH will be history.</p>
              <p>and with more polymer Lithum ion, battery will be lighter, compare to now liquid Lithum ion.</p>
