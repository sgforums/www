            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">SM: Why Govt stepped in to boost retirement nest-egg  </span><br><br>By Keith Lin<br><br>THE Government will continue to take a paternal approach in safeguarding Singaporeans' retirement needs, said Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>Social safety nets such as the Central Provident Fund system are necessary as there remains a sizeable number of people who cannot be trusted to handle their finances, he added.<br><br>'We come across friends and relatives who cannot keep money. The moment they have some, they want to spend the money...on a restaurant or gambling den or whatever there is,' Mr Goh said.<br><br>Speaking to about 200 grassroots leaders at the Braddell Heights Community Club yesterday, he acknowledged that some of the recent changes to the CPF system may not sit well with some Singaporeans.<br><br>Would a more hands-off approach to securing people's retirement nest-eggs work, he asked, citing Hong Kong: 'If you don't have the funds, can't be helped. We'll just make sure you have enough to get by and put you in a poor folks' home.'<br><br>Rather than watch many elderly suffer in poverty, Singapore's approach is to do more to help those in need so that 'no one will be left behind', Mr Goh said in his opening remarks.<br><br>The almost two-hour-long session on announcements made during the National Day Rally earlier this month was held behind closed doors.<br><br>Later, Mr Seah Kian Peng, MP for the Braddell Heights ward in the Marine Parade GRC, told reporters about some of the main issues raised. The CPF changes were one of them.<br><br>Why was there the need for a compulsory annuities scheme for those aged under 50, asked one of the 20 participants who spoke up.<br><br>SM Goh's response was that many would opt out if the scheme was not mandatory and those who remained behind would have to grapple with a higher premium.<br><br>Another participant felt that the Government had allowed too much of Singaporeans' CPF savings to be used to buy property, leading to many now being caught in an asset-rich, cash-poor scenario.<br>The various schemes introduced recently, such as the buy-back scheme, will allow Singaporeans to unlock the value of their properties, Mr Seah quoted SM Goh as saying.<br><br></div>
