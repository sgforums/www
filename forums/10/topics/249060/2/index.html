Not because she is pretty and charming but because she has the heart.<br><br>She has the heart to speak up despite running the risk of being ticked off by her party elders.<br><br>But apart from her too many of her fellow PAP MPs are too afraid to speak as they should on the ministers' salary benchmarking issue.<br><br>One however is not enough. May be we need at least twenty who could match Inderjit Singh or Dr. Tan Cheng Bok or Tan Soo Khoon.<br><br>She probably was one of a handful allowed to be chosen because there is no choice otherwise the whole parliament may become a total charade and a total switch off for Singaporeans.<br><br>The rest were just waiting to get favors from supporting their supreme leaders as otherwise they do not stand a chance for promotion to million-dollar parliamentary secretary or junior ministers.<br><br>Our leaders have yet to learn from Deng Xiao Peng who is prepared to take a back seat and let the younger leaders really take over and run the country with collective leadership and teamwork.<br><br>Deng has left behind an enduring legacy which is now helping China to surge ahead where leaders truly support capable ministers without power play and people and government are working as one to overcome many problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was at Orchard last weekend thinking it is now the Great singapore sale, probably I can get good discount on my shopping list.<br><br>I went to Paragon, there was a sports shop on one of the upper levels. I wanted to get a can of tennis balls. And the shop had a big sign saying 20% discount store wide. So i ask the Prime sales person, is the stated tag price before or after discount? she says BEFORE. Afterwards as I was paying for the item at the cashier, the Prime sales ask the Senior sales person, is the stated price before or after discount, the senior sales said its AFTER. I ask him, is he sure? He said yes, and just to enforce that the indicated tag price HAS BEEN discounted, he ask his Mentor sales person, forcefully says, this price indicated is AFTER discount right! The Mentor sales guy says yes, AFTER.<br>Smelling a rat, I decided not to buy from them.<br><br>Another day later, I went to CCK and they had the same chain sports store there there and the same similar can of tennis ball on sale and the price indicated was 20% cheaper than what I saw in paragon.<br><br>Absolute power is equal to corruption.</div>
