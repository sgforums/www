            <div class='col-md body'>Becoz our country is "cheap",our ministers is "cheapskate",thats y our citizenship(including PR) is so easy to get.But anyway,those foreign workers who migrate to Singapore as PR dont really treasure the citizenship.They use it as an easy tools to work in here,after earning enough money,they will withdraw their "lumpsum working money" n return to their country n enjoy.<br>While others treat this country as a "springboard" to migrate to other western countries like Australia n U.S.No one really give a damn about this "tiny little island".Not to mention about our "narrow-minded" ministers.Even Singaporeans are trying to get out of this god damn place,not to mention PR.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how easy is your easy??<br>as Manager433 said, some ppl spent yrs here but still cant get PR.<br>u can check out the ICA(former known as SIR) website to see what is required to obtaion PR in singapore.<br>Sg govt only accpet wat they want, that's why for some ppl it's easy to get PR, some is difficult of even impossible.<br><br>one type of ppl sg govt accpet is damn rich ppl who invest big money here, real big money. They get PR as long as they are willing to invest here, that will create job vacancies here and pay tax to sg govt.<br><br>another type is young talent. Foreign teens who get into our Poly, once they graduate and get dipolma, they get thier PR.<br><br>And old talents also, but harder than young talents, ppl who have long working experience in certain trade and have very professional skill also got thier chance to obtain PR, as long as they are willing to work here, which means somehow or rather sg ppl will learn such skill from them.<br><br>For foreign labour without special skills or certs, they only get work permit/employment pass in sg, it's very hard for them to get PR even they work here for very long.</div>

Then he seek help from his GRC(i think that area is ChongPang), the GRC get to know the situation and agree to write a letter for him to go along with the application forms. That piece of paper with the GRC's signature really helps, he got the PR for his China wife after that. Seems like Sg govt dun worry about these ladies as long as someone here can support her financially so that she wont become illegal prostitute in geylang.<br><br>For guys, i dun think sg govt accept a china guy who dun speak english, no special skills(sg imports china and other countries' sports talent), no cert, no money, no working experience, etc.... foreign guys must have something that the sg govt in order to get PR.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i knew a storeman during my NS days, recent immigrant from<br>PRC, poor bugger barely knew his ABCs, got bullied left right centre of course .... but fact remains ... how did he got his PR in the first place ? ....<br><br>what some in preceeding replies said is correct .... lots of immigrants treat Singapore as a stepping stone, a case of "didn't get a fish, will settle for a shrimp" kind of thinking .... anyone remember the case in the papers sometime ago when some PRC fellows conned their fellow countrymen with a bogus agency promising australian PR status ? ... what one woman said still stays with me ... "I would never have given up my Singaporean PR status if i had know that this was a scam " (paraphrased) ...... but the underlying fact is that these people, migrants from first world or third, are economic migrants .... people who have placed their economic well-being above any tugs of the heart-strings they might have felt about their motherland, so what do you expect ? .... that they'll fight and die for singapore ? ..... if a better opportunity presents itself to them, or the grass stops "growing" in singapore ... of course they'll scram from the place .....<br><br>having said that ... there will be a few who have decided to sink their roots into singapore .... we musn't discount these people ... our forefathers were immigrants themselves too, remember .... which i why i felt a certain empathy towards that storeman .... and tried to help him when i could .... serving NS shows he's willing to take up a stake in the security of our country ...<br><br>and for those singaporeans thinking of quitting .... surprise ! ... you realise that you too, would become economic migrants once you run off to australia, US or whatever ..... believe me .... I'm currently studying in Canada .... and my canadian friends here too, have conversations similar to this thread here ... lots of them are weary of the waves of economic refugees and immigrants that hit Canada's shores every year ... taxing the society's infrastructure and clustering among themselves .... creating ethnic ghettos ..... and feel more affinity towards their home countries than canada ? ... (during the tsunami crisis, the canadian indian community was very vociferous in criticizing the canadian goverment's response to the crisis ... how would we feel if say, recent malaysian immigrants badger the goverment to help out with the haze situation in malaysia right now ? ..... ) Canadians are generally nice and politically correct ... so no one will publicly voice such things out for fear of being labelled a racist ... (a common weapon of certain groups of minorities over here .... i shall not mention which ones .... scream racism everytime something doesn't go their way ...) but when the beer flows in a pub and the tongues loosen up .... this is how they feel about immigrants .....<br><br>bottomline ... no one, in any society, wants people who just leaches off it .... be they native born or migrants ...(would be quitters take note ! ... ) that is my stand too, with regards to immigrants ..... come ! stay ! ... sink your roots here .... take up a stake in our society ... make this your country ...... you're more than welcome .....<br><br>but if you just treat Singapore as a transitory place ... then kindly bugger off asap ........</div>
