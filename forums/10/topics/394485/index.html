              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>GRC deprives Singaporeans of the true representation in the parliament.</strong> <strong>Even if near 40% of the Singaporeans vote for the opposition, PAP still gets 95% of the seats </strong>in the parliament as seen in the <a href="http://www.singapore-elections.com/parl-1991-ge/seats.html">1991 elections</a>, <strong>a gross anomaly by any standards. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Come next round of elections, chop the near win opposition GRCs into three pieces and give out money and upgrading to win votes and use the state controlled media -the only source of information at that time, to sing praises everday.Oh bankrupt a few opposition politicians along the way too...<br></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Don't complain - find the candidates</h1>
              <p>   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MR TAN Hong Ngan has advocated a ban on walkovers in the General Election ('General election: Ban walkovers'; Tuesday).</p>
              <p>His
                      rationale is that walkovers have deprived many Singaporeans of their
                      basic human right to vote. He blames the group representation
                      constituency (GRC) system for creating this situation because it
                      disadvantages the opposition in terms of resources and credible
                      candidates.</p>
              <p>The GRC system is not the reason for
                      the lack of opposition. As Mr Tan acknowledges, walkovers occur because
                      of the opposition's 'lack of resources and credible candidates'.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Suppose
                      all 84 constituencies were single seats. Would the opposition have the
                      resources and credible candidates to contest all wards? If yes, then
                      they should also be able to raise the required number to fight in GRC
                      wards. After all, the sum total of elected Members of Parliament is
                      still 84. If no, do not use the GRC system as an excuse.</strong></em></p>
              <p>Second,
                      voters decide who they wish to pick in a General Election. Parties do
                      not get into Parliament on their own volition. It is unlike sports like
                      football, where the players decide the outcome of a match, not the
                      spectators.</p>
              <p><strong>Thus, even if the People's Action Party (PAP) holds the advantage, it can still lose it if voters so wish.</strong></p>
              <p>Conversely,
                      no matter how rough the playing field, the opposition can still win if
                      the people feel they have had enough of the PAP.</p>
              <p>In
                      1959, when the PAP contested the General Election for Singapore's first
                      fully elected self-government, the ground was rough for the party.</p>
              <p>The
                      ruling British were not enamoured with it, imprisoning many stalwarts
                      such as C.V. Devan Nair, Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan. The PAP
                      also had to contend with the communists and the communalists.</p>
              <p>Yet
                      the party won, and by a landslide, too. As then secretary-general Lee
                      Kuan Yew declared immediately after the results were announced: 'The
                      verdict of the people is a terrifying thing.'</p>
              <p>Today's
                      playing field is also rough for the opposition. But instead of
                      complaining about the GRC system, it should focus on finding able
                      candidates to match those of the PAP.</p>
