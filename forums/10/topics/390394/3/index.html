              <p>Upgrading of skills is an individual preference, agree that it dun really guarantee you a better paid job or more so, a job to work on, however it is a self enrichment of knowledge expansion and education. It will rejuvenate your brain cells and make you more lively in learning new things and absorbing new knowledge.</p>
              <p>Tho it may not land you in a job, but it certainly give you an edge over others, and also it help to improve your intellectual soul to embrace longlife learning, re learning and re skilling. Singapore govt is good enuf to encourage peoples to go upgrading by providing various forms of institutions and sponsorships, we as citizens, should be glad that our govt is helping us to upgrade, unlike our surrounding countries, where got??</p>

              <p>The way he wrote his article (on how 'foreign talent' is cheaper than locals) doesn't sound like what you are telling me (4/120)</p>
              <p>In addition, if the above is true, that there are only 4 foreigners, how many PRs are in the 116?</p>
              <p>I actually know of an actual case of how he treated his employee. He hired a lady, made use of her skill to setup a new type of class, and then forced her to leave. As far as I hear, it's coz of costs (again)</p>

              <p>No doubt at all, Since all Assholx are of different kind, you will expect different type of characters in a capitialised industrial, managers who rule thru their authority are not true leader, because leader rule thru their influences and examples.</p>
              <p>A manager who uses hidden agenda to chop his peoples inorder to reach his target and goal just to satisfy his bosses, will not last long. If he keeps playing with his staffs, no sooner, he will face a backlash thru a low morale workforce, high turnover, no team work, poor quality, and a negative productivity. A good manager will manage in a way to boost his staffs morale, take care of them so that they can help him to reach his goal, and in a long run, the organisation will gain from high productivity, good quality and good profits.</p>

              <p>Back to the topic,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think we all have to be true to ourselves, maybe you all may argue over certain policies that govt implemented is not up to you liking, but for upgrading and education, our govt is very good in it, for this you all have to agree, as i said above, the primary objective of upgrading and education is for self gaining, whether you get a good paid job is secondary. But definitely, with a better equipped cert and skill, you will be more confident in your job and excel on it.</p>
              <p>Education also bring about a more stable and gracious society, I have no doubt that whoever as govt, if they fail to upgrade and educate it peoples, the society will be a mess and the economy will be a total diseaster. For once, we should praise PAP for trying to educate, re-educate, upgrade and reskilling us.</p>

              <p>Nah, din think you were defending him in the first place, just some questions raised.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my stand is simple. Businesses in Singapore are immature as well, tending to focus almost 100% on costs, and nothing else. That's a reason why so many businesses still stay the way they are - small and insignificant. It all boils down to our govt mentality, cheap and good (good secondary)</p>
              <p>Anyway, improvements should be done on one's own true freedom (the freedom to choose to upgrade, or not to upgrade), and not be forced to do it because of a rice bowl. If one is forced, there is really no point (the person is not truly upgrading becoz he/she wants to, therefore he/she will not fully absorb the knowledge)</p>
