            <div class='col-md body'>Myanmar generals cannot survive indefinitely, says MM<br><br>MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew believes Myanmar's ruling generals, whom he described as being rather 'dumb' when it comes to managing the country's economy, will not be able to survive indefinitely.<br><br>But he says the army must be part of the solution to the problems facing their country, because if it is dissolved, all of Myanmar's administrative instruments will go with it, and the country will have nothing with which to govern itself.<br><br>Mr Lee made these points during a wide-ranging interview at his office in the Istana on Sept 27 with syndicated columnist Tom Plate of the University of California's Los Angeles Media Centre, and new-media expert Jeffrey Cole of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Centre.<br><br>Mr Lee said: 'These are rather dumb generals when it comes to the economy...How they can so mismanage the economy and reach this stage when the country has so many natural resources?'<br><br>He noted that Singapore hoteliers, who had sunk millions of dollars in Myanmar on his advice, have now found their hotels empty.<br><br>Mr Lee disclosed that he has tried to advise the generals to take Myanmar out of its isolation, referring specifically to former junta member Khin Nyunt, who is now under house arrest.<br><br>MM Lee said: 'He's the most intelligent of the lot. I sold him the idea, or at least he bought the idea, that the way for them to go forward was to get out of uniform, and do it like Suharto, form a party, Golkar, and then take over as a civilian party.<br><br>'But halfway through, Suharto fell. So, it ended up as the wrong advice, they backtracked. Then they chucked Khin Nyunt out.'<br><br>Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, as prime minister and head of military intelligence, was once part of a troika in the military junta, but apparently fell out with current regime chief Senior General Than Shwe, and was stripped of his posts after a purge in 2004.<br><br>The following year, then aged 64, he was sentenced to 44 years of house arrest on charges including corruption and bribery.<br><br>Mr Lee said he could not understand how the generals could believe they could let Myanmar remain isolated from the world indefinitely, noting that even medicines were being smuggled from Thailand.<br><br>He said: 'We will see how it is, but whatever it is, I do not believe that they can survive indefinitely.'<br><br>The Minister Mentor also decried recent excesses by the junta, saying they must have pushed 'a hungry and impoverished' people to revolt.<br><br>These excesses included moving to an entirely new administrative capital, Naypyidaw, complete with expensive buildings for military leaders and a golf course.<br><br>He also referred to the lavish wedding of Gen Than Shwe's daughter, a video of which was smuggled out of the country to be shown on YouTube on the Internet.<br><br>The video showed his daughter wearing a collection of diamond-encrusted jewellery and extravagant clothing - lit up 'like a Christmas tree', as Mr Lee put it.<br><br>Gen Than Shwe's daughter and her husband also received gifts reportedly worth more than US$50 million (S$73.6 million).<br><br>Asked if China could nudge Myanmar out of its isolation, Mr Lee said he was not sure if Beijing had that power. He said: 'They've tried and, in fact, we have tried to talk them out of isolation.'<br><br>During the interview, Mr Lee was also asked to comment on a wide range of other issues, including US-China ties, US presidential elections, the changing media in the age of the Internet, Singapore's long-term prospects and other regional issues.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_165519.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_165519.html</a></div>

During the IMF meetings he also test water liao, in the end Malaysia paiseh. Judging from past experiences though, first Keris will be waved today. Thereafter, other members of UMNO must KPKB for the next whole week and some will wave their Keris. They will demand for an apology. What if Lao lee apologise for causing discomfort and produce an annex again ? Anyway, next week things will die down. Some slow person who want to score point will come and talk about it the week after and such a person exists judging from history.</div>

TO be fair also, even if asked i don't think he will have much criticism, if any at all. One question is, can we afford to offend the U.S and Israel ?</div>
