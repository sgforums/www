Was it not to deliver a high volume of traffic at the highest and safest speed possible ? Why bother to add cameras with a purposeful designed dummy camera back so that no-one will know which side the camera is facing ?<br><br>All these can only end up with drivers beating the Speed Camera by slowing down before arriving at its position, and speeding off at BEYOND the speed limit after the camera position.<br><br>Has the Singapore Economy succeeded based on every driver observing the various speed limits of 50kmh, 70kmh, 80kmh, and a maximum of 90kmh ?<br><br>How often have we seen - on a daily and hourly basis - at all times of the day, cars zipping along even on minor trunk roads, such as Upper Bukit Timah and Upper Thomson Road, at a speed of 90kmh in a 70kmh restricted area ?<br><br>Even the 3 lane carriage way - in each direction - from AMK Ave 3, to Hougang Ave 3, to Jalan Eunos, to Sims Avenue are imposed with a speed limit of 70kmh at 24hours a day, irregardless of traffic volumes.<br><br>Yet, cars are zipping past at 80 to 90kmh along this artificially suppressed speed of 70kmh.<br><br>Throughout Singapore, cars are zipping by at speeds of 10-20kmh above the artificially suppressed speed of 70kmh.<br><br>At 70kmh, all kinds of vehicles will have to drive on 3rd gear throughout its journey, and travel time will have to be increased by at least 30 minutes.<br><br><strong>Can the Singapore Economy arrive at its present status at this speed of 70kmh ?</strong><br><br>Singaporeans have been cheated by LTA and the Traffic Police, who knows that everyone is driving at speeds 10-20kmh above the officially set speed, and found this to be safe.<br><br>Yet it has been a convenient revenue generating format to simply catch Singaporeans for speed violation, when none actually exist.</span><br><br></div>

YCT's constituency became cut off from the main transport routes because of his predecessor's bad decisions, yet he did nothing to remedy it. Even if Raymond wanted to do anything now, it's probably too late.<br><br>But I say that camera is more for revenue raising. The same can be said for putting speed traps in school zones in Perth.
