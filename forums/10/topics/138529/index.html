            <div class='col-md body'>If there're any Singaporean reporters reading my blog, this post is for you: Get A Life.<br><br>Just because you fellas are not given "freedom" of expression for obvious reasons doesn't mean you should go on a rampage and start writing social commentaries on what other people post on their blogs or websites.<br><br>And please don't walk around with this idea that your job is to maintain moral standards and act like you're guardian angels. No one needs your watching over, so to speak, so don't cast someone as a slut just because she posted nude photos of herself or, in your own words, "shamelessly" advertise her desire to have a sugardaddy. Who are you to pass such judgements anyway?<br><br>Your role is to report news in as objective a manner as possible. Don't they teach you these things in journalism classes? Or have they lowered their standards and made paparazzi material out of all of you?<br><br>You yourselves shamelessly dig into the private lives of others just so to get a scoop and you decide who you want to glorify-- someone like Xiaxue is deemed as doing her country proud and letting the rest of the world know about life in Singapore, while a very much better writer like Sarong Party Girl is typecasted as someone who's shamed the nation.<br><br>Hello, in case you haven't noticed, one is a god-damned ah lian who peppers her distastefully pink blog with foul language and talks as if she's the only person who deserves to live on Earth.<br><br>And writes bad grammar. And makes eye-soring spelling errors too.<br>On the other hand, we have another Singaporean who writes very well-- so well her standard and command of English puts some of your own writers and reporters to shame-- and all you focus on are two tiny photos that show exposed nipples and nothing more.<br><br>Have you made any comments on how well she writes?<br><br>To be frank with you, if I was teaching a class of mature students, I'd recommend they read SPG's blog because of how well-written the entries are. And yet, I hear some schools are getting their students to learn how to blog like Xiaxue. What the fuck?? Are we all missing something here?<br><br>People in Singapore are no longer the bunch of uneducated farmers they were 40, 50 years ago. In case you haven't noticed, everyone knows how to read and write now, and most people-- even older folks-- have learnt how to surf the Internet and check emails. Stop being a stiff and think people are stupid because they aren't. You think the average Singaporean can't discern between what's right or wrong?<br><br>Once more, I say this to you: do your job the way you were supposed to and be less judging. Else you're no better than tabloid trash.<br><br>_______________________________________________<br>I find this very well written.<br>Shame on ST, SG press.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">If there're any Singaporean reporters reading my blog, this post is for you: Get A Life.<br><br>Just because you fellas are not given "freedom" of expression for obvious reasons doesn't mean you should go on a rampage and start writing social commentaries on what other people post on their blogs or websites.<br><br>And please don't walk around with this idea that your job is to maintain moral standards and act like you're guardian angels. No one needs your watching over, so to speak, so don't cast someone as a slut just because she posted nude photos of herself or, in your own words, "shamelessly" advertise her desire to have a sugardaddy. Who are you to pass such judgements anyway?<br><br>Your role is to report news in as objective a manner as possible. Don't they teach you these things in journalism classes? Or have they lowered their standards and made paparazzi material out of all of you?<br><br>You yourselves shamelessly dig into the private lives of others just so to get a scoop and you decide who you want to glorify-- someone like Xiaxue is deemed as doing her country proud and letting the rest of the world know about life in Singapore, while a very much better writer like Sarong Party Girl is typecasted as someone who's shamed the nation.<br><br>Hello, in case you haven't noticed, one is a god-damned ah lian who peppers her distastefully pink blog with foul language and talks as if she's the only person who deserves to live on Earth.<br><br>And writes bad grammar. And makes eye-soring spelling errors too.<br>On the other hand, we have another Singaporean who writes very well-- so well her standard and command of English puts some of your own writers and reporters to shame-- and all you focus on are two tiny photos that show exposed nipples and nothing more.<br><br>Have you made any comments on how well she writes?<br><br>To be frank with you, if I was teaching a class of mature students, I'd recommend they read SPG's blog because of how well-written the entries are. And yet, I hear some schools are getting their students to learn how to blog like Xiaxue. What the fuck?? Are we all missing something here?<br><br>People in Singapore are no longer the bunch of uneducated farmers they were 40, 50 years ago. In case you haven't noticed, everyone knows how to read and write now, and most people-- even older folks-- have learnt how to surf the Internet and check emails. Stop being a stiff and think people are stupid because they aren't. You think the average Singaporean can't discern between what's right or wrong?<br><br>Once more, I say this to you: do your job the way you were supposed to and be less judging. Else you're no better than tabloid trash.<br><br>_______________________________________________<br>I find this very well written.<br>Shame on ST, SG press.<br></div></blockquote>what's ur point eh?<br><br>do u want reporters to just report the facts or do you want them to be a thinking press?<br><br>Just because the reporters've their opinions doesn't mean they should be slammed for that.<br><br>there're crime stories which are treated objectively and issues which the reporters have their comments on - accept that.<br><br>and also accept the fact that different people've different opinions. that's what freedom of speech means - not just one way.<br><br>if u're not happy - write to the press! there's a forum for that u know?<br><br></div>
