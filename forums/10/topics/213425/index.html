            <div class='col-md body'>poodles are more often associated with strutting around with their nose in the air with their jewelled collars with high disdain for other dogs below themselves.<br>They are often good at useless tricks and doing useless things.

            <div class='col-md body'>The post 65s surely cannot bring up issues of high costs or pro-foreign investment and employment policies even if they know that these are issues very close to the heart and soul of the people at large.<br><br>This is because if any of them do bring up such issues they will be slammed as immature or idealistic.<br><br>So to show their usefulness to the citizens of being elected they ought to show some other contributions like the ability to hip-hop, connect with the ground and the younger generation so that they will be well received by the people and the revered leaders.<br><br>To them, hip hop is indeed the way to go as it is win-win strategy for them to stay around and look useful as they need to justify their value of being elected into parliament.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our leaders it seems always regarded themselves as above the law. They could sue people and close down newspapers but they do not want others to do the same to them as seen happening in Shin Corp case where the Thai authority is still investigating breaking of Thai law by Temasek.<br><br>The leaders have even persisted in wrongful conducts in elections e.g. threatening votes not to upgrade their estates during election time or using public taxes to buy votes.<br><br>The Minister for Home Affairs even wanted to ban so-called racist blogging and are presently trying to introduce amendments to the internet laws so as to jail people who posted or cast racial slur in very private blogging media.<br><br>But look at our leaders' own actions and behaviour - they say worse and did worse things like saying that the Malays or Indonesians are marginalizing the Chinese. Even if this is true, there are other ways to express the problems.<br><br>Racial slurs once started especially by the leaders, will lead to numerous pandora boxes being open to no end.<br><br>An ex- Malay MP has written a letter to PM Lee on MM Lee's racist remarks reported in international media. He has singled out his many perceptions of how Singapore Malays are being marginalised - despite all Singapore has done to reduce racialism, many Malays in Singapore might not hold the view that they are given the opportunities to go ahead.<br><br>All these incidents of conducts by the leaders point to one clear fact - our leaders are being too arrogant and cock-sure about whatever they are doing or saying. They could be very wrong or mistaken in defamation suits against political aspirants and buying of votes and all their many past assumptions in high-cost, meritocracy and other policies.<br><br>If the post 65s leaders could be counted to serve Singaporeans loyally and sincerely, they should stop all the hip-hopping and pretences and urge PM Lee to come up with a comprehensive people-to-people program to build common values among Asean and eventually get more neutral people like the UN eventually when the time is ripe to form EU-style economic union.<br><br>They should actively get the older leaders to stop thinking they are above the law and truly care for Singaporeans' diverse views and alternatives of what can be done to make this place even better.<br><br>To constantly stay on the sideline and allow leaders to mouth hypocrisy like law and order or other excuses so as to stay put in their present mentality is a dereliction of their duties and responsibilities as MPs of the people.<br><br>Singapore will no doubt change if the post 65s MPs begin to realise changing past policies of the old leaders are their urgent duties and responsibilities. On their shoulders fall the task of building a more open, participative multi-racial non-elitist society which our leaders are only talking but not seeking to build.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A copy of my post in club30, which I felt was more appropriate in here:<br><br>Dear People's Action Party,<br><br>Ordering your "young" MPs make fools of themselves hip-hop dancing at the Chingay parade is not going to make your party any more appealing to the younger Singaporeans. The the older ones will think of you as a bigger joke than you already are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>The fact is, those that hate you do not hate you for not being "hip" or "happening". They hate you for your heads in the sand, top-down ivory tower approach running the country. They hate that you stifle the development of the arts and try to kill off whatever little culture we do have that is unique to Singapore. They hate you for running the country like a godamned company with little thought for the welfare of the "employees". They hate the fact that there is nothing that citizens can do to have a say in the country's future. They hate that to have any impact they need to enter politics and be immediately smashed against the mammoth party machinery and a non-level playing field. They hate that the judiciary is not separate from the executive. They hate that the government competes against its own people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>On top of all that, I hate that as part of your social engineering experiment, you systemically marginalise singles. We are singaporeans too, we pay taxes, we did our national service. So why the hell am I not allowed to buy a new HDB flat? Why? Why am I being penalised because I haven't found my soulmate? Why do you punish single mothers but not the men who ditched them? Why? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Up Yours<br>AV<br><br>P.S. And to that idiot who mentioned in parliament that singles and childless couples should be taxed more as a form of punishment, I hope that you die a slow and terrible death.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>
