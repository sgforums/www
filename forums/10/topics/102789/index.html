            <div class='col-md body'>BEIJING (Reuters) - One of China's top Taiwan policymakers said Monday armed conflict will be unavoidable if the island keeps provoking and pushing for independence, but held out hope for the rivals reopening long-stalled dialogue.<br><br>Tension has been simmering since the March re-election of Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian, who said last week the next two years are key to resuming dialogue with China and suggested the two sides set up a "buffer zone" to avoid accidental military conflict.<br><br>"I think it is unavoidable tension will rise in the Taiwan Straits and there may even be armed conflict ... if the island keeps bumping Beijing's 'one China' bottom line and pushes for independence," Wang Zaixi, vice minister of the Taiwan Affairs Office, told Reuters in a rare interview. "The Chen Shui-bian authorities are exploiting our restraint on the Taiwan issue," he said.<br><br>"They are attempting to exploit ... the fact that mainland compatriots are focusing energy on developing the economy and exploit our preparations for the 2008 Olympics," said Wang, a People's Liberation Army major general before becoming vice minister in 2000.<br><br>But Wang held out hope for the two sides to resume dialogue under the "one China" principle which dictates that the mainland and the island are part of a single country.<br><br>Beijing has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since their split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has threatened to attack the democratic island if it formally declares independence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: LazerLordz,<br><br>I think China had meant what it said when it said that it would use force if Taiwan tries to declare independence.<br><br>Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian, has no Chineseness or not known of Chinese culture that was passed down for the past Five Thousand years when it said and thought Taiwanese people are not Chinese.<br><br>Chinese people has been Chinese even if they live overseas or have taken up other citizenship. Indonesian Chinese remain Chinese and Malaysian Chinese remain Chinese. It will take a long time for Chinese of Taiwan to erudicate their Chinese root and culture.<br><br>Definitely, Taiwan has elected a leader who was commercialised by election process to talk for winning votes. In other words, he talked independence for party or self-interest which may not represent Taiwanese interest.<br><br>Any further tensioning by Chen will heighten China's military response in which case the Americans may be drawn into conflict. This will not serve Americans' or international interest.<br><br>Very simple, China will just conduct another major military exercise without attacking Taiwan island. What can Taiwan do?<br><br>Statemen are now lacking. There is a need for statemen in both China and Taiwan to defuse current tension and move for eventual unification the Deng Xiao Peng's way.
