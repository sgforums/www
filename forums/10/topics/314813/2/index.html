              <p>can we outsource our government to foreigners? now that we are even selling our critical state own assets to china companies. (the power plant, if you don't remember)</p>
              <p>Quality:</p>
              <p>Westerner, top price range, $400,000. ( Pay of US President)</p>
              <p>Regional: can get bangla with degree, for $500.  ( way lot cheaper than our current ministers. you can get the same efficiency for a lot lesser.)</p>
              <p>Advantage of hiring foreigners to be our government:</p>
              <p>we can retrench these foreign workers anytime, anywhere. summore dunid to pay additional $3.6m for post like president, MM, SM.</p>
              <p>With every PM who decided to step down, we have more and more SM, MM  positions which ask for the same pay as the PM.... hmmm interesting when you consider the fact that the office of the PM is suppose to be the top job in the parliament. </p>

              <p>Base on his logic = if PAP let pretty china gal as MPs = more vote + attract more sex perverts to migrate to singapore . This bring brisk business to Singapore ... but then if china gal so good did his job .... why the fuck we need him ? Maybe he then go for upgrade courses to learn makeup and dress in cosplay uniforrm !!!</p>

              <p>The Strait Times Friday April 18 2008</p>
              <p>The Minister in the Prime Minister's office - commenting on a drink seller complain to Mr Lim Boon Heng, that she feel threatened by  a sweet, young lady from China who sells beer at the same joint. She is worried that allowing such foreigners to work at cofffee shops would undercut her wages . She was already working 2 jobs to make end meet.<br><br>The view for the Minister is that - The china co-worker was drawing men in droves to the coffeeshop , he said. This in term mean brisk business which in turn help local, in turn helped the local drinks lady keep her job !</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Hello what crap is this from a minister !!!!</p>
              <p>He is selling "Sex" or beer !   People go there for beer ..... but he encouraging people to go for sex !!!<br><br>Crap - I may see the drink owner profit increase by selling sex and their soul and moral !!!!  But I still do not see how it is going to help the local drink lady ... she is more likely to lose her job !!!!</p>
              <p>See this is what our high pay shit head minister, we pay him/her to think of high class - sex !!! Pervert !!!<br><br>On one hand they keep asking older folks and people to come out to work ... but on other hand - they fucking say - they rather need sweet sexy hot girls from oversea to sell beer and other stuff - what jobs is there out there for singaporean !!!</p>
              <p>If you put a sweet sexy china girl to sweep the floor in HDB - also will draw men in droves !!! Next time we get the india guy to go - hire - sweet sexy china to sweep the HDB with short maid uniform !!!</p>
              <p><br>Maybe LKY should come back out to give the whole bunch of new idiots a good lecture of moral !!!</p>
