              <p>The time has come, now PAP is lost. It has taken the wrong path and don't know how to U turn back. Lots of singaporeans have suffered in the last 4 years under a lost PAP regime, how much longer are you going to suffer?</p>
              <p>The time has come, now opposition parties need to be voted into parliament to lend a hand to PAP to guide it back to the correct path. To provide good alternate policies, to check the PAP and change the PAP.</p>
              <p>For this to happen, you will need to vote for opposition parties in the coming election. Vote without fear. if you fear this and that, then you might as well stay at home. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Malaysians have suffered, in 2008 they voted more than one third of opposition members into parliament, if Malaysians can done it, what are Singaporeans still fearing of? The serial number on the ballot paper? Or your rice bowl if you are in civil service? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If you think this is still not the time to do, it will be too late in 2016 when foreigners-turned-citizens will outnumber you. You will regret it!</p>

              <p>I'm in West Coast GRC. The reason PAP can get high number of votes in Ayer Rajah the last time in 2001 (in 2006 it became part of the GRC) was because the opposition candidate was weak and majority did not know him. Tan Lead Shake from DPP.</p>
              <p>Pioneer ward of the GRC has the most number of foreigners-turned-citizens. So I guess the most number of PAP votes in this GRC will come from this ward.</p>

              <p>It just does what any juice blender does, but you would like it to peel the fruit, juice it, chill it and served with a bendy straw.</p>
              <p>And all available blenders in Courts, Best Denki, Gain City do not do as good a job as your current blender, which is why it lasted so long in the first place.</p>
              <p>It all blends down to making a choice.</p>
              <p>Each decides on his own, or make a decision on the influence of another.</p>
              <p>Even if a decision is made on the influence of another, the last act is still rest on the individual.</p>
