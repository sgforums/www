            <div class='col-md body'>Talk about tyranny of the minority. It's amazing the things we have to endure in the name of racial harmony and tolerance. The Singapore Government's always getting lambasted about not giving equal opportunities to Malays, about not helping them enough, about not giving them a fair chance in school, in the industry, in the military etc etc. Just recently Lee Kuan Yew got whacked yet AGAIN concerning this. It will never be enough, I tell you. They will always strive to be the underdog, to be seen as oppressed, to be seen as the under-privilaged. Why? It is to their advantage after all. In a nation full of Chinese, that's the only way to gain some benefits. And they have done so very succesfully, I might add.<br><br>Especially in areas like education. The MOE's always having a hard time trying to find ways to so call boost the number of Malay graduates for all levels. And when they don't perform, it is the MOE's fault. Wonderful. Now here comes the National Football Academy to save the day...for the Malays. Finally, they have the chance to earn good money without studying just by kicking a ball around for what, $3000-$4000? I would love to kick a ball around for that amount as well. And how good exactly, is their standard of soccer? If their so good, why do we need to import so many foreign players? Is that all the S-League will be made up of? Malays and foreign players? The foreign players are better than the Malays! And how come there are so many Malays in the S-League? Oh no, not that Chinese and Indian players are all that good either, but you can't help wondering right? Well, it's the Malays ticket to an easy life. After all, if they can't study, they might as well kick a ball around and earn good money. It's just too bad that the obsession of having a local soccer league totally overshadowed this. Or perhaps not? Ok, let's not talk about soccer.<br><br>Talk about normal life. Malays are exceptionally persistent in honouring their religion. Nothing wrong with that. Every Friday they go to mosques to pray, which entitles them to the whole morning and afternoon. Nothing wrong either. In some schools, they even have a prayer room for them. How privilaged indeed! So much so that they abuse it. In a certian institution, the prayer room of the Malays was found to have graffiti on walls, with cigiratte butts and beer cans scattered on the floor. A complaint was made, and the warning notices were put up. To no avail. The same thing was repeated twice, and each time the Malays that used the room clamimed innocence. Finally, the room was simply closed off. No more prayer room. Up in arms, came the Malays to the principal, demanding that their prayer room be reopened. The reply was a firm negative. But the Malays insisted and insisted and got the help of religious teachers to back up their cause. The principal made a deal: Whoever drew the graffiti and smoked and drank, owe up. Sabotage was out of the question, since it was a Malay holding the key. The Malays refused. They claim that they were sabotaged. Who? No idea. And this is not an isolated incident. It may be one of the worst cases, but it is definately not exclusive to merely a few schools. To primary schools, secondary schools, JCs and poly ( I'm not too sure about NUS and NTU ), they are such cases of varying degrees of mischief. And the Malays always claim innocence.<br><br>If that is not bad enough, let's talk about something practical: food. Lots and lots of halal food out there, one might say. Is it a problem? Nope. Who cares anyway? Just make it all halal to accomodate them, never mind the rest. By the way, does anybody here know about the halal process? Let me explain then. This process is done by their own Muslim butchers, and they cut up the animal in a certain way which is supposed to make it halal. Very good. Do you guys know that they offer the animal that they have killed as a sarcrifice to their god, Allah? No, they don't do anything to the meat. They just face Mecca and offer their prayers. Now then, what is the big deal? If you don't care, it doesn't matter then. However, if I'm not wrong, the Lord Jesus did say in the Bible that his disciples must not eat food sacrificed to  idols. Christian, would you please tell me, is Allah an idol? If he isn't, fine and dandy. And by the way, the term "idol", what does it mean? An object of worship. By object, I suppose one might mean a PHYSICAL object. What a minute, there are no images of Allah! Yes, there aren't, but in Mecca, do you know that there is this thing called the Black Box? I'm not sure of its exact name, but inside that box is a stone. And every Muslim in the world when praying, would turn towards that stone and worship. Now, there is the idol! Don't believe me? Read up, ask your Muslim friends, do some research. What I am saying is current and true. So, Christians, have you been eating halal food? If so, you are guilty of eating food sacrificed to idols! Have you ever realised that? Ever? No? Go and find out if you don't believe me Christians. When you do find out that what I am saying is true, what are you going to do? Oh, that's your problem, not mine. Most likely you'll just keep quiet and not do anything, after all, the Muslims will surely be very offended. But having known this, how does feel it if let's say you do try not to eat halal food? What a nightmare! Goodness, halal food is everywhere! Oh nothing wrong for me. Just wondering what you Christians will do, that is, if you honour God not just in name of course. But what I have said is merely nitpicking to those who don't care.<br><br>How about this then? Their famous Ramadan, the month-long fast. They tell you that that they cannot eat or drink anything for one month. But, if you wish to observe, do you know that in the dead of the night they will gorge themselves silly? What hypocrisy. I know a few Malay friends who DO eat during Ramadan. Their job is to push railway cars containing electrical generators, which weigh around 2 or 3 tons, in order to connect them to trains. No time for fasting, thank you, we need to eat in order to get the job done.  Same goes for truckers, labourers, and other tasks which require lots of energy. Fair enough I suppose. Even Ramadan isn't worth losing their jobs. The problem is when other Malays do the same thing. In offices, especially, those obese Malay clerks munching away during teabreak. Who cares? Same goes for the office workers as well, though they are more discreet. Do I sound as though I'm whining? Perhaps I am. If they do not wish to honour their religion, that's their problem. The problem is when they make all sorts of excuses to justify slacking off. Every year it's the same. During Ramadan. What irks me most is that they really take advantage of everybody during that bloody month. Weakness, nausea, loss of concentration, you name it, they've go it. Which of course, justifies a series of long breaks and lunch hours. In schools, apparently any and all project work are automatically dumped onto the laps of their non-Chinese partners, or if there're all Malays, a postponement of the project deadline is an absolute MUST. Missing classes becomes the norm for that month, and somehow or other it is the month in which Malays get sick the most easily, with plenty of MCs and excuses as always. Oh, yes, I too would fall ill if I had to fast a month every year, but what makes me so mad is that I have witnessed so many eating whilst they are suppose to be fasting, and not a little bit, and they still act as thought they really haven't eaten at all! Like I said earlier, if they wish to bluff themselves, by all means it's their problem. But not at the expense of such lame excuses to get off work and study! My friends working or studying overseas also complain of the same, with some telling me that the school cook was totally fed-up with outrageous requests for meals in the middle of the night! Indeed, how much longer must we tolerate this?<br><br>I have not even begun to fully detail the benefits the Malays are given in Singapore in terms of education, housing, etc etc. The thing is, are they really as in need of help as they say they are? Do we really have to accede everytime they bring up their religion? Do we need to always give them a headstart in order to compensate for their, what, stupidity? Not only in Singapore mind you. In Malaysia, the so called bumiputras, ah, now there is an excellant example! They are so coddled by the Malaysian government in this regard, and then Mahathir complains that the bumiputras are not performing as well as non-bumiputras. What a joke. Since when did pampering companies ever helped to improve the economy? How much more do Malays need to be coddled? How much, and for how much longer?<br><br>Perhaps without these perks they wouldn't able to survive out there after all. If that is the case, the Malays are truly, and I say so justly, despicable. Despicable for pretending to be stupid and helpness; despicable because perhaps they truly are stupid and helpness, in which case we and the Singapore Government should kick our own asses for being so stupid by trying to help them so much and by accomodating them in so many, many ways. Next outburst please!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Allah (edited 21 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its about time someone brought this up. I'm as pissed as the guy who started this thread. I am not prejudicial against Malays, neither do I have agendas for racial disharmony. In fact I think racial harmony is THE most important issue in internal affairs in SG. It is also important however, that we do not generalise across all members of the race, although trends by definition are a phenomenon by the statistical majority.<br><br>HOWEVER, I have a problem with racial harmony being used to blackmail the nation economically. I believe in merit where merit is due and fault where fault is due. The facts stated in the 1st post are evident for all to see. Action and reaction, socially and economically. The state of affairs now is what the Malay community have put themselves in. And they expect public funds to be used to bail them out. But SG acceeds, why? Because racial harmony is held hostage.<br><br>If analysed globally, a trend begins to emerge and the inevitable and painful results begin to point to religion. Islam is basically non compatible with modern capitalist economies. The culture that it instills does not give itself easily to emotionless efficiency, nor does it place any importance on economic wellbeing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes indeed, the Government has finally stood up to those bastards in the AMP! Ungrateful lot. I guess they got too proud and arrogant for their own good. Malay professionals, what an oxymoron. The Malay community has already been so well provided for in Singapore. Those university graduates in the AMP managed to get their degrees by riding on the free wave of goodies provided by the government during those years. And what did they graduate in? Social studies, Islamic studies...lame subjects that do not help the country economically. I suppose that's all they can ever study, anything more than that is too much for their puny minds. And just because of that, they got over their own heads, and start thinking too big for their own good. Serves them right! I'm just glad that the Government is smart enough to keep the Malays in the position of the underdog, since that is what they love to be so much. They just don't realise that as the underdog, they cannot behave as though they are the top dogs! Underdogs have an obligation to their protectors, namely the Government. If they wish to be known as the top dogs, surely they can do without any the many special benefits that the Government has provided specially for the Malays? But no, they want to have the cake and eat it as well. The benefits of the underdog, and the priviledges of the top dog, they want to have both! But unfortunately, the Government isn't that stupid. If the Malays wish to be known as the top dog, they'll have to prove it on the same footing as the rest of the non-Malays in Singapore who do not receive any special benefits. But they know they can't, so they'll just remain firmly under the thumb of the Government as the perpetual underdog, brilliant strategy by the Government!<br><br>If there's one Malay that I truly admire, it's Dr.Mahathir. He's a truly moderate Malay. He's one of the very few Malays who can actually think, and have some foresight as well! He knows very well that the only way Malaysia can prosper to its fullest is to secularise it. But that would be impossible. They are always lame defenders of the Islamic faith clamouring that this is unislamic, that is against Islam. As a result, they shut themselves up and wonder why is it that their lot has not improved. Oh, it's the Chinese that are to blame! Even with the lame bumiputra system to help them in all ways, they can still blame the Chinese for what, being too smart? There were articles recently about top Chinese students in Malaysia not being able to get into the course of their choice in the local universities because of the lame quota system. But ah, the places for the Malays have not, and cannot, be filled! Why? The answer is so obvious. Malays are inherently stupid! But of course, they cannot admit that to anyone, so here we read in the Strait Times about this change and that change to make the Malays smarter, if that were ever possible. Too bad, I feel sorry for Mahathir. He's torn between leading his country and Islam. If only Malays were not Muslims, they would surely be able to compete with just about anybody in any field. But since they choose to shackle themselves, why are they still complaining? Doesn't make sense. The perpetual underdog mentality as usual I suppose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, before we start another race riot, lrt's look at the pros and cons or both sides of the argument.<br><br>The truth is that sometimes the majority (I'm Chinese) resent the tyranny of the minority (not any one in particular). Just as much as the HDB dwellers resent the tyranny of the private housing fellahs (of which I am a member).<br><br>However we mustn't let emotions get in the way of everything, or allow generalisations to destroy our harmony. I know many Muslims and I can tell you that they are very nice people, whether or not they are staunch Muslims, I cannot say. (I leave such matters to God or Allah)<br><br>Look at it from their point of view, they were original inhabitants of this land (I mean Malays, not those Arabs or Indian Muslims, but then the line is blurred nowadays) and they do deserve some rights as a minority as well. Unlike the Chinese who are very adaptable (to the point of ditching their own traditions, c'mon now... be honest, besides Chinese New Year and Qing Min, wat else do u really know about Chinese history or traditions, besides fiction gleamed from those lousy Taiwanese crying shows)<br><br>This matter is highly sensitive. We live in a society where most religions and races are accorded equal rights and protection under the law (however little or much that may be, up to u to decide) and we have learnt to get along (not love each other, but tolerate each other) without having to play the race card or have parties along racial lines (save the PKMS, but who are they?!? do we really care?).<br><br>We've built decent enough rapport to not want to go down the "race riots" lane again. Trust me on that one.<br><br>So the Malays get s few extra bonuses, does it hurt our country? No, not really. Maybe some Malays/Muslim exploit this beneficial system, but others resent such treatment. I mean, if you're a bright young Malay, who made it in the military, everyone will say that it's beacuse you r a Malay. That's not good at all.<br><br>So I'm asking all of you to understand each other. Don't just go shooting off like that. Everyone has a point to make. Be sensitive to both sides of the story, be willing to learn and understand. If you fail to do so, you'll just end up smashing the brick wall. (and it'll hurt I tell you, it'll hurt like hell)</div>
