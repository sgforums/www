Gomez was another... between that two, the MIW could not have damaged the opposition as much as they did..<br><br>he keeps ranting that he 'doesn't have interest' because, like the fox which proclaimed the grapes are sour, he knows that the Singapore People will never be hoodwinked by this charlatan ever again.. only people on the outside who have no idea of his disgraceful behaviour will believe him.. but then, isn't he like the MIW who is more interested in FTs than the locals?<br><br>everything about this piece of crap is dubious..<br><br>again, i say.. your enemy's enemy may not be your friend..<br><br>btw... Gandhi is an icon... he did his in a time where things demanded to be done and he did it the correct way.. please do not demean the Mahatma by comparing CSJ with him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br></div></blockquote>I have heard talk of him being a MIW Mole, its of no consequence as its has not been proven, or even remotely close. The only thing is that some people felt that he screwed up the repuation of Opposition members, which hardly means he's a mole, probably means that he's not a very skilled politician. I didn't agree with ousting Chiam, but also didn't agree with Chiam asking Chee to "self censor". Then again thats between the 2 of them.<br><br>And with this specific case in question, I see no harm done to the opposition repuation. Non-Violent protests and garnering int'l support to apply pressure on the government is a common strategy among human rights activists around the world. Most recently, in East Timor.<br><br>The desensatization, is a large part, the work of the PAP. I know foreign media portrays him in a very different light, even in the begining, even the locally based foreign journalists. I do not think he's PM material, but at least he's garnered more int'l support than all other opposition parties put together, and that is fact, not speculation.<br><br>I don't trust him wholly. Regardless of his own agenda, I do know for fact that what he has accomplished on an international level has yet to be achieved by any other Singaporean living in singapore. Other than mytrdom, he has gained nothing but condemnation and the destruction of his material well being.<br><br>Do you understand the concept of Non-violent action? It is to rave and rant, over issues or polices that you are opposed to, in order to garner support, locally and internationally. I hardly think of this incident as a screwup. It is infact a direct challenge to the Govt to take action against non-violent protests(which are a accepted norm in many developed countries), especially now that Singapore has a higher visiblity within the international community.</div>
