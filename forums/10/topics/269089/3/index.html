            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by ORIGAMIST:<br><strong>Yesterday I was approached by two different persons to donate to the President Star Charity.. I donated. It then strike me, why must there is a donation drive asking common folk to donate when the Presidents and the Cabinet minister is drawing hugh salary.. If a common folk salary is on average $1200 per month and donated $10, that would be about 0.83%. If the President and the Minister donate same percentage, there won't be a need to have this drive right ?? Please correct me if I am wrong.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </strong>[/b]</blockquote>People approach you to donate, oh i see.  You know, staff in SGH are forced to ask for donation for President /Challenge.  They were given cards and the pro PAP SGH make it compulsory for all staff to get the donation cards and help to donate.   REally, only the stupid balls carrier SGH will do that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So, President Star Charity 207 have come to an end.  We can see that the majority of the fund raised comes from big organisation.  In this case, should they keep the students out of it to concentrate on study or other useful activities ?   Mediacorp can continue with the show as it is a great revenue churner..  The whole show I recorded was about 2 hrs 40 mins .. after deleting the advertisement, the show is about 1 and half only ....</div>
