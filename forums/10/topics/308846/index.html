              <p>"Banks are expanding in areas of their business such as Basel II, operational 
              risk, compliance and regulatory reporting, and the local labour pool is just not 
              enough to fill the jobs," says a banker, who adds that while layoffs are 
              inevitable due to the sub-prime mess, the fast-growing Asia Pacific region will 
              continue to hire.</p>
              <p>One example is Barclays' capital markets division, which hired 19 experienced 
              research people from the Philippines last year and relocated them all to 
              Singapore, says Richard Mills, chairman of Chalré Associates, a search firm 
              operating in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Mills says companies who tap into talent pools overseas might do so in order 
              to trim costs, but their principal motivation is that they can’t find enough 
              suitable staff locally and want to expand their supply of experienced people.</p>
              <p>Robert Half Singapore's managing director, Tim Hird, says by hiring foreign 
              talent, whether from emerging countries or elsewhere in the world, a firm 
              benefits from a diverse workforce with a broad mix of skill sets, viewpoints and 
              experiences.</p>
              <p>"Nevertheless, they must be mindful of cultural sensitivities when hiring 
              foreign talent, and ensuring their adaptability and commitment to the country 
              and company should be a priority in the hiring process," he points out.</p>

              <p><strong>More and more jobs created but not enough S'poreans to fill them</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore economy has been creating more and more jobs but there are not enough Singaporeans to fill them.
              <br> <br> So companies are turning more and more to foreigners. Hence the
              proportion of new jobs going to Singaporeans has been falling over the
              years.
              <br> <br>A Manpower Ministry study noted that in the three years between
              2004 and 2006, although increasingly more jobs were created each year,
              those going to Singapore citizens fell from 45 percent to 40 then 37
              percent in 2006.
              <br> <br>Latest MOM numbers showed 360,700 jobs were created between 2004
              and 2006. Foreigners took the largest share, clinching 156,500 jobs,
              with 141,700 going to Singaporeans and 62,500 to permanent residents. <br> <br> This is the first time employment figures have been broken down into
              the three individual groups of employees in Singapore. Previously,
              reports on such nature put Singaporeans and permanent residents
              together into one group and foreigners another.
              <br> <br>The Manpower Ministry said the trend of falling proportion of new
              jobs for Singaporeans "is typical of periods of robust and sustained
              economic growth" which led to more jobs being created. <br> <br> It said: "With the lowest unemployment in ten years and employment at
              an all-time high, the number of available Singaporean citizens to take
              up new jobs over the next few years will shrink.
              <br> <br>"This is already occurring as shown by the proportion of employment
              gains going to Singapore citizens, which dropped from 45% in 2004 to
              40% in 2005 and to 37% in 2006. This is typical of periods of robust
              and sustained economic growth, with strong employment creation.
              <br> <br>"Going forward, as a result of falling fertility and ageing, we
              will have to tap on older workers and women to maintain the size of our
              citizen workforce."
              <br> <br>Wong Su-Yen, managing director of ASEAN Mercer Singapore, said:
              "Increasingly companies are finding that there just isn't enough people
              anywhere to go around. And so they're trying to find people wherever
              they can.
              <br> <br>"There's obviously a large gap between what the population here is
              producing as opposed to how many jobs required to sustain the
              economy....
              <br> <br>"Even if they're getting a smaller slice of a bigger pie, in
              reality everybody who wants to have a good job is getting the jobs that
              they're looking for. It just means that the economy is growing faster
              than what the local population can support.
              <br> <br>"The other dimension to this is that labourers are a lot more
              mobile, so in fact what you're seeing is that many Singaporeans are
              working elsewhere too. So you've got Singaporeans working in China, in
              Vietnam, in the Middle East.
              <br> <br>"So it's really a question of mobility and that's going to shrink
              the population here available for work, which just means that more
              people are going to be coming in."
              <br> <br>But in terms of absolute numbers, MOM said more Singaporeans are
              getting jobs - nearly 65,000 were employed in 2006, up from 32,000 in
              2004. <br> <br> And according to the MOM report, even though Singaporeans were taking
              up a smaller number of the new jobs, nearly two thirds of them were
              employed in well-paying positions as PMETs - professionals, managers,
              executives and technicians. These pay above the median monthly income
              of $2,300.
              <br> <br>The bulk of Singaporeans also found new jobs in the services sector
              in 2006. Close to seven in 10 service workers were Singaporeans, with
              the rest going to foreigners and permanent residents. <br> <br> Foreigners had a higher employment share in manufacturing and construction, where many took up labour-intensive jobs. 
              <br> <br> MOM said the more demanding working conditions in these positions are less attractive to Singaporeans.
              <br> <br> In 2006, MOM issued about 110,000 S-Passes and Employment Passes for
              foreign workers earning at least $1,800 and $2,500 respectively and
              646,000 work permits for foreign workers earning not more than $1,800.
              <br> <br>In construction, foreigners made up three out of five workers (or
              61%) in the sector. 31% were Singaporeans and 8.2% were permanent
              residents.
              <br> <br> In manufacturing, less than half of them (or 44%) were Singaporeans.</span></p>
