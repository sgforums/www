Okay, not enough "seniority and responsibility." So is President Nathan, for the past six years, putting his vast years of "seniority and responsibility" into poring through the finanical accounts of Singapore? That's my BIG question for which I have no answer.<br><br>What have President Nathan been doing for the past six years in the Istana? It can't be just jogging and learning Chinese??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
