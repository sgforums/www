Those who being through 1st owner and resale flat transaction should know what I mean.

The HDB or the government. Don't forget many of the population still is from the low-income class. One earlier 20+ young fellow just graduated from uni.. got a job paying 2K plus.

Father odd-job labourer.<br><br>Intend to buy a new 3 rm flat cost around 140-160k.. garmen say cannot ... earning above 2k must buy at least a 4 rm or bigger which cost ard 200k above.. Then how long must this guy continue to work in order to pay finish this flat???<br><br>Sometimes, I just wonder is it the government purposely jerk up the HDB price then everybody got to work for their entire life to support our highly-paid Ministers or garmen' wage system?? given most of the population ard 80% got nothing to choose , can only live in public housing.

How did that happen just overnight... Well it didn't.<br>In accounts, DBS big shots would have discussed that during the economic slump, they do not feel comfortable that they will collect the debts and so they had to set aside a contingency sum to assure that the profits are not over reported, they make an estimate of the amount of bad debts (for all you know, it might just be an arbitary sum) and this amount is deducted from profit every year to accound for contingency. So you have a reduced profit. However, once the big shots felt things are smooth sailing, they immediately revised the accounting policy and reduce the bad debts. So this number is release back into profit which seemed to indicate to the laymen/women, that DBS did well. But in actual fact, its neither.<br><br>In accouting, its always always true to be conservative about reporting profits. There is a bias towards reporting a lower profit level than a higher one and they will tell you its all about contingencies.<br><br>So numbers... only tell a little of the whole picture... there's more than meets the eye. Its not that people do not care about facts and figures, but once you really know more about accounting... you'd not always base your decisions on these numbers.<br>Oh I'm in IT (must qualify first) so i might not say the right thing about the accounting profession so if there is any accountants out there, Duo duo de jui ...<br></div>

Since by private, price will be more expensive but still no facilities..  See, the same piece of land when built by HDB earn lesser...  These flat will be HDB, mind you..  the finishing may be better but I doubt their prices will cost more for HDB. But when HDB sell to you, they charge you more...
