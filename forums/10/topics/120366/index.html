Always ask you to leave message and they NEVER call back.  Go to office to see them always not in and someone take over and talk to you with settleing the problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>What ever it is....  We are paying more for what they say public housing.  In recent years, the price of private property drop so much.  Now the price of a 5 rooms can cost as much as a resale condo, how to differentiate the diff between private or subsidised.  HDB just refuse to lower the selling price of new flats.  They know it will be taken up as with new town facilities will be there.  They got way to make people buy house.  Look at Buangkok, they don't have enough people and so don't open MRT there.  Then when people compare facilities,  a better choice is to take there right since MRT ready to be operational...<br><br>Anyway, they got their way... They do things that people cannot questioned them openly.  They always have reason.  They even make comparision with pte property when pricing HDB but when prices of pte property drop, their prices remains....  Still they got their reason...  I am not into arguement with you.
