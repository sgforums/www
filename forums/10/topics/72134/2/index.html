            <div class='col-md body'>just thinking maybe the mum didnt want the gal to see the bf body is becos the chinese belief that the soul cannot leave if too many regrets or something. not very sure. i am on unclear grounds, those who know the chinese customs and beliefs would be in a better place to explain. maybe the mum felt that the gal cant take it either. but its really a sad case. condolences to all involved. to the teachers and principal of <strong>LOYANG SECONDARY SCHOOL</strong> there really is such a thing as judgement day. if u do not believe in that, there is always retribution. a life loss at what expense?? u improving ur career and scoring brownie points?<br><br>dating nvr harmed anyone. everyone of us comes out emotionally scarred through the trials and turmoils of relationship, but yet much stronger to face challenges ahead. we were young once. thinking our 1st love will last forever. have we forgotten how to dream???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While the school and the principal will have to take a large piece of the blame for this whole sorry mess after handling the matter in the worst way possible, some other things set me thinking:<br><br>Did the mother, who was so vehement in blaming the school and the principal, ask herself why her son was so afraid of letting her know?<br><br>And on the child's part, are our children so pampered and soft that they are so afraid of a scolding or a beating from the parents over this matter, that they can choose death over the consequences of their actions?<br><br>I'm not against dating in school etc, you can stop such things in teenagers, but then again, the parents must ask if they brought up their child the right way. As hard as it is, following the loss of one's child.<br><br>I hate to say it, but looking at all the different perspectives of this sad incident, there is something seriously wrong with society.</div>
