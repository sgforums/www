            <div class='col-md body'>thought this was a case where a little bit more sensitivity on all parties involved would have prevented the tragedy...<br><br>had the school been more sensitive in dealing with the boy and how it is going to notify his parents, it probably wouldn't have terrorised the boy into thinking of suicide.... e.g. through counselling, understanding the kid first... asking the kid what his fears are abt his parents knowing,...etc...<br><br>and perhaps also the parents had a part to play.... e.g. were they so strict at home that the thought of them finding out drove the kid to 'escape" via suicide??<br><br>Afterall, the boy is already 15 years old... things like finding out about relationships, BGR, dating etc.. it's a natural part of the process of growing up... discovering themselves.</div>
