The service was deplorable, was told hospitalisation was needed at 5pm, didn't get hospitalised till 3am. There were families of patients that have been waiting since 9am, but receive no news of any outcome till 7pm. Think the service standard is related to their operational management. However, I think it would give them a lame reason to increase the price of healthcare, as they can claim that they have shortage of manpower.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is common in public hospitals. The waiting times of public hospitals are very long. In TTSH, it's not even uncommon to wait up to a day. I've tried visiting the hospital from 10am in the morning, and by the time I'm home, it's already 3am the next day.<br><br>The worst thing is they tell you they have ran out of hospital beds if you need to be hospitalized.<br><br>As for infections, you are supposed to see a doctor first, before seeing a specialist. It's in no way sub-standard, as long as you are a healthy individual. That's also assuming the infection doesn't turn bad.<br><br>For diabetic patients, the same thing is recommended, except that in serious cases (say fever or some parts of the skin had turned black), then they say you visit the hospital.<br><br>Services wise, I guess it's just the hospital's wrong to assume that patients will know how to recognize an infection, how to reduce a swelling. You could write in and tell them. TTSH won't let you go out of the hospital without telling you how to recognize certain things. That's my experience with them.</div>

Why other hospitals don't receive as many complaints as SGH is receiving?<br><br>They will never change and improve their service lah.  Don't place high hope on them.  So what if they have increased fees, ISO certified and what crap.  They will still be who they are.<br><br>There are many problems in SGH.  So many internal problems, too!  My good friend works there told me the INs and OUTs of the way patients are treated and the dirty politics there.  So if there are struggles even within the hospital itself, don't think they can put service to patients as first priority.  The dirty politics there is horrible, for eg, if they don't like the staff, they can deliberately find fault and anyhow quote a reason to get the staff terminated.  This happened more than once already.    Sometimes could be power struggles among doctors so affect their service.<br><br>If you wanna go public hospital, don't go SGH, go TTSH (Tan Tock Seng).  Over there they provide good service and moreover so conveniently located.<br><br>Go write letter to their CEO called Professor Tan Ser Kiat and have it writen "to be opened by addressee only" on the envelope to see how he can handle your problem.<br><br></div>

I told the nurse that and she said 'well if you get an infection go to the polyclinic'.What kind of service is that? Can't you tell what is important and what is not.And besides it would take just 10minutes.So for 11 full days,i am going to have my foot bandaged,with stitches intact and look for infections?I am not a doctor please tell me how to see infections.<br><br>I would not be surprised if i do not receive a reply or receive a reply after 1 month,after all i saw the ugly side of Singapore's largest hospital yesterday,i hope that you can still practice some ethics.<br><br>Thank you.</strong><br><br>Guys share your views[/b]</blockquote>Well, all I can say is we're SCREWED in areas such as public services in healthcare, so long as our government is not replaced...<br><br>Their 'efficiency' is only from their lips, and in their prompt collection of Taxes...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed.But worst part has to be that there was only 1 bone specialist on duty that day,like wth man?Government is really screwed man,agreed that till they aint gone nothing is gonna happen.Anyone who speaks up gets screwed.Look at Chee Soon Juan and JB Jeya.<br><br>And just received a call from them btw,the lady appologised for 'inconvenience caused that was purely unintentional'.Said she would check with the doctors when my stitches can come out the earliest and call me back,I have tests myself and school man,im in IT course,you miss 1 lesson the next lesson you are totally lost,and im not good in IT.And doc had said till stitches not taken out,i cant walk.<br><br></div>

We call the ambulance for every minor issue. Once I was in the A&amp;E department because my grandma had some serious health issues.<br><br>Guess what? A girl arrived in ambulance for a wound (and the wound isn't a gaping wound) that doesn't stop bleeding, and cut the queue and demanded that she be attended first. For goodness sake, this sort of issues should be sorted in polyclinic or just any clinic, not the A&amp;E department.<br><br>I've seen a Bangladeshi waiting behind, with his head bleeding non-stop, but due to that lady, his treatment got delayed. The nurses can't do anything, in the name of good service. I could see from their faces that between ethics and services, they are stuck. It's very saddening to see their faces.<br><br>Also, given the constraints of our land space, A&amp;E counters are packed with people who refused to clear the area for the paramedics. In my whole day there in the A&amp;E department, I hear the paramedics shout "Excuse me!" more than anything.<br><br>Yes, I know we are concerned about our family members, but what about others? They too are concerned. By blocking the way, it wastes a lot of time and every second wasted might cause a life. And it's not first time that I've seen one died because they get in the way of paramedics. One that I've seen, lost too much blood and had soaked the hospital bed thoroughly. Died because couldn't move into the A&amp;E department.<br><br>My reasoning for increasing prices is to just get the people away and stop wasting the time of A&amp;E departments, since Singaporeans are so kiasu.</div>
