They always make sure they are sufficient doctors on duty to serve the patients.  Even doctors are on leave they will get others to cover their duty.  As for shortage of beds, it is possible.<br><br>Any way, I know of a doctor who has left SGH told me the way they work really is terrible.   Hey, this is from the mouth of a doctor who worked there.    I have asked him questions about attitude of the staff there, I was told it is real bad.  The problem with SGH is being the largest and oldest hospital in Singapore, so they thought they are the top on the list and blah blah blah so this explains the bad attitude of the staff.<br><br>Their service and working there really suuck!!!    It is not a good place to be hospitalised, go for consultation or work there.  I am not saying all is bad but about 80% to 85% is real bad.   Those few good foreign doctors I know of have resigned and gone back already, they can't stand the way they work and the dirty politics there.    It is a shame to lose talents like that!
