While, given your sycophantic tendencies, it's probably hard for you to come to terms with the fact that the waiting times at NHS institutions today aren't anything close to the May 2004 figures cited, it must be even harder for gnomes to accept that <strong>waiting times have indeed been reduced</strong> - even if that's a result of an increase in hiring more doctors. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Secondly, so how does paying your National Insurance render NHS "not free"? While the NIC provides an avenue of tax for the government to fund its NHS program, there's <strong>nothing that precludes one from seeking treatment whose value outweighs what one pays for NIC</strong>, is there? I don't suppose a monkey could <strong>distinguish taxation from healthcare</strong>, eh? <strong>To convolute the picture (and safeguard your argument) further, why not go further and make a case of how socially irresponsible it must be for the NIC - along with the other taxes and duties - to be funding the dole and other social benefits?</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Then again, why should I be surprised sycophants would regard it a better deal to pay for your paid public healthcare through Medisave (which provides medical coverage to a level you can afford) than paying for National Insurance (a scheme which exempts the unemployed and low-income earners from paying, but still offers the same extensive medical coverage that is the NHS) which offers extensive and free medical care through the NHS.<br><br>Thirdly, for all the ills and inadequacies within the NHS (which no one ever claims to be perfect), it must be a paradise to have access to a paid healthcare whose emergency department delivers timely responses within 7 hours, eh? I'm sure someone down with severe stroke or other cardiac issues would welcome these facilities over one which doesn't charge at the point of delivery and respond in under 7 hours.<br><br>Given your specious - albeit foolishly courageous - polemics, I'd be amazed that you have got anything that remotely resembles a brain (much less one that functions).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Thats absurd isn't it.Ok,so why don't polyclinic get xray facilities? Wouldn't that be better? Save time like you say?<br>Can't you face the cold hard truth? While waiting for the specialist to see me,there was a man whose whole right leg was bleeding,again not so much,and the nurses/doctors didn't even offer him minor dressing.His son had to get tissues and clean the blood.<br><br>To say our taxes are low?

Shooting yourself in both feet?<br><br>First, waiting times in the NHS have fallen because they have spent millions of pounds hiring more doctors like us. Second, the NHS is not free...if you earn above Â£100 a week (the 'earnings threshold') and up to Â£670 per week you pay 11 per cent of this amount as 'Class 1' NICs (<a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/Taxes/BeginnersGuideToTax/DG_4015904" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/Taxes/BeginnersGuideToTax/DG_4015904</a>). Third, there is a waiting list for the first consultation to see a consultant, not even to talk about waiting list for the hip replacement. How long is the waiting list? Oh sure, it has fallen...only a third of patients now have to wait one year to see theor consultants. Great, isn't it?<br><br>In any case, imbeciles like you don't have to worry about long waits at A/E. We may be doctors but we aren't not God. There is no cure for the lack of a brain.</div></blockquote>The waiting time must have increased exponentially since you started work.</div>
