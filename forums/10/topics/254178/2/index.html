Society plays a huge role, not just the government or hospital's practices, though they each has a part to play which resulted in today's problems.<br><br>By the way, A&amp;E department handling of cases are efficient, it's just external factors that resulted in what we see as inefficiencies.</div>

Dude,they did a year 3 course before starting life as nurses and some have already spent enough time at a hospital.Like you,i don't know if you're a healtcare professional or not but you just said you saw a Bangladeshi waiting behind whose head was bleeding non-stop.<br><br>And,IF there is some sort of system,the serious cases should be seen first.Sad to say,there isn't.Absolute nonsense that you come in a Civil Defence ambulance means you are serious.By the time you wait for the ambulance to arrive,you would had already departed,15minutes to arrive,another 15 to get to the hospital.<br><br>And,of course i have seen that your nationality plays a part as well.I bet if the Bangladeshi was some white dude (no offence),chances were high that he would had been rushed for treatment.But to them a Bangladeshi is someone illiterate and perhaps not important? But they may think 'Oh what if the white guy gives poor say about the country?'.See.

But a hospital isn't a flat. A flat's path is wide enough for wheelchairs to go past, but not hospital beds. They need to be as spacious as possible for things to go on smoothly.

But after 40 plus years ... the system cannot deliver. There's no connection between those in the system and the patients," he said.<br><br>But it's the way free healthcare systems work, he added, noting that Singapore must not go down that path, even though there are calls for free C class wards in public hospitals here.<br><br>"It's how the system works ... They did not discriminate against us," he noted of his London experience.<br><br>This contrasted sharply with how quickly Singaporeans - including national carrier Singapore Airlines - reacted to the situation.<br><br>Even though doctors initially advised that Mrs Lee stay put in London for three weeks, Mr Lee decided fly her back once her condition stabilised.<br><br>And then there was the big worry that she would get a spasm onboard, he recounted.<br><br>But he needn't have worried. Within 48 hours, SIA had fitted out SQ321 with medical support of oxygen tanks and other fixtures for a drip.<br><br><strong>"No other airline would have done this," Mr Lee said, looking visibly touched.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">wonder if the airline would do this for anyone who is not a minister?</span><br><br>On board were also two Intensive Care nurses from Changi General Hospital, two doctors, as well as officials from SIA who made sure all the equipment worked.[/b][/b]</blockquote>As with my first post in this thread, that's a classic account by a fascist disconnected from reality.<br><br>Actually, in accounts I read from other free press - and I literally mean media free from control by the fascist in question - 10 Downing Street actually did not intervene in his case at all. The above account's just some embellished bollocks churned out by his pet mouthpieces to cultivate his "cult" status.<br><br>Oh, has that thug actually accounted for the charges incurred by the public for that makeshift SIA aircraft which he'd been pledging to pay from his own pocket for lightyears?</div>
