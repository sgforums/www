Do you?<br><br>========================================<br>Jan 11, 5:46 AM EST<br><br>Soros says Singapore's use of libel suits against opposition politicians curbs free speech<br><br>By GILLIAN WONG<br>Associated Press Writer<br><br>SINGAPORE (AP) -- U.S. billionaire philanthropist George Soros said Wednesday that Singapore could not be an open society as long as its leaders used libel suits against opposition politicians.<br><br>"The use of libel ... can be a tremendous hindrance to freedom of expression," Soros said in response to questions at a seminar. "Obviously, Singapore doesn't qualify as an open society."<br><br>The U.S. State Department and Amnesty International have previously accused Singapore's top politicians of using defamation lawsuits to remove their opponents from public life.<br><br>Gillian Ong, a spokeswoman for Singapore's Home Affairs Ministry, said officials were discussing whether to respond to Soros' comments. Singapore's leaders have said they sue because it is the most effective way to protect their reputations.<br><br>"If I had to select one particular spot where Singapore could take a step forward, it would be in not using that method to suppress freedom of expression," Soros said. "There is now a desire for greater openness and I think that there is enlightened leadership, and I hope that they will take that next step."<br><br>Opposition leader Joshua B. Jeyaretnam lost his parliamentary seat in 2001 when he was bankrupted after being unable to pay damages that resulted from lawsuits filed against him by members of the ruling party in 1997.<br><br>Under Singapore law, the civil rights activist's status as bankrupt prevents him from running for political office.<br><br>Jeyaretnam's creditors include the founding father of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, the city-state's then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>Jeyaretnam was sued for revealing at an election rally that his colleague had filed a criminal complaint accusing the ruling party leaders of defamation.<br><br>At least two other opposition leaders have been sued for libel by the ruling party, including Tang Liang Hong of the Worker's Party and Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore Democratic Party.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is slowly but surely opening up. Crazy horse troupe, the use of words like shit and fuck are no longer censored in the movies, the almost nude paint models shown in the Superhost competition, and the soon to be built IRs with the casinos show Singapore is becoming liberal.<br><br>But what i think Singaporeans need to change is their attitude. Last week, when singapore held the anti-terrorist drills, there is an uproar over the fact that there were disruptions to some people going to work, and if there is a need for such drills. And also this week, when people were evacuated from Ngee Ann due to a small fire in Seoul Garden, people took their time, and some even took photos posing next to fire engine. The mentality is that nothing COULD ever happen to them. The thing is, people have to realise what is important, and what is not, and posing for photos or KBKB about a 'needless' drill is definitely not the most important thing in the world.</div>

Its like refusing to identify problems and assuming everything is rosy.
