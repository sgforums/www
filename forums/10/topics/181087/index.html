            <div class='col-md body'>Extract from Sunday Time 5 Mar 2006 Page 1<br><br>PM to rivals: Contest all 84 seats<br><br>By Lydia Lim<br>Senior Political Correspondent<br><br>PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday challenged the opposition to contest all 84 seats that are up for grabs in the coming general election.<br><br>'I hope that when elections are called, the opposition will field candidates in all the constituencies, so that all the PAP candidates will be contested and we can test the strength of the voters' support for the PAP,' he told The Sunday Times.<br><br>The polls will be his first as Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the People's Action Party.<br><br>His comments, in an e-mailed reply to questions from The Sunday Times, follow Friday's release of the Electoral Boundaries report.<br><br>While many of the boundaries have shifted, the changes did not affect the maths: the number of single-seat constituencies remains unchanged at nine, and there are still 14 group representation constituencies (GRCs) with either five or six seats each.<br><br>The two opposition-held wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir have stayed intact.<br><br>'Whatever the boundaries, the PAP fights to win in every constituency, including Hougang and Potong Pasir,' Mr Lee said.<br><br>Some political observers said the lack of major changes reflected the Government's confidence. Mr Lee would only say the constituency contours were decided by the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee.<br><br>The panel of five civil servants is meant to be non-partisan and recommend adjustments based on population changes.<br><br>There is still no sign of when the Prime Minister will call the election. He would only say that in the lead up to the polls, the PAP will announce its line-up of new candidates - expected to number at least 20 - and its party manifesto.<br><br>His challenge to the opposition to take on the PAP in more wards has been a running theme of ministers' comments in recent months.<br><br>Over the past four general elections, the number of walkovers has risen steadily. It went from 11 or 14 per cent of seats in 1988 to 55 or about two-thirds of seats in 2001.<br><br>Some Singaporeans have expressed frustration at never having voted because they live in repeatedly uncontested wards.<br><br>The PAP itself has voiced misgivings about a growing number of its candidates entering Parliament without an electoral baptism of fire.<br><br>Judging from opposition activities yesterday, it seems likely that the focus will once again be on the single seats and, at most, a handful of GRCs.<br><br>The Singapore Democratic Alliance has laid claim to the two new single-member wards of Bukit Panjang and Yio Chu Kang, citing an earlier opposition pact.<br><br>But the Singapore Democratic Party is also eyeing Bukit Panjang.<br><br>As for the PAP's plans, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Jurong GRC MP Lim Boon Heng said yesterday 'the party has not finalised its list as to who stands where'.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee reiterated the significance of the coming election. 'This election is about choosing the team to lead Singapore ahead into a bright but challenging future. It is about staying together, and moving ahead,' he said.<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br><span style="color: red;">PM could sense the fustration of voters not having a chance to vote due to the numbers of walkover during past elections. What could be done to avoid the same suitation again?</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My sense is that they could feel the voters fustration that our elections were mere gimmick given that even incompetent can be voted in using the the GRC system.<br><br>They sense that both old and new voters are fustrated with the wayang elections after elections (EP &amp; GE) whereby you are given the right to vote but unfortunately your GRC or canididate gets walkover because the opposition cannot get enough canididates to compete or there is no suitable canididate can be found who are willing to serve.<br><br>It shock me to see that long time MP aka Mini-star can crumble under pressure during election when they suddenly become SMC and had to compete  because they have been MP but does not carry any experience or battle scars in the elections.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LinYu:</div><div class="quote_body">Extract from Sunday Time 5 Mar 2006 Page 1<br><br>PM to rivals: Contest all 84 seats<br><br>By Lydia Lim<br>Senior Political Correspondent<br><br>PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday challenged the opposition to contest all 84 seats that are up for grabs in the coming general election.<br><br>'I hope that when elections are called, the opposition will field candidates in all the constituencies, so that all the PAP candidates will be contested and we can test the strength of the voters' support for the PAP,' he told The Sunday Times.<br><br>The polls will be his first as Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the People's Action Party.<br><br>His comments, in an e-mailed reply to questions from The Sunday Times, follow Friday's release of the Electoral Boundaries report.<br><br>While many of the boundaries have shifted, the changes did not affect the maths: the number of single-seat constituencies remains unchanged at nine, and there are still 14 group representation constituencies (GRCs) with either five or six seats each.<br><br>The two opposition-held wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir have stayed intact.<br><br>'Whatever the boundaries, the PAP fights to win in every constituency, including Hougang and Potong Pasir,' Mr Lee said.<br><br>Some political observers said the lack of major changes reflected the Government's confidence. Mr Lee would only say the constituency contours were decided by the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee.<br><br>The panel of five civil servants is meant to be non-partisan and recommend adjustments based on population changes.<br><br>There is still no sign of when the Prime Minister will call the election. He would only say that in the lead up to the polls, the PAP will announce its line-up of new candidates - expected to number at least 20 - and its party manifesto.<br><br>His challenge to the opposition to take on the PAP in more wards has been a running theme of ministers' comments in recent months.<br><br>Over the past four general elections, the number of walkovers has risen steadily. It went from 11 or 14 per cent of seats in 1988 to 55 or about two-thirds of seats in 2001.<br><br>Some Singaporeans have expressed frustration at never having voted because they live in repeatedly uncontested wards.<br><br>The PAP itself has voiced misgivings about a growing number of its candidates entering Parliament without an electoral baptism of fire.<br><br>Judging from opposition activities yesterday, it seems likely that the focus will once again be on the single seats and, at most, a handful of GRCs.<br><br>The Singapore Democratic Alliance has laid claim to the two new single-member wards of Bukit Panjang and Yio Chu Kang, citing an earlier opposition pact.<br><br>But the Singapore Democratic Party is also eyeing Bukit Panjang.<br><br>As for the PAP's plans, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Jurong GRC MP Lim Boon Heng said yesterday 'the party has not finalised its list as to who stands where'.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee reiterated the significance of the coming election. 'This election is about choosing the team to lead Singapore ahead into a bright but challenging future. It is about staying together, and moving ahead,' he said.<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br><span style="color: red;">PM could sense the fustration of voters not having a chance to vote due to the numbers of walkover during past elections. What could be done to avoid the same suitation again?</span></div></blockquote>Lwflee to PM: DIAM LAH! See Beh wayang. Army teach you so many things you learn to wayang?! Mei zong yong!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah.. its a trap lah. They purposely issue the challange. If they take up to it, it will drain their resources and lose more deposit boxes.

In chinese, it is called "making the first move". It would not be wrong if the other parties has the resources to take up his offer.<br><br>Like in a dance floor, go for tango, one to one. Your step will be more perfect, you won't fall. Don't disturb the elderly man dance step, as this is his last dance.<br><br>I would think going for pie is better than going for tip bits. Children will need healthy food to grow. Tip bits got no meat inside. Can considered passing the tip bits to your pal if you do wanted to throw it away. As the adult, should bring the kids to eat the pie. Then the kids will be healthier.<br><br>As if for the pool of money in any poker game, I think the players will have showhand this time and no other time. My advise is keep the royal flush till the last 2 games.<br><br>There is a lot to learn from our late co-founder, his speeches, his practises, his way of life. He can be the mirror for you to use. I think he is still the best idol that have a lot of ideas and it can't be wrong.  Keep it down to earth.<br><br>Don't shoot me if you don't understand the contents. I would not explain further in detail. For your own cracking.<br><br></div>
