            <div class='col-md body'>Taiwan's President Chen shot during campaigning; presidential election to go ahead on Saturday<br><br>TAIPEI : Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian was shot in the stomach on Friday during campaigning but is conscious in hospital, a top presidential aide said.<br><br>"We confirm that at 1.45pm the president when campaigning in Tainan was shot," presidential secretary general Chiou I-jen told a press conference in Taipei.<br><br>He said that Chen was conscious and was being treated in hospital. The bullet has been found, he said.<br><br>Chiou said Saturday's presidential election was due to go ahead as planned. He said Vice President Annette Lu had also been injured.<br><br>Earlier, a spokesman for Chen's Democratic Progressive Party said the president and vice president had been hit by a firecracker during campaigning.<br><br>Chen, 53, and Lu were taken to Chi Mei hospital in Tainan.<br><br>However a presidential aide, speaking outside the hospital, said Chen was able to walk into the hospital and was not seriously hurt.<br><br>"There is no big problem. The president is fine, only the vice president was helped into the hospital. People should calm down," said the aide, declining to give his name.<br><br>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said Chen had been hit in the stomach <strong>with a firecracker</strong>.<br><br>However DPP lawmaker Wang Sing-nan, who was with Chen at the hospital, said the president had been shot.<br><br>"The bullet hit the ankle of Vice President Annette Lu before hitting Chen Shui-bian's stomach," said Wang.<br><br>Both Chen and opposition challenger Lien Chen on Friday spent doing last-minute campaigning in the south of the island ahead of Saturday's presidential election in which the two rivals are reported to be running neck and neck.<br><br>The campaign has been long and spiteful, with much acrimony over Chen's plans to hold a referendum vote separate from the presidential poll centred on<br>relations between the island and mainland China.<br><br>The referendum is seen as an attempt by Chen to push the island further down the road towards independence, something China has threatened to oppose by military force.<br><br>The referendum has been criticised by France, Japan, Germany, the European Union and, most crucially in a rare rebuke, by its biggest ally, protector and<br>arms supplier the United States.<br><br>The result of the election - and the two-question referendum that runs alongside it - is being closely monitored by China, which still claims the island as part of its territory. - AFP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am wondering if the assasination attempt is a show created by him and his party to gain sympathy votes from the people and putting the blame on either mainland China or the opposition party. Most professional killers hired to finish a person off will go for the head. Seems that over here, no attempt is made to finish him.</div>
