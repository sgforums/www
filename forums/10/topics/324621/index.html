              <p>Very often we will today see the frequent attempts by the government to
                  use cover agents to slam or counter critics for speaking up on
                  wrongfulness of governing policies with the excuse that the government
                  should be entitled to the same freedoms to reply as the critics.<br> <br> Let us examine whether the government has been prevented by any critics from their freedoms to reply to criticisms?<br> <br> To begin with, freedom of speech in the ordinary business of running a
                  country or conducting businesses of an economy is more or less the
                  totality of communication being exercised through publishing news and
                  information by the broadcast and print media.<br> <br> Has the PAP not dominated such broadcast and print media? Has it not
                  many government websites to purvey all that it wants people to believe
                  in whatever they may be doings to stay in power and control in the
                  running of the country?<br> <br> What has the people done to deprive the PAP or government it must
                  complain in internet blogging that it should be entitled to the same
                  freedom to internet posting in discussing over government policies over
                  the net.<br> <br> Being the government it is its duty to answer to any complaints or feedbacks to serve the citizens.<br> <br> In fact they can the civil defamation laws as the trump cards to sue
                  anyone whom they regard as threats even on people as civic as Mr.
                  Brown. Administratively they have even greater power to deal with
                  critics like dismissing or transferring civil servants speaking out of
                  line or not seen as acting in concert with their own interest.<br> <br> They would sue anyone in their own appointed courts for even the
                  slightest innuendos as happened in Tang Liang Hong case with civil laws
                  narrowly interpreted as libellous for remarks made against them even in
                  the course of electioneering without giving their oppositions defence
                  such as fair comment or public interest.<br> <br> It is therefore quite incorrect to adopt the underlying assumption that
                  government is not given the equal opportunity or freedoms of replies to criticisms in the media or internet.<br> <br> The plain fact is the reverse is true. The PAP and PAP government has been enjoying
                  more-than-equal and often one-sided freedom to slam critics' views over all media without giving the critics the chance to reply.</p>
              <p>With such total domination of the media it is to be seen that the government is not satisfied and it is still trying to take away the remaining freedoms whatever left from the people. It is finding new way and means and excuses to use cover agents to slam critics
                  even critics like Mr. Brown who is just a citizen with views concerning
                  governing of the country.<br> <br> The real issue here today is whether PAP and PAP government should be
              given such    "more equal than equal" right or privilege over all media to practise such wrong doing against the citizens in the manner
                  of speech.<br> <br> So weighing both the freedoms of speech or expressions on both sides
                  there is no need to be so overly concerned that when critics speak up
                  there must be opportunities for PAP and PAP government to rebut or
                  reply.<br> <br> If MM Lee does not use such defamation suits so often against his
                  political opponents will we today be running out of political leaders
                  of calibre?<br> <br> For every good and bad policy there is always a price to pay. If we
                  want to practise a "no free lunch" system of government, we may end up
                  having a greedy money-grabbing government on the other side of the
                  equation.<br> <br> It is quite wrong for the government to control the media or pass
                  draconian laws just for their own purposes without looking at the other
                  side of the equation what we stand to lose.<br> <br> It does not make sense that we allow a one-sided policy like "no free
                  lunch" or "meritocracy" to dominate our political system for so long
                  and today we as a people are suffering from naivety of accepting such
                  propaganda.<br> <br> It is the duty of all citizens to speak the truths against wrongfulness
                  of government without fear or favor in whatever forums or occasions to
                  put us back on proper path of growth and vibrancy as Hong Kong people
                  are now enjoying.<br> <br> Just look at Deerhunter. He obviously has been sent here (not of his
                  own natural volition) to slam at citizens' views and opinions with
                  vulgarities and name callings.<br> <br> Is the Freedom of Speech balanced with complete control of PAP and PAP
                  government of the public media leaving the internet now as the only
                  available free venues to express their views and opinions ?<br> <br> Is there a justification for ministers to send cyber-agents to come to
                  slam people using hidden unequal selfish political power and probably
                  using publicly paid servants to do so.</p>

              <p>Personally i believe fully in what you have to say here.</p>
              <p>Yes, the PAP government has done very well in the development of Singapore and i agree with much of their long tern plans (Building the IR, F1 racetrack , attracting investments for solar panel constructions, bioscience and the 3D industry) which would have otherwise be blocked in parliament and take forever to start in a liberal democracy.</p>
              <p>Some of you may disagree with me, that is your right but i believe LKY has done well for this country and deserves the celebrity status he has now. I disagree with how he handles certain things but can agree with the reasons on why he had to do so.</p>
              <p>The current government are implementing ridiculous laws to protect themselves and i'm begining to think that if i want to get the police to come stop a robbery or murder i'd have to tell them i'm staging a protest to get any worthy response. I often shudder to think how easy it is for me to stage terrorist attacks considering how ineffective our police force is becoming.</p>
              <p>Also, the recent Mas Selemat escape is an immense scandal, it proves how fragile our security is and how ill prepared to deal with people who simply have a better survivor instinct. Worst of all, WKS did not have to take any responsibility for allowing the escape and failing to recapture him. Those of all that has been through NS would understand that when a unit is slack, it means the entire command structure has a problem and it always starts from the top</p>
              <p>All that said however, i'm still against a liberal democracy and free media. Of course, my definition of free media would probably be somewhere near the extreme of "say what you want and to hell with the consequences". A lot of times, the Truth hurts and is difficult to stomach and accomplishes nothing but a moral responsibility.</p>
              <p>I dislike how liberal democracy allows mostly lawyers to get in Parliament, how  the system itself only allows reactive policies  and proactive policies are always shut down. <br>Jimmy Carter (US President) have voiced out the problem and M.King Hubbert ( a geoscientist) have predicted that  the US would have to be an importer of oil by 1974 but in the end the Americans have realised they have done nothing to prepare for Peak Oil and instead have created a population that consumes more energy per person than anywhere in the world. Their electrical grids are not even prepared to deal with switching to EV support.</p>
              <p>America practices supposedly free media but can we really say that? How many networks have portrayed the Iraq War from the Iraqis perspective? Who do you think gives their funding? </p>
              <p>Why i feel the China Communist Party would probably be able to survive far better than India? Because their leadership is led by scientists who could understand the cold hard numbers to avoid disasters, not by lawyers who know what to say to make the people happy but have no freaking idea how to plan ahead.</p>
              <p>I'm 25, previously i purposely throw my vote to the opposition even though i had no freaking idea what the opposition starts for. Now i realised how stupid i am to throw my vote in such an irresponsible manner. I do not want an Anwar or Chee Soon Juan to be be anywhere near the government.</p>
              <p>If the opposition wants respect, let them get people who can argue as well as Chiam See Tong and Slyvia Lim. I believe the people of Singapore is slowly maturing to "might" be able to handle a <em>more </em>liberal democracy and soon the opposition would be able to fill their ranks with far more competent membership. But i'm crossing my fingers until then.</p>

              <p>I cannot agree with the assumptions underlying your statement that MM Lee has done the right things to restructure the economy or bring about a more just and equitable society for all to work as a united country.</p>
              <p>It is precisely because he has run dry of ideas from his taxing and profiteering system that the whole economy has lost the right kind of entrepreneurs or economic competitiveness that he has no choice but to be forced finally to resort to IR or keep quiet about so many prostitutes coming here to operate in our red light districts.</p>
              <p>Please read the alternative system of government under the thread "Minimalist Taxing Maximalist Facilitator Government is what we want" for more information about what he could have done to bring about such a society.</p>
              <p>As for your view that China now has better engineer/scientist leaders who are better able to provide many solutions to its immense problems, I fully agree with you on this observation. If we want to produce a more united country while bringing about competitiveness, we should not keep putting up so many lawyers to run our country.</p>
              <p>Lawyers by their training are protectionistic and litigious and tend to run the country treating their citizens as potential trouble-makers or adversaries to be controlled constantly with all sorts of laws and enforcements.</p>
              <p>Too many lawyers among our ministers and MPs will produce eventually a litigious society with avoiding of responsibilities through manipulations of laws rather than solving problems.</p>
              <p>We are being divided now as a country all because of too much doings and manipulating by the lawyers to get what they want to protect themselves and their own selfish agendas instead of serving the people. A house divided is a house in doom. This is what the lawyers will do because they perceive people as adversaries and pass all kinds of laws on theory "X" instead of theory "Y" approach which finally negative creativity and entrepreneurship running down the mass practical knowledge applications by the people which can only be created based on theory "Y".</p>
              <p>The whole government has to be overhauled with more scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs who know the real fizz and functions in every aspect of the economy and who will build up a whole infrastructure to tap on people's practical talents in every field and use them for successful team building and not so much fighting among the people as we are seeing now for years.</p>
              <p>Only when we place truly knowledgeable people who know how to listen and put up the right plans in all the right departments will we succeed.</p>

The word politics already told us, it is not just outright common sense we are talking about. What is right may not be right. There is alot of rolling and dealing and wheeling behind the scenes. So well yeah, we all just want better lives at the end of the day,</p>
