Sandip Roy is the host of "UpFront," New America Media's radio program on KALW 91.7-FM in San Francisco.<br><br>CALCUTTA--An India awash with Western-style malls and brand names has some new unlikely heroes. It's not Madonna or even Bill Gates but freedom fighters from pre-Independence India. The twenty-somethings who went to their deaths after gunning down British officials are suddenly sexy again. Or so Bollywood, India's film industry, would have us believe.<br><br>"Rang de Basanti" (or RDB as it's become known) is the latest big-screen hit sweeping the country, and it raises a question that has all the media buzzing. Now that we have Maxim and Tommy Hilfiger is anything worth dying for anymore? It's not an idle question. By the last frame of RDB almost all its hipster, college-student protagonists are dead, going down in a hail of bullets after they take over a radio station at the crack of dawn.<br><br>The film has been such an instant blockbuster that some theaters in India have had to add a 6 a.m. show. In its opening weekend alone it raked in a phenomenal $4.79 million.<br><br>RDB is about a group of bored, cynical friends who are roped into acting in a film about freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, who was hanged in 1931 at the age of 24 for killing a British officer and throwing a bomb in the Central Assembly in Delhi. When the crew's friend, a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force, dies because of shoddy equipment, these Generation X Bhagat Singhs, electrified by the histories they are acting out, assassinate the corrupt defense minister.<br><br>Of course, the defense minister is Indian now. For the new RDB generation, the stand-in for the pith-helmet wearing tyrannical Brit is now its own government. A survey by India Today across 14 cities in India finds that 68 percent of young people view corruption as the greatest ill facing India.<br><br>But here's the twist. When asked if, given a chance, they would rather work in India or abroad, 80 percent still chose India. They are reading Hewitt Associates estimates that salaries in India will go up by 13.8 percent in 2006. They see a new report projecting "major power status" for both India and China by 2035. This new generation wants change not through moving to the United States but right here in India. They are, writes India Today, "looking ahead in anger."<br><br>They are also looking back to find their heroes. Impatient for change, they are looking not toward Gandhi and his patient satyagraha, or philosophy of non-violent resistance, but to long-dead young men with homemade bombs, breathing life into their crow-dropping spattered statues, islands lost in traffic and grimy with exhaust.<br><br>Bhagat Singh has already had two other celluloid incarnations, as have other long-dead heroes like Netaji Subhas Bose, who marched against the British during World War II, and Mangal Pandey from the 1857 War of Independence.<br><br>It's quite astonishing for me to see freedom fighters from the 1920s and 30s as the newly minted heroes for the new Levis-clad India. When I lived in India 15 years ago, Lenin-reading, homespun-cotton-wearing revolutionaries with pencil-thin mustaches and neatly-parted, oil-slick hair were the last people we wanted to emulate. At that time we drank Coca Cola knock-offs and wore jeans with labels like Lavis. Now India has all the real brands plus one more. "Celluloid has made Bhagat Singh the brand of the 21st century-a brand that blends the ancient with the contemporary," says singer Shaan in The Times of India.<br><br>Perhaps in this age of Osama and his terrorists, terrorists of another age, now reincarnated as freedom fighters hold a special appeal. "These guys are irreverent and want to break the rules," Siddharth, one of the stars of RDB, told The Telegraph. He is talking about the filmmakers of RDB, but he could be describing his own generation who have had enough of a byzantine bureaucracy with its armory of rules and endless scandals involving politicians and kickbacks.<br><br>But it's difficult to figure out how real this revolution really is. Sagarika Ghose, a columnist for the Hindustan Times dismisses RDB as "the ultimate made-in-media-India film," not "rooted in any kind of reality." It's hard to tell what the audiences sitting in plush new multiplexes, sipping their Coke and curry puff combo really make of the fiery speeches on the screen. Does what India Today calls the "Me Generation" really have the stomach for revolution and the sacrifice it calls for? My mother recalls how soon after Independence passionate movie-goers threw their slippers at the screen whenever the British-loving inspector appeared. The audience at RDB limited their rebellion to answering their cell phones in the middle of the movie.<br><br>The person I really wanted to ask about this newfound patriotism was my great aunt. She had been beaten up by the police on the streets of British India. But I didn't get to see her. After decades of public service (always clad in plain white cotton saris) and now over 90, she has moved to an ashram on the city outskirts. That was too far away, too difficult to get to (Mapquest has yet to come to Calcutta), and on the couple of weekends I was in town we had more pressing things to do -- like going to see "Rang de Basanti."</div>
