              <p>In Germany's history, there was a rise of an external force, the Nazi party. It was an organization which sprung very rapidly out of nowhere, and quickly entrenched itself in key levers of power.</p>
              <p>Actually, we can say the reason why Germany entered into facism, totalitarianism, and dictatorship, with a strong individual leader (Adolf Hitler), is because of the key role that Nazi Party played, and especially that Nazi has its own security force and intelligence force, such as the SS and Gestapo. They were completely loyal to Adolf Hitler.</p>
              <p>In the initial struggle, Nazi Party was not alone. There were other parties spanning a wide spectrum. But eventually Nazi Party managed to outmaneuver the communists and the others, and cornered them all. Then they became the supreme ruling party.</p>
              <p>Nazi had its own apparatus and they work to protect Hitler's and the Party's power, by controlling the media, harassing the opposition, arresting people with no good reason, and so on. Hitler had its own special force, the SS.</p>
              <p>Eventually Hitler became such a powerful and charismatic "paramount" leader in Germany that his dictat became unchallanged. His "Fuhrer's will" is supreme. He singlehandedly led the nation. People adored him and took him as a hero. He did great things and motivated Germany to rebuild and rise.</p>
              <p>Hitler's ambitions led Germany to disastrous wars, which worried the German Army.</p>
              <p>German Army, consisted of the old military and not all of them supported the Nazi. Some of them tried to launch a coup and remove Hitler and stop the war, but they failed. Hitler used his party's forces, the SS to launch a crackdown. He arrested all his opponents in the army and executed them.</p>
              <p>Actually, I did not know all these things.</p>
              <p>I did not know Nazi Party was a relative newcomer, that there were other components in the German society, and that they were repressed by the SS. I did not know that Hitler had to rely on his Party's apparatus for reliability because the professional force was distrusted by him.</p>
              <p>This reminds me of some other case in some other countries. There is some country who keep a strong control of the media, who has a supreme singular ruling party, who has "special force" in its police force, who harass the opposition regularly, and who had arrested people for no good reason and label them as "communists" and the like. That country also keep a foreign mercenary force detached from the professional force in an obscure structure, not transparent to anyone. It also has a strong charismatic individual leader, whose dictum wont be challanged by anyone, similar to the situation with "Fuhrer's will".  People take him as a hero and adore him.</p>

              <p>Hitler used to aspire to become an artist in the 1900s.</p>
              <p>He wanted to enter the Vienna College of Fine Arts and showed his drawings of the city of Vienna, hoping to enter it desperately.</p>
              <p>I've seen it at a video documentary before. Mind you, it is way above average.</p>
              <p>However, it was not enough to enter and at that time, it was said to be populated by Jews. Thus, he harbored hatred for Jews.</p>
              <p>This can be applied to Singapore as such competition from foreigners in this manner can even be a bread and butter issue as space is constained.</p>

              <p>chinese have always been clever since begginin of history.they invented started wearing silk clothes in china while the rest of the world were still wearing animal skin.they invented and used paper while the rest of world were still using stone tablets.they had huge navy which went thru from india to africa.</p>
              <p>Empire's trade routes were extended in the maritime ports of Southeast Asia as far as the Malay Peninsula's international port of Tun-sun.</p>
              <p>china did not put their flag on other country despite coming to all in an amada of ships with thousands of soldiers and support sides.they were thus peaceful.only once was a battle fought in sri lanka with the chinese navy armada.</p>
              <p>In 1411 Zheng He [head of an immense Ming Dynasty Chinese armada - a naval expeditionary force] had intervened in an earlier war on the island, pitting Hindu Tamils from the north against two mutually hostile Sinhales Buddhist realms in the center and south. Zheng was forced to act when one of the Buddhist rulers, a rebel cheiftain, attacked a Ming shore party. In a stroke of military genius, the main body of Sri Lankan troops was lured into a fruitless assault on the fleet, leaving their capital open to easy conquest.</p>

              <p>In 1911 a British engineer out for a stroll near the harbor city of Galle chanced upon a strange granite slab with inscriptions in Chinese, Tamil and Persian. It proved to be a commemorative stela [monument stone] raised by Zheng in 1410 at Dondra Head.</p>
              <p>The stela's three inscriptions were addressed, respectively, to Buddha, Siva, and Allah, offering thanks for their compassion and moral virtue, and seeking their protective blessing for the voyages' aims. The chief Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim shrines of Sri Lanka, the stela recorded, were to be presented with equal offerings of gold, silver, silk, and other precious gifts...</p>

              <p>they knew what was wrong and right and they certainly arent no where close to being regarded as jews from history.</p>

              <p>So, when Minister Mentor (MM) Lee Kuan 
              Yew did the same in an 
              interview with National Geographic in July 2009, one would have to ask 
              the same question of the MM: “Will you ever stop bashing Singaporeans?” 
              The question should also be directed at People’s Action Party Members of
               Parliament as well, such as Mr Sam Tan and Mr Charles Chong. (More of 
              that later.)</p>
              <p>The MM, in his National Geographic interview, effectively compared 
              Singaporeans to animals when he said, “No, I think the spurs are not 
              stuck on your hinds. They are part of the herd, why-go-faster?” He was 
              answering a question about Singaporeans’ seeming lack of drive. And in 
              quintessential MM arrogance, he went on, “We tell them look they have 
              got to work harder or they’ll become stupid.” He added, “Singaporeans 
              are champion grumblers.”</p>
              <p>This is, of course, not the first time that the MM has disparaged 
              Singaporeans but what made this latest instance more disconcerting is 
              that he chose to do so in an interview with a foreign publication. It 
              makes one wonder if the MM, living on his laurels, has become so 
              arrogant that he does not feel there would be any political consequences
               to this.</p>
              <p><em>More importantly, is the MM painting a picture of Singaporeans as
               a defective people to the world?</em></p>
              <p>This is not the first time that the MM has used the word “stupid” 
              when speaking of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In his 1983 National Day Rally speech, when he was Prime Minister, MM
               Lee said, “If you don’t include your women graduates in your breeding 
              pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid 
              society…So what happens? There will be less bright people to support 
              dumb people in the next generation. That’s a problem.”</p>
              <p>But that is not the worst of it. In the 1997 book, The Man And His 
              Ideas, he was quoted as having said, “Mine is a very matter-of-fact 
              approach to the problem. If you can select a population and they’re 
              educated and they’re properly brought up, then you don’t have to use too
               much of the stick because they would already have been trained. It’s 
              like with dogs. You train it in a proper way from small. It will know 
              that it’s got to leave, go outside to pee and to defecate. No, we are 
              not that kind of society. We had to train adult dogs who even today 
              deliberately urinate in the lifts.”</p>
              <p>And more recently, his comment about Singaporeans wanting more 
              opposition or alternative voices in Parliament, that “the cure for all 
              this talk is really a good dose of incompetent government” again brought
               to the fore the thinking behind the man, his attitude towards 
              Singaporeans. He warned that “your security will be at risk and our 
              women will become maids in other people’s countries, foreign workers.”</p>
              <p>Grumblers. Animals. Stupid. Dogs. Maids.</p>
              <p>There is no politician in the world who would get away with calling 
              his own citizens these. Yet, by the looks of it, MM Lee’s remarks over 
              the years have not met with much outcry. It is a serious problem if 
              Singaporeans are so mellowed or disempowered to the point of being 
              nonchalant to such disparagement – even if it is from a founding father 
              of modern Singapore.</p>
              <p>Where is our pride?</p>
              <p>Yet, it seems that the MM is not the only one whose arrogant ways 
              have taken root. Memorably, People’s Action Party MPs too have displayed
               signs of such conceitedness and contempt of their fellow Singaporeans.</p>
