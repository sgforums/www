              <p>It's painfully obvious how you're living in denial, but you're in a tight spot here - because of your denial, you're denying your problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As for more denial, well, go back through the 80-odd pages of your mud slinging fest and see for yourself if it's just fymk and myself you had a problem with.  Hell you traumatised poor KB by first having a go at him and then pathetically asking him out for a date - his skin just about crawled right off him at that prospect. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> The FACTS are there even if you're too neurotic to see the truth. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Haha! I knew it when I saw the thread title that this is going to degenerate into a screaming/shouting/arguing thread. Keke</p>
              <p>Anyway, my take on those who agreed and supported along the lines of "Poly go out can earn something, A levels can't so places should be given to A levels people."</p>
              <p>I'm sure u know this as a general fact after your O levels, so why pick JC? Can I say some of you look down on Poly considering it as an inferior place to go to as compare to JC? How come now after your As when you're not able to get into Uni, u complain that poly people are squeezing u out?</p>
              <p>A forumer even did some calculations about a poly grad earning more working rather than spending an extra 3 years studying Uni. Can I appeal to that forumer that his calculation is grossly inaccurate. I shall not go into the details, but let me put it across this way. Those going into uni are the top few percentages in Poly, and according to the ST article, accounts for about 25% of their corhort. Do you think they had not considered this before? Let's look at it another way. There are alot of diploma holders, people with several years of work experience, graduates from ITE taking Night/Part time degrees from the unis. What do you think is their reasoning for doing so, since according to the way you calculate, they should be earning more?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This Poly/JC squeeze issue will always be there and it will come up every year during the release of A level results. The issue is not even primarily on the number of places available for A level graduates in Uni, but is the number of places available for A level graduates in Uni for the <em>course of their choice</em>.</p>
              <p>Well, the complaints we are seeing in SG from A level graduates not able to get into the course of their choice again underlines the Complaining and Blame-Pushing Nature of the younger generation Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Teacher scold u - complain to parents - parents come to school to make a big fuss. Little bit not happy with retail staff - complain to supervisor to make the staff loss their job. Little bit not happy with boss - complain and spread gossip about them. Taxi fare increase - complain government. Late for work - complain bus come late. <em>It's everyone's fault but their own.</em></p>
              <p>In case the complainers haven't realised, we live in a performance oriented society, be it in SG, in SEA or in any developing/developed countries. If you're not able to best it amount others, then, too bad.</p>
              <p>Your parents are not able to help you. Neither are your grandparents nor your MPs.</p>
              <p>Accepted that you didn't managed to achieve what you want. Recognise you're not as good. Move on and do better in your next stage of life.</p>

              <p><br>A fair call to some extent, airgrinder, although I'd question if we're looking at the right criteria here, and where the raison d'etre of university education fits into the picture.</p>
              <p>Just doing a quick recap of the proposed reasons why one group or other should be deprived of places at university, we have:</p>
              <p>- someone needs to do the blue-collar work<br>- poly grads can go and earn money so they shouldn't go to university<br>- there's simply not enough space in universities</p>
              <p>At best, these are peripheral to getting a university education.</p>
              <p>When I was an undergrad, a hot-button topic was "education for sale".  There were two aspect to this:</p>
              <p>1) university places were going to those who could afford to pay full fees and;<br>2) university courses were being too fine-tuned to limited and specific industry requirements instead of providing students with an atmosphere in which they can explore, analyse and synthesise new ideas and concepts</p>
              <p>Now speaking as someone who's making a comfortable living in a specific and narrow field, I cannot fairly say that I have not gained by said fine-tuning of university courses.  However, as idealistic as it sounds, IMHO there's much more to being in university than getting ahead in the rat race.  I spend my spare time with formal and informal multidisciplinary groups, and there's a certain enjoyment in stepping out of one's own field and learning a thing or two about other subjects like law, medicine, engineering and, dare I say it, literature.  The generic analytical skills provided through a university education open the doors to much more than just jobs.</p>
              <p>That being the case, should the opportunities for education be dictated by criteria such as quotas for blue-collar workers, whether or not someone should be working instead of studying or inadequate access to such education?  Personally, I don't think so.</p>
