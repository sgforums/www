              <p>That's right 'A' level cert is equivalent to 'O' level cert in the job market.</p>

              <p>which uni issued the paper is also relevant, for new entrant into the mkt. when you have gained experience in your field, then relevant experience matters.</p>

              <p>Another way you can look at it is the fact that there is also a possibility that the latter can fail or do badly in his or her EMS related modules in polytechnic studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you know, everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, a person who is not lingustically inclined would not go for law, literature, medial journalism related degree or diploma, but rather choose others that could use their strengths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conversely, a person who fare badly for Maths but scored well for English and Sciences can still do well in courses that do not requires advanced or intricate understanding of mathematical skills. If there's no mathematics-related module in the course curriculum, how else can that weakness adversely affects one's result in polytechnic for that matter?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like you've said. You would choose the latter who is an average joe, rather than the former who have demonstrated ability for English and Science. So i guess it contradicts with what Mister Gedanken had implied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As far as i remembered, the whole education system is just like a bell-curve distribution. You just can't have everyone smacked right up at the upper percentile, it'll ruin the economy and social construct of the community.</p>

              <p>Opportunities are given from young. As you have mentioned it yourself, there are limited vacanies. The selection process starts way before your application for university. By the time you can complain that there isn't equal opportunities in entering a university, it merely means you have wasted many other opportunties before hand. We are not talking about the minorities that are more equal than others; we are talking about commoners like the rest of us. Do you seriously believe that you had less or more of a chance to enter a university than me the moment you were born?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I want to tell you is, this is not a case of 'equal opportunity' at all, but rather, a case of elitism, of which I'm standing on neutral grounds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, NUS and NTU do take into account CCA records; it is a bonus to entry. In addition, another form of ability is the ability to pull strings; there are definitely people who did it successfully and entered an academic institution.</p>
              <p>As in your example</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Then, let me give you an example. I have friends that scored
                                      16-17pointers for their L1R4, but failed Mathematics and went into
                                      ITE, while people who fare badly for their aggregate averaging
                                      around 22-26pointers for their L1R4 are allowed into
                                      Polytechnic, what gives?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>it merely means that the 22-26pointers who entered had more ability to enter.</p>
              <p>Let's say you apply for Stanford or Cornell university with perfect A level grades, and you do not get in. However, someone with lousier A level grades got in. Why? Their application process includes teacher's recommendations and essays on describing yourself. Academic ability alone does not guarantee you a place; many other factors count.</p>

              <p>By the way, NUS and NTU do take into account CCA records; it is a bonus to entry. In addition, another form of ability is the ability to pull strings; there are definitely people who did it successfully and entered an academic institution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As in your example</p>
              <p>it merely means that the 22-26pointers who entered had more ability to enter.</p>
              <p>Let's say you apply for Stanford or Cornell university with perfect A level grades, and you do not get in. However, someone with lousier A level grades got in. Why? Their application process includes teacher's recommendations and essays on describing yourself. Academic ability alone does not guarantee you a place; many other factors count.</p>

              <p>The part about NUS/NTU considering CCA records are under 'Discretionary Admission Scheme', an optional scheme for those who have excellent CCA records to boost their chances of admission, but primary criteria are academic results, nonetheless. Afterall, you're entering an academic institution, what else would they look for as the primary criteria?</p>

              <p>I do not understand what you're trying to bring across in this statement: "As in your example</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, it seems like you are saying that 22-26 pointers have more potential to enter something (lol i don't know what) compared to 16-17 pointers.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know, other factors count too, but ultimately your academic results is still the primary criteria, like it or not. It is a moot point.</p>

              <p>And in regards to your example, it is, still afterall an example. Perceived outcome of admissionary decision by Cornell or Stanford does not equate to the actuality of the outcome. This, neither you nor i can conclude unless we have substantial empirical evidence.</p>

              <p>22-26 pointers have
                      more potential to enter is totally different from them having more ability. Anyway that's beside the point.</p>
              <p>Yes, academic results is the primary criteria. But you are still missing the point that 'equal opportunity' still exists for most of us (not talking about white horses); everyone has the same opportunity to do well and go into a prestigious university. Whether they make use of that opportunity is a different matter.</p>
              <p>With regards to your last paragraph, do you understand how their
                      application process works? Have you ever applied for admission to these
                      universities? Perhaps if you have applied before, you would understand that academic qualifications is, although a main criteria, not a guarantee against those with lower qualifications than you. This is my main point.</p>

              <p>lao ying is trying to say while academic results should be of foremost concern for uni entry, universities also look into other factors like community involement, ECA awards, leadership qualities etc. cos universities want to create a healthy blend of undergraduates of various backgrounds to create diversity so each one can learn from one another.</p>
