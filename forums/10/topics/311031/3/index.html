              <p>lao ying is trying to say while academic results should be of
              foremost concern for uni entry, universities also look into other
              factors like community involement, ECA awards, leadership qualities
              etc. cos universities want to create a healthy blend of

              <p>Yes, academic results is the primary criteria. But you are still missing the point that 'equal opportunity' still exists for most of us (not talking about white horses); everyone has the same opportunity to do well and go into a prestigious university. Whether they make use of that opportunity is a different matter.</p>
              <p>With regards to your last paragraph, do you understand how their application process works? Have you ever applied for admission to these universities? Perhaps if you have applied before, you would understand that academic qualifications is, although a main criteria, not a guarantee against those with lower qualifications than you. This is my main point.</p>

              <p>actually, ccas and other what-nots are kind of important in the admission into uni, or rather the admission into the uni's courses. just look how competitive medicine, dentistry and law are. i doubt that mere st As are enough to enter the particular course, and thats alr not counting the interviews and essay tests one has to go through to enter.</p>
              <p>similarly, smu also requires individuals to have a particular edge over his/her respective competitors. in fact, smu has the slight  tendency to veer away from academic credentials and focus on other aspects of achievements in a person. this ranges from cca to representing singapore to starting a business etc.</p>
              <p>its just fking sad that even tho our gov promised us education from young, its merely a foundational one. when it comes to the tetiary level, you're all out on your own in the bloodthirsty cutthroat environment.</p>

              <p><br>You know something about proper courtesy when addressing an issue at hand? Instead, you chose to hurl mindless cursing and ramblings that makes you sound nothing really impressive, but much like an obnoxiously inane whiner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seeing whatever posts you've come up with, you're just some loud vessel with absolutely no substance to boast of. All you can do is just to hurl personal abusive words at people, and not remain within the topic of interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So where's your brain gone to? Read carefully on your mindless ramblings? You must be kidding me, dim-witted boy. Grow up and learn to handle argumentative discussion in a proper manner. If you don't show respect to others nobody will do to you.</p>

              <p>Don't give me all this bullshit about being *ahem* pleasant and avoiding personal attacks.  You're not just as bad as me - you're even worse because you do it and then get up on your high horse.</p>
              <p>Like I said, you're nothing but a low-down hypocrite.  Just keep proving me right. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
