            <div class='col-md body'>It is interesting to note the different approaches that foreign analysts and reports made about Temasek's report card use in comparison with our local mass media. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br>http://sg.biz.yahoo.com/041012/15/3npq4.html<br><br>Tuesday October 12, 8:30 PM<br>UPDATE: Singapore's Temasek Reveals Declining Returns<br>By Hasan Jafri and Abdul Hadhi<br>Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES<br><br>SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. for the first time<br>Tuesday offered a detailed peek into its finances, revealing that<br>while the state-owned investment company is Singapore's most<br>profitable firm, its returns have progressively declined.<br><br>The publicized annual report - a first in three decades - is likely<br>to renew a long-standing debate about whether the state or the<br>private sector is a better manager of funds. Temasek is one of the<br>region's most aggressive investors, outlaying S$3.3 billion across<br>Asia over the past two years, according to the report.<br><br>Analysts say the report is likely a prelude to Temasek's first-ever<br>bond sale, expected to be as big as US$3 billion. Debt rating<br>agencies Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's responded quickly to the<br>report with top-notch ratings on the company.<br><br>Temasek controls Singapore's biggest companies, including port<br>operator PSA Corp., Singapore Airlines Ltd. (S55.SG) and Singapore<br>Telecommunications Ltd. (T48.SG). Temasek-owned companies account for<br>47% of the Straits Times Index's market capitalization.<br><br>But the 72-page annual report portrays Temasek as a growing, dynamic<br>and active investor that over the next decade will own a diversified<br>portfolio of assets evenly split across Singapore, the rest of Asia<br>and the developed world.<br><br>"The annual report gives you some idea what Temasek is all about,"<br>said CLSA head of Singapore research Prabodh Agarwal. "People outside<br>are very curious about it."<br><br>Which Is The Better Fund Manager?<br><br>Interspersed with pictures of green leaves, orchids and regional<br>landmarks like the Taj Mahal and Malaysia's Petronas Towers, the<br>annual report shows that Temasek's return to its sole shareholder -<br>Singapore's Ministry of Finance - has fallen over the past decade.<br><br>Singapore has S$231 billion in liquid reserves alone, Standard &amp;<br>Poor's said last month, which are managed by Temasek and the ultra-<br>secretive Government of Singapore Investment Corp.<br><br>By S&amp;P's calculations, Singapore's investment strategy netted nominal<br>annual returns between 1.7% and 4% over the past five years, while<br>Hong Kong's privately managed reserves yielded an average nominal<br>annual return of 6.1%.<br><br>The GIC's financial returns remain a state-secret, but Temasek's<br>aren't any more. Temasek's returns over the past five years amounted<br>to 6%. It's unclear whether S&amp;P and Temasek are using the same<br>yardstick to measure returns on investment.<br><br>Temasek said its annual shareholders' return, measured by market<br>value, was 18% over a 30-year period, but declined sharply to just 3%<br>over the last 10 years. In the same 10-year period, the MSCI Asia ex-<br>Japan index, which includes top Asian companies, shrank 2.7%.<br><br>Sounding a theme popular with publicly-listed companies and<br>governments alike, Temasek blamed the declining returns on the Asian<br>financial crisis, the terror attacks in the U.S. in 2001 and the<br>outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in Asia.<br><br>Singapore's liberalized telecommunications sector, a property bubble<br>burst and asset impairment charges at power generation companies<br>added to the woes, Temasek said.<br><br>"However in the midst of these recent global and regional economic<br>setbacks, new opportunities have emerged in a bustling China and a<br>confident India, alongside a recovering ASEAN," Temasek Chairman S.<br>Dhanabalan said in the report, referring to the 10-country<br>Association of Southeast Asian Nations.<br><br>Over the past two years, since the wife of now-Prime Minister Lee<br>Hsien Loong, Ho Ching, became Temasek's chief executive, Temasek<br>became more aggressive in selling and buying assets and returns were<br>8%.<br><br>By Far Singapore's Largest Company<br><br>Regardless of its fluctuating performance, Temasek remains a<br>behemoth. With total assets of S$181 billion, Temasek is comparable<br>with some of the world's largest conglomerates, such as General<br>Electric (GE) of the U.S. and Germany's Siemens AG (SI), S&amp;P said<br>Tuesday.<br><br>S&amp;P handed Temasek its top AAA rating, while Moody's also awarded it<br>the top Aaa rating, ahead of what market participants speculate will<br>be Temasek's maiden bond sale. Temasek has confirmed its intention to<br>issue a bond but has provided no details of size or timing.<br><br>"The exceptionally strong rating on Temasek reflects the leading or<br>dominant market positions in the key business segments in which the<br>Temasek group of companies operate and its high degree of investment<br>diversity," said credit analyst Greg Pau, director of S&amp;P's Corporate<br>&amp; Infrastructure Ratings Group.<br><br>Temasek earned a net profit of S$7.4 billion in the year ended March<br>31, up sharply from S$241 million a year earlier, boosted by<br>SingTel's S$1.9 billion gains from sale of stake in a foreign<br>company.<br><br>Temasek's revenue rose 14% to S$56.5 billion from S$49.6 billion in<br>the same period, making it by far Singapore's largest company.<br><br>Over time, Temasek will be a different company, less dependent on<br>Singapore's tiny S$165 billion domestic economy and more on Asia and<br>the rest of the world, the statement said.<br><br>"Over the next 8-10 years, we expect to see a portfolio with<br>approximately one-third of our operating asset exposure in Singapore,<br>one-third in the rest of Asia and the remaining one-third in the OECD<br>(Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development) of and other<br>economies," chairman Dhanabalan said.<br><br>The portfolio value of Temasek's assets, both listed and private,<br>amounts to S$90 billion, with 52% of the assets in Singapore, the<br>company said.<br><br>CLSA's Agarwal says that given Temasek's breakdown of investments,<br>its strategy for diversification doesn't suggest a grand sale of<br>Singapore assets, as the company is better diversified than earlier<br>thought.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Subject:  MSDW: S'pore: External Economy -- Low Return Is a Concern<br><br>Singapore: External Economy -- Low Return Is a Concern<br><br>Daniel Lian/Anita Chung (Singapore)<br><br>The report on "Singapore's Investment Abroad 1997-1998" released by<br>the Singapore Department of Statistics in the second week of<br>September 2000 validates our balance of payments methodology for<br>valuing the stocks and flows of Singapore's external economy, which<br>we presented in the first week of September (See "External Economy --<br>Some Intriguing Arithmetic," September 7, 2000).<br><br>Without taking into account the part of the external economy that is<br>owned by the government (i.e., other than foreign reserves),<br>official statistics valued the stock at around S$297.7 billion<br>(US$177.8 billion) in 1998 compared with S$344.7 billion (US$205.9<br>billion) estimated by our model.<br><br>We believe the difference of S$47 billion (US$28 billion) at the end<br>of 1998 largely represented the part of the external economy owned<br>by the government (through government agencies such as Temasek<br>Holdings, GIC, and statutory boards like EDB and JTC). In fact, for<br>1998 alone, the government directly, without this being captured by<br>the official survey statistics, recycled some S$15.7 billion (US$9.4<br>billion) worth of the current account surplus abroad. It is thus<br>reasonable to assume that by the end of 1999, the government-owned<br>external economy (excluding foreign reserve holdings) could be as<br>large as S$40 billion to S$60 billion.<br><br>Government, GLCs and MNCs Dominate&gt;<br><br>The government external economy constituted more than 50% of the<br>total external economy in 1998. If one takes into account the GLC-<br>owned external economy, then the government share balloons to some<br>60%. Foreign MNCs accounted for 29% whereas the local private<br>sector (excluding GLCs) owned 11%. It is therefore clear that if<br>the government and GLCs fail to secure a good return on their<br>external economy, the performance of the economy overall would be<br>adversely affected.<br><br>Low Returns of External Economy a Major Concern<br><br>We are somewhat concerned about the apparent low return generated by<br>the external economy. We collate gross factor income of<br>Singaporeans abroad and express it as a percentage of both GNP and<br>the external economy (public and private sector). Returns have been<br>declining over the past few years, according to our projections, and<br>the selection by our model of a 6% nominal return as the proxy of<br>profitability for the external economy during 1980-1999 was<br>consistent with real world observations.<br><br>We do not know the exact sources contributing to the reduced<br>profitability of the external economy in the past few years.<br>However, such a decline has coincided with a period in which the<br>government and GLC-led buildup of the external economy (primarily<br>through direct investment, portfolio investment and other foreign<br>assets) has taken precedence over the past practice of accumulating<br>plain vanilla foreign reserves. The former forms of investments<br>assume more risks and should earn better returns than foreign money-<br>market instruments and bonds. Something appears to have gone wrong<br>with the risk and reward profile of the external economy in recent<br>years.<br><br>We conjecture that the following factors could have contributed to<br>the poor returns earned by the external economy despite the higher<br>risk profile.<br><br>(1) Longer gestation period. Direct and portfolio assets tend to<br>take longer to reap returns after their initial formation.<br>Industrial parks, transportation and telecommunication infrastructure<br>are examples of major projects of the external economy that could<br>have generated poor returns in the early years.<br><br>(2) Asian crisis and currency devaluation. The Asian crisis and<br>currency devaluation in Southeast Asia could have negatively<br>affected both stocks and income flows of the external economy.<br>Singapore's direct investment in Asian countries accounted for 58%<br>of total direct investment abroad and among the top four investment<br>destinations, i.e., China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia, three<br>were severely hit by the crisis. Both the ringgit and the rupiah<br>have also sharply depreciated against the Singapore dollar.<br><br>(3) Poor investment decisions. We have emphasized in our previous<br>analysis that management of the external economy has rapidly become<br>the most important economic activity for the republic.<br>Diversification is key to securing steady returns and protecting<br>investment. While gestation periods and the Asian crisis may have<br>played a role, we cannot rule out poor investment decisions. Even<br>though we cannot ascertain whether it is the government (through its<br>agencies and statutory boards), GLCs, MNCs or indigenous private<br>sector that has been making such decisions, the sheer domination of<br>the government in the external economy means that responsibility for<br>the poor returns must lie with the government to a large degree.<br><br>In the Hands of Government<br><br>The simulation that we carried out in our previous article<br>demonstrates that not only is the future rate of return critical to<br>the growth of the external economy, it will also determine its<br>relative contribution to the Singapore economy. Our estimates<br>suggest that the external economy needs to secure a return of at<br>least 8% to be commensurate with the economy's long-term growth<br>potential of 6.5%. Given the preponderance of government ownership,<br>the task of raising returns clearly lies in the hands of government<br>and the GLCs.</div>
