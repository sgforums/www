            <div class='col-md body'>The whole idea of discrimination emphasises on the negative traits displayed by the PRCs, and <strong>not what good these people are capable of</strong>. There is no point in arguing if the positive traits by the PRCs are sufficient to make up for their negative traits, because the people who discriminates cannot put the positive traits and negative traits on equal standing.<br><br>From my personal interaction with PRCs, there are some things about them that stand out like a sore thumb.<br><br>Firstly, <strong>they assume all Chinese people are from China.</strong> This is not true. The PRC themselve should know better. Chinese people has been immigrating out of geographical China as early as 1300 AD. There are archaelogical evidence of Chinese people on Temasak even before Sir Stamford Raffles founded modern Singapore. In fact, the turbulent Chinese history only serves as good reason why Chinese people should migrate out of geographical China - Civil Wars, Poverty, Lack of Opportunities, Cultural Revolution, etc.<br><br>Secondly, <strong>they do not attempt to assimilate into their host country.</strong> This is demonstrated by the reluctance to engage into activities with people from their host country. When You are Rome, do what the Romans do. The PRCs like to group together socially and tend to exclude other nationalities. They appear to ignore people of other nationalities by being insensitive to these people. Try mixing 5 PRCs with 5 Taiwanese. See if the 2 groups can share a proper conversation together. <strong>This has nothing to do with the existence of a common language or a difference in standard for the common language.</strong> The exhibition of such insensitivity only reflects on their reluctance to assimilate. The insults the PRC make on our relatively poor mandarin standard reflects on the general relecutance to assimilate into the host society. On comparision with Japanese, the Japanese people feels flattered if someone from a foreign country attempts to speak their language to them. There is no sincerity in addressing to the host society.  As immigrants or foreign students, they must remember that the interest of the society (or host society) is above the interest of the individual. This holds true even for a local citizen. The common good takes priority over individual interest.<br><br>Thirdly, <strong>they have questionable work ethics.</strong> Regardless if these ethics are applied on working/studying in Singapore, the philosophy of "the ends justify the means" is not in line with the general work ethics of Singaporeans. The difference between Singaporeans and PRCs is that: when a Singaporean bend a rule for his personal gains, the other Singaporeans will scruntinise on him; when a PRC bend a rule for his personal gain, the other PRCs will applaud for his ingenuity. Last year, I saw a PRC cheat during exam. He was making reference to sheets of paper rolled inside his pencil case during a close-book exam. I promptly reported him to the invilgilator. I was totally disgusted by such a cheat. I told one of my PRC friends about that cheat and all she felt for him was sympathy, instead of being disgusted that such a cheat exists in my university. She even said he was trying his best to score for the exams. She was defending him. She tell me how she used to let her classmates copy her answers during tests when she was in secondary school. <strong>She felt good in helping her classmates to pass the test with flying colours.</strong> This conversation with her only increases my disgust with PRCs with general.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I admit the growing nationalism in China is a worrying trend. Personally, I do not want to see the rise of Chinese military might in Asia. Chinese foreign policy towards Tibet (1962), Taiwan(2000-2002) and North Korea (1951) are worrying. If the PRCs indeed feel arrogant because their country is rising on the global platform, it is our duty as Singaporeans to remind them that it took 5000years to achieve this. China, as a country, has taken a step back in progress many a time. It is not hard to imagine that history will repeat itself, given the mentality of the PRCs. Prior to WWI, Shanghai was divided into 8 protectorates. Perhaps prior to WWIII, China will be divided into 8 protectorates.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its usual, the black sheep (usually the minority) that give the others a bad name.<br><br>I work in an environment where I meet alot of PRCs. I dunno... I would say there are MANY (many black sheep) that behave selfishly. I dont know if its the "we are foreigners in a foreign land so lets stick together and protect ourselves" mentality or maybe thats how they behaved when they're back home... sometimes it just gets on your nerves. Being in service however, I maintain a firm but friendly stance towards them. A friend working in the States tells me it is the same over there, their behaviour as well as the people's thinking about them.<br><br>But on the other hand, to their credit, those nice, unselfish PRCs can become very loyal and good friends. Incidentally these share the sentiment and are ashamed of their countrymen.

In fact, the turbulent Chinese history only serves as good reason why Chinese people should migrate out of geographical China - Civil Wars, Poverty, Lack of Opportunities, Cultural Revolution, etc. [/b]</blockquote> Chinese people are immigrants from China. The difference is when did they migrate? Most of us are first generation Singaporean. The reasons for migrating should not matter, does it?

When You are Rome, do what the Romans do. The PRCs like to group together socially and tend to exclude other nationalities. They appear to ignore people of other nationalities by being insensitive to these people. Try mixing 5 PRCs with 5 Taiwanese. See if the 2 groups can share a proper conversation together. <strong>This has nothing to do with the existence of a common language or a difference in standard for the common language.</strong> The exhibition of such insensitivity only reflects on their reluctance to assimilate. The insults the PRC make on our relatively poor mandarin standard reflects on the general relecutance to assimilate into the host society. On comparision with Japanese, the Japanese people feels flattered if someone from a foreign country attempts to speak their language to them. There is no sincerity in addressing to the host society.  As immigrants or foreign students, they must remember that the interest of the society (or host society) is above the interest of the individual. This holds true even for a local citizen. The common good takes priority over individual interest. .[/b]</blockquote>Grouping of immigrants is not exclusive to Chinese. Most immigrants group together in their new host countries for a simple reason, survival. This is especially true if they do not speak the local language. I once spoke to a Chinese couples in Paris.

Last year, I saw a PRC cheat during exam. He was making reference to sheets of paper rolled inside his pencil case during a close-book exam. I promptly reported him to the invilgilator. I was totally disgusted by such a cheat. I told one of my PRC friends about that cheat and all she felt for him was sympathy, instead of being disgusted that such a cheat exists in my university.

All those happened due to the Qing Government's weakness to defend China from the invasion of Western Powers. In 1900, the USA, UK, France, Italy, Austria, Japan, Germany and The Netherlands combined their armies and invaded Beijing, and the Qing government was forced to sign the Xin Chou Tiao Yue...<br><br>After 1949 all those humiliating Tiao Yues were invalid...so the 8 Protectorate in Shanghai also no longer exist since Mao chased them away...</div></blockquote>I know about the "ba guo lian jun", just am amused at the link between WW1 and the 8 protectorates in Shanghai. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>but this i do know, the day anybody try to have "8 protectorates" in China again, it is WW3.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>huaqing, understand this, PRC under the chinese communists presented a very bad image of the "zhong hua wen hua" to the world, including the many overseas chinese. The misunderstandings get deeper with many people outside of china knowing little about China and those inside knowing little about Chinese outside, and the image get worse and more complicated with the presence of foreign power who want continued domination of the world. You and your fellows students from PRC, shoulder the responsibility to correct and improve this bad image. the last thing you should do is to be confrontational. Take care.</div>
