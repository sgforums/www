            <div class='col-md body'>Staying in enclaves of one's own kind seems to be a universal human trait and certainly is not something Chinese alone are guilty of.  I doubt the Singaporeasn in Australia or America mix easily with the locals. People have an innate tendency to regard with suspicion others from different racial and cultural background. On the other hand, you may know that some Londoners are quite xenophobic and would not like to mix with foreigners to begin with.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br><br>They also tend to mainly socialise amongst other chinese. Like seriously, if thats the case, whats the point of leaving china to study overseas? lots of chinese for them to socialise with back home. They will almost refuse to mix outside of their PRC clique.[/b]</blockquote></div>

I mix fine with the locals. Although maybe it is a trait of chinese people in general to be anti-social outside of their race.<br><br>and the londoners who are xenophobic? The PRCs of course. or do u mean the locals? yes some. but nowhere as numerous as the PRCs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always think that people should guard against making sweeping generalizations especially when they are commenting on human behavior. A cultural group or a nation is not a monolithic entity with no further distinctions within. The way people behave and carry themselves is influenced by numerous factors such as their educational background, familial upbringing and social, economic status. This amounts to the simple fact that people are different.  The traits you observe and come to loathe in a small group of people cannnot logically be extended to the entire group unless you can prove that the observed small group is significantly representative.<br><br>Simply that some Chinese nationals evade rules does not mean that all Chinese nationals do so. By saying that you don't hold <span style="font-style: italic;">them</span> in high regard because <span style="font-style: italic;">they</span> do not respect rules, you sound as if you have known them all.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lwflee:</div><div class="quote_body">Not depise, but i do not generally hold them in high regard.
