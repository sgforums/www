            <div class='col-md body'>Undrlying this comment is an overstated sense of pride in the multi-culturalism here in Singapore. Your very remark of "<span style="font-style: italic;">those PRCs shedding off their backward ways</span>" testifies to this patronizing attitude. It is true that living with people from other races/nationalities may help breed a broader outlook and more cultural sensitivity.  But this is not necessarily the case. I am aware of the recent case of Singaporean bloggers making seditious remarks about the Malay race here. True they are the minority, but so are the Chinese nationals who display unpalatable insensitivity you have observed. I think you will agree with this point if I could give you credit of objectivity.<br><br>On the other hand, a homogeneous environment does not necessarily lead to parochialism and an inflated sense of pride in one's own kind. How a person carries and perceives himself is a result of a combination of factors including his educational background, familial upbringing and economic, social standing. It is the less educated and less informed, regardless of where they come from, who are prone to make condescending remarks about another nationality/race.<br><br>And apparently you have a lopsided view of what cultural interaction means. When one culture comes into contact with another, it does not necessarily lead to cultural assimilation/accomodation, sometimes it leads to cultural dissilimation (the display of even more marked and contrastive behaviour) as well.  A sociologically objective view should not be prejudiced against either result of cultural interaction.

            <div class='col-md body'>At least I have not used any expletives in my comments so far. The same thing cannot be said of certain rude Singaporeans who cannot check their emotions and resort to calling others stupid. If I have made a mistake in reasoning, point it out and argue cogently. Name-calling only betrays your level of education and upbringing. Now who is depicable here? It's sad.<br><br>I laugh at the assusation that I do not understand your childish rantings. I have lived in English-speaking countries for many a year and you are in no position to comment on my ability to comprehend.<br><br>You assert that some studying in Imperial College are children from criminals families and quickly add that this is a non-contestable fact. I personally do not have friends studying in that college so I really cannot comment on the factuality of your proposition. However, I am curious how your friends found out the criminal family backgrounds of those children. Do they just boast on campus that their parents are felons?  In any case, if this is a fact, as you claim it to be, I believe the authorities of that college should be aware of this situation and should have taken necessary measures (such as forcing withdrawls of the students candidature) because apparently the tuition fees they charge are not earned from legal chanels. We have not seen any reportage of this kind in media yet.<br><br>Even if I give you the credit of truthfulness, so what do these isolated cases of these "criminals' children" say about PRCs in general, if I may respectfully ask?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">hello. are u stupid? i said the PRCs in UK are the elites.<br><br>AND THEN, ON A SIDE NOTE, I talk about how some of the PRCs in good unis are from crime families.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>gents, gents, let's not define "culture" so narrowly alright ... culture in anthropological  terms extends beyond religion and customs alone, it also encompasses values, ethics, and a way of life, we are Singaporeans, we are from different races, some of us may have been born in different countries, we have our own religions and customs, but do you not realise that we already have a quasi national identity in the shared set of values and ethics on which our society lives by ?<br><br>We abhor corruption for example, we don't jump queues, we don't try to "succeed at all cost", but play by a certain set of rules, we belive that honesty is a virtue, not a sign of stupidity in a businessman or a student, etc ... these are a set of values in which we all live by in Singapore, (even if we don't abide by some of these rules all the time) ... thing is, every society has a defined boundary within which it's member's operate, romantic rebels aside, we all have to live within these invisible markers of the society which we live in, so now when we say integrate into Singapore, we're not talking about asking somebody to totally forsake their own customs and religion for something else, but asking them to embrace a certain set of values that's common to Singaporeans.<br><br>So is that wrong, or unreasonable, to ask then, that new comers to Singapore embrace these same set of values ? .... I don't think so, for I believe this is what every country or society expects .....<br><br></div>

Outside of Singapore when you hear ppl speaking english we know right the way if they are singaporean or not. I can also tell if they are HKers. Its just the way they speak, to change to a different accent is difficult especially if we don't live there. Unless we are used to speaking english to our angmoh colleagues in singapore, we would find speaking english to an american on the first day we arrive in NY a little difficult and the locals would also have problem understanding your Singlish. its like trying to understand the english of an indian who has just arrived from dehli.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>On the other hand, other races also have problem announce some of our english. my colleague went to London and was supposed to be met by a travel agent who really had problem pronouncing his surname NG. How many angmoh can pronounce OEI?<br><br>In reservists I still came across singaporeans who have problem pronouncing R and D, so "run" becomes "lan", and "down" becomes "now".<br><br>Language is an interesting subject and it is true and not all of our tongues curl the same way. fully agree with you that we should understand and accommodate, especially many of them have just arrived.<br><br></div>

At the time, I would certainly have said that I do not trust cambodians in general. This is because their value system is very very different from ours. The way we behave is very much influenced by the environment we live in. In post-war cambodia, in order to survive, one must glean every advantage, cheat where one can, and explooit others whereever possible. Hence, when dealing with them at the time, i would have cautioned others to be extra extra careful.<br><br>I would say the same of the Chinese, though I certainly hold them in higher regard than the Cambodian of years past. Its not personal. That i do not hold them in high regard does not mean I condemn their behaviour, or that i think they are inherently 'evil'.<br><br>A couple of months ago, I heard someone describe South Africaans as having a 'Nigger Complex'. He was referring to the fact that some people have become so obsessed with colonial exploitation of africa that they cannot accept criticism of Africa and refuse to accept responsibility for the behaviour and actions of the africans. Woe be to him who dares to criticise africa, esp if he is white. After all, everything that is wrong with africa today is die to the actions of the white imperialists.<br><br>Yes, he was crude.
