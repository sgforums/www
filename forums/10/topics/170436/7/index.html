I speak fluent mandarin and still get that "display of disdain" due to my nationality. The PRCs are not appreciative even if I speak their language. On a simpler level, the PRCs are just being plain rude and insensitive. They always seem to expect us to adapt to them, and not actually BOTH PARTIES compromising with each other.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">But I donÂ’t see the need to adjust your own culture to the local culture, I donÂ’t see the need for the Chinese, the Malays and the Indian (Tamil) in Singapore merging into one culture, but we respect each others cultures</div></blockquote>The Singaporean chinese, malay and indian culture makes up the ethnical culture of Singapore. The Singaporean culture is furthur defined by our work ethics and meritocratic system. In this discussion thread, we are comparing Singaporean culture against PRC culture. The suggestion of Singapore turning into a monocultural soceity is irrelevant to this discussion thread. There is no meaning in contrasting Singaporean chinese culture with PRC chinese culture.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by sgdiehard:<strong>We need to learn to handle them.

My cohort at Chinese High was fortunate to be among the first in Singapore to study/work with PRC students. During my secondary school years, I enjoyed working with the PRC scholars in my class. They were brilliant people who deserve our respect. Their drive for excellence and committment were unparalleled.<br><br>I live in the UK now. The PRCs I met here in the UK totally spoilt my image of them. The sheer number of the obnoxious PRCs here make me think that the population of respectable PRCs is actually a minority. It also made me think that the number of respectable PRCs among the Chinese elites is small. Their selfish attitude and insensitivity is not as bad as their work ethics.<br><br>Their work ethics here are horrible. In order to score well for his report, a PRC I know copied a past year project and pass it off as himself. He was caught plagarising and the department (of my university) failed him instantly. I also seen and heard of PRCs cheating for exams. A PRC friend of mine wanted to cheat for her exam and I managed to convince her not to do so. I come from a top university, and are these PRC students. If they are not of high calibre and had to resort to such under-means, they deserve to fail, regardless if their family mortaged the land, etc. If they are not good enough, they deserve to fail. If they choose to party instead of doing your own homework / coursework  / project, they are at fault.<br><br>I was nice towards PRCs in the beginning. I did not discriminate against PRC in the beginning. The PRCs made me discriminate them. I discriminate PRCs in general.</div>

Once again, this is the recurring themes in this forum that somehow we  belittle Singaporeans who cannot speak proper Mandarin. Well, I tell you, this is a misconception or an illusion on the part of those Singaporeans who are generally less confident when it comes to linguistic proficiency. The fact that the media is innundated with discussions on how to minimize singlish on one hand and  to improve mandarin standard on the other, obliquely testifies to this sense of linguistic insecurity. When you are less confident youself, you become overly sensitive. Sometimes factual comments on your language standard get interpreted  as discrimination.  Therefore, don't let your own sense of insecurity distort honest comments from others, if any. Nobody thinks less of you simply on linguistic grounds. Thank you very much.<br><br>On a personally level, as I said previously, I DO NOT CARE what language you speak and with what proficieny.

That speaks for a lot of us.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by geodome:</div><div class="quote_body"> I am not whining - I am just answering mahuaqing's question why some Singaporeans despise PRC.

I don't like to be labelled as other nationalities. The only nationality I am proud to be labelled of is Singaporean.</div></blockquote>You are entitled to your own opinion. But when you expressly delcare your discrimination against Chinese nationals (as you did in your previous posting), whatever you say should be interpreted as tainted with your inherent bias.  and your opinion shall not be taken seriously due to lack of objectivity. If you are mistakenly labelled as other nationalities, that is largly due to physical similarities shared among the same race. Sometimes, it's even hard to tell a Japanese from a Chinese, let alone a PRC Chinese and Singapoean Chinese. There is no need to be fussy when people make such mistakes. We know you are a proud Singaporean though.</div>

It is true that the Beijing Chinese dislike the Shanghainese Chinese, the HKers dislike the Taiwanese, and in the same way, the Americans from the west coast dislike the those from Philadelphia or New York, even the Germans in the north looks down on Germans in the south. Geographical differences do bring about cultural and social difference. The Chinese are not even comfortable sharing each others food because the northern Chinese eat wheat and the southern Chinese eat rice. The world is not homogeneous.

The purpose of this thread is to know/understand why some Singaporeans despise PRCs. What better way is to get the answers straight from the horses' mouths? How can you not see that if you do have objectivity? I am more qualified to post in this thread, with regards to the question asked.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dreameryb:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, I tell you, this is a misconception or an illusion on the part of those Singaporeans who are generally less confident when it comes to linguistic proficiency. The fact that the media is innundated with discussions on how to minimize singlish on one hand and to improve mandarin standard on the other, obliquely testifies to this sense of linguistic insecurity. When you are less confident youself, you become overly sensitive. Sometimes factual comments on your language standard get interpreted as discrimination. Therefore, don't let your own sense of insecurity distort honest comments from others, if any. Nobody thinks less of you simply on linguistic grounds. Thank you very much.</div></blockquote>I scored A1 for Higher Chinese and studied Chinese Literature for O level. My mandarin standard is probably better than most Singaporeans. I am not being over-sensitive. I do not intend to give a PRCs an equal moral standing ground with us Singaporeans for 1 main reason - their horrible work/study ethics. The Singaporeans who had worked in China and posted their comments here all agreed that their quality of service and standard of production is terrible.

Your suggestion that I do not understand chinese as a race is geared towards the ideals that discrimination is not appropriate. Such idealism is irrelevant to this thread because this thread is about why some Singaporeans discriminate PRCs and not why discrimination is not appropriate.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">If you start discriminating somebody, you are not giving a Â“good social conditioningÂ” for your children and those around you.
