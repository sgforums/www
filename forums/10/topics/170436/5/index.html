I personally do not have friends studying in that college so I really cannot comment on the factuality of your proposition. However, I am curious how your friends found out the criminal family backgrounds of those children. Do they just boast on campus that their parents are felons?  In any case, if this is a fact, as you claim it to be, I believe the authorities of that college should be aware of this situation and should have taken necessary measures (such as forcing withdrawls of the students candidature) because apparently the tuition fees they charge are not earned from legal chanels. We have not seen any reportage of this kind in media yet.<br><br>Even if I give you the credit of truthfulness, so what do these isolated cases of these "criminals' children" say about PRCs in general, if I may respectfully ask?<br><br></div></blockquote>1stly, stupid is not an expletive.<br><br>2ndly, im asking you if u are stupid, i have not said u to are stupid as a fact.

Most of their families are in power within China, and usually not active in the UK, so there is no reason to report it to the authorities. Moreover, Imperial College and other prestigeous unis in UK are known to close an eye to such things when they are receiving hefty school fees from these PRC students.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....... Just stumbled across this interesting question. Just a little observation here, I noticed that there is a heated arguement between the PRC ppls and the local folks. I agree to a certain extent some of local ppls in one way or another, used quite some strong words, and might have offended others. I also do hope the PRC ppls do take a step back and keep an open mind when reading the post. Since U r interested in finding out wat the Singaporeans think, U should not be afraid to hear from them. Like the saying goes,  "The truth hurts", honest words do sound nasty to ppls.<br><br>I'm currently studying in a local uni, and I do have a couple of PRC frens. In fact my experience with dealing with them, went all the way back when I was in Secondary school. In general, most PRC students I met before are quite nice and friendly ppls. Of course there are some proud,rich and arrogant ones who boast abt being scholar, and looking down on others especially the poor ones. Here are some of my thought on why PRC ppls perceive Singaporeans as despising them..........<br><br>1) Most Singaporeans speak English at work or at school. Bcos this is the official working langguage and the only langguage which can be used to amalgate the various races. Using any other langguages would have defeated the purpose of moulding Singapore into a fair meritocratic society that do not favour a particular race or group. Therefore, some PRC do not understand why Singaporeans choose to speak English when the majority of the ppl are in fact Chinese...... Some came up theories that Singaporeans look down on their country. Some think that with like to boot-lick the western countries or some even think that we harbour evil intentions towards them.<br><br>2) Inferiority thinking towards others. With new found military and economical strength, ever-increasing number of ppls studying over-seas and learning English, some PRC ppls tend to be overtly showy,egoisitic abt their culture and nation as being the most elite in the world. The part abt the 5000 yrs history and Chinese food, movies and novels gaining popularity all around the world, together with those patriotic education they receive at school, further bolster this mentality. Thus it has cause the PRC ppls to behave like the Americans, ever-wanting others to idolise and follow their way of life and philosophy. It is common to see PRC webbies and forumers to use crude nick-names to refer to other countries, races or even religious believes. Looking down on the poorer and less well-off nations.  For example, I have seen PRC forumer calling Indian "Ah san"( third-rated beings),  Russian " Lao mao Zi"( old hairy men), Japan " Wo kou","Wei Guo" ( villian or pirate country)...........the list goes on. Of- course they do have names for Singapore, but since it is even more nasty than the above, I will not mention it.  The way some PRC forummers conduct themselves on International forums also reflect poorly on their countries. They like to conduct personal attacks on ppls, and the like to used vulgarities to scold ppls.  Thus, it is not surprising that some PRC ppls like to enforce their thinkings and believes on us, as they believe they are more elite than us. There was once I even come across a PRC forummer who claims to be studying in a local Polytechnic, opening a thread by the name of " Why PRC citizens should hate Singapore". I was quite surprised that after studying three yrs in Singapore, he or she is actually writing articles to incite his fellow frens to hate us........how ironic.</div>

There is no right or wrong in what they do, and we understand that china is big and opinions and views vary much. But, you should be aware that it is how you behave that give us the impression of you.<br><br>1. You need to respect countries' laws. I know in China you always find your own way to bypass laws and regulations. "shang you zheng ce, xia you dui ce" can be innovative but may not be respectful to the locals.<br><br>2. You need to understand others who are different from you, especially the ethnic chinese. You must know the difference between a an ethnic chinese and a chinese national. We, in singapore, are chinese but not chinese nationals.<br><br>Don't try to insist that beijing qiang mandarin is the correct mandarin. Not even the shanghainese speak that kind of mandarin, and do not think our chinese bu biao zhun.<br><br>Overseas ethnic chinese are more chinese in terms of chinese culture, traditions and heritage than you are. PRCs under the communists destroyed much of chinese culture during the cultural revolution. So do not think PRCs chinese has the correct chineseness.<br><br>3. Do not assume that we are ignorant of the historical baggages. Much of the disputes are political, and do not force us to take sides with you. Let time heals the wound.<br><br>4. Do not be defensive or only react to how others treat you, even if others may misunderstand you. China is growing big and power, your ppl are in every corner, made in china is in every household, ppl do not know you and the rise of your nationalism frightens ppl.<br><br>Respect and goodwill cannot be demanded just because you come from a big country.

One forumite said something to the effect that "Although I realize the balck sheep are the minority, I still do not hold Chinese nationals in general in good regard". That should give you the general idea. When those who can afford to be objective still persist in their biased thinking, it would be too much to ask the less enlightened here (quite a few, honestly) to start thinking rationally.

AND contrary to what some have commented here, we do understand the rationale for the official status of English here and we do not think they(Sporeans) harbor any ulteria motives towards us by adopting an English-as-official-language policy. It takes a child's mind to think that way.<br><br>Further on this point, someone said here that they were annoyed when we speak with our own accent. Are they equally annoyed when they hear Americans and Brits talking, I do not know. But people generally should not be blamed for their accent. To all intents and purpose, I respect Singlish!!<br><br>Then, there is the talk of the town that Chinese nationalism is on the rise and how that frightens some people. I honestly do not know where they got the idea. With a country's fast development naturally comes with a stronger sense of pride amongst its people. Therefore, we may project a more confident and self-assertive image when we deal with people. But that does not necessarily translate into nationalism. Maybe it's because some people are used to us being meek and silent and the idea that we are growing stronger unsettles them.  Some people start to take us to task for their inability to digest the changes China has experienced. I say, in such cases, it is their problem.<br><br>We may express certain strong views on the Japanese government's (government, not people) selective amnesia in what happened in WW 2. We believe that we are entitled to expressing such views for the sake of justice. Some Chinese nationals have taken extreme measures , (which BTW, most of us do not approve of), but they should be contextually interpreted as expressions of anger,  not a display of nationalism.<br><br>Lastly, we do believe that there is room for improvement in terms of bahviour amongst some of us. However, I just wish to let certain Sporeans know that MOST of us are aware of and exercise social etiqutte in compliance with international standards. If they let a tree hide the sight of a forest, it is their problem. We thank those for the well-intentioned Dos and Don'ts list  though.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by huaqing:</div><div class="quote_body">you dun always assume that sporeans dun bypass law in singapore. of course there are ppl in China who bypas laws, but sporeans sometimes do also.<br><br>and ur second point is obvious...<br><br>a language always have dialects. for example, i can speak Pu tong hua, which is the standard chinese, and i can also speak Sichuan hua, which is my dialect. in singapore your so-called "bu biao zhun" chinese may be seen as a singaporean dialect too...however, PRCs definitely have better chinese standards than most sporeans cos they learn deeper chinese in schools, just like in singapore u learn deeper english than chinese.<br><br>and the cultural revolution is already over for almost 30 years, but i dun see any culture being destroyed. and if u observe, if China is still a communist state until now, will they allow sporeans to go and invest? ok for ur info, they still say that they are communists but they are not communists anymore.<br><br>why would u fear a rise in nationalism among PRCs?<br><br>of course everybody has to be polite to earn respect. no one really cares if u come from what country.<br><br>but all ur points here seems saying that i am doing all these...<br><br>when i did not.</div></blockquote></div>

You change perception of others by what you do, not what you say. In fact I will also tell u that you asked the question, and when we answer, you and other PRCs who see this get annoyed. I find that rather pointless. I mean, seriously, if you cannot stomach our answers, then don't ask in the 1st place. By getting all defensive when all we did were to give you our most honest opinion (and in giving you our most honest opinion, it actually shows that we do not disregard you), all it did was to further sour our general views of PRCs. Maybe I have to point out that perhaps PRCs have to learn to swallow their pride somewhat. Belonging to one of the greatest nations on earth is not an excuse to develop an evo by proxy. I hold that view for arrogant white people, I hold the same view for arrogant PRCs.</div>
