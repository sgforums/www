I assure you ... most people would only judge you for who you are alone, not where you're from ... read what sgdiehard has written ... if you follow that, i assure you you won't have any problems ...<br><br>having said that, there are lots of chinese nationals overseas giving the country a very bad name, where i am, i have observed the following:<br><br>. being overly nationalistic - yes, perhaps some are afraid that some people would still think of China as only great wall and pandas and still a very backward place, but we don't need you showing off how great the country is all the time ... good for you that China has sent someone into space, we're happy for you too, it's an achivement for all mankind ... and stop writing graffiti (in Chinese !) in toilets and library tables everywhere, especially when you're  engaging in the quasi national sport of japanese bashing ...<br><br>. being inconsiderate and quarrelsome - jumping queues, quarrelling with professors, club bouncers, waiters and waitresses, janitors, airport staff, shop keepers etc is a big no-no ... things can be done in a nicer way ... and when in a lab or a library,  please observe the silence rule, AND the no food rule ... if you need to listen to music, please plug in headphones ...<br><br>. being too much of a show-off - yes, We all know now there are some very very rich Chinese people around, but being too flashy with money just pisses people off, example, don't throw money onto the table when you're tipping somebody ...<br><br>. demon driving - people drive from point A to get to point B, it's not war, nor a competition, (PS, it helps to SIGNAL early too ! .... )<br><br>. shaky academic ethics, that means not cheating during exams, especially during mid-terms, where invigilators are a bit slack, and hand in your own work and assigments, not copied from others ...<br><br>the list goes on ... now, don't get me wrong, I'm not tarring an entire people because of the actions of a few, I have quite a number of great PRC friends here, project buddies, drinking buddies, etc (and i've complained to them about all of the above points too ) ... but I'm just high-lighting the fact that such actions of a few are giving Chinese nationals a very bad name ... good luck with you bro, I know you're probably not guilty of any of the above things, but keep your chin up ... It can't be helped that some people would only judge another group from the actions of a few ...<br><br>(come to think of it, it's only like judging the entire japanese race for the actions of their forefathers during WWII, and a few right-wing politicians, isn't it ? ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )</div>
