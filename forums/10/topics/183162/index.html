            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the events in Thailand, there has been clear Thai political and local opposition to Temaseks investment in Shin Corp. What guarantee is there now that Temaseks $3billion investment and its future returns on Shin Corporation will continue to be profitable? It seems to me that we can kiss our $3billion investment goodbye.<br><br>It was pretty clear from the outset that Shin Corporation was a politically linked company. It amazed me that Thaksin was able to raise foreign investment in Thai Telco's overnight just to allow the deal to go through. Any shrewed investment banker would have seen the potential political fallout. We should have paid Thaksin in stages not all the money at one go. Did Temasek go wrong on the due dillegence on Shin Corp. Who, in Temasek holdings, is going to be held responsible for the $3billion loss in Shin Corp?<br><br>Has any MP in parliment raised any questions or debated on Temaseks investment in Shin Corp? $3billion is a large amount of taxpayers money at the end of the day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Temasek had performed poorly except in converting government services to GLCs and set higher fees in monopolices to squeeze greater profits.<br><br>When it comes to technologies, all the technology acquisitions from Micropolis to CSM, from Global Crossing to DBS Daoheng bank acquisitions, from souzhou township to Bangalore developments, few had done well. With so many flops, in their records, they might as well pull back our monies and invest locally where SMEs require great help to start new technology companies. How to justify investing our monies in more overseas ventures with so many poor records. Do we have one good man so far in such area to let the people trust him in making good investment decisions. If we do not have men at Temasek to have abilities of this nature, and who could lead with shrewd judgments proven on past successes, citizens will find it hard to trust their big forays into Global Crossing again or Shin Corp as decisions on emotional factor like getting bigger ports and bigger companies will never work.</div>

When do we get to question the people that govern us and when do we get full transperancy? Or is singapore the perfect example that Democracy's final outcome?<br><br>Fear wields power. To tell u frankly we are all terrified of our goverment. We know they can make us dissapear, or destroy our lives in an instant as with JBJ and DR Chee.<br><br>We fear what might become of our country in the hands of someone else....(I must commend Our MM Lee on an excelent job bringing singapore to where it is.) However.. times are not as they were do we really believe that the current govt can serve us best? Perhaps not. Perhaps we do. For those with doubt, do we dare question? Or can we only whine....<br>I urge the goverment to assure its people thet they are free to speak, if they are truely serious about getting public opinion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I think a free speech bill should be passed in parliment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I think its uncalled for to sue someone to death for somtthing they said. If there is no truth in slander, the goverment should present its facts and discredit it and pay no heed to it. The goverment would gain the respect of its people.<br><br></div>
