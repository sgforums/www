            <div class='col-md body'>It is when the young in Singapore like like Jamie Han are prepared to speak out that all will have a better future. Many of our young have been led into believing everything the leaders are saying. Many have been taken hook line and sinker by the assumptions and presumptuousness of our leaders. Many cannot differentiate between truths and fictions and are so afraid to change for fear of disorders or chaos as painted by the leaders.<br><br>The past is the past. Singapore cannot go back to the past but our dear leaders kept harking back to the old glories when the world has changed to one where pure rhetorics or even sacrifice do not count. But this is our dear leaders want our young to believe in replies to Jamie.<br><br>Singapore must have youths who are courageous and have the knowledge of the outside world to ask for changes.<br><br>So to those who keep telling us in this forum how good is autocracy or how small and vulnerable is Singapore to permit any changes or questioning, they should seriously reflect on their belief.<br><br>It does not mean when more people are speaking out there would be danger of flagmentation or chaos. I for one think that this kind of thinking is even more dangerous that those who speak out. It is the unwillingness to be accountable and transparent that will lead to chaos or disorders.<br><br>My two cents' worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
