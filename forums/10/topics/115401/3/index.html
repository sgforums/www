Speak for your constituents against your bosses? Can there be a conflict of interest over here?<br><br>Recall: Tan Soo Khoon had to apologize to then DPM Lee for certain things raised in Parliament.<br><br>This is why there has to be multiple parties in parliament for there to be purposeful questioning and checking of the Government by holding the cabinet accountable to answer the questions posed by the representatives of the people.<br><br>What MM merely did was to remind Jamie Han gently that he has the right to challenge if he wants to, and that is, if he dares to. MM in doing so has in a glance evaluated that this young man over here may talk but when called upon to face a PAP candidate on nomination day, he does not have the mettle to rise to the occasion.<br><br>For Jamie Han's fans and admirers, let it be known that i have nothing against him and i hope to be proven wrong about him as well. For there are many who will talk but few who will move. For those good with just talking and calling names, i know many. FYI, the people i know will say worse things about MM than Jamie Han.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Imagine this scenario:<br><br>An aging boxer, clear past his prime, wearing his title belt steps into the empty circle the crowd has formed around. He flings off his champion's cape aside just like he used to do so during his heyday. He scans the crowd waiting for the challenger.<br><br>No one steps forward.<br><br>From the crowd of spectators, a rash and rude young man shouts from the top of his voice that it is about time the boxer should retire.<br><br>The boxer raises his glove to indicate that he would receive the challenge. The crowd holds its breath. The young man falls silent. Dares not step forward.<br><br>No one steps forward.<br><br>After an uneasy silence. the crowd, ironically, turns around to cheer the little brat who had done nothing but merely  shouted his comments.<br><br>The champion remains the champion, albeit a little older. The boy remains a boy.<br><br>Except for a little episode of public entertainment and rousing of the crowd.<br><br>Nothing has changed.</span><br><br>We can talk and curse until the cows come home but<br><br>Nothing is going to change if, on each and every nomination day, the PAP candidates go unchallenged<br><br>Nothing is going to change if, even the PAP candidate is challenged, the people choose to give the PAP their vote out of fear or whatever reason.<br><br>When a seemingly unpopular leader throws a challenge to the disgruntled to pick up the gauntlet and nobody dares to do so. Do you not think that the leader has proven why he still stands there?<br><br>Yet the mere commentator draws applause and admiration from the crowd??!!<br><br>This was the case with author Catherine Lim, partly so for Ngaim Tong Dow and whether it will be so for our Jamie Han, it remains to be seen.<br><br>Has our peopleÂ’s political will degenerated to the point that we dare not even practice the few remaining rights which defines our citizenship in this nation?<br><br>1.	The right to speak up and be heard Â– something out of the ordinary?<br><br>2.	the right to vote and to pressure the Govt. with your vote Â– is denied time and time again by tactics that are condoned by the people themselves.<br><br>3.	the right to challenge Â– which few people dare to take.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">At the end of the day the boxer retains his title, his champion status.

            <div class='col-md body'>" Honours studentÂ’s hard talk with Kuan Yew<br><br>Down South by SEAH CHIANG NEE<br><br>ALMOST yearly, Lee Kuan Yew would pay a visit to the premier campus to talk Â– and listen Â– to thousands of undergraduates about the country.<br><br>Started when he was a young, combative prime minister, these events rarely produce fireworks or test LeeÂ’s debating skill.<br><br>Generally meek or polite, these students would at times ask a few critical questions, most of which touched on jobs and careers. They were predictable occasions.<br><br>This year was different.<br><br>The latest meeting that took place last week produced some sparks and showed how far away some of todayÂ’s youths have moved from LeeÂ’s political world.<br><br>Instead of the usual mild questions, the 82-year-old Minister Mentor got an unexpected earful.<br><br>One of the challengers was history honours student Jamie Han, who stressed he wasnÂ’t saying the PeopleÂ’s Action Party was corrupt.<br><br>Â“But the truth of the matter is this: No matter how enlightened a despot is, ultimately heÂ’ll turn into a tyrant if there are no checks and balances in place.Â”<br><br><strong>Applause broke out among the 1,500 students representing all universities here</strong>.<br><br>Jamie said there must have been times in the past when there was a need for consensus and stability.<br><br>Â“But we have come to the stage where in order to progress, the minority viewpoints have to be heard,Â” he stressed.<br><br>Earlier, another student asked Lee why so many Singaporeans were not regarding their country as home.<br><br>Â“We lack the sense of ownership,Â” he said.<br><br>At best, he added, they tended to see it as a comfortable hotel and, at worst, as a prison that people didnÂ’t have money and resources and the talent to make it.<br><br>Lee: What makes you feel you donÂ’t own this place?<br><br>Student: I do. ItÂ’s just the impression I have from talking to people.<br><br><strong>Asked who owned the Housing Board flat he was living in, he replied: Â“I believe itÂ’s a 99-year lease, so the Government owns the house.Â” </strong><br><br>But it was JamieÂ’s use of the word Â“despotÂ” that hung in the air. In the past, criticisms were about policies; this time it was a strong personal label Â– the first Â– to be pinned on Lee.<br><br>There had, of course, been stronger attacks on him and his familyÂ’s power but they came anonymously from the Internet, hence with a lot less impact.<br><br>It reflects a changing generation. At any rate, todayÂ’s generation has little knowledge or impression of LeeÂ’s role in history and does not feel beholden to him like their elders.<br><br>Many are liberals who are dissatisfied with the speed of decontrol of the past decade. Lee, on the other hand, is a conservative who believes in a highly regulated top-down society as prerequisite for stability.<br><br>Jamie had also asked for the Internal Security Act and newspaper laws to be reviewed. The channels that offered different views were Â“either directly or indirectly controlled by the GovernmentÂ”.<br><br>And this exchange followed.<br><br>Lee asked him if he had written to the newspapers. Yes, he replied, but only one letter was published.<br><br>Why not start a publication, asked Lee. Reply: The laws made it very difficult.<br><br>Lee: Â“Well, you have the Internet Â– put up a website. You know how to put up a website? If you donÂ’t, I know a friend who can help you.Â”<br><br>Lee said he was never a despot. Â“You donÂ’t put your life at risk in calling me a despot.Â”<br><br>He challenged, as he had often done, anyone who had a passion to join a party and contest via elections. Â“I say stake your life, come out and put your programme.Â”<br><br>The exchange has propelled Jamie to some sort of instant popularity. To its credit, the media reported the story in detail although it didnÂ’t reflect well on Lee.<br><br>Almost overnight, Jamie Han has burst from being an unknown to an admired youth different from the majority of meek bo chap (uncaring) youths concerned only in themselves.<br><br>The admiration shown is, however, tempered by concern about what Â– if anything Â– will happen to him.<br><br>Some were nothing short of speculative fantasy. One thought Jamie had a Â“death wishÂ”. Another said his career was Â“half overÂ” even before it began.<br><br>Many public commentators saluted his daring speak-up, called it a Â“catalyst for changeÂ”, that deserved some form of award. One said if he were to form a political party, Â“I will vote for him.Â”<br><br>(Jamie later said he was not interested in going into politics, but believed there was value in speaking up on social issues that move him.)<br><br>One commentator said many youths would wait and see Â– and if Jamie was not punished Â“the mindset of others will changeÂ”.<br><br>Describing him as Â“a sacrificial lambÂ”, he said that if Jamie was not punished, it would encourage others who shared his views to move into politics where they could make a change. .................................................................................<br><br>One Web letter said that at 82, Lee has not changed very much. Otherwise, he asked, why should anyone in this stable environment need to Â“put his life on the lineÂ” to join opposition politics? ......."<br></div>
