Form a party<br>If you have different views, go into politics and air your ideas, MM Lee tells young<br><br>By Lynn Lee<br><br>A STUDENT argued for less government control and remarked that even the 'most enlightened despot' could turn into a tyrant if his powers were left unchecked.<br><br>The comment led Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew to throw this gauntlet down to the young: If they believe they have a better point of view to 'stake' their lives, organise, form a political party and win people over.<br><br>'There is nothing to prevent you from pushing your propaganda, to push your programme out either to the students or with the public at large... and if you can carry the ground, if you are right, you win. That's democracy. We're not preventing anybody,' he said.<br><br>The exchange took place last night during a question-and-answer session he had with university students at the Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum held at the NUS University Cultural Centre.<br><br>NUS history student Jamie Han had asked for the Internal Security Act and newspaper laws to be reviewed. This was when he made his comment on despots.<br><br>Furthermore, he said, channels to offer different views 'were either directly or indirectly controlled by the Government'.<br><br>Mr Lee first asked him if he had written to the newspapers, such as The Straits Times Forum page.<br><br>Yes, he replied. But only one letter was published.<br><br>Why not start a publication then, asked MM Lee.<br><br>The laws made it 'very difficult', the student said.<br>No, he could register it, said Mr Lee.<br><br>Mr Han was not persuaded.<br><br>To laughter, Mr Lee replied: 'Well, you have the Internet - put up a website. You know how to put up a website? If you don't, I know a friend who can help you.'<br><br>He returned to the point about 'despots' only later, in reply to another question.<br><br>This time, another student asked about the coming General Election.<br><br>Mr Lee said the election did not have to be held until 2007 and between now and then, it was unlikely any group could form a team that can declare it will do better than the current Government. All it could offer was to be a 'different voice'.<br><br>He asked: 'Those of you who really feel strongly that you got a better point of view, I say organise yourself - as I did. I took my life in my hands and said I stand for this.'<br><br>He recalled how when he met the Plen, or Fang Chuan Pi, in Beijing in 1992, the communist leader had told him that he had saved his life when he could have ordered him killed for taking on the communists in the 1950s.<br><br>Said Mr Lee: 'I said 'Thank you'. He could have shot me. But I told him, 'You are not a fool and you knew that if you had assassinated me, your organisation would have been crushed because I was not unpopular.'<br><br>'Had I been unpopular, then you have got rid of despot... but I was no despot. That generation knew that I fought for them.'<br><br>At this point, Mr Lee asked the student who prompted the response: How old was his father?<br><br>'50-plus,' said the student.<br><br>MM Lee said: 'If he's 50 plus, then he will remember. You don't put your life at risk in calling me a despot. Well, in order to have your views heard, if you profoundly believe that you have that passion, I say stake your life, take on with your duties, come out, put your programme, sort it out.'<br><br>He said too that the current leadership had proven its mettle, having seen the country through the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Sars outbreak in 2003.<br><br>Its team of 'resourceful and quick-witted, well-organised' leaders had responded to these problems methodically and systematically.<br><br>'If you believe that a vociferous opposition with good ideas would have responded in that way, you are wrong,' he said.<br><br>He added that the People's Action Party had remained in power by delivering results and getting good people to be with the party.<br><br>'That's how we stay in office, not by monopolising... but by co-opting, incorporating and moving forward. So my message to you is a simple one. Remember how we got here. And before you make fundamental changes, make sure that your alternative is viable.<br><br>'This is not an ordinary country. You have two election terms of a dud, lousy, incompetent government and you will set Singapore back so badly, it may take you decades to recover, and maybe never. If you dismantle the organisation that brought us here, don't believe it will come back.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That Jamie guy probably deserves some credit for daring to speak up but calling the MM names is just outright disrespect. Even if he was a hardliner and had offended perhaps people form different parts of society, still doesn't change the fact that our young friend, is able to be at NUS shooting his mouth off in a brand new big auditorium, much thanks to the work of our government. If he is really so great, go answer the challenge and make his voice heard. Name calling is not going to get him, nor anyone, anywhere.</div>
