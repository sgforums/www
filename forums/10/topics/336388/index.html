              <p> <span class="update"><span>CHICAGO - President-elect Barack Obama spoke by telephone Thursday with the leaders of nine US allies to express thanks for their messages of congratulation, an aide said. <br><br>Obama returned calls to the leaders of Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, according to Stephanie Cutter, spokeswoman for the Democrat's transition office. <br><br>America's next leader was "thanking them for having called to express congratulations on his election earlier this week," she said in a statement without elaborating. <br><br>Obama has been inundated with foreign plaudits after triumphing over Republican John McCain to be elected the nation's first African-American president Tuesday, with even US foes such as Iran and Cuba offering praise. <br><br>After the election, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hailed Obama's "energizing" politics. <br><br>"This is a moment that will live in history as long as history books are written," Brown added. <br><br>French President Nicolas Sarkozy, another of the leaders called by Obama, wrote to the president-elect to say his "brilliant victory rewards a tireless commitment to serve the American people." <br><br>Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he was certain US-Israeli ties would strengthen under Obama's presidency, after Republicans had said the Democrat would endanger the Jewish state's security. <br><br>According to Cutter, Obama spoke also with Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, Mexican President Felipe Calderon and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. - AFP/vm </span></span></p>

              <p>Do you know how to read the 'Billing' in this Thread, or are your thought process and vision controlled by your knee jerks ?</p>
              <p>Singapore is as strong an ally to the USA as the leaders of the nine countries whom Obama called - Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico and South Korea - more so when the Singapore Leadership had given unstinting support to most US policies as much as Australia, Britain, and Israel despite our size.</p>
              <p>Canada, France, Germany, and Mexico had broken ranks with the USA on more political and military issues then Singapore has supported; while Japan and South Korea were even more selective.</p>
              <p>Despite the unstinting support from SG as an ally - did any US Administration showed the same level of appreciation to SG ?</p>
              <p>Only you will pull the wool over your own eyes to believe that <em>"SG leader dunt need American to endorse that SG is important". </em></p>
              <p>What possibly could be the reason for LKY to desparately build a deep sea naval base in Changi that can accomodate a US Navy aircraft carrier - and annoy every  South-east Asian countries, when all had wanted the US Military out of the ASEAN region ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that LKY was promoting SG to be an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>important</em></span> lynch-pin in the US Global reach ?</p>
              <p>Surely, your Oz bitterness had blind-sided your views towards PM Rudd - and forgot that his first agenda as PM - was to withdraw Oz troops from Iraq, while SG's Old Man felt that it was important to fly Singapore's flag in a token appearance in Iraq - with an aerial tanker and a naval LST.</p>
              <p>Yet for all the negative claims you made, Australia is a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.expatica.com/be/articles/news/Bush-to-host-finance-crisis-summit-.html">member country of the G-8 </a>while for all the self-aggrandizing claims you made about SG's wealth - we are not even a member of the G-8 or even part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.g20.org/G20/">G-20 Countries -  </a>which included the richest Asian country - China, and the poorest - Indonesia.</p>
              <p>From the calls made by Obama to the 9 leaders - are you suggesting that the other nine countries are poorer, while Singapore is far richer than them ?</p>
              <p>From your typical stance taken in this SgForum, you will probably turn a blind eye to the fact that it is the Singapore Government that is rich, while Singaporeans are the poorer lot.</p>
              <p>Conversely, the US Government may have incurred a shocking huge national debt that have gained notoriety, many like you have largely ignored the other fact that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ifsl.org.uk/upload/PB_Private_Wealth_2007.pdf">Private Wealth in the USA  </a>far surpass the Singapore National Reserves or the size of the US National Debt.</p>
              <p>The reason for the USA still standing strong - despite the present chaotic economic and financial melt-down - is due largely to its inner strength - compared  to the Asian financial crisis of 1997, when many Asian economies were shaken to its core that resulted in total financial collapse in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and South Korea.</p>
              <p>Despite the present US financial melt-down, the US Dollar remains solid vis-a-vis other currencies, and is still used as a Reserve Currency by many countries.</p>
              <p>The solid Gold Bars locked up in Fort Knox remains untouched.</p>
              <p>The stupidity and greed of the World Financial Community in swallowing all that the ingenious US Financial System had created - reveal the smartness of not utilising their own internal resources, but to incur the losses onto others.</p>
              <p>The US Lehman Brothers had the biggest investment fund subscribers from Asian investors, and the biggest losers of the collapse of Lehman Brothers were Asians not US Citizens.</p>
              <p>In your anxiety to blow the horn so loudly on behalf of the SG Government, can you even begin to understand the politics that have been played by the US Private Financial Institutions on the World Community - when the US financial system was de-regulated by the Bush Administration ?</p>
              <p>Can we trust your abilitly to differentiate between the debt incurred by the US Private Financial Institutions with the US Government Bonds issued by the US Government ?</p>
              <p>From your skewed views of Oz, it will be benefit you more if you start re-reading and try to look into the deeper meanings behind <a rel="nofollow" href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080810154914AAonUO9">The Wizard of Oz.  </a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>...Any reform of Wall Street practices came from pressure from the
                      hinterlands, especially from the farming West, and was long delayed by
                      the close alliance of Wall Street with the two major political parties,
                      which grew up in 1880-1900.</p>
              <p>In this alliance, by 1900, the influence of
                      Morgan in the Republican Party was dominant, his chief rivalry coming
                      from the influence of a monopoly capitalist, Rockefeller of Ohio.</p>

                      indicated by the passage of the Whitney family from the Democrats to
                      the Republican inner circles, shortly after they established a family
                      alliance with Morgan.</p>
              <p>In the same period, the Rockefeller family
                      reversed the ordinary direction of development by shifting from the
                      monopoly<strong> </strong>fields of petroleum to New York banking circles by way
                      of the Chase National Bank.</p>
              <p>Soon family as well as financial alliances
                      grew up among the Morgans, Whitneys, and Rockefellers, chiefly through
                      Payne and Aldrich family connections.</p>
              <p>For almost fifty years, from 1880 to 1930, financial
                      capitalism approximated a feudal structure in which two great powers,
                      centered in New York, dominated a number of lesser powers, both in New
                      York and in provincial cities.</p>
              <p>No description of this structure as it
                      existed in the 1920's can be given in a brief compass, since it
                      infiltrated all aspects of American life and especially all branches of
                      economic life.</p>
              <p>At the center were a group of less than a dozen
                      investment banks, which were, at the height of their powers, still
                      unincorporated private partnerships. These included J. P. Morgan; the
                      Rockefeller family; Kuhn, Loeb and Company; Dillon, Read and Company;
                      Brown Brothers and Harriman; and others.</p>
              <p>Each of these was linked in
                      organizational or personal relationships with various banks, insurance
                      companies, railroads, utilities, and industrial firms.</p>
              <p>The result was
                      to form a number of webs of economic power of which the more important
                      centered in New York, while other provincial groups allied with these
                      were to be found in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, and Boston.</p>
              <p>J. P. Morgan worked in close relationship to a group of banks and
                      insurance companies, including the First National Bank of New York, the
                      Guaranty Trust Company, the Bankers Trust, the New York Trust Company,
                      and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.</p>
              <p>The whole nexus dominated
                      a network of business firms which included at least one-sixth of the
                      two hundred largest nonfinancial corporations in American business.</p>
              <p>Among these were twelve utility companies, five or more railroad
                      systems, thirteen industrial firms, and at least five of the fifty
                      largest banks in the country.</p>
              <p>The combined assets of these firms were
                      more than $30 billion.</p>
              <p>They included American Telephone and Telegraph
                      Company, International Telephone and Telegraph, Consolidated Gas of New
                      York, the groups of electrical utilities known as Electric Bond and
                      Share and as the United Corporation Group (which included Commonwealth
                      and Southern, Public Service of New Jersey, and Columbia Gas and
                      Electric), the New York Central railway system, the Van Sweringen
                      railway system (Allegheny) of nine lines (including Chesapeake and
                      Ohio; Erie; Missouri Pacific; the Nickel Plate; and Pere Marquette);
                      the Santa Fe; the Northern system of five great lines (Great Northern;
                      Northern Pacific; Burlington; and others); the Southern Railway;
                      General Electric Company; United States Steel; Phelps Dodge; Montgomery
                      Ward; National Biscuit; Kennecott Copper; American Radiator and
                      Standard Sanitary; Continental Oil; Reading Coal and Iron; Baldwin
                      Locomotive; and others.</p>
              <p>The Rockefeller group, which was really a monopoly capitalist
                      organization investing only its own profits, functioned as a financial
                      capitalist unit in close cooperation with Morgan.</p>
              <p>Allied with the
                      country's largest bank, the Chase National, it was involved as an
                      industrial power in the various Standard Oil firms and the Atlantic
                      Refining Company, but it controlled over half the assets of the oil
                      industry, plus the $2 1/3 billion assets in Chase National Bank.</p>
              <p>Kuhn, Loeb was chiefly interested in railroads, where it dominated the
                      Pennsylvania, the Union Pacific, the Southern Pacific, the Milwaukee,
                      the Chicago Northwestern, the Katy (Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad
                      Company), and the Delaware and Hudson. It also dominated the Bank of
                      Manhattan and the Western Union Telegraph Company for a total of almost
                      $11 billion in assets.</p>
              <p>The Mellon group centered in Pittsburgh dominated Gulf Oil, Koppers,
                      Alcoa, Westinghouse Electric, Union Trust Company, the Mellon National
                      Bank, Jones and Laughlin Steel, American Rolling Mill, Crucible Steel,
                      and other firms for total assets of about $3.3 billion.</p>
              <p>It has been calculated that the 200 largest nonfinancial
                      corporations in the United States, plus the fifty largest banks, in the
                      mid-1930's, owned 34 percent of the assets of all industrial
                      corporations, 48 percent of the assets of all commercial banks, 75
                      percent of the assets of all public utilities, and 95 percent of the
                      assets of all railroads.</p>
              <p>The total assets of all four classes were
                      almost $100 billion, divided almost equally among the four classes. The
                      four economic power blocs which we have mentioned (Morgan; Rockefeller;
                      Kuhn, Loeb and Company; and Mellon) plus du Pont, and three local
                      groups allied with these in Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago, together
                      dominated the following percentages of the 250 corporations considered
                      here: of industrial firms 58 percent of their total assets, of
                      railroads 82 percent, and utilities 58 percent.</p>
              <p>The aggregate value of
                      the assets controlled by the eight power groups was about $61,205
                      million of the total assets of $198,351 million in these 250 largest
                      corporations at the end of 1935.</p>
              <p>The economic power represented by these figures is
                      almost beyond imagination to grasp, and was increased by the active
                      role which these financial titans took in politics. Morgan and
                      Rockefeller together frequently dominated the national Republican
                      Party, while Morgan occasionally had extensive influence in the
                      national Democratic Party (three of the Morgan partners were usually
                      Democrats).</p>
              <p>These two were also powerful on the state level, especially
                      Morgan in New York and Rockefeller in Ohio. Mellon was a power in
                      Pennsylvania and du Pont was obviously a political power in Delaware...</p>
