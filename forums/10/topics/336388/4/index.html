              <p>It is simply too early for Obama to be "hard nosed" in his
              selective approach in responding to the deluge of congratulatory
              messages.</p>
              <p>If you feel that China and Russia is more weighty than
              Singapore, can Austalia or South Korea be heavier in weight
              than China and Russia to warrant the call made ?</p>
              <p>Clearly, the calls made by Obama were to countries that he see a
              common thread with his political principles of democratic
              practices, of hope and positive change for their
              respective citizens.</p>
              <p>Governments that are realistic in their assumptions of their
              roles in public service instead of self-aggrandizement through
              inflated self-valuation must surely have gained Obama's
              respect.</p>
              <p>For his character displayed in listening to the smallest and
              weakest person, remembering the elderly 103 year old who lived to
              see this day, the humility displayed in winning this momentous
              election - he will surely have called Singapore if only we had the
              shine in our politics that would have been befitting the
              aura in LKY's claim as the leader of a miracle country
              belonging to the First World.</p>

              <p>I believe there are many other countries that have the excellent
              democracy in place that you crave for. Countries like the Denmark, Sweden, Spain, New Zealand. So why are they not on the list?</p>
              <p>For South Korea, read what i have posted in my initial post. For Australia, they're one of the countries whose policies generally dovetail with the US and it's a good ally to contain Chinese influence in the region. While the US probably doesn't want to go to war against China, it doesn't mean that they agree with Chinese influence throughout the region.</p>
              <p>It's just politics and foreign policy. Do you think so highly of Singapore's position in the world that you think Obama actually cares whether we have a democratic government, a socialist government or a dictator in place?</p>

              <p>From what you have posted, it will reveal that you will need to do more research into the historical relationships of Denmark, Sweden, Spain and New Zealand with the USA.</p>
              <p>These countries that you have named may have the highest standards of democracy that have brought them to First World Status for their citizens - not their political leaders only - but does that necessarily result in the best of political relations with the USA ?</p>
              <p>Denmark and Sweden have never supported the US military adventures - from Vietnam to Afghanistan; the new Spanish Government almost immediately withdrew all Spanish support in the US led Iraq war; while Helen Clark's government pulled NZ out of the Defense arrangement with the USA and ban all US ships from NZ port if they do not declare their nuclear weapons.</p>
              <p>US military force in South Korea and Japan is not to contain China, but more as a safety measure to respond to an unpredicatable North Korean leadership that started the war in the Korean Peninsular in the 1950s.</p>
              <p>I am not sure how you manage to conclude that I should "think of Singapore's position in the World as being highly placed"; perhaps you should seek some help in reading and understanding the "Heading of this thread", and what has been posted todate.</p>
              <p>If you think that Obama is not as knowledgeable or unconcern with the events in our part of the World, you may yet live to re-assess your position during his term in office.</p>
              <p>One thing seems to be a certainty, Obama knows where he can get the most reliable and unadulterated help from - and for now, it does not seem to have included any advise from despots - who believe in the pseudo-science of eugenics.</p>

              <p><br> "Formal Ties" or "Formal Alliances" - replace it in the questions
                      asked.</p>
              <p>What has been posted remains unchanged.</p>
              <p>In 1998, Singapore has a FORMAL Agreement with the USA that
                      allowed the US Navy to dock at the Changi Naval Base and take on
                      resupply.</p>
              <p>Without having a "formal alliance" in the status that you claim,
                      would Singapore have been given access to all the training
                      facilities used by the USAF ?</p>
              <p>Is Singapore's participation in supporting US presence in Iraq
                      not considered a "Strategic Alliance" in the interest of Singapore
                      ?</p>
              <p>What possibly could your argument be about ?</p>
              <p>Yes, it is due to the sensitivity of any "Formal Alliance"
                      between Singapore and the USA that prevent one from being made.</p>
              <p>It does not prevent the activities from occurring between
                      two countries who have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>chosen each to be
                      allies</em></span> without any need to formalise it.</p>

              <p>We can have some kinda training or military cooperation agreements, but that does not constitute "Alliance" and explicitly state us to be a US "Ally."  If we are "Allies" through "agreements" then I think we'd have allied ourselves with Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan, India, and China even.  </p>
              <p>And I don't blame you for misunderstanding, the US Press under Bush likes to throw the word, "Allies" around just to make the US sound popular around the world to its citizens.  The United States is not bound by written agreement to aid Singapore.  </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, lets look at what the US State Dept says about SG.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;  ">In 1990, the United States and Singapore signed a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</span> which allows United States access to Singapore facilities at Paya Lebar Airbase and the Sembawang wharves. Under the MOU, a U.S. Navy logistics unit was established in Singapore in 1992; U.S. fighter aircraft deploy periodically to Singapore for exercises, and a number of U.S. military vessels visit Singapore. The MOU was amended in 1999 to permit U.S. naval vessels to berth at the Changi Naval Base, which was completed in early 2001. In July 2005, the United States and Singapore signed a Strategic Framework Agreement to expand cooperation in defense and security.</span></p>

              <p><br>Let's see what ELSE does the US State Dept say about Singapore...</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;  ">Singapore is <span style="font-weight: bold;">nonaligned</span>.

              <p>After reading up on all this.  Can you tell me which part of MOU, and Non-Aligned movement can possibly spell a foreign policy of US-Singapore Alliance?</p>
              <p>Atobe, you're a pretty enthusiastic user on sgforums, and its really fun to see some of your views sometimes, but please do your research about such "inferences" that may not necessarily be true.  Especially so when people have TOLD you, you are wrong.</p>
              <p>We exist in a sensitive region where it is better for us to pursue multi-lateral relations than to bank on the help of one "Ally."  Even if we do have some relations with particular "superpowers", we need to maintain a form of "deniability" by not officially stating that we are aligned with any one power.</p>

              <p>If you have no idea what I am "talking" about - do you know what you are heading into, or are you taking on a presumptious position for yourself that may simply be too much to swallow or even digest ?</p>
              <p>You seem to be trapped in semantics in determining if Singapore is an ally of the US - with or without any Formal Alliance. </p>
              <p>Have you forgotten what you had posted on Pg 4 15 Nov 2008 - <em>"We are just a regional partner, an FTA partner. Though we have several defence cooperations, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore chose</span> not to call these cooperations an "Alliance" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">due to regional sensitivities</span>.  Understand?"</em></p>
              <p>Can you even understand what you have written in the paragraph extracted about the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">necessity of hiding</span></strong> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">these cooperations</span>" and not calling it an "<em>Alliance</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Not having any Formal Agreement, or Formal Alliance, or Formal Ties - does not necessarily mean Singapore is not an ally to the USA.</p>
              <p>Was it the press that inaccurately hype the word "ally" in describing the US-SG ties ?</p>
              <p>In a publication in 1999, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42191">Defense Secretary William Cohen said he counts Singapore among the United States' strongest allies in Southeast Asia and looks forward to even stronger relations in the next millennium </a></p>
              <p>Even the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Singapor.htm">“Human Rights Watch”  </a>sees Singapore as an Ally of the USA with the Bush Administration dragging its feet in pressuring the Singapore Government to relent on its Human Rights abuse towards its Citizens. </p>

              <p>Did you read the explanation and educate yourself to the meaning of what was written, or did you simply "cut and paste" and let the words do the job for you ?</p>
              <p>The following is a paragraph extracted from your 'wiki' reference site:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>memorandum of understanding</strong> (<strong>MOU</strong> or <strong>MoU</strong>) is a <a title="Document" href="/wiki/Document"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">document</span></span></a> describing a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Bilateral" href="/wiki/Bilateral"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">bilateral</span></span></a> or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Multilateral" href="/wiki/Multilateral"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">multilateral</span></span></a> <a title="Agreement" href="/wiki/Agreement"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">agreement</span></span></a> between parties. It expresses a convergence of will between the parties, indicating an intended common line of action. It most often is used in cases where parties either do not imply a legal commitment or in situations where the parties cannot create a legally enforcement agreement. It is a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>more formal</strong></span> alternative to a <a title="Gentlemen's agreement" href="/wiki/Gentlemen%27s_agreement"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">gentlemen's agreement</span></span></a>.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Now it seems that 'wiki' describe the MOU between the US and SG Government as a "<em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more formal alternative</span></span></em>" - which means that what you had written on Pg 4 is no longer valid, that the SG Govenment need to hide from being an US Ally.</p>
              <p>This pretty much confirms what I had posted in my reply to you on Pg 4, that - "In 1998, Singapore has a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FORMAL</span></strong> Agreement with the USA that allowed the US Navy to dock at the Changi Naval Base and take on resupply".</p>
              <p>Wiki also explain that the MOU "<em>expresses a convergence of will between the parties, indicating an intended common line of action</em>" - if SG and USA do not see things with the same vision and have any convergence of will on isssues of economics and security, will such an MOU exist - in place of more Formal Alliance that may brush the bristles of our ASEAN neighbors ?</p>
              <p>Put it this way, the MOU is a 'half-way' to a more Formal Alliance - by itself, it already formalise the Formal Ties, and at the same time meets with the requirement of the SG Government not to brush our neighbors on the wrong side.</p>
              <p>How do you wish to re-interprete what your 'wiki' site has printed that will favor your position and educate me further ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>After reading up on all this.  Can you tell me which part of MOU, and Non-Aligned movement can possibly spell a foreign policy of US-Singapore Alliance?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Have you read the contents of your referenced wiki site concerning the Non-Aligned Movement, or is this another 'cut-and-paste' job ?</p>
              <p>Is Singapore a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, or is it like all that the LKY Administration has said and done with supposed cold pragmatism - towards Singaporeans, as well as towards the international community ?</p>
              <p>Say one thing, and doing another.</p>
              <p>The opening paragraph of your wiki site had stated - "<em>The <strong>Non-Aligned Movement</strong> (<strong>NAM</strong>) is an </em><a title="International organization" href="/wiki/International_organization"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>international organization</em></span></span></a><em> of states considering themselves not formally aligned with or against any major </em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Power (international)" href="/wiki/Power_(international)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>power</em></span></span></a><em> bloc</em>".</p>
              <p>If Singapore is truly a member of the Non-Aligned Movement - would it have invited the US Military to have free access to its deep water Naval Base, and re-supply services of the SAF air bases ?</p>
              <p>Is it not very unusual for a member of the Non-Aligned Movement to send a aerial refuelling tanker, and an armed LST in support of the US led Iraq War that is strongly opposed by all other members of the Non-Aligned Movement ?</p>
              <p>Has Singapore not contravened the very principle of non-alignment by such close association with the USA, and in support of its military services and military adventures ? </p>
              <p>Can you appreciate the significance or gravity of the actions that the Singapore Government has taken in its deliberate actions in support of the US policies ?</p>

              <p>Atobe, you're a pretty enthusiastic user on sgforums, and its really fun to see some of your views sometimes, but please do your research about such "inferences" that may not necessarily be true.  Especially so when people have TOLD you, you are wrong.</p>
              <p>We exist in a sensitive region where it is better for us to pursue multi-lateral relations than to bank on the help of one "Ally."  Even if we do have some relations with particular "superpowers", we need to maintain a form of "deniability" by not officially stating that we are aligned with any one power.  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> It is interesting to note that my post in sgforums had your attention, and that you are amused by some of my views.</p>
              <p>"Inferences" are a matter of opinions, as much as how details and facts are interpreted, or re-interpreted - and I accept all reasonable and reasonably presented arguments.</p>
              <p>I am not sure who are "those people who have TOLD me that I am wrong, as what had been written by them were also given my counter challenge with logic and substantiated arguments that their valued positions are mistaken.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, while Singapore is pursuing multi-relations with different countries, the Singapore Political Leaders are banking on the US to come to our aid, as the US did when Kuwait was taken over by Sadam Hussein - even when there is no Formal Alliance between the US and Kuwait.</p>

              <p>Continuing from the above, you may wish to peruse the following views from Academia - of which the essential part is extracted.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ontheissues.org/askme/singapore.htm">JesseGordon gave this response on 8/29/2000: I'd like to clarify a couple of points from my colleague's answer.</a></p>
              <p>First, Singapore is only small geographically. Typically, the US bases its foreign policy on ECONOMIC size, not on GEOGRAPPHIC size or POPULATION size.</p>
              <p>If we based it on geography, we'd care a lot more about Brazil; if we based it on population we'd care a lot more about India.</p>
              <p>We base foreign policy on economic size because that's what matters to the US -- how much we can trade with them, etc.</p>
              <p>Singapore is certainly not one of the world's larger economies, but it's a lot bigger economically than it is geographically (a 20-mile island) or by population (just 4 million people). But it's in the same category as Denmark or Israel, economically, which is well above most African, Asian, or Latin American countries. Some nice figures to substantiate that are at http://www.odci.gov/cia/di/products/hies/hies.pdf -- Singapore makes it (barely) into the "select list" of countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second, Singapore DOES have "most favored nation" status. MFN is an oddly-named status; it just means that the country gets the same status as the most-favored nation, which is the same thing as saying, open trade. Because it's so hard to state it that way, the new term is "NTR", for "Normal Trading Relations."</p>
              <p>Singapore has NTR (and MFN) status with the US. We have no import restrictions, and no special tariffs, for Singapore.</p>
              <p>In the world of international trade, "normal" means "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>most favored</em></span></span>."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Third, it's true that Singapore has a one-party government. But they are by no means a strong-man dictatorship -- they're a democracy.</p>
              <p>The US would NEVER put sanctions against a government like Singapore's -- their leaders are elected democratically.</p>
              <p>It's a non-Western authoritarian form of democracy, like Japan and South Korea have, but it IS a democracy. Their one-party state COULD be voted out of power, as Japan's was. I predict that will happen in about 10 years in Singapore -- see http://webmerchants.com/spectrum/bubble.htm#4 for details.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, the US does have some defense relationship with Singapore. <strong>It's true that we have no formal defense relationship</strong> (which would be through SEATO, the US's Pacific equivalent of NATO). But Singapore is a member of ASEAN (the economic Association of South East Asian Nations), which the US is associated with through its membership in the ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum, which has some security aspects to it).</p>
              <p>It's unlikely that the US would feel obligated by treaty to come to the military assistance of Singapore, but it's also unlikely that anyone would invade.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But we were not obligated by treaty to come to the military assistance of Kuwait or Kosovo either, and we did -- I suspect we would do the same for Singapore.</span></p>
              <p>We DO use Singapore as a port of call for US Navy ships (I've seen them in the harbor), and when the US bases in the Philippines were closing, Singapore considered opening a new US base there (I think it was rejected because the island is just too small). Overall, 's answers are correct, but miss the spirit -- <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore is an ally, as far as the US is concerned</span></span></strong>, for the basic reason that they are a developed capitalist democracy. </p>

              <p>From what you have posted, it will reveal that you
                  will need to do more research into the historical
                  relationships of Denmark, Sweden, Spain and New Zealand with
                  the USA.</p>
              <p>These countries that you have named may have the highest
                  standards of democracy that have brought them to First World Status
                  for their citizens - not their political leaders only - but does
                  that necessarily result in the best of political relations with the
                  USA ?</p>
              <p>Denmark and Sweden have never supported the US military
                  adventures - from Vietnam to Afghanistan; the new Spanish
                  Government almost immediately withdrew all Spanish support in the
                  US led Iraq war; while Helen Clark's government pulled NZ out of
                  the Defense arrangement with the USA and ban all US ships from NZ
                  port if they do not declare their nuclear weapons.</p>
              <p>US military force in South Korea and Japan is not to contain
                  China, but more as a safety measure to respond to an unpredicatable
                  North Korean leadership that started the war in the Korean
                  Peninsular in the 1950s.</p>
              <p>I am not sure how you manage to conclude that I should "think
                  of Singapore's position in the World as being highly placed";
                  perhaps you should seek some help in reading and understanding the
                  "Heading of this thread", and what has been posted todate.</p>
              <p>If you think that Obama is not as knowledgeable or unconcern
                  with the events in our part of the World, you may yet live to
                  re-assess your position during his term in office.</p>
              <p>One thing seems to be a certainty, Obama knows where he can get
                  the most reliable and unadulterated help from - and for now, it
                  does not seem to have included any advise from despots - who
                  believe in the pseudo-science of eugenics.</p>

              <p>Must i spell out everything. South Korea, as stated in my initial post and which i stated to refer to in my second post, was to provide a base for US troops to react immediately to any North Korean activities. Nothing was said in my initial post that US troops are stationed in South Korea and Japan to contain the Chinese. The containment of China portion is attributed to Australia if you had read carefully.</p>
              <p>My point about Obama not including those countries is a response to your allegation that Obama didn't include Singapore because of our lack of democracy or despotism as you term it. As your response shows, not including these countries is entirely due to them not having close relations to the US and not due to them having a lack of democracy.</p>
              <p><strong>Everything i have posted can be easily explained or supported by the state of current affairs . But your point about Obama not including Singapore due to despotism, maybe you could cite some examples whereby Obama is concerned about our despotism to prove your point? (Bold here so that you could focus your reply on providing some concrete examples. Thanks)</strong></p>
              <p>And yes, Obama might be aware of events in our region, but would Obama prioritise despotism in Singapore over the war in Iraq and the state of the global economy? Over the state of Kim Jong Il's health and North Korea? Over the nuclear situation in Iran? Over the rise of Russia and China as powers that could rival or at least threaten the US?</p>
              <p>I would really be happy if Obama did take an interest in Singapore politics, it would mean that he would have solved so many of the world's problem that he has the time to intervene in such an unimportant affairs. I sincerely hope that what you have attributed to Obama is true, that he is concerned about despotism in Singapore rather than because Singapore is just not worth mentioning.</p>

              <p>Clearly, he intended the First World of Economically Advance Nations, without the criteria of political freedom for the citizens.</p>
              <p>If LKY is not even a World Class despot, he will have to wait in line for Obama to reach him, as he and his Government is not considered as World Class even amongst the rogue nations.</p>

              <p>I think I've proven my point and said my piece.</p>
              <p>Our relations with the United States is not one of formal alliance by any form of treaty.  An MOU, is a non-legal binding document.  If you choose not to understand that, that is your problem.</p>
              <p>As a non-aligned member, Singapore still contributes as it plays a part in the UN Sanctioned activities.  </p>
              <p>Hence my argument is this:</p>
              <p>Because Singapore is not an official Ally of the United States, Obama who is not yet the President, has no reason to include Singapore into a series of calls that were publicly acknowledged to be for privileged and official allies.</p>
              <p>I have made and proven my point with the US State Department's official stand on Singapore, as well as interpretations of MoUs and Non-aligned movements. </p>
              <p>Your argument of Obama not wanting to deal with "despots" is however, unproven. </p>

              <p>I think I've proven my point and said my piece.</p>
              <p>Our relations with the United States is not one of formal alliance by any form of treaty.  An MOU, is a non-legal binding document.  If you choose not to understand that, that is your problem.</p>
              <p>As a non-aligned member, Singapore still contributes as it plays a part in the UN Sanctioned activities.  </p>
              <p>Hence my argument is this:</p>
              <p>Because Singapore is not an official Ally of the United States, Obama who is not yet the President, has no reason to include Singapore into a series of calls that were publicly acknowledged to be for privileged and official allies.</p>
              <p>I have made and proven my point with the US State Department's official stand on Singapore, as well as interpretations of MoUs and Non-aligned movements. </p>
              <p>Your argument of Obama not wanting to deal with "despots" is however, unproven. </p>
              <p>What you wish to make of the little molehill is your business, amateur. </p>
              <p>Shotgun out. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How pathetically potent can a Shotgun be ?</p>
              <p>After being exposed for the ignorance in the quoted reference pieces for M.O.U and Non-Alignment Movement - confounded by clear facts, all that a Shotgun can do is to unload and make a hasty retreat, and shamelessly cop out with a childish shot.</p>
              <p>It simply shows the maturity of one who believe in the false potency of a "Shotgun" - when the character is no better then a "short gun" capable of firing nothing more lethal then noisy blanks.</p>
              <p>Surely I had expected higher standard from "The Shotgun", or perhaps it was sadly misplaced considering that it was a misnomer from the beginning as it should have been a simple "short gun" ?</p>
              <p>What has Singapore membership in the Non-Aligned Movement to do with her membership dues in the United Nation ?</p>
              <p>Being a member of the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">United Nation</span></em> and the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Aligned Movement</span></em> - has Singapore respected the Charter of both Organisations ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, NO on both counts - as I had shown in my earlier response that clearly detailed how SG had abrogated the Non-Aligned Movement principles by associating so closely with the USA.</p>
              <p>It is typical of LKY in his usual ways of using people and organisations to serve his own ends, and discarding them when he reach another rung up his "security ladder".</p>
              <p>You did claim the necessity to hide the relationship between USA and SG so as not to alarm our neighbors - yet you will insist that since there is no FORMAL Alliance, then SG is NOT an ally of USA. It is amazing that without all the Formal Ties, and without the egging on of the papparazzi as you claimed, the Secretary of Defense William Cohen recognised and publicly stated that SG is a strong ALLY of the USA.</p>
              <p>Period.</p>
              <p>Clearly you are confused about the technicalities between Treaties of Alliances, M.O.U.s and any other forms that two partners can enter to solidify their status of co-operation.</p>
              <p>Clearly you are confused about the status of the co-operation that Singapore has with the USA - to deny that SG is not a "formal ally" of the USA - when you had clearly tripped yourself with the shallowness in your thought process by taking on a position that is clearly out of your orbit.</p>
              <p>It seems that you are being educated instead of achieving your boast to educate me.</p>
              <p>Do I need to prove anything, or should you not prove if Obama had called any one of the World reknown despots up to this date to show that I am wrong ?</p>
              <p>The problem with complacency with a simple mole on the face is that it can easily become a molehill, which in turn can become a mountain when you ignore the malignancy of that simple mole.</p>
              <p>Only a superficial person will draw simple black-and-white conclusions from political issues, when politicians are smarter by taking advantage that the "full spectrum of White" can offer to perform their deeds.</p>

              <p>I'll make it even simpler for you to understand.  </p>
              <p>Fact, MoUs are non-legally binding documents.  Treaties are.  Hence, we do not have any official treaty of alliance with the United States.  Can you refute that Fact?  Yes/No</p>
              <p>If you cannot, you do not have any case. What Cohen says from his lips, is hardly a legally binding treaty don't you think? </p>
              <p>Singapore position in the non-aligned movement Officially states that we are not aligned to any power bloc.  Can you refute that Fact?  Yes/No</p>
              <p> Does it make any sense that we are involved in a movement that is contradictory to our foreign policy?  Yes/No</p>
              <p>The 9 countries that Obama called up, all have some form of treaties with the United States.  Can you refute that?  Yes/No</p>
              <p> Does Singapore have any Official treaty with the United States?  Yes/No</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your argument that Obama did not call PM LHL up because LHL's a despot, was it a fact or your own opinion?  Fact / Opinion </p>
              <p>If its fact, you must some how "Know" so.  How did you know? Are you really Obama?  Or did Obama tell you?  Perhaps his staff told you? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a difference between an argument thats based on established facts and official sources, and one thats based on opinions and inferences.  Yours is clearly based on your own opinion, which I doubt you are in any position to make, Amateur. </p>

              <p>However, let me state that, you do provide a good amount of entertainment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Though your views are clearly skewed and distorted, its still worth a good laugh. </p>
              <p>Here is a really funny example.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Did you read about Obama's attitude about changing the Bush Administration policy in not talking to despots, and of his desires to engage these despots without pre-conditions ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Did you even know what that <span style="font-weight: bold;">meant</span>?  </p>
              <p>The Bush administration did not want to talk to "despots" whom they had issues with (eg North Korea) with out them first having met US Pre-conditions. (Eg. terminating of uranium enrichment or process of building such facilities)</p>
              <p>Obama changing attitude was to meet these "despots" without any pre-conditions, to place diplomacy at the forefront of problem solving with these "despots."  Therefore opening up channels of communications with them, as he firmly believes that issues can be resolved as long as people keep talking to each other. </p>
              <p>How <span style="font-weight: bold;">that</span> became an example for "Obama being concerned about our despotism" really had me laughing out loud, really!  <span style="font-style: italic;">How did that support your argument in a debate where you claimed that Obama did not want to talk to our Singapore's despots, WHEN it clearly showed that he was more willing to communicate to everyone? </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>What "facts" are you intending to reinvent from the bluster and false hits that you think  have been achieved by your buckshots ?</p>
              <p>After giving me the "wiki reference" in your last post, it seems that you did not attempt to educate yourself first before boastfully attempt to educate me. Perhaps you need some tutoring in some of the more important facts concerning MoUs as taken from your <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding</a> - which provided the following:-</p>
              <p>1. In some cases, depending on the exact wording, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MoUs can have the binding power of a </span><a title="Contract" href="/wiki/Contract"><span style="color: #002bb8;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">contract</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">; as a matter of law</span>, contracts do not need to be labeled as such to be legally binding.</p>
              <p>2. In international relations, MoUs fall under the broad category of <a title="Treaty" href="/wiki/Treaty"><span style="color: #002bb8;">treaties</span></a> and should be registered in the United Nations treaty database<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #002bb8;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></a></sup>.</p>
              <p>3. To determine whether or not a particular MoU is meant to be a legally binding document (i.e. a treaty), one needs to examine the intent of the parties and well as the position of the signatories.</p>
              <p>4. One advantage of MoUs over more formal instruments is that, because obligations under international law may be avoided, they can be put into effect in most countries without requiring parliamentary approval. Hence, MoUs are often used to modify and adapt existing treaties, in which case these <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MoUs have factual treaty status</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> Singapore has more then a dozen MoU with the US Government that allowed the various RSAF units to train in the USA.</p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> If the MoUs are non-legal and non-binding, will the Singapore Government expose Singapore to sudden termination of our multi-million investments in weapons purchase and training in the USA ?</p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> Shotgun deny the facts stated in his own referenced evidence.</p>

              <p>If you cannot, you do not have any case. What Cohen says from his lips, is hardly a legally binding treaty don't you think? </p>

              <p>It is not so clever in attempting to smoke your way out of the hole you dug for yourself.</p>
              <p>Only the kid with a Shotgun will be so brazenly flippant as to deride an honorable William Cohen to be a lesser person then what you can possibly hope to be.</p>
              <p>The words spoken from the lips of a US Secretary of Defense William Cohen which confirm the status of Singapore as a strong Ally of the USA - is collaborated from the number of MoUs that the US and SG Governments had committed to; and as well as from the support that SG Government had given not only in words but also in deeds.</p>
              <p>Compared to your claim that "the idea of SG being an ally" was promoted by the paparazzi, it has now been shown that even the US Secretary of Defense recognised that SG is a firm Ally of the USA.</p>
              <p>Is your naive verbal claim that SG is NOT an ALLY more plausible than that spoken by the US Secretary of Defense ?</p>
              <p>Grow up, if you are so eager to hit your target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> SG has been consistently recognised as an Ally of the USA despite the changes made in the US Administration, and also by the US Congress and the Senate.</p>

              <p>If Singapore is not aligned to any power bloc, she certainly behave in some very strange ways that the naive Shotgun fail to see through the smoke created by all the blank shots fired.</p>
              <p>What the Non-Aligned Movement stated in its Charter is a FACT.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the actions taken by the SG Government does not conform to its membership in the Non-Aligned Movement.</p>
              <p>This can be seen in SG's role in supporting the unpopular US War in Iraq by sending an aerial refueling tanker and a LST to patrol and even taking command of a task force to patrol the closed waters north of the Straits of Hormuz.</p>
              <p>Is it not strange that as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, SG willingly extend an invitation to the US Military to peruse the naval and air bases on Singapore soil ?</p>
              <p>This is done even by ignoring the outcry from some of the founding members of the ASEAN countries - of which SG is one.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore an active member of the Non-Aligned Movement ?</p>

              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> Singapore's consistent unflinching support to the unpopular US war in Iraq, and open invitation to the US Military to use Singapore's military bases, as well as the multiple MoUs signed with the US Government - are actions that have contradicted the Principles of the Non-Aligned Movement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does LKY explain anything to Singaporeans for his actions in contradicting all that is printed in the Singapore Constitution, the National Anthem, the Singapore Pledge that proudly declare equality, freedom, democracy and justice ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> LKY's style has been clear from the beginning of his involvement in politics - making use of any individual or organisation to advance his own goals.</p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> In 1950s, LKY introduced <a rel="nofollow" href="http://leelilian.blogspot.com/2007/09/lim-chin-siong-man-who-was-nearly-our_11.html">Lim Chin Siong </a>as the most capable Singaporean to be the future Prime Minister, only to arrange for Lim to be <a rel="nofollow" href="http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.singapore/2008-05/msg01291.html">unkindly betrayed </a>- as we now can see from the documents released by the British Colonial Office in London.</p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> The consistent contradiction of LKY can be seen in his words and the deeds that follows:</p>

              <p>You say that MoUs can be legally binding <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> cases.  Do you even know what these cases are where they are legally binding?</p>
              <p>Following that, does Singapore have any existing treaty for the above mentioned MoU with the US to "legally" amend and attain "factual treaty status"?  Please go give MFA a call or do you whatever research you see fit.  I know for sure, there was not preceding treaty for the above MoU to amend, and hence not legally binding.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Non-Aligned Movement is just a membership, signifying that they are not a member of a power bloc, and nothing like a formal alliance unlike NATO. It does not penalize its members for seeking friendship and cooperation in time of peace.  There is no such thing as "active" membership.  Its just membership or no membership.  </p>
              <p>Singapore's decisions to help out in Iraq is perhaps partially helpful to improve ties with the US, but there are very utilitarian views from LKY about it.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030702429.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030702429.html</a></p>
              <p>There are greater security implications with the power balance in the middle east that LKY, or Singapore is /ought to be concerned with.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps to refine my argument further.  Obama's called up close allies, countries which have official treaties with them.  Singapore's <span style="font-weight: bold;">status </span>is not one of official "Ally."  Neither Singapore nor The US State Department's official stand on our relationship is one of "alliance."  We are partners in many ways, but not in official status allies.</p>
              <p>I'm not even worried about the nuances of our level of cooperation with the US simply because my argument is about <span style="font-weight: bold;">status</span></p>
              <p>Your argument is that Obama did not call Singapore because he did not want to speak to despots.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Can you prove it with any facts?</span>  I'm not asking you to prove whether LKY is a despot, I'm asking you to prove Obama's explicit views on Singapore, and that his views affected the decision not to talk to us.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">How can you possibly prove that?</span></p>
              <p>The link between our authoritarian government and Obama's non-inclusion of Singapore into his list of allies to call, is something <span style="font-weight: bold;">you totally made up.  Your Inference.  </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now known as the "atobe doctrine."</span></p>
              <p>And honestly speaking, your argument is going OUT THE WINDOW, the moment Obama's administration talks to Singapore. </p>
              <p>Your points on LKY are good, but nonetheless have no relevance unless you are able to prove the above.  Until you can do that, I'll just treat it as the "populist"  smoke bomb that it is. </p>
              <p>Look amateur, the reason I think you so, is because you construct an argument out of inference and feelings.  Opinions are nice to have, but don't really hold any weight in an argument unless it is an opinion from an authoritative source, which you are not. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can call me whatever names you want, it just goes to show how immature and amateurish you are in arguments.  Looks like after this episode, a number of users have seen that for themselves.  You overlook the blatantly obvious facts (in this case status), and you construct an argument out inferences made out of non-relevant facts (Singapore's authoritarian government, LKY). </p>
              <p>What does that go to show about you?  Reckless, irrational and immature.  Just like CSJ when he was younger.  Making audacious claims without having factual evidence to back him up.  </p>
              <p>So what other names are you gonna call me now?</p>

              <p>With your reliance on "wiki" as a reference point, perhaps you should take a peek into the rich amount of information that it has offered about the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement">Non-Aligned Movement </a>- and which has largely contradict and debunked your present statement.</p>
              <p>If you do take an interest to truly educate yourself by taking a peek at the given "wiki" site, you should pay particular attention to (1) The Origin of N.A.M., (2) Organisational Structure, (3) Ongoing Policies and Ideology - more importantly - (4) Contemporary Relevance.</p>
              <p>You may wish to note that - "<em>The movement continues to see a role for itself - no longer by opposing superpowers, but rather in a uni-polar world, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is Western hegemony and neo-colonialism that the movement has really re-aligned itself against</span></em>."</p>
              <p>If one is not an active adherent to an organisation, why join it in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Unlike Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia - like so many other member nations of  N.A.M - the other countries in N.A.M have behaved in less hypocritical ways by adhering to the N.A.M Principles of non-alignment.</p>
              <p>This cannot be said of Singapore - and although no penalties are applied, the SG leadership has been treated with disdain, which largely explains for some of the less diplomatic opinions expressed in private - at times negative reactions expressed very publicly - by other government leaders.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Singaporeans have been made to pay a higher price for some of the ill conceived policies adopted by our SG leaders. </p>

              <p>Singapore's decisions to help out in Iraq is perhaps partially helpful to improve ties with the US, but there are very utilitarian views from LKY about it.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>You must be deluding yourself by assuming that the minisicular contribution from SG can determine whatever power balance in the Middle-east, when the USA cannot even prevent or determine how the end game will appear in Iraq.</p>
              <p>Your point concerning the "very utilitarian views from LKY" is already well known - as he has been seen to be ruthlessly exploitative of circumstances to advance his own goals - and changing course without any qualms in sacrificing others whom he can treat as pawns from his chess board.</p>
              <p>It only shows that SG membership in the United Nations and in N.A.M is for superficial purposes to gain recognition, while LKY has shown that he will not be bounded by the rules and conventions spelled out in the Constitutions of these Organisations.</p>
              <p>He has even abused the very principle of an independent Singapore as clearly laid out in the Singapore Constitution - do you think that membership in N.A.M or the UN means anything at all to LKY ?</p>
              <p>If it is pure utilitarian view, what is the point in your bringing up the fact that SG is a member of N.A.M. in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Are you conceding now that SG is an ALLY of the USA - even as you derided the honorable Willian Cohen who said so, in his capacity as the US Secretary of Defense ?</p>

              <p>I'm not even worried about the nuances of our level of cooperation with the US simply because my argument is about <span style="font-weight: bold;">status</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You should only try to refine your arguments further, after you read, absorb and refine your own misguided understanding to your own "wiki" referenced material about M.o.Us and Treaties.</p>
              <p>How much more "<strong>OFFICIAL</strong>" do you want SG to be before being recognised as being or having the <strong>status</strong> of an ALLY of the USA ?</p>
              <p>From a study by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.apcss.org/Publications/SAS/APandtheUS/SmithSingapore2.pdf">Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies </a>- (Pg 4 of 8) - it reported that "during 2004 the two countries continued to negotiate the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore-U.S. Strategic Framework Agreement</span></strong>, which will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>further define defense and security ties</strong></span> - although the exact details are not yet public. Frank Lavin, U.S. Ambassador to SGP, has defined this Framework Agreement not as a formal defense alliance, but as an agreement that will facilitate greater cooperation in terms of joint exercises.... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The signing of an agreement is also likely to facilitate Singaporean access to U.S. defense technology</span>."</p>
              <p>The study had also highlighted the fact that SGP has to accomodate the feelings and politics of her neighbors, and find that formal alliance with the USA does not create any further advantage to both parties, while MoUs and Agreements seems more effective and help to achieve the immediate political and security requirements.</p>
              <p>It also reported that SGP and the U.S. have been negotiating a <strong>Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty</strong> (MLAT) that will facilitate co-operation between the two countries in combating money laundering through the banking system that unwittingly channel funds to terrrorists.</p>
              <p>Here is one clear US-SGP Treaty that is non-threatening to SGP's neighbors - and is clearly announced; while the other military-security co-operation are achieved by less offending treaty-like MoUs that still have equal binding status as FORMAL as Treaty can be - {as stated by Your wiki site).</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Your argument is that Obama did not call Singapore because he did not want to speak to despots.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Can you prove it with any facts?</span>  I'm not asking you to prove whether LKY is a despot, I'm asking you to prove Obama's explicit views on Singapore, and that his views affected the decision not to talk to us.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">How can you possibly prove that?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You must be truly childish and naive to ask for proof, when the proof is already shown in his inaction in not calling a single despot from the list of countries that the State Department has classified as abusing the U.S. Principles of Political Freedom.</p>
              <p>In the same reference piece from Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies - it had detailed that - "differences in political structure mean that the US and SG still do not see eye-to-eye on human rights issues...The U.S. State Department continues to cite a lack of political freedom in SG, but differences on this front do not impede economic, political and security cooperation"</p>
              <p>"The U.S. State Department, in its annual human rights reports, finds that Singapore's judiciary is not wholly independent of the ruling party and that the courts are often used against political opponents. While noting that SG largely respects human rights, the 2003 report also noted the SG government's penchant to limit freedoms and 'handicap political opposition' ".</p>
              <p>Do you think that Obama has no access to this State Department Report when it is available to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies ?</p>
              <p>Obama's views on talking to despots are clear.</p>
              <p>The U.S. State Department views on Singapore politics are just as clear.</p>
              <p>Do you think that Obama is not aware of events in SG - when <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporepatriot.blogspot.com/2008/02/obama-praises-singapores-education.html">Obama praise SG education system </a>at a Democratic Election Rally in the recently concluded Elections ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that the derisive remarks of the famed SG despot towards Obama - made months ago - has not reached him, when Obama is known to be an avid "Blackberry" user, and constantly fed with information from friends to the going-ons around the globe ? (see Times November Edition commemorating Obama's victory). </p>
              <p>Do you need lessons to make inferences in forming your own conclusions ?</p>
              <p>If you have been entirely educated in SG, it probably explains for your inability to make your research and consistent dependence on Black and White Answers placed on the table for your mind to ponder if it is even safe to absorb.</p>

              <p>With Obama having to clear his immediate domestic problems, balancing finances to meet his promised programs, and settling the Iraq issues - he will then lined up his time to talk to the despots.</p>

              <p>Was CSJ as reckless, immature, and irrational, or have you simply succumbed to the propaganda - which is so readily and easily absorbed by a naive, immature and politically undiscerning mind that is trapped in a self-indulging, egoistically, cock-sure braggart tightly fitted into a gung-ho Shotgun toting kid ?</p>
              <p>It seems that the only one making more audacious claims is you - with your poor understanding of the MoUs, and N.A.M. to the extent of even making audacious rejection of facts by even ridiculing the honorable William Cohen's recognition of SG as a true ALLY of the U.S.A.</p>
              <p>What has your argument been all about - that SG is not an ALLY of the USA, and / or that SG is not run by DESPOTS ?</p>
              <p>The statements made in my post have been clear if you still want to dispute that SG is not an ALLY.</p>
              <p>It is common knowledge that SG is run by leaders who pretend to be what they claim they are not, but in actual fact are no better then third world DESPOTS.</p>
              <p>Obama's attitude towards DESPOTS are known - that they must be engaged and not left alone to do their evil deed to endanger the world - and he did say that he will call them at his own time.</p>
              <p>The 9 countries that Obama called have ties to the USA that are of varying qualities, with some countries not having the quality relationship that SG has with the USA.</p>

              <p>Seriously, in terms of immaturity, recklessness, and irrationality - it is not unique to CSJ alone, as one can see the same in LKY, LHL, GCT, MBT and other newly promoted Ministers in LHL's cabinet.</p>
              <p>They had the good fortune of having the various print and broadcast media under their control, and allowed their immaturity, recklessness and irrationality not being emphasised, and the continuous publicity being muted.</p>
              <p>Unlike them, the spotlight has clearly been focused on your <strong>irrational interpretation</strong> of your own reference materials, resulting in the extreme publicity being given to your <strong>immature political views</strong>, that seems to have bolstered your egoistic poppycock <strong>drive towards recklessness</strong> in your boastful annoucement to educate me.</p>
