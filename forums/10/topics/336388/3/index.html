              <p>With so many M here, Obama is probably confused as to which one

              <p>Is it not amazing, the world is changing as fast as the time is ticking away, and yet the resident political <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Narcissist">“ narcissist” </a> will claim that we live in ordinary times ?</p>
              <p>Only the Father, the Son and the Holy PAP Ghost and the "croonies" will continue to insist on the status quo so as not to rock their boat that is caught in a world storm.</p>

              <p>In the other thread, I had given the symptoms of a "narcissist" :</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Disorderdf">“A narcissist personality is one who is controlling, blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others’ views, unaware of others’ needs and of the effects of their behaviors on others, and insistent that others see them as they wish to be seen – susceptible to angry outbursts, blame, attempts to instill guilt, emotional withdrawal, and criticism. Such behavior originates from the self-perceived inadequacy in dealing with the real world due to perceived own defective nature, and will insist that others’ should behave in the standards that they cannot attain by controlling others’ perception and behavior towards them.” </a></p>
              <p>It is amazing that the narcissist will believe himself to be disapproving of the present Singapore Government, and at the same time is just as strongly disapproving of the abilities of the various personalities from the Alternative Parties.</p>
              <p>With such cynicism mixed with the volatality of a narcissist - is it any wonder that Singapore continue to exist in a state of political limbo since independence in 1965 ?</p>

              <p>A possible reason why the SG government isn't too excited about Obama is cos he is a Left-leaning liberal, who may seek protectionist means to tweak their economy.  If he does that, our FTAs with the US may be affected, thereby negatively affecting OUR economy.</p>

              <p>Other then the NAFTA signed between USA, Canada and Mexico - that is similar to the USA-SGP FTA - is there any other formal ties between Mexico and USA that can be seen as similar to the other "FORMAL ties" between USA and the other remaining 9 countries that include Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea and UK ?</p>
              <p>Are there any formal ties between France and USA - when France quit NATO due to differences with US policies and politics, and had only recently considered rejoining ?</p>
              <p>Besides not having any other more "formal ties" - there is also <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.foreigntradeexchange.com/countries/france.html">no FTA between France and USA </a>.</p>

              <p>It is simply too early for Obama to be "hard nosed" in his selective approach in responding to the deluge of congratulatory messages.</p>
              <p>If you feel that China and Russia is more weighty than Singapore, can Austalia or South Korea be heavier in weight than China and Russia to warrant the call made ?</p>
              <p>Clearly, the calls made by Obama were to countries that he see a common thread with his political principles of democratic practices, of hope and positive change for their respective citizens.</p>
              <p>Governments that are realistic in their assumptions of their roles in public service instead of self-aggrandizement through inflated self-valuation must surely have gained Obama's respect.</p>
              <p>For his character displayed in listening to the smallest and weakest person, remembering the elderly 103 year old who lived to see this day, the humility displayed in winning this momentous election - he will surely have called Singapore if only we had the shine in our politics that would have been befitting the aura in LKY's claim as the leader of a miracle country belonging to the First World.</p>

              <p>The sad thing is that the GDP growth in SGP is not from some industrial output comparable to that of South Korea, Taiwan, China or Japan, but from the churning of economic activities performed by Singaporeans both in domestic consumption and foreign trade.</p>
              <p>Looking at the report of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://app.mti.gov.sg/data/article/12381/doc/ESS_2007Ann_Ch5.pdf">macro-economic policies </a>for 2007, you can review the Operating Revenues and Expenditures, and will see that much of the Revenue is derived from the domestic economic activities Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>A blooming GDP is the curtains mounted on a window simply to make everything look good, but are Singaporeans wealthy ?</p>
              <p>Considering the changes in income disparity leading to the widening income gap between the high wage group, middle-income group and the lower-income - even as the government claim to positive gain to the rising income of Singaporeans - has there been any change to Singaporean wealth in the face of mounting inflation ?</p>

              <p>In 1998, Singapore has a FORMAL Agreement with the USA that allowed the US Navy to dock at the Changi Naval Base and take on resupply.</p>
              <p>Without having a "formal alliance" in the status that you claim, would Singapore have been given access to all the training facilities used by the USAF ?</p>

              <p>What possibly could your argument be about ?</p>
              <p>Yes, it is due to the sensitivity of any "Formal Alliance" between Singapore and the USA that prevent one from being made.</p>
              <p>It does not prevent the activities from occurring between two countries who have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>chosen each to be allies</em></span> without any need to formalise it.</p>

              <p>Obama has yet to be sworn in, he has no State Department in his administration (which doesn't exist yet).  Until he is sworn in, then he will reshuffle, re-appoint a new Secretary of State.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't say he has no voice yet. However, he recognizes that he needs to establish closer relationships with other world leaders in order to "negotiate without preconditions."  A good point to start with be close allies and neighbors, eg Mexico, Canada, and Key NATO countries, and East Asian Allies.</p>

              <p>Well, i hv seen US navy submarines at sembawang coast and yard, and our govt are also looking for a berth to dock US navy ships n carriers here since Subic in philippines was terminated.</p>

              <p>Obama is a fox, he is very clever, all the above issues are sensitive in term of surrounding neighbours countries view, so, inorder not to beat the grass and alert the snake, he rather not call Singapore so that our relationship with our neighbouring countries will remain as it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Publicity is not flavourable in certain condition, his advisors would had advised him not to include Singapore in it, but to thanks the Singapore Govt in an informal way as close friends do, if he will to thanks us publicitily, and not to Malaysia, indonesia, philippines or SE Asia countries, then there maybe tension within the Asean Countries on us. It is a sensitive issues that in any point of time, a foreign minister of Asean may rise and say "Singapore is nothing but a lackey for the American", we wouldn't want that to happen, would we??</p>

              <p>If Singapore ever bother about her neighbors seeing Singapore as an "American lackey", it certainly does not show for the number of policies that Singapore has made in support of the USA's global politics.</p>
              <p>Against the opinions of her ASEAN neighbors, Singapore was alone in supporting Bush's Iraq War, and was the first in ASEAN to join Bush call "to either stand with him or be against him".</p>
              <p>It was also against the ASEAN neighbors wishes to see South-east Asia as a nuclear free zone, that LKY pursued USA continued presence to dock the US Navy into a newly built Changi Naval Base specially built to accomodate the needs for a deep water resupply facility of the largest aircraft carrier in the world.</p>
              <p>While geo-politics may determine the necessities of who we need to work with, the deep end of the soul will tell one who we can trust as friends beyond the politics and geo-political niceities.</p>
              <p>USA may need to work with China and Russia - that does not mean that she trust them as friends will.</p>

              <p><br>From spittle to pee, that is progress.</p>
              <p>Are you being honest by stating you "don't pee in the bush" - surely you must have done so during your NSF days in the field ?</p>
              <p>Must have learnt something about the wind direction to know that wet pants do happen.</p>
              <p>Phlegm can be swallowed, but if you hold on for too long with the pee - you got to watch the stones.</p>
