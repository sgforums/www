              <p>The old adage still seems valid - stand around and shoot the shit together.</p>
              <p>What else can be expected from losers who cop out early and fall for a sting that was a set up to bring the ego back into an ambush ?</p>
              <p>Plain dumb ego that need to be rub after being left in a sorry state.</p>
              <p>Are you sure you can cope with reality, when you cannot even hold yourself together on your make-belief stage ?</p>
              <p>If this is not simply putting the blame on others for your own sorry state, when you are the unchallenged, non-enterprising type of Singaporean that even The Despot lament he has to lead - and he certainly have led types like you into a cul-de-sac.</p>
              <p>Why blame the Opposition for the sorry state of affairs, when Singaporeans like you do not even take up the cudgel to think for yourself but simply resigned to fate in not being able to produce someone better than yourself to be in the Alternative Parties ?</p>

              <p>Here again, you have fallen for another sting that was left for you to pick on, as it will be expected from one who will allow his ego to lead his thoughts, instead of allowing clear thoughts to mind the ego.</p>
              <p>Do I need to highlight the part in <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span> - when I could have edit it out from my quote taken from the article ?</p>
              <p>Instead, this line was intentionally left in the paragraph as a "clay pigeon" for a trigger happy Shotgun to fire at it with more blanks, and create more entertainment.</p>
              <p>Is there anything to hide - when the following statement in the article was also printed but which you had dishonestly left out of your piece - simply to serve your own ego to prove an invalid and mistaken conclusion ?</p>

              <p>The study had also highlighted the fact that SGP has to accomodate the feelings and politics of her neighbors, and find that formal alliance with the USA does not create any further advantage to both parties, while MoUs and Agreements seems more effective and help to achieve the immediate political and security requirements.</p>

              <p>Surely you should be able to recognised the contents of the second paragraph which you prefer not to quote, and which surely you must be familiar to the meaning of the statement ?</p>
              <p>Is the second paragraph not similar to your response on Pg 4, 16 Nov 08, 11.53PM - when you did offer the following statement:</p>
              <p>"<em>We exist in a sensitive region where it is better for us to pursue multi-lateral relations than to bank on the help of one "Ally."  Even if we do have some relations with particular "superpowers", <span style="color: #ff0000;">we need to maintain a form of "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">deniability</span>" by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not officially</span> stating that <strong>we are aligned</strong> with any one power</span>."</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>If we need to maintain a form of "deniability" for the consumption of those whom we do not wish to offend, <strong>do we need to deny the facts to ourselves as well</strong> ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, are we aligned or are we not aligned ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here again, in negotiating the <strong>Singapore-US Strategic Framework Agreement</strong> - instead of using the term Treaty or even MoU - the spirit of this AGREEMENT is tantamount to that of a Treaty or even a MoU - as can be seen from the stated intent for this Agreement to be made. (It is obvious you did not read the wiki site given).</p>
              <p>More importantly, it also concluded that - "<em>The signing of an Agreement is also likely to facilitate Singaporean access to U.S. defense technology</em>".</p>
              <p>If this Agreement is not another Treaty what else can this Agreement be that allow Singapore access to U.S. defense technology ?</p>
              <p>If you had the wherewithal ability to have clicked on the referenced site - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.apcss.org/Publications/SAS/APandtheUS/SmithSingapore2.pdf">Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies </a>- as given in my last post, you will have also read that even as Singapore is not an "<em>Official Ally"</em> of the USA, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2004/mar/16mar04_nr.html">Singapore is the only Asian country to participate in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme.  </a></p>
              <p>The JSF programme is an important programme for the US Air Force - which makes it even more surprising for Japan and South Korea not being invited to be a participant - despite their MORE Official Treaty status than Singapore.</p>
              <p>So are we aligned or are we not aligned ?</p>
              <p>Surely you have some courage not to lie to yourself on a simple issue such as this ?</p>

              <p>And Mas Selamat has a list of open FRIENDS to call, eg Osama, al-Zawahiri etc... Does it make sense for him to include You in the list if both of you intend to keep your friendship under a shroud of plausible deniability?  </p>

              <p>Still, because we do not have an official alliance, there was no reason to include us.</p>

              <p>It is simply PRESUMPTIOUS of you to assume that Obama did not call Singapore because of "Despotic leaders" as you claim.  Moreover, it even contradicts Obama's publicised policy of talking to people without pre-conditions.   Obama's intentions as announced in the run up of his elections is to open communications with people the US has trouble with, and not just offer the silent treatment.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's JSF partnership is due the fact that we were willing to throw in our chips $ into the program.  No doubt, JSF intends to market into South Korea and Japan, unfortunately, they aren't interested when they know that there's something better known as the Raptor.   Hence, they don't intend to throw money into joining the JSF partnership.  If Japan and South Korea wanted to, they can easily do it by just contributing and joining the program.  Singapore is in because we were willing to throw in the chips, no doubt influenced by our Mexican advisors. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I've had enough of this.  I realized that all your replies have been nothing but an effort to get me to keep coming back to engage in your empty nonsensical and unproven argument.  </p>
              <p>I'll leave it to the rest of the rational users following this thread to decide whose argument is more persuasive, logical and backed up by facts. </p>

              <p>The lack of any "official alliance" is not equated by "lack of treaties" - as the "Treaties" have taken a different format and with these "Treaties" disguised as 'MoU' and 'Agreements' - which YOUR offered 'wiki' reference sites have clearly stated that MoU's have the same formal status as TREATIES.</p>
              <p>How much more OFFICIAL an alliance must be - when Singapore has supported the condemned U.S. policies in Iraq, even when the larger membership of the United Nations had disagreed strongly with the U.S. -and this included the majority of members of N.A.M. ?</p>

              <p>Can the Raptor be better then the JSF - when the US is concerned about technology leaks, and will insist on a "watered down version" of the Raptor before allowing its sales overseas - even to one of its most trusted allies ?</p>
              <p>From the US point of view :-</p>

              <p>An assessment given by a Defense Correspondent concerning Japan's position seems to have differed from your stated assumptions of Japan's position towards the JSF Programme:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.afji.com/2007/03/2545493">Tokyo’s relationship to the Joint Strike Fighter captures the country’s ongoing confusion in handling security issues: It seeks greater capabilities than the F-35 promises, but does not have a clear doctrine as to how it will use them; it has one of the most advanced defense industries in Asia, but is unable to participate in the JSF program due to a long-standing ban on arms exports. Tokyo will be grappling with these contradictions for years to come, and the F-35 program will be a useful example to see how it does so.  </a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to the South Korean's position, the same Defense Correspondent offers the follow views :  </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.afji.com/2007/03/2545493">South Korea presents an opposite trend, where Seoul is reluctant to commit to closer ties to Washington despite being a formal ally. Seoul recently procured a large number of F-15 aircraft from the U.S., but its emphasis on developing more self-reliant defense capabilities conflicts with the possible benefits for working with Washington on a program like the F-35 or even taking a qualified role as a security cooperation partner. </a></p>

              <p>The cream of the comment about Singapore throwing its chip$ into the JSF programme seems to indicate Singapore's continued interest in insuring her security interest by strategically placing herself closer to the USA, and subtlely doing so without alarming her neighbors: </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.afji.com/2007/03/2545493">Singapore is one of the most interesting security actors in Asia. The city-state maintains astoundingly close strategic ties with Washington, purchasing much of its equipment from U.S. suppliers, including its F-16 Falcons, AH-64D Apache attack helicopters and CH-47SD Chinooks, which are all based in the U.S., where it trains in close cooperation with American forces.</a>
              </p><p>Simultaneously, Singapore’s government appreciates its geographic proximity to China and its other Southeast Asian neighbors and seeks to avoid being seen in the region as the tip of an American spear. The country has thus consistently sought to maintain a relationship with the U.S. that allows it to maximize the benefits of its relationship while minimizing what could be weighty costs.</p>
              <p>Singapore has likewise demonstrated its commitment to this strategy when it decided in 2005 to purchase a squadron of F-15 aircraft against France’s Rafale fighter, reaffirming the value of close ties with the U.S. Air Force in its acquisition and use of military aircraft.</p>
              <p>Sustained, strong ties with Canberra and other countries in the region also reinforce Singapore’s ability to benefit from growing interoperability among U.S. security partners in Asia, and the city-state bases a portion of its air force in Australia.</p>
              <p>This hedged relationship with Washington is reflected in Singapore’s tie to the JSF program, in which it is participating as an “international security partner.”</p>
              <p>In that role, Singapore has maintained representation at the JSF program office in the U.S. without having to make any financial commitment through the SDD phase of the program. When the JSF is released for sale through the foreign military sales program, Singapore will enjoy being at the front of the queue for purchases (along with Israel), whereas nonpartner countries will have to line up afterward.</p>
              <p>If the degree of Singapore’s participation in the JSF demonstrates how it seeks to use its hedged relationship with Washington to maintain as broad a set of strategic options as possible, South Korea presents an opposite trend, where Seoul is reluctant to commit to closer ties to Washington despite being a formal ally.</p>

              <p>These were the comments about the reasons for the various Asian countries decisions concerning the JSF programme.</p>

              <p>The facts of my written argument are based entirely on your own references given posted in your responses:</p>
              <p>FACT: MoUs are as good and Formal as Treaties are made to be.</p>
              <p>FACT: Singapore is an Ally to the USA - with or without Formal Declaration of Alliance - as seen by the number of strengthening Defense Ties from the MoUs and Agreements concluded.</p>
              <p>FACT: LKY claim Singapore is a First World Country.</p>
              <p>FACT: Obama did not call Singapore amongst the countries he sees as strong Allies.</p>

              <p>The way I see it, this is just a pointless discussion about political semantics. Whether SG has many "binding treaties" with the US is irrelevant because when the US is the dominant superpower since the end of WWII, it is only natural for SG to be "aligned" with the US despite all the politically correct professions of non-alignment to ensure that we still have some kind of credibility with our not-so-pro-American neighbours. Moreover, it is SG's alignment with the western bloc that allowed us to develop so rapidly given our dependence on trade.</p>
              <p>Arguing with hyperlinks to this treaty or that MoU is irrelevent. In the end, it is all semantics to whitewash the real state of affairs. An example. The Declaration of Human Rights, which SG and the US have signed, proclaims:</p>
              <p>"All human beings are <strong>born free and equal in dignity and rights</strong>."</p>
              <p>"Everyone is entitled in <strong>full equality to a fair and public hearing by
                  an independent and impartial tribunal</strong>, in the determination of his
                  rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him."</p>
              <p>"Everyone has the right to <strong>freedom of opinion and expression</strong>; this right
                  includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,
                  receive and impart information and ideas through any media and
                  regardless of frontiers."</p>
              <p>Do you think both of these so-called "rights" are observed in SG or the US? Do you think it matters among the international conspiracy, I mean, community? When the US declares a War on Terror (how do you defeat a tactic?), among its official allies are Pakistan (then) and Saudi Arabia. Ironically, those states couldnt be called a bastion of freedom and democracy in any way at all.  Yet, they are grouped together with the "free world" led by the US. Even though the US tortures, SG violates freedom of expression, does that matter in SG-US relations?</p>
              <p>So my point is this, for the sake of political correctness, international politics demands the need to frequently say black is white and white is black. During the balkanisation campaign, the US (NATO) called the bombing of Kosovo "humanitarian bombing". Can any intelligent and humane person say "<em>humanitarian bombing</em>" with a straight face?</p>
              <p>What is on paper doesn't matter. Like Atobe pointed out, why would SG allow US military forces use our territory? Even if we hated the US with the fervour of the Iraqis, the fact remains that we are horribly dependent on them, as the world's largest military, political and economic power (even though multipolarity is developing as we speak). In the same way, which country wouldnt SG, officially say, we're a good ally of, vice versa?</p>
              <p>On retrospection, SG needs to be a strong ally of all the countries we can do business with. How much clout do we actually have on the international stage without good international relations? Because we dont have the cash and <em>balls</em> of Hugo Chavez, SG has to go along with the dominant western bloc headed by the US.</p>
