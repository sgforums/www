              <p>When Obama is inundated with congratulatory messages from around the world, it is definite that he would be selective. In fact it would be the new team that selects for him. Who are in the new team?</p>

              Why should we even be bothered if Obama called us or not? with shits up to his ears everybody will be watching what would be his first move to solve the financial problem brought about by his stupid predecessor.
              
              If anybody should have reason to be offended just because Obama didn't call him, then Saudi has good reason to be pissed because Obama called Israel but not Saudi, or any of the other middle east countries; Spain, Italy should also be annoyed because Obama is not treating all EU countries the same; Russia should be angry with America and probably would attack Georgia again; Brasil should feel neglected because Obama only treats Mexico and Canada as neighbors and not the other South American countries; and obviously this give China much reasons to be hostile to America because america still see them no up.
              
              And to think that Japan is a country "with political system that is parallel to that of the USA" is simply ignorant.
              
              It is courteous of him to call on anybody, but if anybody should feel neglected just because Obama didn't call him, he is simply childish.

              <p><br>Yes, it can be simply courteous for Obama to call on '<em>anybody'</em>, but for him to call on those 9 leaders as his first "call of courtesy" is due to the values accorded to these leaders whom he see as worthy of his respect to respond to their congratulory messages made.</p>
              <p>I am surprised that you did not cite the congratulatory message from Iranian President Ahmadinejad - as an example amongst the other countries that you have mentioned.</p>
              <p>Seriously, if you believe that Brazil, Mexico, South American countries,  Saudi Arabia or any other Middle-eastern Countries as equal in stature to these 9 countries - you must be ignorant of the history and political values shared.</p>
              <p>Is the political system in Japan not an <em>electoral system</em> as in the USA - even though they may <em>differ in form</em> based on shared <em>OPEN</em> democratic principles ?</p>
              <p>Yes, it is childish only to interprete that it is neglect for Obama not to call, as it takes political awareness to discern between being politically ignored and simple neglect.</p>
              <p>Looks like you still have not learnt to watch where the wind blow before you spit.</p>

              I really cannot tahan why Obama didn't call Singapore first so I called him, guess what, he gave me 3 reasons why he didn't call us.
              
              1. He thought he got rid of the president of the US whose father was an ex president, but then he realises that the father of the prime minister of singapore is also an ex PM, and damn, the son is still in power.
              
              2. He thought he was the first black president in a country that is not predominantly black, but damn, Singapore had a black president, of Indian origin, way before him. He thought he made history, but only in the US, not the world.
              
              3. He doesn't like people who go round spitting, so he didn't call China and Singapore. Damn, this you are wrong, Mr. president elect, in Singapore only Atobe go round spitting.

              <p>Kudos for your story telling efforts, except that:</p>
              <p>1. Was Obama's call to serve - all about the Father and the Son, or was it about the <em>Ghost</em> that haunt the Economics affecting the Future for the USA ?</p>
              <p>2. Is<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/mar/01/usa.uselections2008"> Obama black enough </a>for the US African-American community to consider him to be a black - especially when his mother is White and his father an African.</p>
              <p>3. Spitting in Singapore ?</p>
