            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">'Retirement means death'</span><br>Urging seniors to stay active, MM Lee says research shows those who lead sedentary lives after retirement die quickly </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>January 12, 2008<br>Author: Clarissa Oon</span><br><br>THE three words 'retirement means death' reverberated around the Suntec Convention Centre theatre yesterday as Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew addressed the problem of an ageing society at a dialogue.<br><br>'We've got to educate those about to retire: Don't retire, work. Retirement means death,' said MM Lee with a laugh.<br><br>And he meant every word of what he said to participants at the Silver Industry Conference and Exhibition (Sicex).<br><br>'I would not be able to speak to you in this way if I had not led a very active life, connected with many people throughout the world and tried to interpret it to make sense for Singapore,' said the elder statesman, who turns 85 this year.<br><br>Like many developed and fast developing countries around the world, Singapore has an ageing population due to longer lifespans and declining birth rates.<br><br>'Maybe if we had not started family planning, it would not have been so bad. But then we would not have (economic) growth,' quipped Mr Lee to much laughter from conference participants.<br><br>Earlier in the 70-minute dialogue, which revealed a light-hearted and more personal side of the MM, he said that Singaporeans who believed they could stop work at 55 to drink wine and play golf were 'done for'.<br><br>'If the mindset is that 'I'll reach retirement age at 62, I'm old, I can't work anymore, now is the time I enjoy life,' I think you're making the biggest mistake of your life.'<br><br>Research has shown that those who retire and lead sedentary lives 'die off very quickly', said the man who started jogging regularly in his 50s and now also keeps fit by swimming and cycling.<br><br>'With nothing to do, no purpose in life, you'll just degrade, go to seed. The human being needs a challenge.'<br><br>He maintains a packed schedule of international travel, including official trips every year to regional powerhouses China and India.<br><br>MM Lee was sharing his experiences of active ageing with Sicex participants.<br><br>The four-day conference, which ends tomorrow, explores ways to grow the seniors' market in Singapore and the region.<br><br>Asked by Dr Kanwaljit Soin, who runs a non-profit organisation for older women to age successfully, if Singapore could do away with its retirement age of 62, Mr Lee said he personally did not believe in such a concept.<br><br>However, he said it was very difficult to deviate from international practice.<br><br>He suggested that a senior citizen 'go on working for as long as he can, but changing the nature or the intensity of the work as he ages'.<br><br>Mr Lee also defended Singapore's Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme and argued against pensions for the elderly, which have to be supported by tax revenues.<br><br>The CPF scheme, he said, helps Singapore to remain competitive, saying it aims for 'minimum tax rates and maximum self-sufficiency'.<br><br>'This way you are not passing the burden (of caring for the elderly) to the next generation,' he added.<br><br>clare@sph.com.sg<br><br><strong>A PURPOSE IN LIFE </strong><br>'With nothing to do, no purpose in life, you'll just degrade, go to seed. The human being needs a challenge.'<br>MINISTER MENTOR LEE KUAN YEW<br><br><strong>STAY ACTIVE </strong><br>'We should die actively, meaning we should be active till death. I think we have to be active, eat healthy food, exercise and socialise. My research shows that talking to each other, watching television and housework can help prevent declining memory.'<br>DR TRI BUDI RAHARDJO, 61, a member of the National Commission for Older Persons in Jakarta<br><br><strong>RETIREMENT NO MORE </strong><br>'I don't think the idea of retirement will survive the 21st century. The concept of a retirement age is new and appeared in the 20th century primarily when the British introduced pensions... You simply can't fund people for so long if they retire at 65.<br><br>More than the funding issue, people must remain active. You have to use all your faculties. Use them or lose them.'<br>MR ARUN ABEY, 49, Australia-based head of strategy at AXA Asia-Pacific Holdings, and a speaker at the Silver Industry Conference and Exhibition<br><br><strong>START A SECOND CAREER </strong><br>'I probably would not say it the way MM Lee has - ?Retirement means death' - but I do believe a person must have a purpose and life must have a meaning. When a man retires, he must have a second career, or do something and treat it like a second career.'<br>DR LEE CHONG KAU, 67, director of the Institute of Elders<br><br><strong>PROLONGING DEATH? </strong><br>'I like the part: ?Retirement means death'. Are we prolonging death or prolonging life? I think, too often, many of us are prolonging death.'<br>MS LIM SIA HOE, 47, NTUC Eldercare senior manager</div>

But for the Borg Queen the concepts "I" and "we" are interchangeable. In her own words, she is the "one who is many."</div>
