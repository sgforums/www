He was in Jakarta yesterday to visit the critically-ill Mr Suharto.<br><br>Speaking to the media after he left the hospital, Mr Lee said Mr Suharto is not getting the recognition he deserves.<br><br>Adding that he came to pay tribute, he said: "I feel sad to see a very old friend with whom I had worked closely over the last 30 years not really getting the honours that he deserves. He deserves recognition for what he did. And the younger generations Â— both in Indonesia and in the world Â— do not remember where Indonesia started. I do.<br><br>"He gave Indonesia progress and development. He educated the population. He built roads and infrastructure. And from Sukarno's konfrontasi and other foreign policy excesses, he stabilised international relations, cooperated in Asean and made Asean more successful than SARC in South Asia. And today, we have a stable South-east Asia.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">"Yes, there was corruption. Yes, he gave favours to his family and his friends. But there was real growth and real progress. I think the people of Indonesia are lucky.</span></strong> They had a general in charge, had a team of competent administrators Â— including a very good team of economists to build up the country."<br><br>Mr Lee went on to put the developments in perspective.<br><br>"From '67 when he became President right up to '97, the economy grew and Indonesia was on the point of taking off. It didn't take off not because of his fault but because Bank Indonesia's interest rate was too high."<br><br>Mr Suharto's condition worsened yesterday, two days after he suffered multiple organ failure, doctors said. Â— AGENCIES<br><br><span style="color: red;">He couldn't think less of that of himself, so in his view, corruption is OK, as long as there's progress overall, even if majority of it goes to the elites.</span></div>

He was in Jakarta yesterday to visit the critically-ill Mr Suharto.<br><br>Speaking to the media after he left the hospital, Mr Lee said Mr Suharto is not getting the recognition he deserves.<br><br>Adding that he came to pay tribute, he said: "I feel sad to see a very old friend with whom I had worked closely over the last 30 years not really getting the honours that he deserves. He deserves recognition for what he did. And the younger generations Â— both in Indonesia and in the world Â— do not remember where Indonesia started. I do.<br><br>"He gave Indonesia progress and development. He educated the population. He built roads and infrastructure. And from Sukarno's konfrontasi and other foreign policy excesses, he stabilised international relations, cooperated in Asean and made Asean more successful than SARC in South Asia. And today, we have a stable South-east Asia.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">"Yes, there was corruption. Yes, he gave favours to his family and his friends. But there was real growth and real progress. I think the people of Indonesia are lucky.</span></strong> They had a general in charge, had a team of competent administrators Â— including a very good team of economists to build up the country."<br><br>Mr Lee went on to put the developments in perspective.<br><br>"From '67 when he became President right up to '97, the economy grew and Indonesia was on the point of taking off. It didn't take off not because of his fault but because Bank Indonesia's interest rate was too high."<br><br>Mr Suharto's condition worsened yesterday, two days after he suffered multiple organ failure, doctors said. Â— AGENCIES<br><br><span style="color: red;">He couldn't think less of that of himself, so in his view, corruption is OK, as long as there's progress overall, even if majority of it goes to the elites.</span>[/b]</blockquote>of course suharto dun deserve the respect... he made indonesia to become so poor... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
