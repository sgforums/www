I have followed federal and state elections there. Every constituency (single seats) had up to 8 candidates. It's a bit hard with GRCs back home, but there should be more battles for SMCs if we try out such a system. One thing to note, I noticed each constituency had at least one independent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's sad that under the "great" ruling of our MIW, we can only able to express ourselves truthfully (hopefully) behind a nick, in this forum. It's a sarcasm, you know it and I know.<br><br>We all know how our MIW works but all we can do is talk (whispering, somemore) behind their back. What set me thinking (if I still can think rationally) is what has the MIW empire did in resulting the way we think today. Are we born Kiasu? Are we born selfish? Are we born arrogant? These are some of the impressions that foreigners had on us but do we really want to be like that? For me, that's a definate No-No and I try not to be one. What I can say is our MIW has done a great job in doing that. That's why we are only capable of grumbling under breath. Young generations like us are getting less bold when counteracting the MIW policies. We choose to use verbal power over real action. All I can say, those ah peks in Cow Car Water are more garang than us. Sometimes, we cannot blame us in the way we are. We are brought up in the way we are now and the MIW wants us to be in this way, so that we are more controllable. And I believe our next generation will be even worse. Maybe a yes-man to whatever they say.<br><br>I know maybe I would not get a chance to vote in this lifetime (always walkover) but if I really got the chance to vote, my vote will go to the other side, whoever they are.<br><br>Maybe, in the future, the whole island will be a big GRC. All you have to do is mark your X in the big MIW rectangular box (right in the middle, occupying 3/4 of the ballot sheet) or the small miserable other side's box (at the corner, bound to miss it if you don't look carefully). And they say balloting is sacred and secrecy, then why is there serial no. on the ballot sheets? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
