In fact, Aljunied GRC today comprises elements of the old Eunos and Cheng San GRCs. The WP team chose to stand for elections in Aljunied in 2001 and were disqualified under suspicious circumstances. Very likely the MIW realised they could lose this ward and came up with some desperate move to ensure a walkover there.</div>

As hypocritical and non-democratic those PAP-heads are, I certainly do not want a psuedo-loanshark clown like CSJ becoming Prime Minister.<br><br>This post doesn't contradict what I really think about those PAP-heads. Yes, they trample on democracy and show the finger in the face of freedom. However, just because they do so it doesn't mean that we can anyhow spite them and put power in the hands of clowns who can't even spend five minutes on national television without embarassing themselves.<br><br>Even if the PAP-heads become fully democratic and allow absolutely free elections I'll still vote for them if the opposition stinks big time. If and when the opposition can convince me that they can do a better job (CST is one such person.... but he's too old and he's only one person), my vote goes to them.<br><br>If I have to choose between two evils, then I'll have to choose the lesser one..... even if it means keeping the PAP-heads in power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are forgetting one thing: The chances of the opposition gaining enough seats in parliament to win the election is next to zero. Therefore, by voting opposition, you are not removing PAP from power. What it does is to erode PAP's dominance and to make it easier to get rid of them when the time comes.<br><br>And i think too little credit has been afforded to Mr. Chee here. No doubt one of the reasons for this is his lack of PR skills and personality. However, i have no doubt that it is also due to the media having influenced perceptions of him. I have read some of this articles b4 and he certainly doesn't write like a clown.</div>
