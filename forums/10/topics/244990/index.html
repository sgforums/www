In Asia, Japan is the one with the most developed forex market.<br><br>low class factory jobs has no value, if they had value those factory workers will be paid a nice fat salary.

Between manufacturing and services, services always generates more cash. Plus, what is the point of a low-end manufacturing job if it doesn't bring enough food to the table? Moreover, these days, the only factories we are getting are the high end variety which means smaller labour pool.<br><br>If there is something that I don't quite get, is why there are certain industries that are getting a lack of labour. Is it because they don't advertise themselves? (Singaporean companies seem to have very very bad advertising.) Or is because the Govt has done its extolling of select industries that no one even knows they exist?<br><br>And our so called "lousy neighbours" are slowly catching up, or has everyone forgotten PTP?<br><br>As for our financial centre, our stock market value pales in comparison to any of the top end stock markets. We still have a lot to go to catch up on Hong Kong in terms of sophistication of the market itself. Other than that... well, we will definitely trail behind London and NY when it comes to financial centres.</div>

Basically, the citizens are happy. Why? Because the you can spend the money you earn this month without worries. Why you can spend it without worries? Because you know there are food on the table for the next few decade, your children's education is looked after and when you are sick (and you will be), your healthcare is taken care of.<br><br>The wage increase you mentioned. There must be an increment in standard of living. NOT just the money you earn!! Assume that you earned $1000 a few years ago and a loaf of bread costed $1 then, now you earn $1300 and the same loaf of bread by the same manufacturer cost $1.30 (maybe even more) now. Can it be considered as wage increment?</div>
