The scheme aims to peg long-term vehicle population growth at 3 per cent a year.   The government wants the people to take public transport in order to control our car population. U want our roads to be like Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Bangkok with Traffic jams everywhere? Not so rich dun drive a car la.. the pubilc transport is good enough although not the best.<br><br>HDB expensive?

Are we living in fear? No lei.. we live in considerable safety. Suppression and Oppression only applies in North Korea. THe North Koreans are really repressed.<br><br>As i had said, our country do not have any natural resources, if they ban oil supplies to us, we also will pay over the top prices to get oil. This is expected, dont bitch about it. You think our country produces sand? If PAP released the sand and let the prices fall down. in the end when the govt stockpile finishes. the sand prices will rise too. The stockpile i believe is for govt projects in building infastructure.<br><br>Got me? I dun think so..<br><br>Rational arguments prevail.<br><br></div>
