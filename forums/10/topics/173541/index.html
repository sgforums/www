            <div class='col-md body'>In this frighteningly unpredictable world. - SGporeans have to stand up for moral authority-<br>(For the sake of our future, our children, for humanity.)<br>.<br>WhatÂ’s to be done?<br>.<br>1)	Feedback to PAP (tell your MP) that the elections commission has corrupted the true principle of GRCs to favour solely the PAP during elections. Originally intended to guarantee ~25% minority representation in Parliament (through groupings of 4 constituencies inclusive of at least one minority race member); GRC groupings have in recent elections been inflated to become groupings of 6 constituencies (in effect diluting minority representation). This Â‘corruptedÂ’ GRC practice, coupled with the late and unpredictable allocation of electoral boundaries- totally confuses the voting public as well as the non-PAP candidates. Sadly- these high stakes groupings have achieved their intended purpose- to make contest most unpalatable to opposition parties- as such unnecessarily increased stakes easily out prices any opposition party in SG. (Most opposition partite have neither the finances nor sufficient representation to confidently contest in a 6candidate GRC). People vote the PAP because they notice the Minister representing/ are promised Â‘upgradingÂ’ for voting the PAP by a good margin.<br>-	In short- PAP has manipulated the election rules to favour itself during elections- and this cannot be a good thing for the long term welfare of SGporeans.<br>-	My suggestion would be for there to exist 15 GRCs of 4 candidates each (15 x 4) =60candidates, and 24 SSCs= 24 candidates to maintain the current 84 seat parliament.<br>.<br>2)	ItÂ’s an embarrassment knowing that some SGporeans could have voted the PAP during the last election for personal gain- that of having their estates upgraded.<br>-	This PAP ploy to link selection of estate upgrading to support for PAP during elections is certainly misguided.<br>-	National funds should be disbursed equally amongst ALL Singaporeans since ALL Singaporeans contribute to national tax. So govt expenditure should benefit ALL SGporeans equally- (no matter what their political association might be).<br>-	National funds are sacred- and thus shouldnÂ’t be manipulated for the benefit of any particular political party.<br>-	No one should be penalized by the ruling government based upon their choice of representative- as elections should be free and fair.<br>-	Lack of benefit in any manner (e.g. estate upgrading) should be replaced by an equivalent benefit (e.g. improved infrastructure, utility rebates etc). Total deprivation of benefit suggests discrimination and prejudiceÂ—a bad thing for national unity. (Parliament should abide by the rules of morality)<br>-	If estate upgrading were the reason for PAP to gather &gt;75% of votes, then I have lost faith in &gt;75% of my fellow SGporeans who had fallen for this rotten carrotÂ…<br>-	The worst thing is the emulation by ordinary SGporeans- who are led to think thatÂ… if IÂ’m in-chargeÂ… then I can change the rules; Â…  TT Durai was one of those- the way he governed NKF funds.- (http://happycitizen.blogspot.com/2005/12/only-10-cents-per-dollar-donated-goes.html)<br>-	(IÂ’m ashamed of SGporeans who have displayed moral neglect in their quest for personal gain.)<br>.<br>3)	The excessive emphasis upon estate upgrading might have also made SGporeans more materialistic.<br>-	Money cannot become the meaning of oneÂ’s life- and its over-emphasis will only compromise other aspects of our lives- any wonder the dwindling birth rate or the high divorce rate?<br>.<br><br>So I ask myself:<br>Are SGporeans happy?<br>The future looks glum:<br>SGporean has he worldÂ’s 3rd lowest birth rate (out of 226 countries) @ 1.05 /woman lifetime (http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html), this means that unless Â‘PRÂ’s are conscripted, our army enlistment will shrink by at least Â½ the next generation- then who would be responsible for our national sovereignty.<br>- [Could this figure be worse as Â‘1.05Â’ might be the average/ living woman- my grandma had &gt;10kids - and being alive, her Â‘productivityÂ’ could be included as part of that statistic too! Â…]<br>-	Till today- the reason for the Â‘unproductivityÂ’ of SG women still mystifies me, is love lacking in SG? Or are SGporeans unhappyÂ…<br>.<br>An increased rich poor divide can only mean ill for SG- poverty is linked to poor self esteem, depression/ suicides. Poverty- left unchecked- cannot be good for the morale of the community and service standards will surely fall as people get distracted by social problems. http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/poverty.html<br>Muggings, social disturbances etc- will make SGpore unfavorable place for tourism or investment - and we would slide down a slippery slope towards national poverty- foreign talents will quickly leave- leaving us marooned upon our little island.<br>.<br>And poverty isnÂ’t a small issue- itÂ’s a social cancer that erodes the fabric of society- the poor tend to feel neglected and unwanted- as such- they are easily manipulated by money/ promises of radical terroristÂ…<br>.<br>I regret to disclose the following possibility- but I really feel that sth has to be done about national security; and the more SGporeans are aware about terrorism- the more willing they are to prevent such a possibilityÂ…<br>.<br>You see a stray bagÂ… will you tell? You see a ubiquitous lump of paperÂ… mmmÂ…<br>.<br>Imagine a Â‘misguided poorÂ’ individual with hand grenadesÂ… pulls just the pin, wraps the whole thing in A4 paper- leaves it in a public place then walks awayÂ… the unsuspecting will pick it up/ kick it aroundÂ…<br>The possibilities are terrifyingÂ…<br>$5/handgrenade fr Cambodia- Â…&amp; heÂ’s been paid $$$ to do the jobÂ… you now cannot speak your thoughts. Â–weapons=  http://www.oxfamgb.org/eastasia/cambodia/camhandgrenade.html<br>.<br>.<br>Has technology has overtaken humanity?<br>.<br>There are better things to do then Â‘estate upgradingÂ’, motivating the poor to live righteously is one optionÂ…<br>.<br>Resolve povertyÂ… prevent disharmony.<br>.<br>Our futureÂ… is decided by the wisdom with which you cast your vote<br>.<br>The elections will decide.<br>.<br>.<br>Thoughts of a Singaporean.<br>.<br><br>(a/m are my thoughts/ readingsÂ… I stand eager to be corrected should omissions exist)<br><br></div>
