            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn9/soueasia/winsemiu.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn9/soueasia/winsemiu.html</a><br><br><strong>1959</strong><br>Singapore, the former British colony had become independent,<br>PAP government of the young nation had asked the United Nations to invite Dr Winsemius, the founding father of the Dutch post-war industrialization programme, to help them to find out which chances the future would offer to Singapore.<br><br><strong>1960</strong><br>Dr Albert Winsemius arrived in Singapore . He headed an international team of experts in the field of development economics.<br><br>Dr Winsemius' first impression was anything but hopeful. "It was bewildering," he remembers. "There were strikes about nothing. There were communist-inspired riots almost every day and everywhere.<br><br><strong>13 June 1961</strong><br>the Winsemius team offered Singapore a development plan. The final assessment was written by Winsemius personally: 'Expectations and Reality' was his motto.<br><br>"Singapore has the basic assets for industrialization. Her greatest asset is the high aptitude of her people to work in manufacturing industries. They can be ranked among the best factory workers in the world."<br><br><strong>Summer of 1961</strong><br>Winsemius became the chief economic adviser to the Singaporean government. He held this function for almost twenty- five years, and at no time was there ever any written contract.<br>The collaboration was based on mutual trust.<br><br>Twice a year Winsemius flew to Singapore to spend about a fortnight there - one time it was to help drafting the plans for the coming year, the other time for checking and steering. Part of the deal was that he would come immediately should the government let him know that his help was needed at short notice, which was, for instance, the case in 1965.<br><br>"When we started with the implementation of the first development programme, Winsemius recalls, "I was convinced that a policy of protection of the home market would come to nothing, because there was almost no home market. I immediately advised them to try and form an economic federation with Malaya. As soon as this aim was achieved, I assumed, we would be able to move over to the next phase and try to conquer a position on the world market.<br><br>Four years later Singapore was expelled from the Federation, and there were the signs of some initial panic in the state. In my opinion there was no longer any reason for such a reaction. On the contrary, this is the best day of my life, I told my friends in Singapore, for in those first years of development Singapore had proved that it was able to overcome internal antithesis and to work together to build up a manufacturing industry that would certainly be competitive in the long run."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Albert Winsemius distinguishes five main phases in the economic development of Singapore.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span class="large">The first step</span></strong><br>To set up low-value industries, such as the production of shirts and pyjamas in factories in which women could work. "<br><br><strong><span class="large">The Second step</span></strong><br>The Separation in 1965 marked the beginning of the second phase.<br>The Housing and Development Board (HDB) started with an enormous building programme, under the leadership of Mr. Howe Yoon Chong.<br><br><strong><span class="large">The third phase</span> </strong><br>Singapore became very active in promoting education for technical jobs, especially for the electronics industry.<br><br>In the beginning it was quite a difficult job for me to convince people at the top of the big Dutch electronics company Philips to set up production plants in Singapore. I went to Eindhoven, where the headquarters of Philips are situated, to warn them: you have to hurry, I told them, otherwise there is a very real danger you will be too late and then you will be sure to miss the boat in the growing market of Southeast Asia. The result is that Philips is now one of the big investors in Singapore and is doing a very fine job there.<br><br><strong><span class="large">The fourth phase </span></strong><br>It was to make of Singapore an international financial centre.<br><br>Formerly the young state was bound to the English pound sterling. I knew a Dutchman who had lived and worked in Singapore; he was an employee of the Bank of America in London at that time. I visited him and told him we wished to transform Singapore into a financial centre for Southeast Asia within ten years. He told me it could be done in three or four years. He took a globe and showed me a gap in the financial market of the world. Trading, he explained, starts at nine o'clock in the morning in Zurich in Switzerland. An hour later London opens. When London closes, New York is already open. After closing time on Wall Street, San Francisco on the American west coast is still active. But as soon as San Francisco closes, there is a gap of a couple of hours. This gap can be filled by Singapore, should the government not shun taking some drastic measures - such as cutting its links with the British pound.<br><br><strong><span class="large">Fifth and last phase</span></strong><br>It was that we transformed Singapore into a centre of international traffic and transport.<br><br>My advice was: build an airport where the biggest aeroplanes can land and let everyone know that they are welcome to land there. In other words, do not use landing-rights to protect your own Singapore Airlines. They followed this advice and it became a success. And thanks to this initiative Singapore has become a tourist centre too, especially for short stays. In the same vein, we started to construct a big container harbour. In Holland I had been chairman of a committee to advise the Dutch government on the problems to do with shipbuilding, so I had some knowledge about what was going on in that world. I saw the enormous growth of container transport between the United States and Europe, concentrated initially in the harbour of Rotterdam. So I advised the construction of a big container terminal in the harbour of Singapore, taking the risk of overcapacity and unoccupancy during the first years for granted. The advantage was evident: Singapore would be the only harbour in the region with container facilities. Nevertheless it was a hard job to convince the harbour authorities. Only after a small conversation with the minister the decision could no longer be postponed. Nowadays Singapore, after Rotterdam, has the second largest container harbour in the world. That surely is something of which to be proud."<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Winsemius" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Winsemius</a><br></div>
