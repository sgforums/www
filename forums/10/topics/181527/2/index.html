Patients are free to ask for a prescription from the polyclinics if they think they can get medication more cheaply from Guardian pharmacy and the like. I do not think polyclinics are a money-making venture but I do agree that polyclinic managers are pressured to remain in the black despite the fact they are serving the poorer sector of the population.<br><br>The biggest chunk of overheads in polyclinics is manpower. To cut polyclinic prices, guess we'll have to bring in more foreign doctors and nurses instead of employing locals then.</div>

For example, beta-blockers are often prescribed for hypertension and they are good for some patients. But if a patient who also has asthma can just purchase it from the pharmacist based on a recommendation by a friend who has hypertension, he could die from an asthmatic attack. Another reason is to prevent drug resistance from improper use, particularly relating to antibiotics. Some dugs such as retinoic acid analogues are very effective for acne, which some might consider a minor ailment. But the drug can cause horrendous deformities in babies if the patient happens to get pregnant.<br><br>'Non-potent' medication such as lozenges, antiseptic cream and the like are already available over the counter.</div>

The lower labour and rental costs translate into lower manufacturing and retail costs. Also, drug companies are willing to lower their prices for certain countries because the population is poorer and they would not be able to afford the higher prices charged in first world countries like Singapore. That is why there are strict contracts preventing parallel imports of many drugs.<br><br>For certain drugs, eg. anti-retrovirals for HIV, Thailand has imposed compulsory local licensing regulations that allow their local drug companies to ignore patents and manufacture these drugs for local consumption.

The problem is that the pharmaceutical industry is willing to do a special deal with the public sector because otherwise they will not be able to get their drugs into the market in the first place. So they sell their drugs at a lower price to MOH, earn less from public hospitals and get their profits from the private sector. With public-private joint tender, the drug companies will not give MOH such a good deal. In the end, patients in public hospitals will lose out</div>
