Cheap labour is the word or maybe slave. we can choose whether to sign on or not but we cannot choose not to serve NS getting that pathetic "pittance". In the end wat do we have? we have fat rich arrogant SAF officer who think they are king and can step down on us cheapskate NSF.<br><br>To AndrewTay :<br>Fuck you. using the word i learned from SAF.<br><br>Think SAF is the place where you get to learn vulgar language quick.</div>

WHY??<br><br>FOR PAY?? no..... He sacrificed so much... so that you and many other singaporeans can build their dream homes, own their dream cars, fell in love with their sweetheart and live a peaceful life...<br><br>so what if u treat him to a movie?? its only 7 dollars, 10 at the most... think about the sacrifice he made for you so that you can eat, sleep and dream in peace.<br><br>recognise your guy for what he truely is. A hero, A warrior, A defender, He suffered in camp to ensure your safety, security, peace and happiness.<br><br>He may be a chow recruit, he may be an officer, but it makes no difference, as long as he dons the uniform.... anytime... he may not come back alive... do not let the peace around you trick you into believing otherwise... cherish the moments you have with him and pray that our SAF continues to deter the enemy and keeps your guy coming home safe... else remember this guy of yours for what he is doing for u... though he may not look like arnold or rambo. but he still bravely stand his ground and shield you from the harsh reality of war.</div>
