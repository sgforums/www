Lee and Goh family have an interval on age gap.... so its perfertly fine fitting into the slot.... So in then end every happy and gets a turn... problem solved.</div></blockquote>Haha,what u expect is Lou Lee would actually "share" his power with Lou Goh,if Lou Goh really wish that,then i must say that he is rather "navie"!!!Do u know Lou Lee takes how long to build up his empire?Who the hell is Lou Goh,he is just an "outsider" only want to share power with Lou Lee?Dream on man!!!<br>And besides,Lou Goh also mock at Lou Lee saying that when he first become PM,Lou Lee actually shift his working place to Lou Goh's office to "monitor" him during the national day rally speech.Lou Lee's face was damn dark on that day!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Lou Goh also toying around young Lee by appointed him to be his successor then later say must bring in all PAP members to vote who is the new PM,young Lee must be piss off by his "untruthful" character.This Lou Goh simply cant be trusted man!!!</div>
