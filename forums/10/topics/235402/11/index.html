            <div class='col-md body'>If leaders are holding themselves high as capable leaders who could sway the whole world with influence, like the way they conduct themselves to the citizens e.g. arrogance, self-confidence about their leadership abilities and talents and not willing to be subjected to good corporate governance or accountability processes, then our foreign relation will also suffer the same problem.<br><br>Being Leaders of a small country called the red dot by Habibi they must learn to conduct such foreign relation with a certain extra finesse which will win respect not only from its own people but from all other leaders and people.<br><br>They have been having past difficulties with leaders of other countries before and by now should have learned their lesson from the past.<br><br>For example, do not adopt the attitude that they are never wrong in their judgmens or dealings with people or others like has been happening in dealing with the Souzhou local authority over its sale of local industrial lands. If our leaders have been more tactful and not resort to showdown and threats will we have sufferred the setback.<br><br>In past dealing with Mahathir over the water issue - do our leaders always have to publicised how right they are ? Do they really understand foreign relations.<br><br>If we keep wanting to show we are better or superior than the other countries in the neighbouring region, will it create better foreign relation.<br><br>If we keep trying to tell people we are providing them with aids will we really go down well with their people.<br><br>As advised to the government Feedback Unit previously, being small and vulnerable we must not conduct ourselves based on haughty arrogance that we are more advanced or superior.<br><br>We must conduct genuine people-to-people good relation with actions rather than a great deal of words and broadcasting about our taking over other people's national assets.<br><br>So it is time for our foreign ministry to really come up with a more strategic foreign relation master plan and implement it with practical sensibility.<br><br>No need to show or broadcast about how good is our leaders' abilities to the people.<br><br>Prove the abilities with actions and results.</div>

The 9-month long<br>branding process included the following steps:<br>a) researching into strategies used by competing cities;<br>b) interviews with stakeholders, real estate developers, potential investors and tenants both locally and internationally to obtain feedback on a competitive positioning for Marina Bay.

Tis in a sense is good because they r asking for public opinion since the public is surveyed. Otherwise how r u going to get public opinion ?<br><br><a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/POS.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/POS.pdf</a><br><br><blockquote> $200,000 --- what LTA spent in 2005 to "save a matured Angsana tree"<br>located right in the middle of a road (outside Raffles Junior College) ---<br>resulting in several traffic near-accidents!<br>Which is more important --- saving human lives or saving a tree??? </blockquote>Tis is a tricky question.

If u want policies for the short run, it is very simple. Spend a lot of money, reduce tax, chase away all investors, suffer budget deficit and people r happy for a short time. If u talk about long term policy, then we have to tax money, balance budget, solve problems they expect to see 10 years time and woo investors. People r not happy now. But then it is better than facing the problem and solving as we go and not blind to it and truly face worse hardship in future. Times r hard. Almost all developed cities r facing hardship and competition in one way or another. Most of your posts r just complains without offering a solution. Most of your posts also never consider the global trend in the world.<br><br><blockquote>Firstly - when you talk about the serving the country etc.. like a Minister, do you really take into account 80% of what you are gonna be paid for? becasue that seems to be what you are implying right there? </blockquote>As said, if u offer more money, u get more people as candidates and there can be more selection. There r enthusiastic people who r capable and willing to get a drastic pay cut, but then r they the best in performance and do we have enough of such people before the standard dropped drastically ? Tat is why I ask the normal people first if they r willing to get an 80% pay cut simply because they want to serve the country.

In other words, you mean managing a company is the same as managing a country?? </blockquote>Wat is wrong ? The important skills r dscision making, judgement, management, foresight which r common to both CEO and minister. Which jobs has a closer job scope compared with minister ? Cook, clerk, driver ?<br><br><blockquote>Thirdly, The system works to better turn around the economy, for whom actually does the system work for? Hmm..let me see.. a CEO of a company is being elected as a Minister..no guessing what system he implements works better for.. </blockquote>A minister have to be a full time minister.

Tis is especially true since some of the subsidies for PR had reduced compared with citizen.<br><br>Another question tat need to be asked is in tis global world should we close up and face companies moving out of singapore ? Frankly u r right in asking if foreigners r snatching jobs and lowering income. But then tis is a global phenomenon and US, Britian and any open developed country r facing. Do u think closing up our economy will help the situation in the long run ?<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, in times of high unemployment (when citizens can't find employment), the government should restrict the conversion of PR to citizens.<br><br>Whatever the government does, companies are still moving out.

By the way, my friend lives in a 3-room HDB, cost of his flat is around $200,000. The cost of having an extra storeroom is half of his flat cost. </blockquote>U need to see the figure properly. 10,000 is 5% of 200,000. I don't see it surprising to cost 100,000 for the storeroom and properly lift tat stop at every floor and changes to the environment etc. But he can sell the flat back at a higher price now isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Without the cost of the land? It would be cheap. Doesn't make sense that polyclinic which is owned by the government pay the government for the land. It's like paying from you left pocket and putting in your right pocket. </blockquote>I think it is fair because if I am the decision maker for building the poly, I will build less taller building (higher building, higher building cost) and use up more land if land is free for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>HDB could easily have continued with what its previous minister Mr. Lim Kim San has done - selling or developing the lands for low-cost housing by recovering the costs of development and construction. To be fair to citizens, allocation has been on needs and first come first served basis and no citizens have cried foul of such an allocation of low-cost housing. Where is the distortion of our national resource if it is to provide low cost housing to serve the people and tie them to loyalty for the country and be finally build a prosperous country with more property taxes to collect etc. What could be wrong with the original objective and practice of low-cost housing as introduced by Lim Kim San which Mah Bow Tan the ministers for revenues changed probably to secure his own position. </blockquote>Tat is wrong since the housing of isolated places still cost lesser than places tat r central. If u talk about 20 years ago, there r still more land 20 years ago and singapore do not face such intense competition from other countries then.<br><br><blockquote>Yes my reference to our taxing-and-recovering system of government is to show you that government has under such a system no need to profit from low cost housing as it has all the alternative means of replenishing its governing revenues from all these other profiteering methodologies like corporatising essential medicare and utility and public transport services into profit generating devices so where is there a justification to use HDB to make windfall profits except to serve its own nkf -type of reserve and golden tap purposes perhaps. </blockquote>As said, if u want free housing, gov made a big loss here and u have to pay much much more for the medical and other areas. And it will not be a fair way to tax since it rewards people for wasting land and having good location while punishing people with lousy small land at lousy locations. Aren't u taxing the poor and landless but give to the rich and people with more land here ? U want the rich and poor divide to be greater ?<br><br><blockquote>When the government has clung on to a tax-and-recover system of government to avoid welfare, it should have taken care to avoid over-charging as when you wants to avoid welfare, people will need to work on their own efforts to survive and should not be deprived of their fruits of labor. So the system of tax-and-recover government to avoid welfarism has gone to the other wrongful extreme. Leaders who have talents or abilities who are paid muli-millions should have such ability to understand such pitfall.<br><br>So, my reference to the government's tax-and-recover system is not irrelevant but highly relevant to the point under discussion namely should citizens pay market prices for their low-cost housing when lands were already paid for by them through taxes. </blockquote>I feel your writing is very "flowery" and sometime lack concisesiveness. If u allow me to summarise, u simply means the citizens r tax for the resources they use and should not be taxed more for the land. If wat I interprete is right, I have to say housing is using up resources and thus have to pay tax for it. Land is in fact the most limiting resources singapore has. Why should it be free and make tax unfair tat increase rich and poor divide ?<br><br>U need to know tat your other tax r used to pay for many services like police or army or teachers or prison etc. So far I see tat u r avoiding the issue where these services need a large chunk of money to function properly. If your question is since tax is pay through other measures, why pay more tax for land for your housing. My answer is those other tax u pay r used to pay for policing and defense and teachers etc. Do u pay a army tax or a police tax or a fireman tax ? No right ? These services r paid from your other tax like income tax or corporate tax and land tax.<br><br><blockquote>Profiteering by HDB against the citizens is well proven as a major policy error as elaborated in the foregoing and up to now minister Mah was still keeping mum and unable to explain why he claimed that HDB is subsidizing the low-cost housing. He also could not answer why if HDB must charge its flat at market price, making adjustments for location etc, it is subsidizing the flats. </blockquote>I think he have said land is not free before but it is never accepted.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> They also elaborate why land has a cost and it again is never accepted.

Please feel free to compare if comparison will be for the best and betterment of all citizens and not to suit the arguments of government's stubborn narrow-minded policy of taxing and recovering all possible costs to enrich its own surpluses and claim success.</blockquote>Can u give me an evidence tat I am comparing with the worse off countries ? I am comparing with the rest of the world, including better off countries. I have stated many times tat there is a global phenomenon and all countries faces the problem.

How will closing our doors to foreign investors improve employment for our citizens? The main reason for unemployment in Singapore is not the shortage of jobs but a mismatch between jobs and skills, between remuneration and expectations.<br><br>At the top, there are highly skilled jobs in the biomedical, financial and precision engineering industries and that unemployed Singaporeans cannot handle. At the lower end, there are low-skilled jobs in the cleaning industry that Singaporeans refuse to do. Then there are decent paying jobs in wafer fabs but Singaporeans are not interested in them because of the need to work shifts and wear protective clothing, which they find restrictive.<br><br>Without foreign workers to fill these jobs, investors will move their businesses elsewhere, causing more Singaporeans to lose their jobs. The loss of tax revenue will also mean there will be less money available to assist the poor.<br><br>However, I do agree that low skilled jobs in the IRs should primarily go to Singaporeans as much as possible. As I have often said, the casinos are the only employers able to pay more for low-skilled jobs and we should reserve these for those Singaporeans who for some reason cannot be retrained for a higher-skilled vocation.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by maurizio13:</div><div class="quote_body">Land is free to the government. </div></blockquote> In your dreams, maybe. Go read the newspaper about land acquisition and compensation at market prices. It is true that LTA could acquire land cheaply in the 1970s based on land usage when all there is on the land is an attap house and a papaya tree. That is not possible today and in fact, the government now will pay compensation based on more than just current land usage but future potential as well.<br><br>As for your points about utilities costs, as SIS mentioned, China relies heavily on coal and they have the largest reserve of coal in the world.

If the leaders are not listening and always seeking to blame the people for the slightest failures of their duties, how can the people be made to listen.<br><br>So it appears that the system has produced the serious problem where the high costs are not only affecting the lower income families but also large number of middle income families so much so that government is being forced to rethink its many past policies.<br><br>Yet the government has not been willing or candid or truthful to admit there is any major policy error and would rather like the people to keep quiet or insist that they are unfailing in whatever their judgments.<br><br>If we must avoid welfarism by pointing to western societies which suffer from welfarism, is it also practical to over-charge the citizens for low-cost housing?<br><br>So it is more important for the government to change rather than the people who have not done any wrong as they are the ones who contributed to the nation building through their blood and toil in building up the surpluses.<br><br>So people do not want to see government being too clever by using the nkf creative accounting as to enrich the state coffers forever and claim superficial success.<br><br>Thus it is my humble view that even if government has to take certain unpopular action out of practicality or pragmatism, it still has the duty to substantiate its actions with well argued easons and logics so as to produce the greatest benefits to the greatest number.<br><br>If the government loses cannot do so for any reason or refuses to admit its many past errors then it cannot expect to have the moral authority to ask people to give more births or pay more taxes or tackle any daunting challenges ahead in upgrading the economic competitiveness.<br><br>The large number of citizens' migration to other countries is a case in point to show you what an uncaring and arrogant government can do to a country progress and prosperity.<br><br><blockquote>When you see the the rationality is weak you would dismiss it as being donpracticality and assume everything as ideal.

Is tat fair to the people living jurong ?<br><br>2) Do u agree tat even if u reduce the price of housing very very low, the gov have to tax from some other area to balance the budget ? Do u agree tat tax from people owning the most land, in the better location and do not make efficient in their land deserve to pay more tax ? Do u want the rich and poor divide to become wider ?<br><br>3) All land in the city is not free. Despite the things u say about land belonging to citizens etc, up till now u still cannot name me any city tat offer free land to most of the citizen. A large revenue of the gov come from land, especially in the city. And it is a fair way of taxing since land is the major limiting resources city faces<br><br>Tis time, however u suggest a different time frame, 20 years ago as a reference.<br><br>As said, the past 20 years is totally different. Everybody is coming to singapore to invest. Singapore ask high corporate tax. There r more land available and more cheaper, singapore is undeveloped, not much competition for investors, currency is bigger, china is closed etc. Now political environment is totally different. Now land is more expensive because land r more limited. Tat is why gov have to ask people to pay more for their housing. U say do not suck money from the people, then where do money come from ? U still cannot suggest any good alternative. U suck from anywhere u will feel pain. Might as well suck at places where it will narrow the rich and poor divide. Do u agree ?<br><br>Why don't u suggest 200 years ago ? Land is free and u can build your attap houses anyway because Raffles have not come here yet.<br><br><strong>2) Gov making losses such as shin corp and suzhou</strong><br><br>U r probably just cutting and pasting all your arguments from your book of quotes. I have already explicitly mention suzhou is making money. However u do not rebuked tis fact nor correct your mistakes by reproducing it. Shincorp is still too early to say anything yet. Furthermore, the buyout of other companies from singapore companies r good and overall they r earning a handsome profit from its investments. If u have doubt, u can read the annual report from Temasek. But gauging from your response so far, u do not admit singapore companies r earning money and fail to substantiate your claims. U say singapore is making losses more than profits overall. Prove it. I have shown from the interview of LHL tat the profit is coming in from suzhou and all the losses r offset. Wat is your evidence tat suzhou losses money ? Otherwise u r just cooking up stories using weasel words and outdated facts.<br><br>And the money earn is given back to the people in dividend. It goes back to the budget. It is going directly to the people<br><br><strong>3) Gov making round of round of tax</strong><br><br>Lets put it tis way. All cities give rounds after rounds of tax. We have to be realistic. Money must come from somewhere to feed the army and police. If gov don't tax, then how to buy missiles and radars ? I have shown singapore obtain the highest quality living on asia in a survey. Does it show your rounds and rounds of tax to be unbearable as u claim ?<br><br><strong>4) Gov opening up of economy and allow foreigners to work</strong><br><br>Up till now u do not comment on whether should the gov open or close the economy. But from the wording of the reply, I guess u r more toward the opening of economy. Since u agree the economy should be open, then u have to face the effect of open economy such as foreigners working here. U can't have a cake and eat it. U need to accept the cons of opening up of economy as well<br><br>Furthermore, the unemployment rate of singapore is very low. I do not see why u have an issue with tis. On stagnant income, can u give a suggestion ? So far I don't see any developed city or country tat can solve tis problem<br><br><strong>5) Dealing with surplus and reserve</strong><br><br>Tis is a very tricky issue. Do u think we should spend it out not because we r facing a problem but because we just wanted a more comfy life. In tis case every year by year, our reserves wil be dwindling. How long do u think we can survive ? Tis is a short term policy and an easy way out. It is not about "uncaring gov" or "arrogant gov". It is simply common sense tat it will not work in the long run.<br><br>Why do it keep accumulating the reserve ? Frankly I don't know. It is a security and safeguard against attacks. However it can be seen tat the money is not wasted but kept in the reserves. If it is wasted, then they wouldn't dare to state it is in the reserves. Even NKF is not lying they have a 300 million reserves.<br><br>For your rest of your reply, they r just mere repeating and rephrasing the same points and using flowery language to exaggerate the problem of singaporean. If u have other points, maybe u can just use a one line title followed by your points so people can understand it easier. It make the whole reply more concise.<br></div>

The difference in price is based on market valuation. How do you determine how much this piece of land is worth? It's based on the other factors, like ease of shopping, proximity of schools, etc. Who determines if this factor is to their convenience? Other than that, land is free to the government.<br><br>Are you refering to opportunity cost of land? Land is always free like the air. If you say land has a price, then maybe you should say air has a price too. Air has a price too, it's the price set by the market, otherwise it's free. What the government does is to use the market price, set a cost for them to inflate the price of flats, but the cost is an opportunity cost, not a real cost. To the government, land is always free.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by stupidissmart:<br><strong>There is a lot of things u say, but the points again r repeated again and again and again. Lets put it into short concise sentence<br><br>[b]1) Housing land should be free and not making any profit</strong><br><br>I have already mentioned upteen times tat is is <strong>not feasible, practical, and even desirable</strong>. LAND MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A COST PRICE. I HAVE SHOWN MANY TIMES, WHY. I have answered your question on all account but u refeuse to do it for my question. R u<strong> sincere </strong>with your discussion or u have something to hide ? I have posed 3 questions for several times but it is never answered. I will post them again and again until they r answered<br><br>1) Do u agree tat the price for a good location like toa payoh should pay more than the house in jurong west (same size) ? If only building cost is consider, the houses build in toa payoh costs the same as jurong west. Is tat fair to the people living jurong ?<br><br>2) Do u agree tat even if u reduce the price of housing very very low, the gov have to tax from some other area to balance the budget ? Do u agree tat tax from people owning the most land, in the better location and do not make efficient in their land deserve to pay more tax ? Do u want the rich and poor divide to become wider ?<br><br>3) All land in the city is not free. Despite the things u say about land belonging to citizens etc, up till now u still cannot name me any city tat offer free land to most of the citizen. A large revenue of the gov come from land, especially in the city. And it is a fair way of taxing since land is the major limiting resources city faces<br><br>Tis time, however u suggest a different time frame, 20 years ago as a reference.<br><br>As said, the past 20 years is totally different. Everybody is coming to singapore to invest. Singapore ask high corporate tax. There r more land available and more cheaper, singapore is undeveloped, not much competition for investors, currency is bigger, china is closed etc. Now political environment is totally different. Now land is more expensive because land r more limited. Tat is why gov have to ask people to pay more for their housing. U say do not suck money from the people, then where do money come from ? U still cannot suggest any good alternative. U suck from anywhere u will feel pain. Might as well suck at places where it will narrow the rich and poor divide. Do u agree ?<br><br>Why don't u suggest 200 years ago ? Land is free and u can build your attap houses anyway because Raffles have not come here yet.<br><br><strong>2) Gov making losses such as shin corp and suzhou</strong><br><br>U r probably just cutting and pasting all your arguments from your book of quotes. I have already explicitly mention suzhou is making money. However u do not rebuked tis fact nor correct your mistakes by reproducing it. Shincorp is still too early to say anything yet. Furthermore, the buyout of other companies from singapore companies r good and overall they r earning a handsome profit from its investments. If u have doubt, u can read the annual report from Temasek. But gauging from your response so far, u do not admit singapore companies r earning money and fail to substantiate your claims. U say singapore is making losses more than profits overall. Prove it. I have shown from the interview of LHL tat the profit is coming in from suzhou and all the losses r offset. Wat is your evidence tat suzhou losses money ? Otherwise u r just cooking up stories using weasel words and outdated facts.<br><br>And the money earn is given back to the people in dividend. It goes back to the budget. It is going directly to the people<br><br><strong>3) Gov making round of round of tax</strong><br><br>Lets put it tis way. All cities give rounds after rounds of tax. We have to be realistic. Money must come from somewhere to feed the army and police. If gov don't tax, then how to buy missiles and radars ? I have shown singapore obtain the highest quality living on asia in a survey. Does it show your rounds and rounds of tax to be unbearable as u claim ?<br><br><strong>4) Gov opening up of economy and allow foreigners to work</strong><br><br>Up till now u do not comment on whether should the gov open or close the economy. But from the wording of the reply, I guess u r more toward the opening of economy. Since u agree the economy should be open, then u have to face the effect of open economy such as foreigners working here. U can't have a cake and eat it. U need to accept the cons of opening up of economy as well<br><br>Furthermore, the unemployment rate of singapore is very low. I do not see why u have an issue with tis. On stagnant income, can u give a suggestion ? So far I don't see any developed city or country tat can solve tis problem<br><br><strong>5) Dealing with surplus and reserve</strong><br><br>Tis is a very tricky issue. Do u think we should spend it out not because we r facing a problem but because we just wanted a more comfy life. In tis case every year by year, our reserves wil be dwindling. How long do u think we can survive ? Tis is a short term policy and an easy way out. It is not about "uncaring gov" or "arrogant gov". It is simply common sense tat it will not work in the long run.<br><br>Why do it keep accumulating the reserve ? Frankly I don't know. It is a security and safeguard against attacks. However it can be seen tat the money is not wasted but kept in the reserves. If it is wasted, then they wouldn't dare to state it is in the reserves. Even NKF is not lying they have a 300 million reserves.<br><br>For your rest of your reply, they r just mere repeating and rephrasing the same points and using flowery language to exaggerate the problem of singaporean. If u have other points, maybe u can just use a one line title followed by your points so people can understand it easier. It make the whole reply more concise.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Herebelow was my points you have grossed over and not read. Just accept the facts and logics stated therein that a system of government which is based on taxing and people and recovering all possible costs through clever creative accounting method like corporatizing essential government services and charging highest market prices like HDB, Singapore Power, SLA, JTC, PSA are doing is immoral.<br><br>Method of allocation by HDB for public housing has been first-come-first-served and needs and income ceilings so there is no issue with who get the housing at where. Whether one gets the flat at Toa Payoh or Queenstown, or Seng Kang are not issue at all.<br><br>What is immoral is sinful and will be rejected by the people especially no matter how clever is the propaganda and how flowery is the language used.<br><br>Read below:<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: purple;"><strong>I am sure if you are to read my earlier posts again you will be able to see that I have been the one who has given many concrete examples and logics to back up my arguments.<br><br>I have been pointing out to you many times that the government has been wrong in pursuing all these years a wrongful system of taxing and recovering of fullest costs resulting in taxes being accumulated as continual surpluses for which the government has been quick to claim as its superficial success.<br><br>I am sure citizens do not expect the government to be idealistic and to deliver wonders like in an utopia. I am sure also people do not ask for welfarism or free lunch although the same cannot be said of ministers who went to the parliament to vote for their own nkf-type of salary inreases and other golden-tap self-rewards.<br><br>I am sure citizens will be very happy if the government could just simply owns up and realizes its fundamental policy error in over-taxing the people through all kinds of corporatisation schemes to rid themselves of responsibilty to the people and stop boasting regularly of such tax surpluses as its success.<br><br>The example of HDB changing its low-cost housing policy as practised up to 1970s to profiteering in the 1980s is a case in point of such over-taxing policy which does not bring about the greatest benefits to the greatest number which should be the main pillar of a practical and pragmatic government.<br><br>Uncaring sucking of monies from the people is not a sign of pragmatism or practicality.<br><br>I also did not disagree with all the government actions. I agree that it has certain duties to take unpopular measures for the greatest benefits of the greatest number.<br><br>The issue now is by exacting another and another round of taxes, is the government really serving the people or being practical in its governance.<br><br>Or is the government only treating people as the target for sucking more monies to build its surpluses and extravagant spending and even losses on self-centred investments like souzhou or shin corp.<br><br>Is the government being practical or oppressive in creating jobs for the foreigners even for mundane jobs under its pro-foreign S-pass foreign employment policy. What people want to know is whether by pro-foreign employment policy, indeed more jobs are being created to the citizens including the thousands who have been retrenched and become prolonged unemployed despite high education since the last three prolonged recessions from which Singapore has taken the longest to recover.<br><br>If the lower and middle income earners should end up with lower wages due to retrechments or globalization etc should not our leaders set personal examples by being subjected to the same foreign employment policy instead of constantly lecturing the people for the fault or lack of training even though the ministers have patently failed in their economic restructuring plans for ages without results.<br><br>Is such protectism of the elites and their own kind also done out of pragmatism. Is it not hoarding of people's taxes a sin as it leads to more constant increases of fees and charges including selling the low-cost housing to make obscene double-profits on lands and assets.<br><br>What happen to all the taxes people have been paying and all the surpluses hoarded by the government.<br><br>What is so impractical to use part of such surpluses created by over-taxing as people's relief-of-living-costs endowment schemes to offset the constantly increasing taxes and gst by all the ministies and GLCs which cause great burdens to the people.<br><br>What is so impractical to ask the ministers not to lose people's surpluses by billions nowadays in overseas projects like souzhou and shin corp which do not benefit the people.<br><br>I have given you many examples to substantiate my argument to discontinue the taxing and recovering system of government but you now claim without basis that I am being idealistic or repetitive in posing of these views or queries. See who is the one who refuses to listen to logic and arguments.<br><br>You are not willing to reason with reasons or accept the fact going to the other extreme of over-taxing to recover all possible costs could produce the worse consequences than welfarism.<br><br>A system of government's profiteering from its corporatization schemes to free itself from practically any provisions of essential government services is one where the government is working for its own sake and no longer serving the people.<br><br>I have also shown you that it is wrong to abuse the so-called meritocracy to favor the elites and the rich but you have been too engrossed in selective comparisons with worse-off countries to listen to such plain truth.<br><br>The issue facing our society today is whether when the leaders are being confronted with logics and rationality are they prepared to accept robust arguments and make amends or are they merely interested in regurgitating all the past policies and propagandas which have been largely shamefully exposed in the NKF saga.<br><br>It appears that to you the government always acts for its own interests forgetting the principle of governing for the greatest benefits of the greatest number. If the leaders are not listening and always seeking to blame the people for the slightest failures of their duties, how can the people be made to listen.<br><br>So it appears that the system has produced the serious problem where the high costs are not only affecting the lower income families but also large number of middle income families so much so that government is being forced to rethink its many past policies.<br><br>Yet the government has not been willing or candid or truthful to admit there is any major policy error and would rather like the people to keep quiet or insist that they are unfailing in whatever their judgments.<br><br>If we must avoid welfarism by pointing to western societies which suffer from welfarism, is it also practical to over-charge the citizens for low-cost housing?<br><br>So it is more important for the government to change rather than the people who have not done any wrong as they are the ones who contributed to the nation building through their blood and toil in building up the surpluses.<br><br>So people do not want to see government being too clever by using the nkf creative accounting as to enrich the state coffers forever and claim superficial success.<br><br>Thus it is my humble view that even if government has to take certain unpopular action out of practicality or pragmatism, it still has the duty to substantiate its actions with well argued easons and logics so as to produce the greatest benefits to the greatest number.<br><br>If the government loses cannot do so for any reason or refuses to admit its many past errors then it cannot expect to have the moral authority to ask people to give more births or pay more taxes or tackle any daunting challenges ahead in upgrading the economic competitiveness.<br><br>The large number of citizens' migration to other countries is a case in point to show you what an uncaring and arrogant government can do to a country progress and prosperity.</strong></span></blockquote></div>
