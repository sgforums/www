Last time all support and defend and celebrate NKF, Durai salary cheong-ed like bullish bubble for 4cts every dollar to patients... People even talked in this forum how come Malaysia charge so much lower... Now gahmen all quiet. Wait open mouth another groundnut drop out then how?<br><br>You cannot think like this. If first batch leaders, Durai probably hanged with what new hanging laws oredi.<br><br>I tell you, NKF thing we no talk directly say Gahmen like NKF and all that... Just keep quiet, f**k Durai, f**k those simpletons. People got eyes to see... not everything must say "NKF you know so much problem... eh? Similar to gahmen... ok, got case gahmen must change..."<br><br>You think you tell Durai like that back then, he'd change? He maybe even sue you, understand?<br><br>You invite Lui for what? He agree with you, he finished. He no agree with you, he also finished. If he nobody member, maybe he say something if righteous enough... now he kena minister, you say he got virtue or not? He got virtue you are wrong, he no virtue you invite him also you wrong...<br><br>Robert... u never change abit... Useless one lah... This is the time to idle.<br><br>BTW, whether you right or wrong is not my issue here.<br><br>Anyway... which virtuous leader will have a bunch of clueless leaders... ...? Robert... Robert... You ever endorse begging robbers not to rob will stop robbers from crime? Or telling angels to go to hell and heaven will shut doors?<br><br>If you assume who-and-who no virtue... such asking to offer virtue is like asking for miracle from empty air. Aiyah...  </blockquote>Elfred,<br><br>I can understand your frustration for you have expressed them here many times and you want to get out.<br><br>I am sure from your experiences in dealing with them, you have seen evern more injustices from the insider perspective.<br><br>It is up to you to convince them or not to convince them of the tsunami situation their self-centred policies and doings are leading to taking into account your experiences.<br><br>For now, the citizens are now growing up and the internet is the unstoppable medium of their expressions of unhappiness with policies and NKF ways of doing things to suit themselves.<br><br>But I am sure with better travel and education they can tell the truths from untruths and they can judge for themselves whether the past hypocrisy of promoting ministers' own self-rewards and the self-centred taxing and cost-recovering system of government is good for them.<br><br>Citizens can only express their views as they have no political power to make the change. They will be able however to tell the truths and one day the truths will prevail.<br><br>Leaders must consider for themselves whether they can carry on telling half-truths like unpopular policies being bitter medicine or good for the long-term interest or the no-free-lunch excuses should be given all the time to justify more tax and fee increases. The current narrow system of taxing and recovering all costs against citizens have driven up costs to beyond S$1,000.00 per household and job losses by the thousands.<br><br>These are the wrongs citizens will need to speak up on and government will have to consider whether these feedbacks are the truths or mischiefs. If these feedbacks are not the truths, they have to debunk them or else they will have to overhaul their present self-serving elitist protectionism and nkf way of doing things which put them on a tight spot now because they have been supported openly by our political leaders and their spouses.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Current Constitution has failed to provide for the basic rights of citizens or established the role of government and its component branches.<br><br>Without such provisions, we cannot evolve a system of government which will respect the rights of citizens and protect our citizens from being unjustly persecuted by the government leading to instability of the country.<br><br>It should define larger aspects of nation building, it is essential to provide appropriate safeguard to prevent abuse and motivate all citizens to participate in social and cultural and all aspects of nationhood.<br><br>A forward-looking constitution will motivate citizens to participate in all aspects of nation building.<br><br>As it is because of the lack of commitments towards protecting the citizens' rights against abuse, people are treated as digits and number with hardly any respect and all sorts of laws are being passed which increase their hardship and burden.<br><br>There are also a great deal of complexities and uncertainties in areas of administration of justice because of lack of such basic guarantee of citizens' rights leading to conflicts and instability.<br><br>There should be a proper balance between the need for law and order and fulfilling of citizens' needs for protections against abuse of power against the state and the citizens.<br><br>The lack of such provisions has led to over-controls, over-regulations and over-legalistic passing of laws and enforcement resulting in autocracy and stifling of creativity and enterprises of society.<br><br>In the long-term interest of the state or the people, the constitution will need to be upgraded to one which provides not only law and order but protections of citizens and ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number.<br><br>To begin with we need to approach the constitutional upgrading to cover the following major areas of governments:-<br><br>(1) Systematic decentralized institutionalized administration,<br>(2) Independence of the judiciary and administration of justice,<br>(3) Upholding the democratic one-man-one-vote election process.<br>(4) implementation processes to ensure all component branches of government are permitted to exercise their respective roles and funcations with accountability and responsibility so as to uphold citizens' rights, freedoms to participate in nation building from greater social, cultural and economic opportunity without discrimination through class, elitism, creed of any kind.<br><br>Specifically the constitution would establish the component branches of government so that each will be able to exercise its role effectively without any domination or influence by the executive and its supervisory civil service in the interest of all citizens.<br><br>When such a constitution is established, it will then be possible to rally behind the executive and support all the government policies and decisions as such an executive will be working to safeguard the interests and wellbeing of the people.<br><br>The existing constitution is too general leaving the executive too much power to work on its own agenda without accountability and transparency and many policies, appointments of government etc are not working in the interest of the people e.g. "20 major policy errors of governemnt" as posted to the feedback unit.<br><br>It is not sufficient for the government to work on conceptual leadership-centric system as it will lead to abuse window dressing, creative accounting and look-good justifications of policies and presentations.<br><br>There is a need to recognize people needs and aspirations through the constitution as a compact between the government and the people in the long-term interest and any persistent legalistic wrangling of the current constitution will lead ultimately to instability.<br><br>It is essential if the government wants to engage the people in understanding its policies and decisions for the government to revise the inadequacies and shortcomings in the current constitution and upgrade it to one which will motivate the citizens' collective talents, to work together with the government with coordination, knowledge applications and innovation in every field, the key to the people's vibrancy and competitiveness.</div>

Lewis said that it's no point going to the other extreme from a mistake, for it's simply being wrong in the opposite direction.<br><br>If OM really seeks to be <span style="font-style: italic;">constructive</span> in here, it would help if he actually takes <strong>sensible</strong> positions on certain matters given many of his exploits seem to be taken to "demolish" the "opposition spirit" with equally ridiculus and laughable positions given a pseudointellectual slant.<br><br>If anything one understands the venom coming from some of the unbalanced opposition, but one reacts to OM's post more with disgust if anything else, given how they come across to people and a rather ignorant and arrogrant at the same time.<br><br>It seems to me that OM, as opposed to helping to "rectify" the view of moderate people who may be "decieved" here, is actually helping many of these to be the very persons he is trying to "save" them from. In any case his time here must then be judged a rather dismal failure given the reception from even moderate quarters. Once can understand to take the words from an angry, anti-establishment person with a pinch of salt, but unfortunately OM's words are more often then not totally rejected given he tries to pass of many rather curious and funny positions as absolute and closed to debate.<br><br>I shall reserve comment on the caning thread, which is another bizzare example of this.<br><br>Yes OM, it would be good to actually hear something sensible from you for once... that is if you are really above opposing-the-opposing-for-the-sake-of-opposing-for-the-sake-of-opposing...</div>

The Law Society published it in November 2006  It can be viewed <a href="http://thinkhappiness.blogspot.com/2006/08/meeting-david-marshall-in-1994.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> :<br><br><strong>"I am frankly terrified by this massive control of the mass media, the press, the radio, television, antennae, [and] public meetings. You canÂ’t write a letter to the Straits Times; if there is a shadow of criticism, itÂ’s not published. And the Chinese press follows suit. ItÂ’s a very dangerous position because experience proves that no one group of human beings has got all the wisdom in the world.<br><br>(...)(China had) Confucian authoritarianism for more than 2500 years. What happened to China? She was a fossil. She had to reinvigorate herself with the Western ideology of communism. Another authoritarian ideology! And what was the result?"</strong><br><br>&lt;...&gt;<br><br>We have lost sight of the joy and excitement of public service, helping our fellow men. The joy and excitement of seeking and understanding of the joy of the miracle of the living the duty and the grandeur. We have lost taste for heroic action in the service of our people.<br><br>&lt;...&gt;<br><br><strong>The government doesnÂ’t see I do respect them immensely. They donÂ’t see IÂ’m a genuine friend. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They only see me as a critic and to be a critic is to be an enemy who must be erased and destroyed. There is no such thing as an honest critic to the PAP. ItÂ’s a blasphemy to criticise the emperor, spoilt son of heaven.</span></strong><br><br>(Lee) Kuan Yew says you mustnÂ’t lampoon a Chinese gentleman. Oh, dear me! Ya, what happened? What happened to China?<br><br>In Europe, they institutionalised the court jester and the court jester had total immunity against any result from his public criticism of the kings and emperors and the courtyard. Open public criticism Â– that was his job! They tried to laugh it off but at least there was one person to prick the bubble of their overgrown egoism.<br><br>And which civilisation has progressed better for the development of humanity? The Western civilisation or the Chinese civilisation?"<br><br>How chilling that his words should be so relevant today, in 2007.</div>

But let me ask you again. Do you actually think that by lowering the pay of all the civil servants, you will lower the income gap?</blockquote>My starting point is for a country to be well governed, the basics must be right. The basics include honesty, integrity, commitment to serve the people to attain the greatest benefits for the greatest number.<br><br>One sure way to do so is to govern the country democratically based on rule of law and a well written constitution will help to ensure such a good corporate governance.<br><br>The constitution can be adopted such that the people will respect it as it will provide a basis to settle all potential differences and problems. The constitution can be laid down as a social compact between the people and government with the government committed to serve the people who elected them based on such serious and solemn pledges and manifestos.<br><br>It will be quite wrong for leaders to keep thinking of themselves or their own wellbeings. If there is such a government which thinks of taxing and recovering costs to accumulate their own government surpluses and does not intend to use the surpluses to lower the rising costs of living, then such a system is not sustainable and will fail in the long run.<br><br>So I hope many of our active citizens could appreciate the importance of building a government based on such strong commitments and foundation or social compact.<br><br>Anything that is less than the above will not be serving our interests as a people who pay them to do a job well done and not to give any more excuses to justify their past mistakes.</div>

You take issue with my point that employing foreign doctors from India will solve our healthcare problem.<br><br>My point is that Indian doctors are paid very lowly in their country. A specialist doctor in Bangalore is only paid Rs20,0000 (after a salary hike):<br><br>"Bangalore, Jan 28 (IANS) Karnataka has finalised an $800-million project to revamp its healthcare infrastructure and train health professionals at the grassroots - a scheme that is expected to benefit over 45 million people.....<br><br>...The minister said the salaries of contract doctors in the state were under review and may be increased. <strong>The government is planning to increase the salary of contract doctors to Rs.19,000 and specialised doctors to Rs.20,000,</strong> he added." (Exerpt from http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1913342,000600030009.htm)<br><br>Rs.20,000 for specialised doctors is only S$695.670 a month....In fact, even if we take their creme de la creme, specialists in private hospitals who have worked 6 years in the US (their standard cannot be too bad if they could work in USA, arguably the most medically litigious society in the world), their pay is only Rs50,000 or S$1,740.61 a month.<br><br>Given that our non-specialist doctor (medical officer) with three years' post-housemanship experience is getting between 4k to 5k (depending on the number of calls), we can well employ 2 or 3 Indian specialist doctors for the salary of one of our non-specialist MO.<br><br>If you still cannot see how that will lower healthcare costs and cut waiting times, then you should really enroll in MINDS.<br><br></div>
