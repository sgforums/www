According to them they seek the pros and cons and hear opinions before deciding to go ahead. On hanging of the australian guy, they do seek feedback and come out with statistic tat singaporean prefer the existence of the death penalty. And surprisingly for the last election, no opposition is sued till bankrupt. The past previous elections someone is bound to be sued. I think there r signs tat the country is opening up. Has it opened up enough is another question<br><br></div></blockquote>Pretending to open up is what I see it. How many a times have they received public feedback but only to brush it away. Look at the rise in cost of our public transportation, the general public is up in arms against the pathetic attempt by PTC to help us, but what can we do? They ''attempted'' to help the general population...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">On the problems singapore population faces, I got to ask is it the problem of capitalism problem or is it the problem of politician here ? On the first page robertteh mention public housing earns a profit based on construction cost, and not look at land cost. Now which city in the world offer free land for housing for the poorer people ? Do Shanghai give free land for housing ? Neh... Do tokyo give free land for housing ? Much worse... Do New York give free land for housing ? Nope. Do our neighbour KL give free land ? Also no. All these cities that were mentioned r bigger than singapore themselves and they all charge a high price for the land. All gov consider their land as their precious resources and seek to earn tax from it. In a way it is good since the people who own more land, less efficient with land and stay in a good location generally pay more tax than others. Tis is not the problem of singapore, every city faces tis problem. It is the problem of capitalism. </div></blockquote>People are not demanding free land, that would be impossible to find in any part of the world. I must admit the old guards have done a good job in providing affordable housing for the masses. However, to counter the rising cost of living in this millenium (and the stagnant income level amongst the lower income population), isn't it better to lower the cost of owning a HDB flat thus allowing the person in question to have more CPF funds for his retirement?<br><br>This is a unique problem that Singapore faces thus we need unique solutions.

Tat is why generally education level and having a good CV land u in a better job isn't it ? Don't look at the public sector, look at the private sector. Most of them still look at education level. We cannot blame parents for pushing their children to study hard, and we cannot solely push the blame to gov and not to the companies here as well. Talking about Bill gates or other successful people, it is true tat there r such talents.

I would appreciate the government to address some of our concerns rather than just brushing us aside like rag dolls after we have given our votes.

Dear sir, can you please kindly explain why this medicine is good for us instead of shoving it down our throat?<br><br>The onus is on the government to convince most of the general public, however it appears to me that most are not convinced. A quick survey amongst your friends and colleagues will quickly confirm what I said.<br><br>Rather than recognizing and considering the views and feedbacks of intellects and scholars only, the government will do well to enable the common joe, armchair critics to examine and dissect positions taken by our leaders.

On average, families can easily reside in their current abode for 10 years and more. Should the government kindly reduce the prices for their HDB units by say $30,000, it could mean an additional $40,000 for Singaporeans in their CPF kitty when they retire.<br><br>The advantage? The citizens get to pay off their housing more quickly, meanwhile the government can still utilize our CPF money to invest in their off-shore investments. ItÂ’s a win-win situation for both parties but the banks (and the money minded MIW) will of course prefer that the average joe bleed for a longer period.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Well all big organisation have some people tat leech the work from their subordinate.

Rather they will wait for your contract to expire. Meanwhile all you need to do is to stay out of mischief as that would give them a reason to terminate your contract. Many competent Regulars have left the force because they donÂ’t feel appreciated. Promotions come when the time comes, and the general advice given by the seniors is that just do what you are told, donÂ’t go and be a hero.<br><br>In SAF, a military organization, you find massive wastage of manpower and time devoted to their commitment to maintaining their ISOXXXX.

Dear sir, can you please kindly explain why this medicine is good for us instead of shoving it down our throat? </blockquote>Well the gov always state the reason why the medicine is good for u, it is just tat it is not accepted.

We do not move base every 5 years. On average, families can easily reside in their current abode for 10 years and more. Should the government kindly reduce the prices for their HDB units by say $30,000, it could mean an additional $40,000 for Singaporeans in their CPF kitty when they retire.<br><br>The advantage? The citizens get to pay off their housing more quickly, meanwhile the government can still utilize our CPF money to invest in their off-shore investments. ItÂ’s a win-win situation for both parties but the banks (and the money minded MIW) will of course prefer that the average joe bleed for a longer period. </blockquote>Well i don't think money flies so much so tat the CPF money can double itself to reduce the price HDB unit by letting gov to invest it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> In fact losses can be made in investing. If tat being known, where should the rest of the money for the HDB come from ?

If they cannot perform even in public sector, they r going to be worse off in private sector. So we have a big social problem then isn't it ?

However the objective is to make the system more effective. And sad to say, in the military and police, it is written in their training that they cannot be too familar with the people below them.

Another qeustion should we keep the salesman tat only manage to sell 90 units when we can't find any other people to take over his duty ? Though he sell lesser than expected, he still sell 90.
