Another wild allegation not supported by facts? The electorial results over the past 40 years certainly do not support a grudging acceptance of government policies. People will always whinge, especially Singaporeans, but at the end of the day, those with some brains will make their decision based on who will ensure their continued prosperity.<br><br><blockquote>The Singapore Government aka the Ruling Political Party has already stated that it has nothing to do with the Thaksin or Shin Corp affair; which they claim is largely a commercial transaction involving Temasek.<br><br>They have distanced themselves from this COMMERCIAL deal - why are you barking up the wrong tree ? </blockquote>As usual, you have completely missed the point. My comments on the Thaksin affair relates only to the interview he made to CNN. The purchase of Shincorp is a purely commercial decision and has nothing to do with the government. The question is whether the government should have ignored Thaksin's right to freedom of expression and muzzled him, in the national interests, knowing the current Thai government's position on it. As it turned out, the government resepcted Thaksin's civil liberties and allowed him to make critical remarks about the military junta, thus earning the displeasure of the Thai government. My position is that national interests should override personal liberties.<br><br>Are you prepared to support the PAP in defending Thaksin's right to freedom of expression?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You see, all these die hard PAP supporters often allude to the past "glorious history" to justify their support for the PAP, often papering over all the past stupidities of the PAP Govt. Yes, they did a good job in the PAST. But it is the present that matters. At present, are they doing a good job? I think not. Lots of stupid bungling ranging from the biomedical nonsense where you have someone at the head of a Govt organisation who has the balls to insult the entire male population when that moron has never served NS before in his entire life has no moral authority to even comment on NS, and to the various other bunglings like the Suzhou Industrial project which is a huge billion dollar skeleton in the closet which will make the NKF issue tame by comparison and now we have the more public Thaksin fiasco.<br><br>What they fail to see is that the PAP is banking on the foolish Confucian notion of filial piety and respect for elders for their eternal support. Chinese society is incredibly fossilized in Singapore because people still retain some of the age old notions of how a family should be and should stay that way and not change at all. Respect for elders, pah! Respect is earned and not some God given right!<br><br>The other exploitation of course is the fact that people do not like change and the Govt does its best to keep our laws in the backward ages.<br><br>Now Question: They claim it is a commercial deal with erm.. Singapore taxpayer's money and yet say it is commercial again. Either this is the greatest doublespeak and attempt to pander silly legalistic terms, or the fact of the matter is that they are, like the Suzhou project that went before it, trying to distance the Govt from it. Now, I would like accountability on this issue, but thus far, Temasek has been silent while the Govt does the talking for it. So either the Govt is simply trying to smile off the entire event, or it is simply so deep in shit they know that they are aiming this commercial nonsense not at the Thais but at hte Singaporeans who will be concerned at the prospect taht billions of dollars of taxpayers' cash is now in danger of flying away.</div>

And that is why the Opposition will never win an election unless it can recruit people of the calibre of David Marshall.</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">There is no doubt that in his younger days - during the early 1950s - David Marshall was an impressive speaker as LKY. David Marshall's verbal assault was feared in the Courts, as he was entertaining in debate.<br><br>Despite his fearsome looks, David Marshall retained his humanity towards his fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>His reputation as a Politician and expertise of the Legal System made him a  formidable opponent to LKY and the PAP. It was unfortunate that he lacked the touch of ruthlessness in dealing with the underground Communists that brought his political career to an early end.<br><br>Although David Marshall was less ruthless than LKY, his formidable brain and quick thinking could easily outclass LKY; and given proper political support, it is more then likely that David Marshall could have resurrected his political career in Singapore Politics.<br><br>This possibility was probably noted by LKY, who shrewdly offered David Marshall the opportunity to be Singapore's Ambassador to France; in the same manner as LKY had neutralised the fantastic legal brain of Tommy Koh - by sending him away to be Singapore's Representative to the United Nation.<br><br><strong>'Today - no unemployment, no homeless'</strong> - a statement that you attribute to the late David Marshall is perhaps out of touch with reality; as the term 'Today' referred to 1994 - thirteen years ago.<br><br>Those words were spoken by a gentleman, in his twilight years and blind sided by the superficial glitter of the HDB estates without being involved in the squalor and packed environment of those living in the Single-and-3 Room HDB units.<br><br>From the following report <a href="http://www.jamesgomeznews.com/article.php?AID=13&amp;Page=2" rel="nofollow">"Singapore : New Poor and Social Cohesion"</a>:</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><blockquote>According to quarterly reports by Singapore's Department of Statistics, unemployment has been steadily increasing. By June 2001, unemployment had reached 3.4%, breaching the international satisfactory unemployment level of 3.0%. Singapore?s unemployment rate worsened to 4.7 percent in December 2001, the highest in 15 years, as companies laid off workers to weather the recession.<br><br>Unemployment stood at 4.5% in the first and second quarters of 2003 as confirmed by the Manpower Research and Statistics Department report on ?Labour Market, Second Quarter 2003?. <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The rate exceeds the 4.4 percent recorded in December 1998 during the Asian financial crisis.</span></span> <span style="color: indigo;">The Manpower Research and Statistics Department published a report on "Labour Market, 2001" in March 2002 in which overall unemployment rate was projected to reach about 5.5 - 6% by the second half of 2002 ? an estimate that has been confirmed with the 5.9% figure for the third quarter of 2003. The record rate of 6.0 percent was in March 1986 resulting from the mid-1980s recession.<br><br>With unemployment figures hovering at about 4.5% and set to peak at 5.5%, there is increasing realization that a certain fixed level of unemployment that goes beyond the international satisfactory unemployment level of 3.0% might become a permanent feature of society"<br><br>It is not usual to have government lead surveys of wage to show that since the Asian crisis wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels. However a comparison of the pay increase of the rank-and?file employees will show that throughout the 1990s average annual wage growth has been declining from 10% to 8% in the early half to 7% to 5% in the later half (see page 4, Report on Wages in Singapore, 2002). This is largely due to attempts to keep business costs down, as employers see a cut in wages as one way of keeping costs down.<br><br>In fact, total wages comprising of basic wages, annual wage supplement and variable bonuses came to standstill in 2002, a drop from the 1.1% rise in 2001 (Report on Wages in Singapore, 2002). For the rank and file worker there was a cut in wages by 0.3% in 2002 down from a 1.2% gain a year earlier. The variable wage component of all workers (which includes the 13th month allowance and other variable bonuses) fell 15% from 2.09 months of the basic salary in 2001 to 1.77 months in 2002 (Report on Wages in Singapore, 2002). Needless to say, the rank and file workers experienced a drop of 19% in 2002.<br><br>It has been highlighted that the Per capita GDP in 2000 at around US$23,000 was higher that many First World countries</span> <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">but the remuneration received by Singapore workers or wage share in GDP was about 42 percent, <strong>which is unusually low compared to developed countries and lowest among the Asian NIEs</strong></span></span>.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Some economists have therefore remarked that</span> <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore, while having attained a First World per capita income, in reality has kept in place an income structure that is closer to that of a Third World country</span></strong></span> <span style="color: indigo;">(Department of Statistics, 2001).</span></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Surely in 1994, in which David Marshall made the quoted remarks in his old age, he could not possibly have foreseen the impending increase in the numbers of unemployed and homeless in Singapore?<br><br>The reason for the Opposition not being able to win in any Election is due largely to the unethical political moves made by the Ruling Political Party, with its shameless use of its monopolistic grip and abuse of government machinery, the police, the legal system, the medias - to perpetuate its existence in Singapore.<br><br>In any other First World society, with a strong and independent Judiciary and Legal System, the methods employed by this Ruling Political Party - to perpetuate itself during the Election Process - would have resulted in independent probes and prosecution.<br><br>Can Singapore ever hope to get itself out of the present rut and take off in the same manner as the South Koreans - who have rid themselves from dictatorial rule and the accumulation of power in one person and one party ?<br><br>Will you prefer to be purposefully blind and ignore the numbers prepared by the Department of Statistics; or perhaps the mushroom brain cannot possibly absorb any sequential logic from obvious numbers, and prefer to be lulled to sleep by pompous propaganda ?<br></span><br></div>

My position is that national interests should override personal liberties.<br><br>Are you prepared to support the PAP in defending Thaksin's right to freedom of expression? </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Are you now expanding the Thaksin Affair - from the Shincorp commercial transaction - to the Thaksin Affair concerning his Rights being muzzled by the Thai Military ?<br><br>It is a sad irony to believe your pseudo concern with Thaksin's right to freedom of expression, when you hardly will recognise the same rights that have been taken away from Singaporeans by this Singapore Government.<br><br>Can we believe your pathetic postion in attempting to twist your way out of a quick sand that you have built your entire position on ?<br><br>It is best that you follow David Marshall's decision to stay out of politics, and quit while you are ahead, as it is not so smart to make comments about issues that you have definitely shown yourself to be unable to grasp.<br><br>Going about the entire reply but engaging issues at a tangent with new implausible arguments only confirms the mushroom thinking that you so proudly identify yourself with.</span><br><br></div>
