But then again wat does tis have to do with whether the gov is corrupted or not ? Durai is being sued and charged now isn't it ?</blockquote>It could not be such a pure coincidence that while the ministers were pushing pushing their own salaries from S$600,000.00 for the PM in 1970s t0 S$2,000,000.00 pa by the 11990s today Mr. Durai of NKF has also been pushing up his own salaries with the tacit support of the government patron from S$120,000.00 pa to S$600,000.00 pa during this same period/<br><br>There is a common saying: "monkey sees monkey does." So I cannot accept your contention that NKF wrong doings in self-rewarding themselves was not connected to the government/<br><br>If anyone were to question Mr. Durai's peanut pay at that time while Ministers are voting to pay themselves the highest salaries benchmarked against the successful CEOs and entrepreneurs in the private sector, I don't think any one among our civil servants or ministers would ever have the gut to question Mr. Durai's peanut pay.<br><br>However in the light of the public outrage, and the mass withdrawal of public donation, government has no alternative but was forced to admit the problem and hence the present court case against durai and the conspiring board.<br><br>This is a good evidence to show that the minister in charge has failed in his duty to oversea the charity organization to safeguard against such self-rewards and malpractices.<br><br>It is not a case of government taking its own action on wrong doings in NKF but it was a case of being forced by public outrage to do so. I would correct your assumption that government has taken its own actions to correct wrong doings and malpractices.<br><br>It may just happen that our investments of public funds in other government agencies and ministries are so as accountable or transparent as the government claims because citizens have no access to information/<br><br>Citizens look forward after NKF to ask Temasek and GIC to show us their decision making process in investing public monies in shin corp and global crossing.<br><br><blockquote>quote:There are many flaws in such an assumptions which rest essentially on comparison of the highest pays of bosses in the private business world as many of them are capitalist investors who reward themselves highly from their own business profits or own monies which in a down time could turn into quick losses.<br><br>Stupidissmart:-<br><br>Do they compared themselves with the highest pays of bosses ? Furthermore the pay for some CEO is fixed and whether the company decline or not, he still get his pay. Doesn't the ministers get a pay cut when the economy is faltering ?</blockquote>The specific benching of ministers' pays against the highest earners in the private business sector is flawed and I do not see how you could explain it is not point by point to what I have posted before on this topic in several posts.<br><br>The in-principle concept that we must pay ministers the highest pays to prevent corruption is the same argument that to prevent a murder, we ought to pay potential murderer ransom or blackmail monies.<br><br>PM of Malaysia Mr. Balawi in reply to MM Lee's advice to pay their ministers higher salaries was: We believe that ministers must have integrity ...not to ask for such higher pays to which MM Lee could not reply up to today. So your view that ministers must be paid the higher or highest pays to attract talents or prevent corruptions cannot be borne out in practice neither on talents which were not proven to this day nor on integrity issue.<br><br><blockquote>    quote:They are not entrepreneurs in the private sector who are able to push up their pays by comparing with the highest and not being accountable to their shareholders for lack of performance or mistakes like our ministers such as in NKF or Shin Corp/<br><br>Stupidissmart:<br><br>Lack of performance ? Mistakes ? Whether shin corp, in the long run, will fail is sill not confirmed yet. Overall for the year they still make more profit then the losses so should they get fired for making profit ? NKF has nothing to do with the Gov. It is not even gov linked.</blockquote>NKF is a by-product of our money-worshipping system where on the one hand government believes in no-free lunch but its ministers keep taking monies for themselves against the principle of accountability or good corporate governance.<br><br>Because of the consequent tax-and-recover system of government adopted by the government, Durai was able to exploit on the ministers need to encourage public donations to take care of medically terminal patients and Durai ended up practically supported by the highest authority to do as he likes with the tacit support of the highest level.<br><br>So I cannot agree with your contention that NKF has nothing to do with the government and government should be excused from the wrongs committed with the encouragement of the government at the highest level. (see my other posts on breach of codes of conduct by ministers on this matter)<br><br><blockquote>    quote:Iaococca is another example of a private sector CEO who understands such a predicament of benefits and reward system. He gave up his CEO pay during the period Chrysler was in financial crisis to show that if he wants to be talented and be paid high salaries he must be answerable for performance.<br><br>Stupidissmart:<br><br>U see, he is a classic example but u can't expect everyone to follow him. He does not do wat common CEO will do. Mother Teresa went to africa to help the needy so does it means every nuns have to go to africa ?</blockquote>If our ministers have been promoting themselves as the world's best and deserving to be rewarded the world's highest salaries for bill collections, then you cannot say that they should be exempted from the iaccocca moral and EQ exemplary self-restraints to lead by example.<br><br>quote:I am sure I have by now shown you that it is only an assumption that in order to attract talents we must pay the highest salaries equivalent to The bosses of legal firms, stock companies and all the investor category of private sector CEO. There is no end to such comparison as our MM Lee might well next make comparison with salaries of Bill Gates and Sim Wong Hoo who are extremely creative in their entrepreneurship and deserve all their reward whereas public sector employees or public officers are only in charge of passing laws and collecting monies. [/quote]<br><br>I am sure no matter how MM Lee will try to argue in an international context he cannot justify his benchmarking of ministers' highest pays to be on par with the highest rewards to any wage earners in the private business sector.<br><br>However because the media is under the control of the government there is no option but for the citizens to swallow such a artful one-sided conflict-of-interest wrong doing.<br><br></div>

If u find it is logically flawed, u could easily point it out<br><br><blockquote>We would like to see how ministers could come to rebut the people's criticism that it is profiteering on public housing and its transfer to original HDB loan system to the private banker loans is against the spirit of the setting up of public housing authority called HDB.<br><br>The about-turn on low cost public housing in order to keep taxing and profiteering has today caused one of the biggest problems ever to citizens in human history</blockquote>U can't find minister rebut from me but my logical conclusion is housing is built on land. No land is free in any city. And collecting tax from people having big houses at good location seems to be good for the people.

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone actually came up with some interesting points on the net.<br><br>Effiencency.<br><br>&gt;  The $100,000 that a Singapore Minister is paid in ONE MONTH  is what a<br>&gt; typical experienced middle-age Singapore manager will earn in an ENTIRE<br>&gt; YEAR!<br>&gt;  Nearly half-a-million (some 400,000) S'poreans even earn less than $1,500<br>&gt; per month.<br><br><blockquote><br>8 Ministers of State (Junior Ministers):<br>--  Salary range around  $1m to $1.5m per year.<br><br>5 Parliamentary Secretaries &amp; 1 Political Secretary:<br>--  Yatiman Yusof, Mohamed Maidin, Hawazi Daipi, Maliki Osman, Koo Tsai Kee.<br>Political Secretary Tang Guan Seng has been around for umpteen years!<br>--  Salary around $1m per year.  Hardly any  Ah Kow, Ahmad or Ali  know what<br>the heck they actually do !!!<br><br>82 PAP Members of Parliament:<br>--  Likewise, what do this whole bunch  "actually"  do to  "justify"  their<br>MP Allowance of  $11,900 per month (on top of their regular day job)???<br>[ SM Goh recently defended the $11,900 per month as "fair".  Luckily (for<br>him), he didn't say the amount is "peanuts" !!! ]<br><br>--  They only show their faces mostly near a General Election.<br>--  They hardly bother to attend our infrequent Parliament sittings<br>(convenient lame excuse --- business commitments).   But when either MM Lee<br>or PM Lee speak in Parliament, they were "somehow" able to attend!  Some<br>were even caught napping on televised Parliament sessions!<br>--  At most, they hold weekly  Meet-the-People sessions on resident's<br>problems dealing with bird-brained civil servants.<br>[Note: if our highly-paid civil servants have been doing a proper job, such<br>sessions would be unnecessay!].<br>At say, three hours per weekly session, these MPs are being paid close to<br>$1,000 per hour!<br>--  They also get to hold Directorships in many companies (mostly<br>govt-linked companies), collecting easy  "side income"  from numerous<br>director's fees.<br></blockquote><a href="http://groups.google.com.sg/group/soc.culture.singapore/msg/2b4dead75e79327b?&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com.sg/group/soc.culture.singapore/msg/2b4dead75e79327b?&amp;hl=en</a><br></div>

If the pay is lousy, the people who can get $100,000 outside will not join as minister because they r donating a 80% salary donation to the country.
