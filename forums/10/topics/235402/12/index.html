How much tis land costs depend on market evaluation like future plans, road linking to it and accessibility. If land is free, then no one will save on land. Bungalow become the cheapest housing since it is easier to build bungalow then flats. Everyone will live in one storey bungalows with big gardens which is bigger and cheaper. Then wat happened to singapore ?<br></div></blockquote>You are comparing public housing like HDB to Bungalows? They are different housing type. HDB apartments is no frills basic living area, whereas Bungalow is a privately developed project (where companies have a profit motive and will provide premium development). That plot of land that resides the Bungalow, built up to 12 floors can probably accomodate 48 families.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">As said, land is never free, especially in cities.

I am not sure what is the process loss (of if there is any) during the conversion from natural gas to electricity, but let's say it's 10%. So we end up with (292 Kwh X 90%) = 263.69 Kwh.<br><br>If you divide the cost by the 263.69 Kwh, you get:<br><br>6.37 cents/Kwh as compared to 21.64 cents/Kwh for Singapore Power<br><br>http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngw/ngupdate.asp<br><br>We can have a process loss during conversion of up to 50% and still make a hefty profit when we sell at 15 cents/Kwh.<br><br>292.99Kwh x 50% = 146.50Kwh<br><br>SGD 16.80 / 146.50 Kwh = 11.47 cents/Kwh<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">I check my earlier posting and research, the return on equity for Singapore Power should be 22% to 26% for the last 3 years, not 35% as stated by me earlier. During these 3 years, the price of electricity has gone up from approximately 15 cents to 21 cents. The increase in returns is probably due to increase in price.</span><br><br><a href="http://%20http://www.singaporepower.com.sg/index.html" rel="nofollow"> http://www.singaporepower.com.sg/index.html</a><br><br>Seriously, a return of equity of 22% to 26% on a blue chip stock is extremely rare in the stock market. For the price you pay for the stock, you only need to 4-5 years to make back the value you pay for the stock.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">wat flats is your friend staying ?

I don't think he inflated the figures intentionally.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">And if u want to really know the cost process of land, singapore has been reclaiming land for many years. It is not zero, zilch, nol, ling. It is costly. If u strictly view cost price then singapore spend a few million to reclaim some square kilometers.<br></div></blockquote>Reclaiming land is different, the amount of money they pay, when they sell to investors, they make profits from it. If you build HDB on reclaim land, then it would justify adding the "cost" of reclaiming the land to the price of the HDB. But then again, are all the flats built by HDB standing on reclaim land?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">And it also do a stupid thing to buy government bond.

And I mean government bonds from other countries!!! In case you don't see my point again.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">But now u r talking about a large group of working capable people and u help them work. Do u think u should ask them to pay u ? Furthermore, they have to pay for security guards (army, police)and trainers (teachers) and building (transport, development) for their work. U gonna pay these security guards and trainer with your money or their money ?<br></div></blockquote>How dorky can you be? Geez!!! You have missed the forest for the trees.<br>Do read my post again and understand where I am coming from.<br><br>I like your overall strategy "if you can't beat them, confuse them else change topic to something irrelevant." Same strategy as OM and the current regime.<br><br><strong>If you are talking about cost of the land in terms of "opportunity cost". Then it's another issue altogether, the land instead of building public housing, the government can sell it in the market to multinational corporation or property investors for a tidy sum. That is opportunity cost, the next best alternative forgone. But if you talk about opportunity cost, it's not relevant here.<br><br>Example: [Say]<br>You make $100 an hour doing legal work, at the same time you do social work like helping the handicapped and the under privilege people of society.<br><br>Would you charge $100 an hour doing social work to those handicapped and under privilege of society?<br><br>This is opportunity cost as mooted by you in the cost of land not being free. This is the kind of cost you are associating the cost of land in HDB to be. An opportunity cost is not a real cost in the perspective of the government.<br><br>If you are in such a circumstance, would you charge the handicapped for the money you would make by servicing them?</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">I felt a bit frustrated because up till now u still use suzhou as an example of "bad deals" when i have already shown it is making profit  And u never rebuked on tis fact. R u just repeating and recycling your points ?<br><br></div></blockquote>Profit making? You mean for China?<br><br>Second, the main reason for the conflict was the continuing losses<br>incurred by the SIP. By September 1999, it was reported that the SIP project<br>would have accumulated losses of US$60 million by the end of the<br>year 2000; the incurred financial loss would be about US$77 millions.<br>From SingaporeÂ’s perspective, the main reason for the SIP loss was the<br>fierce competition and undercutting of prices on the part of SND, besides<br>aggressive marketing by the local authorities for the SND. However, the<br>SND municipal authorities denied any attempt at undercutting the SIP<br>joint venture. As a Chinese official from SuzhouÂ’s Foreign Economic<br>Relations and Trade Commission said,<br><br>Â“We have treated both zones fairly. In fact, common consensus within<br>the government agrees that the SIP has received more preferential<br>policies than the SNDÂ… [The two zones] are both sons of our city; we<br>would likely to see both of them grow up and prosper.Â”<br><br>Despite SingaporeÂ’s efforts to persuade the local authorities of Suzhou to<br>only focus on the SIP for developments, they refused to comply. Thus<br>Singapore decided to scale down its further commitment to the development<br>of the SIP in order to minimize further loss of money. As a face-saving<br>arrangement, both the Singaporean and the Chinese counterparts<br>signed a memorandum of understanding in June 1999 in which Singapore<br>reduced its equity from 65% to 35%, whereas the Chinese counterpart<br>increased its share from 35% to 65%, thus becoming the major developer<br>of the SIP. Both sides agreed that upon completion of the eight square<br>kilometres park, it would be handed over to the Chinese partner by the<br>beginning of January 2001.<br><br>After Singapore transferred the SIP to China on 1 January 2001, SuzhouÂ’s<br>vice-major, Wang Jinghua took over the position of the CEO from<br>SingaporeÂ’s Lim Neo Chian. Wang decided to relinquish all ties with the<br>SIPÂ’s rival, the SND industrial park and concentrate all energy to turn<br>around the CSSD from a loss making into a profit generating company as<br>the most important goal of his administration. By 7 May 2001, when the<br>SIP celebrated its 7th anniversary, it was reported that for the first time<br>since its operation in 1994, the SIP will be able to make a projected profit<br>of US$7.5 million (S$13.5 million) to US$10million for 2001 and 2002<br>respectively, a reversal of the previously accumulated loss of US$77 million<br>at the end of 2000. The SIP has become so successful that it contributes<br>10% of SuzhouÂ’s GDP. By the end of April 2001, the SIP was able to attract<br>about US$8 billion of investment funds with about 37 of<br>FortuneÂ’s 500 multinational companies investing in the SIP.<br><br>What is the explanation for SIPÂ’s turning around from loss to profit?<br>First, the main reason is the local Suzhou authoritiesÂ’ decision to eliminate<br>competition from the SND, which was the main reason for the losses<br>the CSSD incurred. As mentioned earlier, Lee Kuan Yew publicly took<br>issue in 1997 with Wang Jinhua for making unfair remarks about the SIP<br>to German investors. With China now having 65% of the equity stake in<br>the SIP, Wang has vested interests not to send any promotion teams<br>abroad for the SND to compete with the CSSD as he did previously.<br>Second, with credit to Singapore, the Singaporean team has built a first<br>class, competitive and high quality industrial park which is able to attract<br>transnational companies, such as Hitachi, Samsung, Solectron (electronic<br>components), Philips, Advanced Micro Devices, Volex and Bosch, etc.<br>Furthermore, the SIP has the advantage of Â“transparency, no hidden cost,<br>quality and reliable infrastructure and good customer support for expansion<br>in the parkÂ”.<br><br><a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/ras/publication/kiyo_en/03/03_9.pdf" rel="nofollow">Singapore-China Special Economic Relations by SHEE Poon Kim (Institute<br>of International Relations and Area Studies, Ritsumeikan University)</a></div>

It's 297 million!!! I don't have to show any relevant research, if 50 MPs can do the job 84 MPs can do, it's already implicit from the relationship that it's beneficial. If you run a business, why would you employ 100 workers if 50 workers can do the same job. Of course, unless all those workers are your relatives and friends, then that's an entirely different issue. But if it's your own business, nobody would cry foul and accuse you of cronyism. </blockquote>The point is a few hundred senators is an example tat more people can still come out with good policies etc. There is no problem with having more people in an parliament. An obvious problem is too few MP will result in weaker brainstorming, detection of problems and questioning of policies. If we have too little MPs, we may face problems because each MP has too large a stake in the whole vote. Lets say there is a cranky guy in the parliament and he vote all the lousy policy. He already have a 3% pursuasion power if there is only 33 people. In the case of 100 people, he only have 1 %. The more people there r, the more likely the people inside follow normal distribution and thus can come out with policy tat r of value.<br><br>Now it is your turn to show why do lesser people inside the MP is a good thing ?<br><br></div>

But if other countries who have plants that generate electricity like us and managed to keep their electricity rates low, I don't understand why we cannot. Electricity generation from fuel is minimal. I don't know the efficiency. Do you know? It could be as high as 95% for all we know. </blockquote>Com'on, the water cycle is impossible to generate 95% efficiency. U need to boil the water, make it go high pressure before it can turn the turbine. The escape water itself have heat and tis energy is obviously wasted. The boiler itself is heated up and heat also lost to the environment through convection and radiation. If I am not wrong, the efficiency never go beyond 70%. Furthermore, electricity going down to your home is again not 100% efficient. The copper wire heat up, the electricity leaks etc.<br><br>A power plant cost about 500 million. So tis cost have to come down to the consumers. Furthermore how about the transportation ?

Next you will be asking we pay higher food charges to support the army. What is the connection here? I don't see the relevance. If you think that it's because of other investments overseas. Why don't you research on it and prove it (with references to sites)? Instead of maybe they made 100% return on equity from overseas investments, these are unsubstantiated points, useless to me. Maybe next time you tell me higher phone charges so that we can have better roads. Not related and not relevant. </blockquote>As said, u r not paying a substantial amount for utility. It is not enough to generate enough income to cover the gov expenditure or the tax from land etc. U think u spend a lot but in the grand scale of a country, it is little compared with the overall expenditure.<br><br><blockquote>When you reclaim land, obviously there is a reason (financial or otherwise). When they reclaim land, they sell it to the highest bidder to develop projects. Unless people behave like you, reclaim land for fun and laughter, then inflate price of HDB apartments to make flats more expensive. Would you waste money to dig a hole in your backyard for no reason? I'd like to reiterate again, cost of land to he goverment is zero!!! There is an opportunity cost for the land, but then opportunity cost is not a real cost in terms of public housing development. </blockquote>Com'on, your points r getting more and more low class and u r adding in insults to your points. Singapore reclaim land. Singapore pay to reclaim land. It released land from other areas of singapore (if no reclamation, factories may set up in previously residential area). The cost of land is not zero.<br><br><blockquote>http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html<br><br>http://federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm </blockquote>I still do not see why u say the gov bond is giving compound interest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Can u show me the evidence tat bond give compound interest and not interest on the principle<br><br>following your suggestion, in the worse scenario<br><br>1950: 1 US$ = sing$3.06<br>2007: 1 US$ = sing$1.53<br><br>If interest is not compunded u get US 3.5 million back.

Consolidating all your 1/2/3 rooms with 4/5 rooms Executive flats and labelling them as well off, is your strategy of side winding the facts again. </blockquote>80% of population living in HDB not enough for u yah ?
