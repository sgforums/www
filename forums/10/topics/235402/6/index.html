We may disagree with some of their policies but on the whole, the ruling party is a far safer pair of hands to entrust the future of this nation. We are not averse to risks, but we are not reckless. As investors, we are prepared to take some risks for higher potential returns, such as the move into the biomedical industry. But we are not prepared to gamble away our future prosperity to put this country into the hands of those who would not even respect our freedom to hold a different opinion.<br><br></div>

Yet you dare to make such bold statements unsupported by any shred of evidence. Just because the majority of Singaporeans choose to support the ruling party election after election does not mean they are brainwashed. It means we are not easily swayed by your vitriolic attacks on the government. We may disagree with some of their policies but on the whole, the ruling party is a far safer pair of hands to entrust the future of this nation. We are not averse to risks, but we are not reckless. As investors, we are prepared to take some risks for higher potential returns, such as the move into the biomedical industry. But we are not prepared to gamble away our future prosperity to put this country into the hands of those who would not even respect our freedom to hold a different opinion.<br><br></div></blockquote>You don't have the guts nor the eyes to admit that the current Govt has failed numerous times nor are able to justify that their hands in indeed the safest hands, other than yanking out the history book/propaganda book and point like a little child all the good stuff LKY and his ministers did decades ago. If by anything, the older bunch of ministers who have since retired were far more competent than the current batch of ministers, who have bungled up countless times and do their best to cover it up.</div>

Let's start with the list of bungles:<br><br>1. Visiting Taiwan before he was appointed PM and starting off a fracas with China. Great foreign policy job eh?<br><br>2. SARS incident. Contrary to popular opinion, the initial stages of the SARS incident was a great bungle. It should not be any surprise that Lim Hng Kiang got demoted to a less public position in the cabinet. Who do you think screwed up?<br><br>3. The indecision over the SAT scores. Great job with the university entry requirements. Flip flop even when they knew that the SAT system was due for review causing countless students trouble, and not to mention wasted cash. Well done.<br><br>4. The sudden surge into Biotech could be construed as policy failure. Why? The PAP refused to accord adequate funding to research for years and now there's a sudden need for researchers. If they have been funding research in the Sciences for years, there would have been no need to suddenly inject billions just to get it up and running. As it is right now, the fruits will not be seen for decades. Plus, the lack of support in research merely drove away some of the brightest in Singapore over to the US and UK.<br><br>5. The NKF. Great job with transparency and the Health Ministry failed to notice the irregularities and allowed themselves to be dictated to by Durai. Well done again.<br><br>6. Why on earth is LKY still in cabinet? On one hand says we need new blood in the cabinet, and other hand, we still have him freaking 70 year old blood up there. Worse, he gave himself the title "MM". What? The current batch of ministers still need baby sitting?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>7.  Suzhou industrial project. Possibly the biggest blunder in decades, not to mention one of the most well covered up incidents. The project was worth millions but then they failed to take into account local politics and the project became a blunder of epic proportions with the Govt getting out with a loss and sold off its stake in the project. God knows how much money was lost. More interestingly, the figures were never released, though analysts speculate that the loss could be in the order of a hundred million at least.<br><br>Do I really need to go on digging?</div>
