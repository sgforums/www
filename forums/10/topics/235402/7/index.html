            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for the bumping up of this thread and I really have to clarify that I only read the first and last page of this thread. Here r some of my thinkings regarding the issues<br><br>Firstly by looking at the last page of tis thread, I find a lot of verbal abuses on oxford mushroom particularly. For some of the posters here, the verbal abuse seems to span more than half of the reply they made... Tis is particularly unhealthy for discussion and I find tat similar in many ways on how the PAP act. They silence opposition and mudsling them, some posters here silence and mudsling opposition as well. Have they become the people they hate themselves ? Or tis is just naturally due to the heat of discussion, similar to heated discussion and passion on politics and how PAP deal with CSJ ? In any case replies can be refered by the points and they and less on the person tat say it<br><br>On the issue of feedback, I tend to agree tat the gov should treat opposition more leeway and seek their opinion more. But if u ask whether have they opened up more after Lee Hsien Long, I tend to agree with tat statement. But they may not "open up" for opposition, they "open up" for population here. In many decision they do hear wat the population say such as casino where there is a lengthy decision making process and the polticians do address issues make by the population. According to them they seek the pros and cons and hear opinions before deciding to go ahead. On hanging of the australian guy, they do seek feedback and come out with statistic tat singaporean prefer the existence of the death penalty. And surprisingly for the last election, no opposition is sued till bankrupt. The past previous elections someone is bound to be sued. I think there r signs tat the country is opening up. Has it opened up enough is another question<br><br>On the problems singapore population faces, I got to ask is it the problem of capitalism problem or is it the problem of politician here ? On the first page robertteh mention public housing earns a profit based on construction cost, and not look at land cost. Now which city in the world offer free land for housing for the poorer people ? Do Shanghai give free land for housing ? Neh... Do tokyo give free land for housing ? Much worse... Do New York give free land for housing ? Nope. Do our neighbour KL give free land ? Also no. All these cities that were mentioned r bigger than singapore themselves and they all charge a high price for the land. All gov consider their land as their precious resources and seek to earn tax from it. In a way it is good since the people who own more land, less efficient with land and stay in a good location generally pay more tax than others. Tis is not the problem of singapore, every city faces tis problem. It is the problem of capitalism.<br><br>About whether should we have the idea of "scholars" and emphasis on study result, I think to be fair, wat other telltale signs do we have when we want to employ a good person ? Tat is why generally education level and having a good CV land u in a better job isn't it ? Don't look at the public sector, look at the private sector. Most of them still look at education level. We cannot blame parents for pushing their children to study hard, and we cannot solely push the blame to gov and not to the companies here as well. Talking about Bill gates or other successful people, it is true tat there r such talents. But then again bill gates himself still use education qualification as a gauge in recruiting people <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>http://www.microsoft.com/college/ft_salesmktgsvcs.mspx<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Qualifications:<br>Â• BA in Business, Information Technology, Information Science, Computer Engineering, or Computer Science required<br>Â• MCSE, MCT, or MOUS certification helpful<br>Â• Presentation experience and Microsoft product and business knowledge desired. </span><br><br>Anyway I probably not going into tis discussion again after tis reply. I think tis is too time consuming and too bad I am not paid to do tis  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Just some points on the other side of the fence to reflect.</div>

OM has consistently not backed up his arguments and in the rules of debate, that can be regarded both as disrespectful and dishonest. Hammering him for not backing his arguments is a direct end result.<br><br>Go read some of the other threads where OM was involved and see his high handedness in debates and you will understand the level of consternation with regard with debating with him.</div>
