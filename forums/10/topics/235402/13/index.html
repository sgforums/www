I have always give out points and logic in my discussion. But for yours, almost all your reply just border a one line statement "Why gov make life so hard for us". It is an emotional statement but it does not make it a debatable or have any argument in it. When I cite tat singapore is the country tat have the highest quality living in asia, u repeat "why gov make life so hard for us". When I tell u the social problems of charging free for land, u repeat "why gov make life so hard for us". WHen I tell u suzhou earn money, u repeat "why gov make life so hard for us".

I quote "U can waste air by breathing more air if u want". I would rather they tax from income.

An obvious problem is too few MP will result in weaker brainstorming, detection of problems and questioning of policies. If we have too little MPs, we may face problems because each MP has too large a stake in the whole vote. Lets say there is a cranky guy in the parliament and he vote all the lousy policy. He already have a 3% pursuasion power if there is only 33 people. In the case of 100 people, he only have 1 %. The more people there r, the more likely the people inside follow normal distribution and thus can come out with policy tat r of value.<br><br>Now it is your turn to show why do lesser people inside the MP is a good thing ?<br><br></div></blockquote>Since when have you proved that a few hundred senators have come out with good policies? Did you cite any references or examples? Obviously when I suggested reducing the amount of repesentation in parliament to 50, it did not mean reducing it to "afew" as so stated by you. Have you not heard the proverbial "too many cooks spoil the broth"? I have proven my point that having 50 MPs that does the job of 84 MPs, there is a reduction in cost of 34 MPs. Since the formation of Singapore, the MPs was around that number, the number was increased to 84 MPs was the old man's way of maintaining his dominance. Simple logic, if you have 50 MPs, you would need 26 opposition MPs to form the government. But with an MP base of 84, you would need an opposition of 43 to form the government. You would need an extra 17 MPs to form the new government. With their techniques of stiffling the opposition, where would such numbers ever be possible.<br><br>Your logic bemuses me!!!<br>Are you trying to justify that maybe having 1,000 MPs in parliament is productive, because each MP will only carry a weightage of 0.1% repesentation? It can be shown that other developed countries like the UK, Korean, Taiwan and Hong Kong have a population to MP ratio of around 100,000 : 1, whereas Singapore maintains a population to MP ration of 50,000 : 1.<br><br>Following your logic and argument, statistically if you have 3% of non performing MPs in the population size of 33 MPs, statistically with 100 MPs, the non performing size of MPs will increase to 100 x 3% = 3. With 3 more non performing MPs, won't that lead to more mayhem?<br><br>Having 84 MPs farting to the same tune Beethoven's 5th Symphony is no different than having 50 MPs farting to the same tune of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. The 84 MPs or 50 MPs has the same conductor.</div>

This should never be happening, condominiums (in the past) used to be for those who can afford to be staying in multi-million dollar units, now with prices as low as $500,000, people are taking the options of paying slightly more for the condominium unit and giving up their HDB flats.<br><br>Should land prices be kept high for private developers, the exclusitivity of condominium units would remain thus keeping the prices of private developments high.

Tis policy is good for people who like to live in condo and not HDB. Furthermore for the same size at same location, HDB is still comfortably 2 times cheaper.<br><br></div>

It is only relevant when u can't breath the air around u and tat is when pollution become drastically serious. Now it is not the case and u r just bullsh!ting your way through<br><br><blockquote>Firstly, these countries have large MPs or representation is because these countries have a large population, going by the yardstick of 100,000 : 1 (population to MP) from UK, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Naturally with a larger population you will have a larger representation. Lousy policies? First you tell us that some of these countries provide welfare and are in dire consequence, then you ask me to justify if these countries made bad policies. Goes to show, having a large MP representation does not necessary produce good policies. </blockquote>They have large population and have large MP. And they work fine. U want a very small group of people like 40 to come out with singapore policy. Tat is not fine. I am talking about system. U can think about PAP farting or anything but the point we r debating is the system, not PAP. The question is whether does a small group of MPs cost problem such as brainstorming etc which u never mention. U just want to blast PAP. U r not here to talk about whether is more MP good or bad. U r just not sincere and u do not know how to read.<br></div>

More MP doesn't mean good, less MP doesn't mean bad. If you think more MP is good, then we should have 1,000 MP, but the policies will be the same. Why? Simple, because some things are not within a mortal's grasp. You cannot fight a wave of Tsunami, you can only run.

Even their plan to reduce CPF contribution for employee, I thought of it last election ago, I am not even a graduate.<br><br>Remember to show me the calculation for the price of the bond.

I don't understand this statement, maybe you can shed some light and help me understand. </blockquote>U put 100, next year u get 118. Then the interest is compounded 1.18*118 which is 139.24. So u can guess tis is much better than putting in yur bond thing<br><br><blockquote>Of the portfolio Temasek has, 44% are companies based in Singapore. Shareholder equity of Temasek is around $90 billion, Singapore Power alone is $5 billion in equity. Singapore Power has return on equity of 26% in 2005.<br><br>Looking at the income statement is useless, when you don't know anything about the balance sheet</blockquote>Com'on, the report show its expenditure and income. Global make a loss, but other companies made a killing. Overall they make money. Get it ?<br><br><blockquote>Can you tell me who is the ultimate shareholder of Temasek? Who gets all those dividends and capital gains(if there are any at all)? </blockquote>Tis shows u know nothing of Temasek. There is only 1 shareholder. The gov. ANd the dividend goes directly into the budget<br><br><blockquote>1) The example you provide was a country with low tax and a country with high tax. Say maybe Singapore (low tax) and China (high tax).<br><br>2) You showed that the company operating in the country with high tax (China) will never move to Singapore despite it's low tax rate, else it would make losses. </blockquote>3) My example prove tat for some investors like company A, they will invest in singapore rather than china because of the low tax.<br><br>4) It concludes tat singapore tax rate manage to pull in investors which has earn much more profit compard with the use of labour<br><br>U r wasting my time to guide u every step of the analysis<br><br><blockquote>Like I said the intra company is used to inflate prices. I already rebutted all your points, you go search all my posting to find it. All you gave was army has cost, police has cost, etc. But these cost are already provided for in taxes. There is no connection between housing and these services. I gave you example of company producing clothing and TV, if clothing is making a loss, do you pass the cost of your clothing to your TV? There is no connection at all!!! </blockquote>I think u felt money drop from the sky. Now gov have money from tax and land. Lets give it a figure of 70-30. If u remove the land charge of 30, then gov is left with 70 of its original revenue. He have to find other ways and means to get back tis 30 %. I have already told u 1 million and 1 times tat if u deprive the gov from taxing from land, then have to find other means to get back the money<br><br><blockquote>Another example, say you have a company doing graphic design and you teach part time tuition. You cannot cover your cost in doing graphic design. Do you go and tell your students you need to increase 100% of their fees so that you can cover your graphic design business? Makes no sense, or it's nonsense. </blockquote>Don't do graphic design lah !<br><br><blockquote>You said nobody would buy that silly product. How fast you change your words</blockquote>I didn't change the word. I am illustrating to u how many silly products r there and u cannot rely on the silliest of them all to give an argument.<br><br><blockquote>I am not bull**@!ting, it's just you have a very narrow perspective of the world. Pollution is a big issue with global warming now!!! Haven't you noticed the freaky weather patterns around the world? That's why the Kyoto Proctocol was aimed at reducing emssions. </blockquote>Pollution is a problem BUT IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR BREATHING NOW. GET IT ? NO COUNTRY PEOPLE CANNOT BREATH BY JUST BREATHING<br><br><blockquote>If you run a company, your company has a small sales figure(tax from small population like Singapore), you can work with 50 managers (salary of managers). You want 84 managers so that the other 34 managers can shake leg and get money? Have you shown that policies made by these 84 managers are better than those made by 50 managers? I have already shown that with the reduction in 34 managers, it will result in cost savings to the company. PAP is the system! I guess we have another party sharing the government? Small group of people cost more problems? Obviously you haven't been managing people. Is it easier to manage a group of 1,000 or manage a group of 100? I am not against them, I used to support their policies afew elections back, but I find that their policies are abit self defeating and self promoting. More MP doesn't mean good, less MP doesn't mean bad. If you think more MP is good, then we should have 1,000 MP, but the policies will be the same. Why? Simple, because some things are not within a mortal's grasp. You cannot fight a wave of Tsunami, you can only run. Likewise, having more MPs does not help the situation, because it only increase the burden on tax payers. Even their plan to reduce CPF contribution for employee, I thought of it last election ago, I am not even a graduate. </blockquote>U see, u r making an assumption tat the job can be hande adequately by 50 and not by 84 people. All the other "companies" have more than a few hundred and they r "earning great profits with great policies" showing great management. If u felt tat 50 is enough, maybe u can show an example of great "companies" with 50 or lesser people ?<br><br>U can say it lower the cost, but by how much ? by 0.01% of the company profit ? In exchange of wat ? Ideas and contributions ? It can be the idea tat make singapore many times richer u know<br><br>There r some things tat r out of human grasp, but most of them r within control. U cannot control tsunamis, but u can have planning wat happen when disaster struck and wat should be the plan to seek assistance etc. They r critical<br></div>

U buy a bond, lets say 1,000,000 for 10 years and 5%. Every year, they will give u 5% cash in coupons. So every year u get 50,000. At the end of the 10 year, they give u your coupon as well as your original 1,000,000 back. So altogether u earn 500,000<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corporate bonds are sold in the same way as shares - a company issues a number of bonds equivalent to the total amount of money it wants to borrow. The issuer sells the bond to a group of investment banks which then sell them on to individual investors. Here are a few definitions:<br><br>- The issuer is the borrower.<br><br>- The principal is the face value of the bond (ie, the capital amount being lent or borrowed).<br><br>- The coupon is a fancy name for the amount of interest paid each year as a percentage of the principal.<br><br>- The maturity date is when all the capital must be paid back.<br><br>- The yield might sound like the same thing as the coupon, but is very different. Because of interest rate changes, market competition and fashion, the capital value of a bond will vary between issue date and maturity. The coupon, however, does not. A 10 per cent coupon on a bond at face value of Â£100 will produce interest of Â£10. If the bond falls in value to only Â£80, the interest paid will still be Â£10 but the yield (Â£10 interest as a return on Â£80 of current value) will now be 12.5 per cent.<br><br>- The redemption yield takes account of both the coupon and the potential for capital gain between now and maturity (in the above case another Â£20). It can become more complicated than this simple example, but is the measure most used by the professionals in assessing value when buying and selling.</span><br><br>Your example give a very strange type of bond, called the zero coupon bond where they give no coupon, or not interest after a period. Tis zero coupon bond means u give 1,000,000 to buy the bond. U get nothing in between and at the time it matures, like 10 years, they give u 1,800,000 for example.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_coupon_bond" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_coupon_bond</a><br><br>U don't even know wat is bond, and u dare to give such as thing as compounded bond. <strong>The whole point of the discussion is r there any compounded interest for bond, and u found none, and u invent out your own compound bond.</strong> I can't believe u...</div>

It is a totally waste of time.<br><br>To SIS, you are right about the nature of the bond, but if the investors use the money received from the couple to reinvest in bond, you can get back compounded interest. However it may also means you will never get back your full capital and interest<br><br>To maurizio13, strictly speaking the nature of the bond is not compound interest.
