In a way, he was not totally wrong in pushing for his own rewards to keep up with what is happening in GLCs and the public sector's method of self-rewards.<br><br>SBS therefore has to keep raising their fares at the expense of the public commuters and tax payers because of such self-reward schemes instituted through corporatization under the Goh Keng Swee doctrine - push up salaries to upgrade the economy to value-adding model.<br><br>Major mistakes have been made by our political leaders in assuming that Singapore public sector was underpaid not knowing that by the 1980s, public sector sinecure managers who do not worry about profits or where the funds are coming from were paid three times that of equivalent positions in the private sector.<br><br>A Car Park division director was paid more than S$10,000.00 pm when private car park operator could only pay their equivalent manager only S$5,000.00 pm at the most.<br><br>So if you want proof, we do have plenty. Look at teacher's pay of S$8,000 pm as compared with adjunct teacher (relief) of S$100 per day.<br><br>The whole salary scheme for public sector has been screwed up on some wrong assumptions of the past and yet our leaders do not want to admit such fundamental errors of government.</div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><strong>''Durai would not be wrong in thinking that he should be paid likewise.

Called the 'new media capabilities group', it executes the strategies.<br><br>Both were set up after last year's General Election. Aside from politicians, some 20 IT-savvy party activists are also involved.<br><br>When contacted, Mr Baey declined to give details of the group's activities, but he outlined the broad principles of the initiative.<br><br>It was necessary for the PAP to have a voice in cyberspace as there were few in the online community who were pro-establishment, he said.<br><br>As such, the committees aim to 'observe how new media is developing and see how we can use the new media as part of the overall media landscape', he added.<br><br>'How do we facilitate views that are pro-party and propagate them through the Internet?'<br><br>The approach reflects comments by Rear-Admiral (NS) Lui at the PAP's party conference in December. He called on younger activists to put up views 'to moderate the vitriol and balance the skewed comments' on the Internet.<br><br>But this can only work if activists are not 'too obvious' about it, Mr Baey said yesterday. Otherwise it comes across as 'propaganda'.<br><br>'The identity is not important. It is the message that is important,' he added.<br><br>One activist who is involved said that when posting comments on online forums and the feedback boxes of blogs, he does not identify himself as a PAP member.<br><br>He tracks popular blogs and forums to 'see if there is anything we can clarify' on hot-button topics such as the impending hike in the Goods and Services Tax.<br><br>But he added: 'We don't rebut everything. Sometimes, what is said is fair enough, and we send the feedback on to the committee.'<br><br>This latest initiative comes on top of a blog site with posts by 12 MPs born after Singapore's Independence in 1965.<br><br>It recognises that more younger Singaporeans are relying on the new media as a main source of information.<br><br>An Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) study conducted last year found that younger and better-educated Singaporeans relied on information from the Internet when shaping their voting choices at the last GE.<br><br>Among the opposition parties, members and supporters of the Workers' Party, in particular, post regularly on forums online.<br><br>But IPS senior research fellow Tan Tarn How wonders about the effectiveness of the PAP's campaign.<br><br>He said Internet users who post on forums such as Sammyboy tend not to be interested in 'intellectual debate' and so will not be persuaded by PAP activists anyway.<br><br>As for more serious-minded bloggers, he said the views that the activists may put out are already available in the mainstream media.<br><br>xueying@sph.com.sg </div></blockquote>I got a few salient points from this article:-<br><br>1) PAP hates anti-PAP people who post anonymously, but yet is more than willing to let its own people post anonymously. Isn't that hypocritical? Perhaps they are afraid that they might get sued for defamation?<br><br>2) "When you can't beat them, join them". A brilliant new slogan indeed. So the govt now realizes that no amount of Amendments to the Constitution or to the ISA or the Computer Misuse Act and no degree of (mal)application of the Sedition Act or the Defamation Act will calm down the online dissent. Good for them to know that! At last they are waking up... a little. But it's kind of sad that they are trying to reform cyberspace, rather than take the road less travelled (for them that is) of sincere self-examination. Shame to teh P-65 MPs too, who are merely giving freshness in terms of hardware, not software. This demonstrates how truely cut off from their other generation-mates they are.<br><br>3) I do wonder what they consider to be "fair'. But the more important question is: Does the committee listen, or is it just a dud?<br><br>4) I never thought of it this way before, but in this context cheers to the resolve of Sammyboy!!<br><br>5) IPS studying voting patterns ... now what does that suggest? PAP trying to copycat WP??<br><br>the (far more objective than any P65 MP) pikamaster</div>

As a consequence from such cartel, many people were made to pay exceptionally high and punitive premium especially after a claim has been made.<br><br>Owing to recessions, opening up of the market, finally the government was pressured to give up such self-protectionism.<br><br>However, government today is getting into banking and finance businesses.<br><br>Now after the Asian Financial crisis government was given the excuse to restructure the financial system. It took advantage of the situation to protect its own banking privileges by similar cartel-like protectionism allowing banks to charge loan-shark interest rates against the working people so that its own government banks like DBS could charge penalty fees and loan-shark interest rates.<br><br>Because of government own self-interests are at stake, citibanks and american express continue to be sheltered in protectionism being allowed together with DBS to charge penalty interest for late payment and card interest rates at 16-20%.<br><br>This is the sort of self-interests which are now affecting all our people. Like the insurance cartel being forced to give up their premium protection, eventually people must again rise up to the occasion and be vigilant against such protectionism of self-interests and ask government to stop all its own malpractices to protect their own business and other related interest which is basically wrong doings which must be changed by opening up to market practice.<br>Back to top<br>View user's profile Send private message Visit poster's website</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let it be clear once and for all.<br><br><strong>PAP is not Singapore. A party is a party, Singapore is a nation far greater than any single political party or non-ideology that it practises.</strong><br><br>If the PAP falls from power one day, SO BE IT. That would be a natural result of some exercise in participatory democracy and a consequence of public opinion.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I believe that our institutions are not so cheap and useless as to be unable to withstand a change in a ruling party. Any such eventuality will only prove the amenable stupidity of trying to tweak and zhng a more-or-less working Westminster system that was inherited from the British. We claim to be First World, but we are told that our little city-state cannot survive a change in political administration.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Capitalism tells us one thing, that human beings will not act to destroy their rice bowl, therefore any alternative party would find it in their best interests to keep Singapore running smooth too. Reject the fear-mongering and think rationally for once.<br><br>If the people can and will be decided that more of the PAP's policies are irrelevant to Singapore and Singaporeans in the future, then just too bad. Too fcuking bad. This is a nation, and the people have to realise that it is their own future they are messing with.<br><br>Choose wisely and let not prior track records nor promises from anyone single-handedly guide your way. Like they say in a football final,  the form book goes out of the window.<br><br>This latest move by the PAP shows that they have belatedly realised that they are seriously disconnected from the ground, and that if nothing is done to meet what we want, they will be irrelevant one day, and there will be a prospective future where more new "leaders" are full of misplaced optimism and faith in their ability through being untested because there will still be a sizeable electorate number who will vote without thinking, and merely do so on autopilot.<br><br>That will spell doom for Singapore because there will be less of reality in our politics, much less a semblance of actual representation of the people's interests as opposed to constructvistic opinions on what the people's opinions should be, or inferred from.</div>
