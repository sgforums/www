            <div class='col-md body'>PM LEE HSIEN LOONG CNY MESSAGE : PRESERVE THE FAMILY UNIT<br><br>Yes, we people agree that family unit is important. But the picture of family unit disintegrating painted by PM Lee and several MPs are one-sided putting the blame squarely on the people.<br><br>Who is the biggest culprit causing breakdown of family unit? Is it culture? Is it the rat race? Why so many problems affecting our society despite all the so-called successes like the GDP growth of 7% pa. I would think that if we are that successful, there would not be so many suicides and dispossessions of homes under our low-cost public housing schemes/<br><br>So my new-year message is different from PM Lee's. I am hoping that PM Lee will not govern the country like his predecessors - taxing and recovering all possible costs and keeping taxes as surpluses to be spent on shin corp or souzhou and encouraging over-spending on durai talents they were proud of on extravagant projects or self-rewarding themselves and their cronies.<br><br>If PM Kee sincerely believes that Singapore should preserve the family unit to avoid welfarism, then the first tasks he should attend to after the Chinese New Year should be:-<br><br>(1) stop all the current double-charging and over-charging by all the ministries and stop all the creative accounting which drive up family household expenditure currently to above S$1,000.00 which are too much for the families to stay peaceful and together.<br><br>Until and unless the government corrects the fundamental error of governing the country based on current income and expenditure format which allow ministries to hoard taxes as hidden profits and surpluses, the government will wrongly claim its incomes from revenues are not enough to meet certain costs.<br><br>(2) Include incomes from land sales, capital gains from surpluses, extra revenues from IR and COEs and car parks and HDB flat sales (at market prices less discounts) in 2008 budget so that before raising taxes and recovering more fees, we could call see how true is the so-called deficits or expenditures behind all the presentations in raising fees and charges.<br><br>Government should not give inaccurate or creative accounts if it does not want to raise more GST and recover all possible costs as their actions will break up more families.<br><br>So it is of no use for PM Lee to talk about building family unit until he walks the talk himself.<br><br>Now more and more families are being broken up now because of inability by family to pay for all the rising costs and hidden surplus accumulations by all ministries and GLCs imposed by our monopoly utility companies, hospitals, public transport, etc.<br><br>I foresee that the government like in the past will refuse to admit this as their fundamental policy error and it will continue to use the media to tell the people about globalization to distract their attention to their most unfair method of governing a country.<br><br>I foresee all the ministries and its GLCs will continue to say that their current incomes are not enough and will have to raise fees again using creative accounts which allow them to increase taxes and fees to meet so-called deficits which are not true at all if we look closely.</div>

I believe more people will apply if the pay is better and a better candidate can be chosen. Notice tat politics is still nevertheless a job. So if u get a $100,000 job now will u go to help gov and take a $20,000 job ? If u have $3000 dollar job now will u get a paycut and apply for a $1500 job to help gov ?<br><br><blockquote>You yourself admitted that most people don't some will. We want those Some people not most people. Soil is more than gold which one is more precious?</blockquote>Given lesser candidate to choose from, the people chosen is likely not to be capable and the country will implement lousy policy. Then overall the whole country suffers. Ideal and realistic situation differs.</div>
