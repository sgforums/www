The reason I defend most government policies is because I agree with them, unlike the many here who are against everything the government does.<br><br>The PAP will never change the mind of the brainless die-hards who are against them regardless of what they do. But putting the record straight and pointing out the other side of the argument is useful for the many who would otherwise hear a biased opinion.<br><br>There are hypocrites aplenty in this forum. Libertarians who claim to espouse freedom of expression are also the ones who criticize the government for not muzzling Thaksin. I strongly disagree with the government's handling of the Thaksin affair, because national interests should come before civil liberties. Yet these leftists haven't any guts to oppose me for denigrating civil liberties and freedom of expression. They talk about how we should be sensitive to the Thais (as I do), but suddenly civil liberties do not matter any longer. Because they are so consumed with hatred and bias against the ruling party, they have suddenly shifted to the right, just for this affair <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> What credibility is there?<br><br>To tell you the truth: on the whole, I was more critical of the government than supportive of its policies when I first came to this forum. Reading the biased vitriol of the anti-government postings here have swung me to the other side. These people have spooked me into serious concern as to what might happen if the ruling party loses at the polls to these jokers. The future prosperity of the nation cannot be compromised.<br><br>So what if I support most government policies? Surely having a different opinion from the loads of anti-government propaganda I read here is essential in any balanced political discourse? But no, supporters of the Opposition have shown that they are only capable of personal attacks and vulgarities. If they continue along this path, it is not surprising that the ruling party will continue to win at the polls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've always been one to appreciate your contributions to this forum, Mushroom. Not very agreeable at most times, but definitely engaging and in some way constructive.<br><br>I disagree with you terming the forumities here 'hypocrites' on the basis that some of their ideas contradict their believe system. I think that instead of exalting yourself upon a moral high ground, you should, like the counter-cyber-insurgency movement consider why people are so pissed off with everything around them. There is a reason I'm certain and I think many of them just do not except the excuse that this is how life is suppose to be. I'm certain that this government could do more to address several isues that people have brought up here, not that all are credible and need for redress. So do me a favor Oxford Mushroom, next time you respond to a fellow forumite, try to put urself in his shoes, not everyone is perched upon high like you and your contemporaries.<br><br>If we all could just see beyond status, but that was not how this world was constructed, I guess we can only try to make it better.</div>

Without such respect, the government will not be supported even though its leaders succeed in passing many laws, win votes due to ignorance of people or through tinkering with election system like the GRC, or win many defamation cases in their courts.<br><br>The lack of virtue can be seen in the following policies and actions:-<br><br>(1) Recommend and vote for their own salary jumps and bonuses using artful argument and fallacious salary comparison tables (as seen in NKF)<br><br>(2) Interfering with feedbacks of citizens by prohibiting the media from publishing certain letters and removing newspaper ceos for certain articles published about sensitive incidents<br><br>(3) Running a government based on taxing and recovering all costs from citizens thereby allowing taxes to be accumulated to glorify their own achievements.<br><br>(4) Passing laws and using power of government not for the benefit of the people but only their own purposes e.g. disallowing elected ex-president Ong Teng Cheong to uncover the hidden surpluses and assets in various statutory boards and GLCs, to bring about greater accountability and transparency in investments by GIC and Temasek overseas etc, hoarding surpluses, and continuing to raise taxes including dubious double-charge on lands already owned by citizens in sale of public housing, increase taxes and approving all kinds of fee increases, and pointing to reserves and surpluses and say that these are their success and pay themselves the highest salaries and bonuses, recover all possible costs through corporatisation thereby driving up the costs of living and causing job losses by the thousands.<br><br>We invite minister Lui Tuck Yew to correct our views on the above-stated lack of virtue so that we will change our opinions about the government if we are wrong.</div>

The last time I heard about this self-invitation is that I need to be accepted by the mp (Minister Lui) through a period of pupilage as a pap member. My reply is: as my intention is to offer my service to take part in such debates, so their normal procedures relating to pap members should be waived. There is no change of mind on their part so I am still not admitted to such debate forums. From here we all could conclude that PM Lee is not serious in robust debates with non-conformist activists.</div>

The reason I defend most government policies is because I agree with them, unlike the many here who are against everything the government does.<br><br>The PAP will never change the mind of the brainless die-hards who are against them regardless of what they do. But putting the record straight and pointing out the other side of the argument is useful for the many who would otherwise hear a biased opinion.<br><br>There are hypocrites aplenty in this forum. Libertarians who claim to espouse freedom of expression are also the ones who criticize the government for not muzzling Thaksin. I strongly disagree with the government's handling of the Thaksin affair, because national interests should come before civil liberties. Yet these leftists haven't any guts to oppose me for denigrating civil liberties and freedom of expression. They talk about how we should be sensitive to the Thais (as I do), but suddenly civil liberties do not matter any longer. Because they are so consumed with hatred and bias against the ruling party, they have suddenly shifted to the right, just for this affair <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> What credibility is there?<br><br>To tell you the truth: on the whole, I was more critical of the government than supportive of its policies when I first came to this forum. Reading the biased vitriol of the anti-government postings here have swung me to the other side. These people have spooked me into serious concern as to what might happen if the ruling party loses at the polls to these jokers. The future prosperity of the nation cannot be compromised.<br><br>So what if I support most government policies? Surely having a different opinion from the loads of anti-government propaganda I read here is essential in any balanced political discourse? But no, supporters of the Opposition have shown that they are only capable of personal attacks and vulgarities. If they continue along this path, it is not surprising that the ruling party will continue to win at the polls. </div></blockquote>To balance of what?  Balance for them to become richer? fark <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
