            <div class='col-md body'>I think its heaven's fault. Just kidding.......<br><br>Basically, the PAP started this political problem of fear.<br><br>But it is also due to this -- when each individual ask himself "PAP or opposition?", going for PAP seems 10 times easier on the heart than going for opposition.<br><br>So, those who think of going for PAP will join it officially and uprightly, or join grassroots. Those who thinking of going for opposition, very few will take the step and the rest will not do it in the end, stay away or decide to join PAP when they are told they can 'change from within' only to be disappointed and go back to staying away. For the voters, it takes 10 times the mental effort to vote for opposition than PAP.<br><br>So when individually when individuals hold such difference in consideration of joining PAP or opposition, collectively it will mirror the myriad individual phenomenons. The collective result will be the distinction in strength between PAP and opposition.<br><br>The only way is for Singaporeans to stop looking at or around for opposition people, supporters, voters etc. and be one himself. Then they will discover that there will always be others like themselves for them, and people will all emerge to be there for each other.<br><br>EmptyCage</div>
