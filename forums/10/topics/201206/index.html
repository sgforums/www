But we also need to act in a pragmatic manner and have the will and courage to implement our own policies," he said.<br><br>"However, I do not have any intention to copy Singapore's policy directives as the SAR has its own specialities and merits that need to be addressed."<br><br>One of the examples he cited was the market-competitive salaries offered by the Singapore government to lure talented people into the administration.<br><br>"When they were trying to attract talented people from the business sector and from non-government organisations, the difficulties faced by the Singapore government were quite different when compared with those of the SAR.<br><br>"The salary gap between the business and political sectors was not as enormous there as it is in Hong Kong."<br><br>Tsang also said he had no intention of raising salary levels for civil servants and politically appointed officials in Hong Kong.<br><br>Tsang, who also spent 45 minutes with Teo Chee Hean, second assistant secretary-general at Singapore's ruling People's Action Party, said he was also impressed with the way the city-state's government groomed political talent.<br><br>"I was told the ruling party is now recruiting talented people who were born after Singapore's independence in 1965. This shows a long-term vision to political continuity and stability," he said.<br><br>Asked whether he would follow Singapore in establishing a democratic base to serve as a foundation for effective governance in Hong Kong, Tsang said that while both places shared a similar legal system, there were still differences in values and the degree of freedom in the two cities.<br><br>But, in answer to both former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang, who said she hoped the SAR government could offer a definite date for the introduction of universal suffrage, and former security chief Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, who said the prerequisites for universal suffrage were inadequate, Tsang said parties, political groups and others who wished to express opinions should make detailed proposals.<br><br>"We should use the coming months to raise detailed proposals. I'm very pleased to address every proposal raised by politicians. This can also offer more choices to the people," he said.<br><br>He said a government committee was now working on the best way for Hong Kong to become fully democratic. The proposal should be finished next year and he will try to get it approved by lawmakers and by Beijing.<br><br>On the proposed goods and services tax, he stressed public views would not be ignored and that it will not be imposed should there be strong opposition.<br><br>http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_print.asp?art_id=23104&amp;sid=8890532</div>
