            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Lotus,<br><br>I would say that PAP government has made an embarrassing blunder for this ASEAN summit.<br><br>They are afterall, not really politicians. If they allow peaceful protests by local Burmese outside the summit venue to put pressures on these leaders, I think the chances of having it Singapore's way would succeed!<br><br>It is such an irony actually.

On what moral grounds do PAP government has over other ASEAN members over the issues of "protests"?<br><br>Well, yes, the only difference is that Burma Junta uses brutal force against protestors but in Singapore's context, it is using "legal brutality" against those protestors.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lotus999:</div><div class="quote_body">i thought someone is supposed to be so talented, why the faux pas?<br><br>ASEAN discredited over Burma, analysts<br>Singapore's handling of meeting under question as leaders' wilted, say analysts.<br>AFP<br>Nov 22, 2007<br><br>Singapore - ASEAN's handling of the Burmese crisis has shattered the regional bloc's credibility and deeply embarrassed Singapore, the host of this week's southeast Asian summit, analysts and activists say.<br><br>In the run-up to the gathering, Burma's ASEAN partners - under pressure from the international community - appeared ready to press the junta to take concrete steps towards democracy.<br><br>Instead, bickering among the leaders marred the talks meant to focus on a landmark charter, and Rangoon, by blocking a special UN session on its bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests in September, emerged victorious.<br><br>Â“In terms of the handling of it, they made a mess of it,Â” said Trevor Wilson, a former Australian ambassador to Burma who is now a visiting fellow at the Australian National University.<br><br>Â“Given that people have a lot of questions in their own mind about how effective ASEAN is on political issues like this... to have made such a public gaffe doesn't do them a lot of good.Â”<br><br>The annual summit that ended on Wednesday was meant to be a celebration, with the 10-member bloc marking its 40th anniversary and signing its first charter aimed at turning the bloc into a more cohesive and influential force.<br><br>But with the world's attention on Burma and how ASEAN would handle its errant member, the bloc's apparent unity on the issue - it expressed Â“revulsionÂ” at the deadly violence there two months ago - quickly crumbled.<br><br>They clashed over Singapore's decision to invite UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari to brief leaders of ASEAN and their dialogue partners from Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea on the crisis.<br><br>Burmese Prime Minister Thein Sein refused to allow Mr Gambari to address the session and his ASEAN counterparts blinked, forcing Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to abide by his wishes and scrap the meeting.<br><br>Â“ASEAN's continued commitment to `non-interference' will tend to limit the capacity of member states to force others to adopt a uniform approach,Â” said Damien Kingsbury, an associate professor at the School of International and Political Studies at Australia's Deakin University.<br><br>Debbie Stothard, co-ordinator of the Bangkok-based Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma, called the move Â“particularly shockingÂ” in the wake of the bloc's condemnation of the junta before the UN after the crackdown.<br><br>Â“They've gone from revulsion to intimacy,Â” she said.<br><br>Summit host Mr Lee came under particular criticism for his handling of the Burma issue, which revealed deep divisions among ASEAN members, with The Philippines strongly criticising the regime and pressing for the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.<br><br>Â“It's a fatal sign of weakness especially when Singapore is seeking to assert itself not just on the regional stage but on the world stage as well,Â” said Ms Stothard.<br><br>In his defence, incoming ASEAN secretary-general Surin Pitsuwan of Thailand said Mr Lee's invitation to Mr Gambari had been made Â“with good intentionÂ” but Â“some members were not quite readyÂ” to go ahead with the briefing. - AFP </div></blockquote></div>

Like u say, 6 out of the 10 nations are not that democratic.<br><br>If anything, this serves to remind the world that ASEAN is just an ineffective organization.
