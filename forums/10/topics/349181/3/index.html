              <p>owl!!! that is so uncall for...as an opposition advocater and promoter, you should not behave in such a way, by scolding people mother so badly. You should lead by example with cool head and caring mind. No wonder many go for PAP, with such opposition followers, prepare for riots with axes and parangs when if opposition wins.</p>

              <p>According to some historians the riots were instigated by the british and Lim Yew Hock to serve as a pretext to destroy Lim Chin Siong. Lee Kuan Yew secretly connived with the British as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">The episode began when Chief Minister Lim closed
              				down a Chinese women's group and a musical association. A week
              				later, he banned the Chinese Middle School Union which provoked
              				further unhappiness with the locals.<br><br>Undeterred he
              				arrested Chinese student leaders and shut down more organizations
              				and schools, including the Chinese High School and the Chung
              				Cheng High School. Given the already tense situation between the
              				Chinese-speaking people and the colonial authorities, this was a
              				highly provocative act. <br><br>At that time any Singaporean
              				leader worth his salt could not have sat by idly. And so Lim Chin
              				Siong came to the fore and spoke up for the students. The late
              				Devan Nair, former Singapore president, joined in.<br><br>A
              				12-day stay-in was organised at one of the schools and Lim Chin
              				Siong was scheduled to speak at a nearby park one evening. <br><br>It
              				wasn't long before the police appeared and ringed the crowd.
              				Suddenly a mob started throwing stones at the police who then
              				charged with batons and tear-gas.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Violence erupted and
              				spread, with police stations being attacked and cars burned. By
              				the end of the chaos 2,346 people were arrested and more than a
              				dozen Singaporeans were killed. </strong></span><br><br>The blame <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>was squarely
              				pinned on Lim Chin Siong </strong></span>who was arrested.<br><br>But did Lim
              				Chin Siong really cause the mayhem?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Who was the "mob"
              				that started attacking the police?</strong></span><br><br>At that time, Chief
              				Minister Lim made no bones that the Lim Chin Siong was the front
              				man for the communists who had started the violence. Lim was
              				arrested by the Special Branch the following day. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lim
              				vehemently denied this accusation and countered that the chief
              				minister was a colonial stooge.</strong></span> As declassified documents now
              				reveal, Lim Chin Siong was largely right.<br><br>Entitled <em>Extract
              				from a note of a meeting between Secretary of State and Singapore
              				Chief Minister, 12 December 1956</em>, the archival note recorded
              				that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> it was Chief Minister Lim who "had provoked the riots
              				and this had enabled the detention of Lim Chin Siong."<br></strong></span><br>Poulgrain
              				even documents that full-scale military assistance was requested
              				by prior arrangement. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore Governor, William Goode,
              				acknowledged that the colonial government was not beyond
              				employing the tactic of provoking a riot and then using the
              				outcome to "achieve a desired political result."</strong></span><br><br>Indeed,
              				Poulgrain noted that "[Public Record Office] <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>documents show
              				these were the tactics of provocation that were employed in the
              				1956 riots that led to Lim Chin Siong's arrest." </strong></span><br><br>A
              				few weeks after Lim Chin Siong was behind bars, Lim Yew Hock

              <p>In a startling and revisionist essay, Dr Greg Poulgrain of Griffiths
              University observes that the British Governor of Singapore and his
              Chief Secretary in their reports to London had admitted that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>police
              could find no evidence to establish that Lim was a communist. </strong></span><br><br>Poulgrain
              claims it was actually Singapore's then Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock,
              who had deliberately<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "provoked" the bus and other industrial workers
              and Chinese middle students to riot in 1956 in order to have Lim Chin
              Siong arrested. </strong></span><br><br>Lim Yew Hock's own admission to responsibility
              for the riot appears in an official report to the British Government
              which<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Poulgrain found in the Colonial Office records in London which
              are now open to researchers. </strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>"Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a
              party with Lim Yew Hock,"</strong></span> adds Poulgrain, "in urging the Colonial
              Secretary to impose the subversives ban in making it illegal for former
              political detainees to stand for election."</p>
