              <p>Yet Iceland was nearly bankrupt (Actually they did) and had to
                          borrow money from the IMF in the recent financial crisis.  I
                          don't see how allowing that to happen is any indication of a
                          "developed" country, especially the one that scored the
                          highest.</p>

              <p>Before the crisis Iceland had virtually no public debt at all. In Singapore it was already then 96,3 % of the GDP. This is one of the biggest figures in the world, and Iceland is still nowhere near it despite all the hardship they're going through.</p>
              <p>All this is rather irrelevant though, as the financial crisis have nothing to do with democracy, but with capitalism. Authoritarian regime therefore does not protect capitalist Singapore from economic crisis.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The rest of the world(Asia/Middle East/Africa) was also
                          colonized and prevented from developing a developed country until
                          after WW2. It's unfair to expect them to develop much when their
                          raw materials are constantly taken and send to Europe/America for
                          development for a spittle of what they're worth.</p>
              <p>So why is it any surprise that the top 21 of the HDI short of
                          Japan are all European countries and America?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Many of the 18 European countries that are according to the HDI better off than Singapore are relatively young states, for example Slovenia was established in 1991.</p>
              <p>Even in Asia Singapore is by no means holding a leading position, being placed between Brunei and Kuwait far behind Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. I personally can't see how an authoritarian regime would contribute to high standard of life, when both globally and in Asia the top nations are liberal democracies.</p>
              <p>Even more so as the rise of South Korea began when the authoritarian regime was forced to allow democratic reforms in the late 1980's.</p>

              <p>And do not forget, Japan did not have to return the loot it took

                          reparations for the damage it has done.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This is not true. In the treaty of San Francisco (1951) Japan lost its vast overseas assets and later (1955-59) did several bilateral treaties to make up for the damage with countries where the assets didn't cover them. All in all Japan had to pay what is about 500 billion Singapore dollars in today's money. Only after the treaty did Japan's economy first start to grow again.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>South Korea's military government got its initial funding
                          for economic development by sending 300,000 troops for the Vietnam
                          war, receiving a total of 3 billion
                          dollars worth of loans for their
                          assistance. They got their economic and industry
                          development through heavy foreign loans, resulting in their

              <p>And today South Korea's foreign debt equals to 18,25 % of their GDP. In Singapore it is 11,27 %. The difference is rather marginal, especially as the total amount of public debt is a lot lower in South Korea (28,2 % of GDP).</p>

              <p>For the simple reason that when the State exist for the people,

              <p>I was'nt aware the government owed you a living, or a job for that matter. If you really are as highly educated and skilled as you claim, there should be no shortage or job opportunities for you.</p>
              <p>Just out of curiousity, what are you highly skilled in? Construction work? If its that then i can understand why you don't have a job</p>

              <p>What you say is true, but it does'nt help that Singaporeans are so picky when it comes to jobs. Many companies would rather hire foreigners than Singaporeans simply because foreigners are cheaper. Whats the PAP supposed to do? Impose a quota that restrict the employment of foreigners? Many MNC's would simply take their business overseas.</p>
