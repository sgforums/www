              <p>This is not easy to do. We are a small nation and we protect ourselves by secrecy or by having a "confusing or  deceit" outward appearance to protect our sovereignity when viewed from the outside.. We do not want other countries to know about our problems , at least in depth. This will give them chances to make a run on our systems, economies, people and culture.Simply write up
              a rebuttal with evidences and publishing them will pose a security vulnerability to our nation.It will call for full transparency.</p>
              <p>Our nespapers have a reason on being secretive and pesky about information flow in the media. The PAP has adopted a technique that is similar to a hybrid between   Nazi Germany  Third Reich an ideologically-driven state, and both advocated a middle-way between capitalism and communism, commonly known as corporatism.</p>
              <p>Here are some of the similarities:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eugenics </span></strong></p>
              <p>Hitler claimed that a nation was the highest creation of a “race”, and “great nations” (literally large nations) were the creation of homogeneous populations of “great races” working together. These nations developed cultures that naturally grew from “races” with “natural good health, and aggressive, intelligent, courageous traits”. The “weakest nations”, Hitler said, were those of “impure” or “mongrel races”, because they had divided, quarreling, and therefore weak cultures.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Militarism </span></strong></p>
              <p>Nazi rationale invested heavily in the militarist belief that great nations grow from military power and maintained order</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facism </span></strong></p>
              <p>Nazism is generally considered a form of fascism.Fascists often had no strong opinion on the question of race, since it was only the state and nation that mattered</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nationalism </span></strong></p>
              <p>This idea is a central concept of Mein Kampf, symbolized by the motto Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer (one people, one empire, one leader). The Nazi relationship between the Volk and the state was called the Volksgemeinschaft (people’s community), a late nineteenth or early twentieth century neologism that defined a communal duty of citizens in service to the Reich (as opposed to a simple society)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic policy </span></strong></p>
              <p>Nazi economic practice concerned itself with immediate domestic issues and separately with ideological conceptions of international economics. Domestic economic policy was narrowly concerned with four major goals to eliminate Germany’s issues, elimination of unemployment, rapid and substantial rearmament, protection against the resurgence of hyper-inflation, and expansion of production of consumer goods to improve middle and lower-class living standards. All of these policy goals were intended to address the perceived shortcomings of the Weimar Republic and to solidify domestic support for the party. In this, the party was successful. Between 1933 and 1936 the German Gross National Product (GNP) increased by an average annual rate of 9.5%, and the rate for industry alone rose by 17.2%.</p>

              <p>Why do you think the PAP talks about brain drain? Although the number of emigrants are small, but they represent the top strata of our intellectuals. And what does the PAP do to replenish our numbers? Import more the likes of lionnoisy, angel and parn from China, India, Philippines and Indonesia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
