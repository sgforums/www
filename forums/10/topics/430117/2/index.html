              <p>if there's anything abt public tpt, I can say there's improvement but it came too late - only last yr.</p>
              <p>But the problem is it'll take another good year to resolve because the buses would be stucked in the traffic jams as well unless more bus lanes are created.</p>
              <p>But her suggestion over the long distance bus route was one tat didn't go well with the infrastructure that they built</p>

              <p>Yes, a balance has to be struck, but consideration for citizens cannot always come after MNC. MNC brings jobs, but it is in Singapore they make money, otherwise why don't they just go to malaysia?</p>

              <p>PM already said - the major ministerial posts are finance and defence (for the obvious reasons). The rest of the ministerial posts, if helmed by weaker candidates, can be firmed up within the cabinet's framework of groupthink.</p>
              <p>Interesting enough (as someone from another forum pointed out), prior to voting, VB denied there is groupthink within the cabinet.</p>
              <p>But GY said he had been vocalising about the people's dissatisfaction as far back as ten years ago. He claimed that his voice was a minority within the cabinet, giving us the impression that the majority didn't agreed with him on this issue. But GY went along with the rest - a clear indication of groupthink. </p>
              <p>There is no groupthink in the sense of them all thinking alike. But there is groupthink in the sense of them forming consensus among themselves and displaying a united front for the public.</p>
              <p>VB was very cunning in giving us the impression that because there is no 'groupthink', views and opinions were actively sought and thoroughly scrutinised. If it's so, they won't be so clueless about the people's feeling.</p>
              <p>I tend to agree with GY that within the cabinet, it's majority voices vs minority voices. He is out of both parliament and cabinet now - no need to be cautious with his words anymore.</p>

              <p>Ministers are appointed from the elected MP, but not all MP will be appointed ministers. You elect MP to serve the constituency, not to become ministers!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Yes, a balance has to be struck, but consideration for citizens cannot always come after MNC. MNC brings jobs, but it is in Singapore they make money, otherwise why don't they just go to malaysia?</p>
              <p>If sinaporeans are not responsible, do you think the MNC will employ us?</p>

              <p><br>as again, it's obvious only the best can be minister.</p>
              <p>To me, it's the defence, foreign affairs, finance minister that has the highest portfolio aft the PM</p>
              <p>you see, can Malaysia offer you R&amp;D supporting facilities? Now cherish whatever we've, no doubt now the next 5 years is mostly cleaning up the mess and moving on</p>
              <p>The responsibiliy is over politics. Sometimes practical minds overruns emotions. lol</p>

              <p>PM already said - the major ministerial posts are finance and defence (for the obvious reasons). The rest of the ministerial posts, if helmed by weaker candidates, can be firmed up within the cabinet's framework of groupthink.</p>
              <p>Interesting enough (as someone from another forum pointed out), prior to voting, VB denied there is groupthink within the cabinet.</p>
              <p>But GY said he had been vocalising about the people's dissatisfaction as far back as ten years ago. He claimed that his voice was a minority within the cabinet, giving us the impression that the majority didn't agreed with him on this issue. But GY went along with the rest - a clear indication of groupthink. </p>
              <p>There is no groupthink in the sense of them all thinking alike. But there is groupthink in the sense of them forming consensus among themselves and displaying a united front for the public.</p>
              <p>VB was very cunning in giving us the impression that because there is no 'groupthink', views and opinions were actively sought and thoroughly scrutinised. If it's so, they won't be so clueless about the people's feeling.</p>
              <p>I tend to agree with GY that within the cabinet, it's majority voices vs minority voices. He is out of both parliament and cabinet now - no need to be cautious with his words anymore.</p>

              <p><br>what can I say.</p>
              <p>the system we had of scholarship (it's more to do w/ the selection) nuture them highly, bring them overseas for the best env studies and they come back they immedaitely run higher post.</p>
              <p>Take for example the NS reduction case during the election campaign period. I believe it was the ex scholar that came with it. Maybe it's coincidental I've no idea.</p>
              <p>Let's put it, reduction is something everyone wants to look forward to. But operationally you end up with problems training officer (OCS takes a good 9 mths). You can say ppl can volunteer.</p>
              <p>But implication is would people want knowing should they not opt, they can earn much more income than being in the conscript force. Neither is the govt going to start giving regular pay over this. Now it works out it may not be a good idea after all.</p>
              <p>I guess it's time to let people run the show. I mean people who are passionate, know their things well, and able to weigh implications properly onto executing any policy changes.</p>
              <p>It ought not to be a scholar's world anymore.</p>
