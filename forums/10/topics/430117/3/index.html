What it implies is that if George were fighting in a single seat constituency, he would have a higher chance of staying in the parliament.</p>
              <p>In singapore we have to acknowledge that in many ways the price of being an opposition politician is much higher than those from the ruling party. Will MP from the opposition have the chance of becoming a minister, if he is capable?</p>
              <p>Fighting cocks fight for the sake of fighting, they don't fight to solve the problem to help people. True blue fighting cocks politician are like Jaya, chiam ST...they fight till they die! in that sense, george is not a true blue fighting cock.</p>

              <p>Turn the table the around<br>The PAP started as an opposition party. If they could strengthen up, find good ideas in their manifesto that's workable in day to day environement, soon you'll see another Singapore. Whether is it good or not, time will tell.</p>
              <p>As for fighting cocks I mean those that appeared in the 1970s era like Chin Harn Tong, Jaya, CST. GY's a case probably because he's a soldier himself.</p>

              <p>Up till now, i still do not understand why peoples keep saying George Yeo is a nice person, I personally met him in his capacity as a foreigner minister at Fullerton Hotel, he completely ignored the singaporeans greeting him and instead take care of his guests who also felt why he ignored his peoples, he is a proud person to me.</p>
              <p>Did he found singapore? No</p>
              <p>Did he bring up the poor? No</p>
              <p>Did he changed PAP to make them accountable and be transparent? No</p>
              <p>Is he paid Millions to be a foreign minister..Yes, the most expensive foreign minister in this region and perhap in this world. No big deal if he retire now, Singaporean had been looking at retirement at 65yo and forget all about the 55yo age which is an international standard.</p>
