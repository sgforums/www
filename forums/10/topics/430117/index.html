               Hua, said she will not contest the next General Election in 2016.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>She said she will leave it to someone younger as she will be 57 years old.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking at a media 
              conference Wednesday morning, Mrs Lim, who is also the Second Minister 
              for Finance and Transport, said she has served almost 15 years and 
              that's a "reasonable" stretch.<br><br>Mrs Lim said she was also 
              surprised by the depth of resentment felt by citizens towards the 
              government, which surfaced during the campaign.<br><br>And while the PAP team was expecting a close fight in Aljunied GRC, Mrs Lim said she was still surprised by the outcome.<br><br>Mrs Lim said she plans to take a break over the next few months.<br><br>She also doesn't rule out the possibility of returning to the finance sector.<br><br>On Tuesday, fellow Aljunied GRC team member, Mr George Yeo also announced his exit from politics. <br><br>In
               the contest for Aljunied GRC in the 2011 General Election, the Workers'
               Party won 54.71 per cent of the votes, leaving the People's Action 
              Party (PAP) with 45.29 per cent.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p>PAP MPs are really not politicians.</p>

              <p>Unlike the opposition, defeat after defeat still come back and fight. Why?</p>
              <p>Because opposition are real politicians, PAP MPs are just paid agents of Lee family.</p>

              <p>PAP MPs are also Ministers, &amp; unlike those opposition just-MPs, they are busy and they even sacrifice their family tiem for residents' birthdays etc.</p>
              <p>U want the tire our the PAP MPs and work for free?</p>
              <p>Of course they have the right to feel disgusted, played out by the Aljunied residents after they have served them for more than 20 years.</p>
