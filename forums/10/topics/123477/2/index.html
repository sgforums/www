            <div class='col-md body'>I lost all respect for Chee Soon Juan the day i saw him on TV, shouting at then- PM Goh during a walk-about during the days leading up to the General Elections. 'Where is our money?' his famouse words. My god, he acts like some sam seng kia and his mouth shoots off so many things that he kenna sued like siao. Also, there was once he proclaimed 2 go on a hunger-strike, only 2 be discovered that he was drinking water.<br><br>By making a documentary about him, whatever the intention of the director is, it seems that it is trying 2 glorify a man who cannot be trusted. So, it is just as well we do not get 2 see film about him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans cannot be trusted to critically evaluate what they see in a film. But they are responsible enough not to blow all their wealth in the casino..<br><br>I don't think much of Chee Soon Juan and would not bother watching the film even if it was screened. But I am sick of the government treating me like a kid. Gosh, I am no elite but I am not daft either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think they might as well be honest and change the restriction to say that political films that do not paint a rosy picture of the ruling party are to be banned.
