              <p>As of 2003 dollars, the min sum in 2013 is likely to be $120,000. After adjustment for inflation, it shd become approx. $140,000 to $150,000. And that's when you turn 55 in 2013. If you turn 55, ten, twenty or thirty years later? Min sum is likely to be $200,000 to $300,000 by then.</p>

              <p>Retirement at which age is a very personal choice ! If you have enough too last you long, you can retire any time ! But as what some friends said here, what is the use of raising retirement age when some employers practice age discrimination in hiring. I personally have no issue of raising the retirement age because to me if you are still healthy and still idle, life can be quite boring, as I look at what my father is in now. I don't want to grow old like my father to be a boring and irritating old man !</p>

              <p>Govt going to face this problem soon (more old pple in another 15 to 20 yr time). Yes mass withdrawal will suck the cpf dry. They will change policy here and there. The better policy is to increase age. And increase the min amount in cpf, yes again, goal post shift here and there. Pple will not be able to beat them.</p>
              <p>Hey, my manager are like that too. Decision change here and there and subordinates always in the loosing end.</p>

              <p>When we retired, officially, we are given renew contract with a different set of pay structure and job redesign for us. Therefore you need to retire inorder to be re employ again. If you dun understand me, ask the PRC manager to explain to you.</p>

              <p>The retirement age is not for you to work until. You work until you want to stop (you can quit anytime), until you cannot anymore. The retirement age does not matter to you, if atÂ 40 your bone creak and pain and you cannot work, there is this thing call golden handshake. Even if the retirement age is 55 like last time, will you be happy with it. You will still work as long as you are able to.</p>
              <p>The retirement age isÂ  to give employers the chanceÂ to throw out oldies. It is not to force you to work until. You can retire at 18, the legal age to buy lottery tickets, if you are lucky enough.</p>
