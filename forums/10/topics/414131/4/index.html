              <p>It is true that not everybody knows how to save, or to invest, or simply take care of their money.</p>
              <p>I think all the women in china knows that singaporean men get a big sum of money when they reach 55, i know of a few a peh who went to china with their china girlfriends with cpf money, song for a few months then come back with many stories to tell but have to continue working for a living. Now with IR, I hope not many old folks are making the bosses of the casino happy at the expense of their retirement fund. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

Invest can be a better choice, but if invest failed, that is it, saving is not so practical anymore, when young, i look at a million as so big, but today, i see nothing in it, what is a million in singapore today..almost normal.</p></div>

              <p>it depends on how you look at it. At 55 or earlier, I can
              sell my HDB and take my CPF and go places and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>today you leave your money in CPF you get 2.5% interest for
              ordinary account, 4% for special and medisave account, how much
              money you put in bank? if you don't trust CPF, then put in bank, if
              you don't trust bank, then put under your pillow.</p>
              <p>You have a choice, are you capable of making a wise decision?
              don't expect the government to do financial planning for you.
              sounds bizarre?</p>

              <p>How old are you? 55 is such a long wait to enjoy your life. And HDB and CPF rules are ever changing, you may not even be able to liquidate your house come retirement? God knows. Who would have thought the retirement age would one day be 68? HDB prices to hit $1m?</p>
              <p>What makes one so sure that by around 55, one can easily liquidate the HDB and go elsewhere like a swashbuckling adventurer to enjoy life?</p>
              <p>I'm not based in singapore and where i am, the interest ranges from 6-10% in a public bank. I dont expect the govt to do my financial planning for me. Which chap expects so? lol. Doesnt sound too bizarre?</p>

              <p>Extending the retirement age is a good thing.  50 years down the road, we WILL need it.</p>
              <p>When a country faces a serious ageing population issue, there only so few policy options available.  1.  Allow poverty among the aged, 2.  Increase welfare spending.</p>
              <p>1, is of course, not very good.  2. Money doesn't appear from thin air.  When the population ages, the economy ALSO shrinks, because theres less available workforce.</p>
              <p>Hence, extending retirement age HELPS to prevent the available workforce from contracting too much and hopefully, prevent the economy from shrinking too much. The less the economy shrinks, the more $ available for welfare spending to cushion our old boney asses.</p>
              <p>Makes sense?</p>
              <p>Now... on the other hand, if we had "guai guai" had more children, and have enough people to replace our population, we wouldn't have to extend our retirement age cos the workforce doesn't shrink.</p>
              <p> Migrate all you want, but just make sure u pick a place that doesn't have an ageing population.</p>
