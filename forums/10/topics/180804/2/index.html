But i refered to them in 2 seperate groups. I meant that opposition's strategy based on their writeup for the pre general election mandate were to sway this particular group into their favor.<br><br>Lower income are basically the bread and butter of out society. They are not necessarily lazy. but under singapore's educational system, they obviously had to be lazy somewhere along the line as not to 'make it' in this life. Probably during their growing up years. They are the ones who are paid to ensure cooperations can survive and thus investors and rich people who own the businesses at the end will just keep gettting richer and richer.<br><br>In singapore opportunities abound. There will always be whiners and people who bitch their lives away.

There will always be whiners and people who bitch their lives away.

            <div class='col-md body'>IMF and economists also said something similar to Steve Chia:<br><br>Feb 27, 2006<br>&gt; NEWS ANALYSIS<br>&gt; Near $3b Budget gap sparks fresh debate<br>&gt; Govt's accounting is conservative and S'pore is not really in<br>&gt; deficit, say economists<br>&gt;<br>&gt; By Narendra Aggarwal<br>&gt; Economics Correspondent<br>&gt; AS PARLIAMENT sits today to consider Singapore's Budget for 2006-07,<br>&gt; weighing heavy on its mind would be the fact that the huge $2.9<br>&gt; billion deficit projected by the Finance Ministry will be the largest<br>&gt; in at least 20 years.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yet private-sector economists, academics and public-finance experts<br>&gt; will remain, as in previous deficit years, totally unflustered by the<br>&gt; figure.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The reason for their indifference is that many argue that the rather<br>&gt; gloomy picture painted of the Government's finances is not the result<br>&gt; of unsustainable fiscal largesse, but rather the result of the<br>&gt; Government's rather conservative accounting methods.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It's an old chestnut of a problem that has bugged everyone from the<br>&gt; humble economics undergraduate to economy watchers at the<br>&gt; International Monetary Fund (IMF).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The numbers, this time around, look like this: Aided by what is<br>&gt; expected to be strong economic growth, a surplus of about $0.7<br>&gt; billion is expected for the year ending March 31, 2007.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But because of a handsome $3.6 billion worth of giveaways in the<br>&gt; new 'Progress Package' Budget, an overall deficit of $2.9 billion is<br>&gt; estimated instead.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Economists have been quick to point out that there really isn't any<br>&gt; red ink at all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For example, long-time Singapore economy watcher Song Seng Wun, a<br>&gt; senior economist with CIMB-GK Research, says there is 'under-<br>&gt; reporting' of government revenues by what he thinks is a sum of about<br>&gt; $10 billion.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'So in fact, by my estimates there should be a surplus of about $7<br>&gt; billion,' he concludes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Whether there is a deficit boils down to 'really a definition issue',<br>&gt; says Standard Chartered Bank (Stanchart) economist Joseph Tan.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'And Singapore takes a very, very conservative view of revenue<br>&gt; compared to other governments,' he explains.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In this conservative approach, two major items, typically regarded as<br>&gt; current-year government revenue, are not included in full in<br>&gt; Singapore's income statements.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The first is capital receipts, and in particular, land sales. This is<br>&gt; totally omitted.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; According to an appendix that accompanied the Budget numbers released<br>&gt; last week, capital receipts for the coming financial year 2006 are<br>&gt; estimated to weigh in at a whopping $4.08 billion. Land sales will<br>&gt; account for the lion's share of this at $4.04 billion.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The second item is net investment income (NII). Only up to 50 per<br>&gt; cent of NII from the investment of past reserves are 'available for<br>&gt; use by the government of the day', says the Finance Ministry. For the<br>&gt; coming year, 'investment and interest income' is estimated to be<br>&gt; $7.65 billion, but only $2.39 billion has been budgeted in the<br>&gt; accounts.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Both of these accounting moves are problematic, say economists.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; IDEAglobal senior economist Nizam Idris says 'not including land<br>&gt; sales revenue is one glaring omission'. He adds that going by<br>&gt; international standards, money from all land sales should be included<br>&gt; in government revenue.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Like other economists, he also points out that the return on<br>&gt; investments made from past savings of the state shown in the Budget<br>&gt; are very small.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The new Budget includes $2.39 billion as NII contributions, but Mr<br>&gt; Nizam notes that even if Singapore's near $200 billion foreign<br>&gt; reserves were invested in United States Treasury bills with a 4 per<br>&gt; cent yield, the state's investment income would be much higher.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; CIMB-GK's Mr Song says that if IMF standards are applied, Singapore's<br>&gt; financial position is quite strong.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This hypothesis was put to the test in a study presented at an<br>&gt; Institute of Policy Studies conference in 2002.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Using IMF conventions, public finance guru Mukul Asher of the Lee<br>&gt; Kuan Yew School of Public Policy estimated the excess in the state's<br>&gt; total revenue over total expenditure to be between 6 and 17 per cent<br>&gt; of gross domestic product (GDP) between 1991 and 2001.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If one uses last year's GDP figure of $195 billion and applies the<br>&gt; low end of his findings, Singapore would have had a Budget surplus of<br>&gt; more than $10 billion for the year just gone by, instead of the $0.43<br>&gt; billion reported.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In the past, the Finance Ministry has defended its conservative<br>&gt; accounting, arguing since capital receipts from land sales could be<br>&gt; highly volatile as a result of changing market conditions. Since it<br>&gt; is not a steady stream, it is not prudent to include land sales as a<br>&gt; revenue item.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In an e-mail response to the Straits Times, the ministry emphasised<br>&gt; again that this accounting method is designed to produce an overall<br>&gt; Budget balance that includes all the regular income and revenue<br>&gt; available for expenditure by the current government.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'The portion of the NII that is not used for expenditure and all<br>&gt; proceeds from land sales are therefore not included in the Budget.<br>&gt; Otherwise it will mislead Singaporeans on how much revenues are<br>&gt; available for expenditure.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Not everyone, however, is totally convinced. 'Everybody else does it,<br>&gt; so there is no reason why Singapore should also not do it,' says Mr<br>&gt; Song of CIMB-GK.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Referring to the point about volatile land sale revenues, Stanchart's<br>&gt; Mr Tan says that 'this is not a valid argument as the market will be<br>&gt; able to adjust to the fluctuations of revenue'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He adds that the market has its own ways of adjusting to reality.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'Just consider this: the Budget deficits in recent years has not hit<br>&gt; Singapore ratings. We have been able to sustain our triple-A rating.<br>&gt; Clearly the market thinks that the country's fiscal position is<br>&gt; stronger that what it appears to be.'</div>
