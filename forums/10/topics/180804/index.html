            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><strong><span class="large">Govt far richer than it makes itself out to be, says Steve Chia</span></strong><br><span class="small">By Sue-Ann Chia<br>Straits Times, 1 March 2006</span><br><br>THE Government is misleading Singaporeans on the true state of its finances, charged Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia yesterday.<br><br>It is actually far richer than it has made itself out to be, he said, continuing the opposition's attack on the Government's fiscal poliicy. His accusation comes a day after opposition MP Low Thia Khiang pressed the Government to be more transparent in its <a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2006/budget_speech/downloads/FY2006_Budget_Highlights.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>Budget accounting </strong></a>.<br><br>At issue is the way the Government <a href="http://app.mof.gov.sg/faq/faq.asp?category=Budget+And+Government+Expenditure&amp;subheading=Budget+And+Government+Expenditure" rel="nofollow"><strong>classifies revenue</strong></a>. <strong>Its definition of revenue does not include capital receipts such as from one-off sale of land and capital good. Nor does it include all net investment income (NII).</strong><br><br>This conservative accounting practice has led economists to argue that Singapore's fiscal position is actually much stronger than it appears.<br><br>Mr Chia pointed out that up to half the NII can be used within a government's five-year term, while the other half has to be locked away as long-term reserves.<br><br>But the Government decided to use only 33 per cnet. "Why did it not use up all the 50 per cent allowed ? " he asked.<br><br>The Government had projected a deficit of $2.86 billion this year, after giving away $2.6 billion in dividends and bonuses to Singaporeans.<br><br>But Mr Chia argued that <strong>when capital receipts and 50 per cent of net investment income are included, the Government actually enjoys a surplus of <span style="color: blue;">$5.1 billion this year</span>.</strong><br><br><strong>When capital receipts and NII are included, the <span style="color: blue;">total surpluses chalked up over the last few years is an "obscene total" of at least $19 billion sitting in the Consolidated Fund</span>, <span style="color: red;">waiting to be transferred to the national reserves</span>.</strong><br><br>"That is a lot of money. More importantly, <strong>that money <span style="color: red;">has not</span> been reflected in the Budget</strong>. It gives a misleading picture of our Government's fiscal position," he said.<br><br>He noted that the Finance Ministry had previously explained that these capital receipts were "lumpy and uncertain" and hence should not be counted on to fund regular expenditure.<br><br>But not reflecting such big amounts in the Budget was more misleading to the public than reflecting it, he argued.<br><br>"I had been misled. The public had been misled. Everyone had been misled to think the Government had been very tight these last four years, and we will enter FY2006 with a huge deficit. But that is not true at all."<br><br>The $19 billion surplus should be put to good use, he said. <strong>"The Government should scrap - or at least drastically reduce - the water conservation tax, the radio and TV licence fees, and the foreign domestic worker levy. They can afford to, and they should, "</strong> he argued.<br><br>But People's Action Party MPs were swift to rebut Mr Chia, the secretary-general of the opposition National Solidarity Party.<br><br>Dr Ong Chi Chung, (Jurong GRC) said: "I heard with amazement Mr Chia's call to abolish and lower taxes, and at the same time, advocating more and more giveaways and freebies. Now, who will pay for all this ? Without sufficient taxes and revenues, such things cannot be sustained. It is, in my mind, a recipe for disaster."<br><br>Dr John Cheng (Hong Kah GRC) also took issue with Mr Chia's Budget analysis. He reiterated the Government's position that the proceeds from government land sales should go into long-term reserves. "Otherwise, a rougue government, with the election promise to give away money, can come in easily to sell land and give the money to peopl," he pointed out, adding: "I think either Mr Chia does not understand what constitiutes reserves and the protection of it, or he is indeed misleading people himself."<br><br></div>

Not only did he criticise the Workers' Party (WP) "time bombs" and manifesto in his round-up speech, Mr Lee also rebuked both WP chief Low Thia Khiang and Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia.<br>.<br>The former was chided for his "selective memory" and sole interest in "scoring political points", and the latter was portrayed as a bank raider for his suggestions for tax cuts and fee waivers.<br>.<br>Responding to Mr Low's question as to why the Government could incur a spending deficit of $2.9 billion while the WP's suggestion for increased education and healthcare expenditure was labelled "fiscally irresponsible", Mr Lee said the problem lay in the call for "an unconditional needs-based welfare safety net" in the WP's manifesto.<br>.<br>"In contrast, this Government lives within its means, without neglecting its obligations to lower income Singaporeans," he said.<br>.<br>While explaining that the Government's capital receipts from the statutory boards were sufficient to fund the $2.6 billion Progress Package without drawing on past reserves or burdening taxpayers, he went on to say:<span style="color: blue;"> <strong>"(Mr Chia) wants to raid the bank Â— he proposed cutting all sorts of taxes and fees and (wants to) just declare that Christmas has arrived." </strong></span><br>.<br>Mr Lee also pointed out that Mr Low chose to forget the $7.8 billion worth of assistance measures doled out by the Government since 2001. Instead, he said, Mr Low had accused the Government of raising the GST after the last elections.<br>.<br>"But before we raised the GST, we had also provided $2.7 billion worth of Economic Restructuring Shares to help Singaporeans cope," Mr Lee said. Visibly irked, he then launched into a scathing dose of Latin: "Mr Low has, to say in Latin, suppressio veri suggestio falsi Â— suppressed the truth while suggesting what is false!"<br>.<br>Pointing out that Mr Low had nothing constructive to say about the Progress Package Â— unlike Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong Â— Mr Lee said this "shows he is not really interested in whether Singaporeans are getting the help they need, only in scoring political points".<br>.<br>"Why make a speech to score political points?" he asked Mr Low. "There will be an opportunity to do so before the next General Elections."<br>.<br>But both Mr Low and Mr Chia persisted with their concerns during clarification time. Mr Chia asked which chapter or clause in the Constitution states that land sales go into the reserves and not the budget position. Mr Low questioned the Government's "ad hoc" help only in times of Budget surpluses Â— before being put down by Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the House Wong Kan Seng for a "clarification" that seemed more like a speech.<br>.<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">In response to Mr Chia, Mr Lee pointed to a White Paper that states land sales are to be locked up as past reserves and cannot be touched. </span></strong>Still, Mr Chia told Today there was a lack of transparency where national reserves were concerned.<br>.<br>"I did not say money should be given out freely. I'm trying to say that if there is a lot of money then the spending on the people should reflect it," he said.<br>.<br>More than just 2 days<br>.<br>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng yesterday revealed to the House that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee had completed its report.<br>.<br>It is now with the Prime Minister, and a copy would be sent to the MPs within the week.<br>.<br>The report would map out the wards and the number of MPs for each constituency and reveal if any constituencies are absorbed into others or if any new ones are formed. It is usually released just before the polls are called.<br>.<br>Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia, who is the Secretary-General of the National Solidarity Party, wanted to know how long the campaigning period for the coming General Election will be, and if there would be "at least three months" between the release of the boundaries report and the dissolution of Parliament Â— which precedes the issuance of the writ of election.<br>.<br>In response, Mr Wong said: "I am very certain what was experienced in 2001, where there were only two days between the publication of the electoral boundary report and the dissolution of Parliament, will not happen this time.<br>.<br>"But if the Prime Minister decides and when he decides to have the election and dissolve Parliament, I think all of us will know of it." Low and Chia reproached by Mr Lee for trying to 'score political points'<br><br></div>
