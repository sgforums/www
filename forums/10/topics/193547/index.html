I feel a government must first take care of the citizens.<br><br>- Also wish for society to be kinder, more gracious, more humble in general.<br><br>d) Economically, yes.

Enough of that trash talk about 'No one owes Singapore a living; we must find our own ways to survive and prosper'. Foreign talents don't owe Singapore a living either. Since they are here, they should compete with locals on a level playing field and not rise to the skies under favouritism. Well-deserving schoolmates are denied the opportunity to develop their potential to the fullest in the top class because half of the seats in that class are reserved for foreign scholars. Whoever initiates and supports such favouritism should ask themselves, 'is that fair?' At the end of the day, who runs the government and Singapore as a whole? Obviously not foreign talents, obviously it's Singaporeans at the helm. Who sings the national anthem and recite the Singapore pledge? Singaporeans. Who are the natives on our homeland? Singaporeans. Is there nobody out of the 3 - 4 million Singaporeans who even qualify to represent Singapore in SEA games or olympics, or who can match the foreign players that play in the name of Singapore in SEA games? Obviously not.<br><br>An education system that does not breed elitism outright. Nuff said.<br><br>Tolerance of dissent. Freedom of expression. Nuff said.<br><br>A society with a soul; with empathy and tolerance for fellow citizens. A society without such is merely a direct replicate of a ghost town. It is of great wonder, how a human can live in a society which comprises of cold-blooded 'people'.<br><br>A 'Singaporean Singapore'. Fellow citizens as one, regardless or race, language, religion and political parties.<br><br>d)       Are you confident that Singapore will have a bright future?<br><br>The prospects seem dim.<br><br>e)       Are you confident that your personal aspirations can be fulfilled in Singapore?<br><br>Yes. All it takes is some hard work I hope.<br><br>(The above is the humble opinion of a sec 4 student, none other than myself.)</div>
