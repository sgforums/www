I believe we have a (intrinsically) good people, and well-meaning leaders (save LHL and increasingly, LKY). THe main problem with us is our system, and how we choose to clutch to straws in order to preserve it. We - or at least the govt - drags external props to support it e.g communism, war on terror yada yada.<br><br>b) the fact that I grew up here, that my friends and family are here...<br><br>c) Have more freedom of expression, unmuzzle the press, Ditch the streaming system and replace it with a more integrated variant.<br><br>d) not really. If the WP manages to rise up and the SDA can solve its internal disunity, yes. But else, no.<br><br>e) I hope so.</div>
