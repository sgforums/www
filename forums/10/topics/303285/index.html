Â§ 2901 et seq.) is a United States federal law that</a></strong><br><blockquote><br>requires banks and thrifts to offer credit throughout their entire market area and prohibits them from targeting only wealthier neighborhoods with their services, a practice known as "redlining." The purpose of the CRA is to provide credit, including home ownership opportunities to underserved populations and commercial loans to small businesses.<br><br>The CRA was passed into law by the U.S. Congress in 1977 as a result of national grassroots pressure for affordable housing, and despite considerable opposition from the mainstream banking community. Only one banker, Ron Grzywinski from ShoreBank in Chicago, testified in favor of the act. [1]<br><br>The CRA mandates that each banking institution be evaluated to determine if it has met the credit needs of its entire community. That record is taken into account when the federal government considers an institution's application for deposit facilities, including mergers and acquisitions. The CRA is enforced by the financial regulators (FDIC, OCC, OTS, and FRB).<br><br>In 1995, as a result of interest from President Clinton's administration, the implementing regulations for the CRA were strengthened by focusing the financial regulators' attention on institutions' performance in helping to meet community credit needs. These changes were very controversial and as a result, the regulators agreed to revisit the rule after it had been fully implemented for five years. Thus in 2002, the regulators opened up the regulation for review and potential revision.</blockquote>2.One of the link in wikipedia provide a very good anaylsis<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo125.html" rel="nofollow"> The Government-Created Subprime Mortgage Meltdown<br><br>by Thomas J. DiLorenzo</a></strong><br><blockquote>... So-called "community groups" like ACORN benefit themselves from the CRA through a process that sounds like legalized extortion. The CRA is enforced by four federal government bureaucracies: the Fed, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The law is set up so that any bank merger, branch expansion, or new branch creation can be postponed or prohibited by any of these four bureaucracies if a CRA "protest" is issued by a "community group." This can cost banks great sums of money, and the "community groups" understand this perfectly well. It is their leverage. They use this leverage to get the banks to give them millions of dollars as well as promising to make a certain amount of bad loans in their communities.<br><br>A man named Bruce Marks became quite notorious during the last decade for pressuring banks to earmark literally billions of dollars to his organization, the "Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America." He once boasted to the New York Times that he had "won" loan commitments totaling $3.8 billion from Bank of America, First Union Corporation, and the Fleet Financial Group. And that is just one "community group" operating in one city Â– Boston....</blockquote>3.<strong><a href="http://www.hsbcusa.com/hsbc_finance/pdf/HI8k1103_AcornPressRel.pdf" rel="nofollow">HSBC US branch settled a class law litigation with ACORN</a></strong><br><br>ACORN got the ransom!!<br><br><blockquote>...In connection with the proposed settlement, Household has agreed to provide funding over a three-year period for<br>ACORN-sponsored financial counseling and literacy programs...</blockquote>4.<strong>Justice in US</strong><br>Rubbish.This is the failure of voting system.The community org<br>is quite well organised,like Mafia.They can win offices in community<br>and have more political power!!<br><br>God save America.</div>
