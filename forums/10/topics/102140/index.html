            <div class='col-md body'>Strong government has too many implications.<br><br>It may mean more self-centred or intuitive top-down decisions or policies that lead to strait-jacketing of whole government machinery from openness and competitiveness.<br><br>As admitted by retired civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow, a spartan system will only lead to extinction. He had characterized the top-down policies of our leaders as creating to auto-piloting of many policies that could not and did not work thereby holding back our entrepreneurship possible under diversified Athenian system.<br><br>For many years, streaming of schools and allocation of jobs based on meritocracy while feeding the public sector economy is not doing justice to mass participation in the overall entrepreneurship. The whole populations have probably lost out on competitiveness to other more entrepreneurial ones believing and practising mass paticipations in knowledge applications.<br><br>On the other hand, based on our leaders' proclaimed best leadership approach and being paid the best salaries in the world, there is no reason people cannot have more say on their effective performance of duties.<br><br>From the point of view, it is not strong government that we need. It is accountability and transparency that our highly paid leaders and civil servants who could not measure up to expectations of masses will have to relent and back off.<br><br>Is there a system to examine our leaders' performance based on effective performance or results and not justifications portrayed by the press or media.<br><br>Performance of duties should be the key not utterances to justify past mistakes from top-down management.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my humble opinion, a strong government is made up of:<br><br>(1) Highly educated workforce who are actively involved in applying their knowledge to increase efficiency of governance inclusive of entrepreneurship needed to support a high standard of living and social life.<br><br>(2) A responsive central government based on 7 points of true democracy to reassure the population of fair and equitable solutions to problems openness and accountability.<br><br>Central government is only a tool but not the master should respond to and carry it the people's collective wishes. (Customers are always right : eg. EM3 in education is counter-competitive)<br><br>Under such a definition, it will be seen that the key to strong government or central governing machinery is its responsiveness to people's wishes. For this key to be used by the people, there has to be accountability and transparency.  For accountability and transparency, there has to be the 7 practical points of democratic practices to assure of due diligence and progress.<br><br>Without responsiiveness of central government or accountability of processes of governance, the government will be weak no matter how the press or media projects it to be or how the pro-establishment beneficiaries try to have others to believe because it will fail to carry the whole economic prowess of the people which is the real power. Eventually, through poor performance, self-centred government will not receive the support of the people and will be eventually replaced. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
