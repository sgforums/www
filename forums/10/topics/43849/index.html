You mentioned asking Singaporean to be more entrepreneur and daring? Easier said than done. If you are saying about food-related industry, it will probably survive. If you are saying about industrial-related business, can I ask where can those start-up find business in this area? Do you surf the gov. websites that requires companies to have good financial background and experience to bid for their projects? Do you think those startup business will have such capabilities? Those are for established and rich people. Basically, business must have revenue and cashflow. How can a startup survive if the gov is so insistance, does not cut the red tapes and not dariing or innovative enough to give these startup a chance? Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Singapore's economy is hit by SARS problem...<br><br>The current "high" unemployment rate is not really that bad.<br>Those unemployed should learn new skills and knowledge and upgrade...<br><br>These years of economic downturns show that on skill is not enough to survive... We have to be "Multi-Industrial Trained"...<br><br>But we must carry on with our lives and be confident about our future. Or we'll end up like Hong Kong, which is suffering from depression on the SARS as well as their economy... There is just not enough confidence....<br><br>The SARS problem can be considered long-term (if it stays too long or gets out of control) or a short-term problem (Once the disease is greatly under control)...<br><br>Once the SARS is over... Our economy will recover...<br>But that may take about 1 or 2 years<br>(for proper SARS preventive measures or even vaccine to come out)!<br><br>We may be hit another wave of recession or downturn again for the next 3-5 years again, judging from the frequency of economy's ups and downs...<br><br>But we'll be stronger... Remember our 5 aspects of Total Defence...<br>That's the key strategy to Singapore's Survival, Stability and Success!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, the high unemployment rate is really bad. If I am not mistaken, this is the 2nd or 3rd year whereby a lot of local graduates who are not able to find job easily. There are just too few job openings in the market. From the news, we heard that some graduates becomes hawkers, taxi-drivers, etc which don't require knowledge that they learn in the university or poly institution. To make matter worse, there is a huge influx of ready "foreign talent" graduates competing for those positions that our local graduates can fill up and gain experience.<br>What I can say is that in the long run, there will be a high mismatch in the supply and demand of the workforce.<br>Something must be done quickly, else the one who suffers will be our local people. This will have social impact too, like decreasing number of  marriage, low birthrate, etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya, the unemployment rate reali quite bad... and to make things worst, the foreign talent is still coming in... something need to be done to ensure that foreigners done take up all of our jobs... mayb should encourage companies in sg to take up locals rather than the foreign talent. sg do lack of entrepreneurs... mayb more should be done to attract ppl to startup lor.</div>

Its a simple logic. If no buyer, why sell and lose money? So I think the first thing the gov should do is to create the environment. In concrete, it means creating demand. Examples is looking for current local SME to do part of their projects, give as much work to local SME for any overseas projects, service or work. In this way only can SME prosper to MNC and help others locally.<br>Just my opinion.; Tsk...</div>

I still heard grads. friends having high demands in thier job search, such as high pay, 8 to 5, work must be course-related, etc.<br>Talking about people with families, some of them really cham. I know a friend who got retrenched, but luckily got a job soon. According to him, this new job's income does not meet his household expense. You see, he bought a 5-room flat before the 911 and he got 3 very young kids. His wife is taking care of the kids at home and he cannot downgrad his 5-room, arghh think need to live in there for 5 years before he can do that. Even if he can downgrad his 5-room, he will be in deeper debt due to the price difference he buy and sell. So this does not solve his problem. Currently, he is working 2 jobs, and I find its really torture... So sad... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi CX,<br><br>most of your points stated are true, but u have misunderstood me somehow or I might have mis-communicate in my previous message.<br>What I mean is the gov should made use of their financial strenght to build MNC overseas and help local SME to grow.

In this way, the gov MNC can concentrate to grow globally and SME can take up more of local work. This also may help local grads to have a chance to go overseas and help these gov MNC to grow and in the meantime learn.

            <div class='col-md body'>Short term goals for Singapore is to continue to attract foreign investments in a variety of form, whether in service, manufacturing, etc. This will require an environment supportive of foreign talent, in order to attract the larger more significant investments.<br><br>Long term goals should be to encourage local enterprises to form and to:<br>1. Feed into the existing business framework<br>2. Replace some, if not all, the existing foreign framework and ultimately to export these to the region and the world<br>3. Create new form of businesses<br><br>We have been successful in the past achieving the short term goals set. Each year we were able to bring in more foreign investments. While we were patting out backs, we failed to see that we have wasted those years by not looking after our long term goals.<br><br>It is time, we separate the two and have separate home teams working on them. Placing them together will simply lead to a status quo. The long term goal team should be given the flexibility to achieve their goals without hindrance and concerns of short term realities.<br><br>I have worked mostly with MNCs and one very obvious trait of such companies is that they have one and only one goal and that is to achieve profits for their parent company back home. There is no loyalty to the local country where they operate. If you do not give them what they want they will move and leave. The few cases recently in the shipping business is clear for all to see.<br><br>To think that they have Singapore interest at heart is being naive. My constant hope for the government is to realize the need to put more emphasis to build a large pool of world class businesses that will one day go overseas and bring back the dough.<br><br>I know some will say that enterpreneurs should come from the people and should need no assistance from the government. My answer is simple, if with government assistance we can bring sucess quicker, then why not. Say what you want but fortune 1000 companies achieve their current position with a lot of help from their home governments. Sanctions, quotas and whatever are used to ensure these successes.<br><br>P.S. I have read recently government is already placing our brains at the service of local SMBs. This is a good start and I urge the government not to stop at that only.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

DBS vs Merryl Lynch, Citibank and HSBC... once u remove the restrictions currently holding them back... and with the US FTA, we're set for MORE competition on home ground... it won't be sweet.<br><br>to compete effectively, the GLCs need to revamp their entire mindset and operations philosophy... its not an overnight process... u can't run  a business with bureaucrats in this day and age.<br><br>thats how i see the GLCs... monolithic, sluggish, dinosaurs.<br><br></div>
