DBS vs Merryl Lynch, Citibank and HSBC... once u remove the restrictions currently holding them back... and with the US FTA, we're set for MORE competition on home ground... it won't be sweet.<br><br>to compete effectively, the GLCs need to revamp their entire mindset and operations philosophy... its not an overnight process... u can't run  a business with bureaucrats in this day and age.<br><br>thats how i see the GLCs... monolithic, sluggish, dinosaurs.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I fully agree with the points that you stated. Though foreign MNC and technology are fully entrenched, we must still strive on... Every business got risks and competition. It all drive down to the management and whether they can attract talent to value-add to their businesses.<br><br>As for rising costs,  I think the respective authority should really do something to control and contain it. Some ppl might says that we are too dependent on the authority, and we must stand on our feets, but certain things are not controllable by us, the individual citizen. Its all bullshit to say that we must take care of ourselves on everything and not rely on the authority for spoon-feeding. Look at how the basic needs like housing and healthcare had boom logarithmly over the years comparatively to what an average individual is earning. I think there is really a growing gap among the different levels of earning.<br><br>Yes... I see that the GLC is monolithic, sluggish, dinosaurs too. I also see that the environment is so tightly controlled that individual does not have the "space" to innovate and to explore new ways of doing things. Some of them, high levels managment are ppl from the forces. This does not make sense to me... You can't drive a business like a top-down command structure like in the forces. Something is really really wrong.... Hope that the relevant authority can look at profit and loses and find ways to generate earnings and not everytime tax the common ppl. It seems like nowadays their "innovative" ways is to tax the ppl or increase prices to meet their required profit margin... If it keeps going this way... can't really imagine what will happen to our country...economically...</div>

Here is another story...<br><br><strong>More then 89,000 unemployed Singaproeans are searching for jobs, among them 13,000 are graduates. Unemployment is expected to rise above 5 per cent. Working hard or long hours for low pay or no pay may not save the job anymore. Read the story of a young graduate and his retrencehd father both on the search for job and how he feels!</strong><br><br>Early morning. I crawled out of bed and make my way to the kitchen, which is bathed in half-light. Father is reading his newspaper and having his coffee. I proceeded to take a shower. Another new day has begun.<br>I towelled myself dry and opened the toilet door. Only a newspaper and a cup of coffee, half drank and still warm, greeted me from where father was sitting just now.<br><br>He had gone out to work as a packer. A tough job no doubt what with having to stand from morning till evening. Lunch break is the only time when he can rest his tire legs.<br><br>It has been almost a year since I graduated but I am still without a proper job. My father used to think that by working hard and supporting me through university, he will have an easier life in his old age when I graduated and get a well paying job.<br><br>But with the bad times, I was not able to get a proper job and some months back, my father was retrenched from his clerical job. The income I am earning in my temp job was not enough to support the household so father had no choice but to work as a packer.<br><br>This packer job does not come easy for father. It took him months of job searching to land this job, as most times, employers will just reject father straight away when they know his age.<br><br>Just the other day, I overheard my father complaining to his friend over the phone about how tough his packer job was. I feel so sorry for father.<br><br>How I wish I could give him the luxury to finish his cup of coffee and newspaper in the morningÂ….<br><br><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, A uni degree does not guarantee much in the west as well. Germany has 11% unemployment and lots of those unemployed are degreed people.<br><br>What is important is the kind of jobs that the PAP regime create for our people. Sadly, the mentality that the PAP regime has imparted on the people is that working for people / PAP earns good money. That is definately a falsehood in every other country in the world.<br><br>In fact, some elected governments are better run by experienced people who made it successful in their own profession, who became government ministers / members because of their willingness to sacrifice their income for the good of the community.<br><br>So the "scholar" is best for our PAP regime and how they skim the cream off the top of our people is mismanagement of limited resources.<br><br>If they try to label it as following the confusian (sp) way, they are sadly mistake. In the old days, there were scholars. They spent their entire lives studying for the exams. Those who passed are made officials and judges and ministers. There are the 90% who failed. What did they do? Well, they helped out in their fathers business, became ordinary merchants etc.<br><br>But those who passed became the ruling class. They set the laws and became the judges. However, they did not become merchants. They ruled the country and dispensed justice. They did not compete with the merchant class.<br><br>So we can see that our so called scholar theory holds no water. We take the best for the government service .. that I don't agree, but the PAP can justify confusianism for that. But if they go on that path, then the PAP regime has no right to use the same scholars to lead corporations and compete with the ordinary merchants.<br><br>Thats one of the problems facing our people now. The feeling of helplessness that unless you are a scholar, you are doomed as even being a businessman will not succeed if you are a mere ordinary peon.<br><br>And the PAP regime took it one step furthur. By bringing in FT, they ensured that they get the same tax revenue without the neccessary political baggage that citizens come with.</div>
