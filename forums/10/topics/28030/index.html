Imagine if we had a hundred Predators replacing all our RPVs and we could put a few missiles into the Petronas twin towers during a war, we could have remoted controlled Bionixs or LSVs fighting in Malaysia, a perfect solution to prevent our soldiers from getting killed by Malaysians with stones shot from MiG-29s (hahahaah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ).

Is it for some rich kid living in bungalows or can it withstand weeks of jungle warfare? Sure, anyone can easily build an army of robots, but its not gonna make a very big impact. Imagine how thats gonna sound. Robots are susceptible to jamming and any kind of counter-measures you can think off. You'll have a headache upgrading lage numbers of them every year to keep them current. If you had been to USAF's website, they had an article on TASS, their automated base protection system. It is almost perfect, but the system still notifies humans to react to a threat. Why? Go figure.<br><br>Although I would love to believe that this is the way in the future, we cannot sit around and imagine whats gonna happen. As of now and the foreseeable future, humans are still the dominant force in the battlefield. Star Wars isn't exactly fact either.</div>

Thus, you can't use a manned jet like an F-16 or an F-5. Their avionics will be fried before they could escape to a safe distance. Furthermore, current non-nuclear e-bomb tends to be huge in size and limited in power. To generate such an effective EMP to disrupt a city such as KL, you probably have to drop a small generator to create an EMP and only transport aircrafts such as the Hercs and the Fokkers can carry. Thus again, to drop it using a transport plane, we are assuming a total air-superiority, no effective anti-aircraft weapon bearing on the slow flying transport planes. Drop the EMP bomb and then fly away fast enuff to aviod getting fried, etc.... too hard.<br><br>It is simpler to puchase a very small yield air-burst nuclear device that will not create much hard to people and infrastructure, but will create enuff EMP to fry everything. Armed a Standoff missile with the very small yield air-burst nuclear device and then have the delivery plane (assuming a jet like a Viper) to get out of the danger zone ASAP....<br></div>

Small, high rate of fire, and can advance against enemy fire.  It need only be the size of a racing KART, and with a substantial amount of ammunition, say 300rounds.
