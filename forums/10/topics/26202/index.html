            <div class='col-md body'>Furthermore, to your comment, an armed Skyhawk should not be called a UAV. It should be called an UCAV (Unmanned Combat Arial Vehicle). BTW, if the skyhawks are converted to UCAV, then it would be the world's second UCAV after the US's predator. I wouldn't consider IAI Harpy to be in the same category since it was meant to do a sucide attack.<br><br>I am surprised that Singapore has achieved such feat already because it is only currently that US could use UAV for combat purposes rather than just for recon or survelliance. The other UCAV is still under development by Boeing (X-45).<br><br>It is not technically impossible to convert Skyhawks to UCAV, but it would be crude though, a skyhawk drone cum UAV + weapons... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
