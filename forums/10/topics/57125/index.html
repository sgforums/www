            <div class='col-md body'>An article that was first researched and written by a Singaporean, and printed in the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 November 2002.<br><br><strong><span class="large">Why Lee Kuan Yew's world view is out of date </span></strong><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br>Sydney Morning Herald.<br>November 22, 2000<br><br>Singapore is a modern, sophisticated city state with a booming economy but its political system needs a drastic overhaul, writes Lily Zubaidah Rahim.<br><br>FEW authoritarian leaders have been willing to gracefully relinquish the reigns of power. This reluctance has been reinforced by the experiences of former leaders who have endured legal challenges, ridicule and worse. Out of power, their diminishing number of friends among Western leaders are belatedly embarrassed by the less than salutary company they used to keep.<br><br>Enter Singapore's irrepressible Lee Kuan Yew. Although never tainted with the odium of a Marcos or a Soeharto, the former prime minister of the one-party dominant state has long been a critic of liberal democracy and vociferous champion of Asian values. After relinquishing the prime ministership in 1990, the cabinet position of Senior Minister was created to ensure his political longevity.<br><br>As Senior Minister, Lee is well positioned to ensure that the political ground rules and the direction of public policy do not stray too far from the fundamentals set by him as prime minister over the previous two decades. Lee's fundamentals include the minimisation of state welfare spending, maintaining the numerical dominance of the Chinese community, sustaining a formidable military establishment that is technologically second to none in South-East Asia, maintaining the political hegemony of the People's Action Party (PAP) and its corporatist relations with pivotal groups in civil society.<br><br>Paternalistically cautioning Singaporeans of his political immortality lest they drift too far into the fanciful realms of overturning the PAP's fundamentals, Lee warned in the late 1980s: "<strong><span style="color: blue;">Those of you who believe that when I have left the government as prime minister that I have gone into permanent retirement should have their heads examined</span></strong>."<br><br>Observers of Indonesian politics are aware that some of Soeharto's advisers were tinkering with Lee's ingenious model for ensuring political longevity many years before his ouster. However, adopting the Lee model would not have saved Soeharto due to his inability to fulfil a key prerequisite: widespread public and market perception of passing the leadership baton with a robust economy in place.<br><br>In Malaysia, to the north of Singapore, recent statements made by senior politicians of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) suggest that the Lee model is being seriously considered to allow the Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, to eventually leave the position without fear of retribution, stemming from the handling of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's sacking and subsequent conviction. If adopted, the Lee model is unlikely to succeed in Malaysia because of the dynamics within UMNO, distinguishing it from the highly centralised and controlled, technocrat-led PAP in Singapore. Furthermore, despite Mahathir's economic achievements, his standing within the party and particularly within the Malay community has been marred by his vindictive humiliation of Anwar. In traditional Malay political culture, a leader may undermine and marginalise his or her political enemy, but never in an overtly humiliating manner.<br><br>In Singapore, the humiliation suffered by the more adversarial opposition politicians and former PAP leaders, who have dared to transgress the parameters of the politically permissible, is very much a part of the political culture. They have been soundly humiliated by the casting of aspersions on their personalities and private lives and through lawsuits which have left many financially and professionally ruined. The risky nature of venturing into opposition politics has been clearly conveyed to Singaporeans.<br><br>Lee is in Australia to promote the second volume of his memoir, From Third World to First. It has been applauded particularly by the more conservative politicians and academics from the "realist" school of international relations. Not surprisingly, a doyen of this school, Henry Kissinger, has contributed a foreword. Typical of their beliefs is a reliance on a strong military capability. Alarmingly, Singapore's continued arms build-up and joint military research and arms production with Israel have assisted in fuelling regional insecurity and precipitating an arms race. <strong><span style="color: blue;">In the arguably more complicated post-Cold War environment of international and regional politics, Lee's appraisal of international politics may be somewhat outdated</span></strong>.<br><br>Generally received with circumspection, particularly in the more democratic East Asian nations, the warm response accorded to Lee by various quarters in the West is all the more remarkable. No doubt the projection of Singapore as a modern, secular, industrialised nation with a GNP per capita figure that has long surpassed nations like Australia and Britain, and its energetic promotion of trade liberalisation, has won Lee and the PAP government considerable admiration. At a time when the regional economic crisis has sapped the enthusiasm by the less industrialised nations for trade liberalism, Singapore's support for the free-trade agenda of the WTO, ASEAN Free Trade Area and APEC has remained unshakable.<br><br>Singapore's free trade agreement with Australia is in tandem with other bilateral free-trade agreements it has signed with Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, the United States, Canada and Japan. By blending these bilateral trade agreements into larger regional trade accords, the Singapore government hopes to accelerate the process of trade liberalisation. Singapore has also proven to be a reliable champion of Australia's interests within ASEAN.<br><br>Lee's political longevity has allowed him to assume the role of a cultural filter and diplomatic bridge between East and West. However, some words of caution for those from the West hoping to understand East Asia through the lens of Lee, who represents the East Asia of the past. Most of the more industrialised societies of East Asia have begun to move away from Singapore's authoritarian political structures towards greater pluralism. <strong><span style="color: red;">Singapore may be economically First World but its political system is more akin to authoritarian Third World nations</span></strong>. Paradoxically, Lee and the PAP Government are fast developing a reputation as political recalcitrants and regional laggards.<br><br>Lily Zubaidah Rahim, the author of The Singapore Dilemma (OUP Press, 1998 ) , lectures at Sydney University's School of Economics and Political Science.<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/001122sm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/001122sm.htm</a></div>

Favourite excuses for crimping public view of economic data include national security and the public interest.<br><br><strong>More often, these mask inefficiency and outright coercion</strong>.<br><br><strong>Socialist states were heavily information retentive and paid the price in economic efficiency</strong>, as poor-performing companies are reliable cover-up merchants. But drawing a line between public interest and data voyeurism is no easy task.<br><br>Singapore, a capitalist metropolis in socialist drag, offers an interesting case in point.<br><br>Recently, it chose to loosen up and go with the market-economy flow. That has seen public utilities partially privatised, regulation loosened and less moral hectoring by a government wanting to encourage a free-thinking, "knowledge-based" future.<br><br>This has not been easy. <span style="color: blue;">High-cost Singapore is heavily exposed to the global electronics slump and is seeing foreign companies exit to cheaper locations</span>. This cyclical downturn has hit economic growth hard and, arguably, portends a deeper malaise in the city's statist development track. <span style="color: blue;">The general public suspects trouble ahead and is politely asking for greater economic transparency</span>. <span style="color: red;">The official response last week was a resolute refusal</span>.<br><br>Central to Singapore's planned economy is the state's ability to capture an astonishingly high share of private-sector savings, which are invested by government agencies such as the Government Investment Corporation (GIC). <span style="color: blue;">These surpluses are the result of taxation, forced social-security payments and sterilised foreign-exchange reserves</span>.<br><br>In recent weeks, Singapore's letter-to-the-editor writers have called for greater transparency in GIC's holdings and performance. In response to an opposition parliamentarian's calls to open the books, Lee Hsien Loong, the Deputy Prime Minister and chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, fired back: "It [the Government] does not stand up and say, 'Here are all the things; here are all the data; here are my national secrets; here are my defence secrets; here are my foreign-policy moves; and here are my innermost reserves'."<br><br>The performance was vintage. Asked to cast light on the public-asset accounts, <span style="color: red;">he invoked the mantle of defender against barbarian hordes</span>. <strong>In short, he engaged in <span style="color: red;">absurd exaggeration</span></strong>.<br><br>Last week at a press conference, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew was queried on the same topic by the South China Morning Post's Southeast Asian correspondent. Mr Lee was equally firm in rebutting disclosure. The following day, a Straits Times columnist inveighed against the Post's question to Mr Lee, invoking racist language and arguing that secrecy at GIC was a matter of national interest.<br><br>The average Singaporean - like his counterpart anywhere - cares little about such details of governance. But he does worry when he cannot fund his retirement and suspects his savings have been squandered. That might sound harsh, as Singapore has clearly done more right than wrong. Its economic success is real, even if civil liberties have been abused.<br><br>Yet the call for greater disclosure comes at a time when the deferred costs of Singapore's planned economy are coming home to roost.<br><br><strong>GIC is a government fund manager with a reported US$100 billion (about HK$780 billion) under its charge. Among other things, it manages part of the country's US$80 billion foreign-exchange reserves. Its operations are secretive and its accounts are not disclosed</strong>.<br><br>Other than revealing a basic asset allocation among equities, bonds and cash, little is revealed. Performance is monitored by a council of government insiders.<br><br><strong>The general public suspects reserves might have been wasted following the post-1997 Asian crisis. <span style="color: red;">A secret S$17 billion (about HK$73 billion) loan to Indonesia, made in 1998, was publicly revealed only after former Indonesian president Suharto blurted out the fact of its existence to foreign journalists</span>. In another case, there has been scant disclosure of losses on a failed investment park in Suzhou, China, which has been largely swept under the carpet. Meaningful disclosure, such as it is, occurs when required by regulators in foreign jurisdictions. </strong><br><br>Of immediate concern to most Singaporeans is the state of their Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts. An average of 30 per cent to 40 per cent of total wages have been forcibly extracted into government-administered coffers over the past few decades, but the average CPF account holder has sufficient money to fund just a few years of retirement at the average wage.<br><br>There are two reasons for this. First, individuals can draw down their CPF accounts to fund housing purchases and other social needs, such as health care. Second, balances kept to fund retirement - about S$90 billion at present - yielded a real return of zero between 1987 and 1997, according to Mukul Asher, a National University of Singapore economics professor who is a world expert in the field. <strong>Last year, an International Monetary Fund report called for radical reform of Singapore's CPF system</strong>.<br><br><strong>Last week, Senior Minister Lee was at pains to stress that <span style="color: red;">GIC fund managers did not manage CPF funds</span>[/color]</strong>. That surprised academics in the field, who have long ssumed CPF funds and fiscal reserves are essentially interchangeable because both are invested in government-linked companies and schemes.<strong> The point is the strategic fog maintained around economic data makes it impossible to verify such statements and, more importantly, to monitor the Government's performance record.</strong><br><br>Extract savings on cheap terms and force-feed a planned industrial economy, and unsurprisingly, growth is achieved. This was the basis of criticism in the mid-1990s - based on Singapore's awful total factor productivity - of the city's growth track. Far from being dispelled, such criticism is only reinforced by unnecessary secrecy about data which, if made available for examination, could provide a more complete picture of economic performance.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Hong Kong resembles Singapore in having substantial reserves confiscated from the private sector. To date, these have been managed in a relatively transparent manner.<br><br>Encouragingly, the SAR Government has agreed to put its own accounts on a fully transparent accrual basis. The Government also faces pressure to give back some of its surplus through public expenditure </span></strong> .<br><br>There are valuable arguments either way for fiscal largesse. Whatever is decided in Hong Kong, Singapore offers a salutory lesson in how not to manage public assets. <strong><span style="color: blue;">The city's refusal to open government accounts to scrutiny seems less a matter of national security than of concern that transparency would reveal the Government's investment performance for all to see</span></strong>.<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010606sc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010606sc.htm</a><br><br>Related Reference:<br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010516a3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010516a3.htm</a><br><br></div>

No one in the region would want to threaten the British occupying it or even interested in the concept. They won't even need a paternalistic figure.<br><br>Singapore is an all different ball game, surrounded by countries who felt the large Chinese population here is an affront to their dignity in its early days and would have liked nothing but to see the little island nation crumble. Not to mention since the British were pulling out, investors no longer felt assured their investments would have been protected in a country with such hostile surroundings.<br><br>Personally i like LKY for the way his mind works, a rarity of politicians globally. But i do not neccesarily agree that at his age he should have stayed in politics, any fool could tell you that to allow the old to remain in power indefinitely would stagnate the progress of the country.<br><br>Yes, i do agree the media currently is too conversative, only chosing to display articles that are pro government or airing interviews that show their interviewees agreeing with what the government did.(Come on, 4.5 percent of the working population think that way? highly unlikely.) I do not trust the numbers that the government sources have given either, it's too easily manipulatable(sp? XD).<br><br>But, would we have gone so far without LKY? I think it's highly unlikely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Stevenson101, great to see your post again.<br><br>While Hong Kong may be close to China, and it may serve as Hong KongÂ’s hinterland, I doubt very much if the trade figures between the two Â“countriesÂ” amount to a large portion of Hong KongÂ’s annual economic performance.<br><br>Similarly, SingaporeÂ’s Â“hinterlandÂ” is the regional countries around it, with Singapore being the main Â“entrepotÂ” serving this entire region since the founding by Raffles. Singapore's trade figures with the region is not as significant as its figures with the regions beyond South-east Asia.<br><br>Hong Kong links to the World is largely similar to Singapore, which became more essential when the political pressures onto the economic world forced Singapore to leap frog over the heads of the immediate region, and linked Singapore to the World Economic Grid. Likewise, Hong Kong had been doing the same since its founding by the British.<br><br>When the British pulled out, there were different type of uncertainties felt by the locals associated with the British Military(whose concerns were more to do about the future of their rice bowls), and those not economically associated in the activities of the British Military and employed by the local and foreign factory owners (concerns more with political and security arrangements).<br><br>It is obvious that the difference is quite marked between the two groups in Singapore Society.<br><br>Those already employed in the Â“Civilian SectorÂ” were only nervous about the future political and security arrangements only, as Singapore was already kicked out of Malaysia, and the early security arrangement with Malaysia, was that both had depended on UK for military defense.<br><br>The Politicians of early Singapore were economic Â“green hornsÂ” and were not looked up very much by the local business community during SingaporeÂ’s early politics.<br><br>Just as Singapore is presently moving into a transitory phase of economic problems Â– (that have been referred as being similar to the days experienced when UK announced its military withdrawal from the Far East) Â– our Political Leaders are groping around in the dark, experimenting with hopeful CPF cuts to revive the economy.<br><br>However, in the Private World of Commerce and Industry, the Tai Pans have already foreseen the economic numbers and have already made their moves five years ago. Some have reinvested elsewhere, others have retrenched and retooled, more have redirected resources to other growth areas.<br><br>The worlds of politics and commerce work at different pace.<br><br>LKY has admitted that he is only the Point Man in his team of First Generation Leaders, and will obviously take the spotlight in guiding his Â“platoonÂ” safely through a war zone, and getting it out of several Â“skirmish and ambushesÂ”.<br><br>However, the Point Man alone does not win the war alone, and had the backing of the fire power and survival will of the entire Â“Platoon personnel, Rear Forces, Upper Echelon and Reserves ForcesÂ”.<br><br>From the manner in which political transition is formulated, and the manner in which political power is held, there seems to imply that Singapore has become the real estate of the First Family. No other Singaporean seems to be capable, suitable, trustworthy enough, to take on the positions that are occupied by the Â“FamilyÂ” and Â“close or distant RelationsÂ”.<br><br>The ever growing concern is that when LKY is no longer around, can the supposed safeguards that are in the hands of the Â“First FamilyÂ” remain intact to serve its original intended and declared purpose ? Will the system be abused to stifle the ability of any Government formed by any other Party ? Will such a system serve Singaporeans, who vote another Party to form the Government ?<br><br>At 80, LKYÂ’s declared continuation to be in politics has made headlines worldwide, from Beijing to New York, Tokyo to New Delhi, and across Europe.<br><br>Does it serve Singapore well ? If he should suddenly depart from the life of Singapore, will that not prove to be a greater shock and create another crisis of confidence again ?<br><br>If the system is already said to be working well, and Â“capableÂ” leaders are already at the helm, why should LKY continue with his political participation in the forefront of SingaporeÂ’s politics ?<br><br>Just as GCT "needed" LKYÂ’s Â“adviseÂ” to deal with the Opposition, and prodded into taking tough and severe legal reaction to bankrupt any Opposition, LKYÂ’s continued existence is to protect LHL from any possible unruly behavior from within the Party, or externally from local Opposition and from Other Countries.<br><br>Is this good for politics in Singapore in the Twenty First Century ?<br></div>

In my opinion it is a tool to <strong>fight threats to Singapore, NOT threats to the Ruling Party.</strong> Have the ISA overseen by a panel of member of the judiciary, lawyers and ordinary citizens (at least all of the last 2 groups must be WITHOUT any affiliation to ANY political party). And open all of its decisions regarding the detention of an individual open to public scrutiny with the publication in public domain full, unabridged reports of the panels decision. It'll take some reading to read all, but at the very least, it'll reassure some of the fears about the tranparency of the whole system<br><br>Modify the Elections Act. This is another point Atobe has made in the past and I fully agree with. Some points, again not exhaustive<br><br>- Set up a truly INDEPENDENT Elections Commission to oversee General Elections<br>- Allow the Elected President fulfil his stated role as one of the 2 Keys overseeing the Reserves.<br>- Extend the minimum campaigning period to at least 21 days from the present 9.<br>- Switch of a system of Proportional Representation for Parlimentary Elections<br>- Liberalise the media, with independent organisations being allowed to run their own media organisations with minimal (but present) <strong>independent </strong>watchdog oversight.<br><br>It'll dilute the power of the Ruling Party, but without the tilted playing field we have now, we can truly see what they are made of. Or are they afraid to find out?<br><br>Another positive effect it will have on Singaporeans as a whole would be to forment a sense of belonging and identity, as they would be able to feel like they have a say in their country's and their own future.<br><br>The fact that Singapore, despite its relative wealth, boasts one of the highest net migration rates in the world, along with polls suggesting a lot more would like to join them, speaks volumes about the above issue.<br></div>

If one sheep starts walking the wrong direction, the rest of the herd will follow.We must correct them immediately before anything happens.However, they must not be a tool of any political party.Thankfully, i have not seen any sevear misuse of power yet.<br><br>/*At least ONE Percent of annual surplus will be set aside for the benefit of the under-privilege and the aged. */<br><br>This is not a very good solution.As you know, we are becoming an aging population, If we keep giving funds to the aged , it will tax the workning class.I rather that we educate the public to put aside  some money every year, rather then we, trying to pay for them.trust me, Japan had implemented such a system, 30 years ago, when their population is growing, such a system could be implemented. However, now, the working class are burdened.I suggest that you think of an alternative system.<br><br>As for the rest rest, i can't comment because i don't know how to comment.So forgive me over that.<br><br></div>

If one sheep starts walking the wrong direction, the rest of the herd will follow.We must correct them immediately before anything happens.However, they must not be a tool of any political party.Thankfully, i have not seen any sevear misuse of power yet.<br><br>/*At least ONE Percent of annual surplus will be set aside for the benefit of the under-privilege and the aged. */<br><br>This is not a very good solution.As you know, we are becoming an aging population, If we keep giving funds to the aged , it will tax the workning class.I rather that we educate the public to put aside  some money every year, rather then we, trying to pay for them.trust me, Japan had implemented such a system, 30 years ago, when their population is growing, such a system could be implemented. However, now, the working class are burdened.I suggest that you think of an alternative system.<br><br>As for the rest rest, i can't comment because i don't know how to comment.So forgive me over that.<br></div></blockquote>Congratulations, CenturionMBT for your wonderful contribution, it is good that we can all make some effort - in each of our own ways - to improve our environment, even if it is within the confines of this sgForums.<br><br>Your opinions are very much respected, and while I do not wish to change your position, perhaps I can offer an alternative point of view concerning the ONE Percent of Annual Surplus for the sake of the Aged.<br><br>While I can accept your views concerning the responsibility of every individual to plan for one's retirements, you must appreciate that there remains a large group of elderly - at present - who have "missed the boat" in preparing for their retirement.<br><br>These are already in the age group of 65 years to 75 years, and from the various Charity Homes for the Aged, you will be surprised how many are actually placed in these Homes - which the Singapore Government DO NOT support in any way.<br><br>If you should visit the Charity Homes for the Aged, the majority of the Aged are from the lower income groups, in which almost everyone in the household has to eke out a meagre income to survive, with some having to take on extra second jobs.<br><br>With everyone in the household having to work, how can they look after their older folks ?<br><br>Their meagre incomes that they have, will need to be contributed to the Charity Homes to allow these Homes to take in the Aged from their family - with medical attention and medication being minimally charged at a token sum.<br><br>Those who are in the early 50's would have been working since at least the last 30 years, and would have a substantial sum in their CPF, unless the bulk is spent on the HDB Flat - with the Government soaking up the money.<br><br>What about those in the early 50's that do not hold any steady jobs for the last 30 years ?

            <div class='col-md body'>But after this scheme is implemented, there are chances that more old folks would rush down to homes, either to relieve their children of their financial burden or to simply get an income without raising a finger.If that is a case, wouldn't the working people get bogged down with an extra burden?Besides, we have charity shows every year with collects up to 5 million annually.So itsn't this enough?</div>
