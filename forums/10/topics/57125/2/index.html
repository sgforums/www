Doesn't that sound like a fair deal?<br><br>After decades of working for the good of the the country, contributing to the economy, when workers retire, and have no family support network to fall back on isn't it time for the country to give something back? Yes, there are the welfare homes and children, but whats wrong with the country doing its bit too to help older folks. They've spent decades supporting the system, isn't it time for the system to give something back after they retire?<br><br>Like the Chinese saying goes, 'Mei you gong lao, ye you ku lao' (Even if there are no achievements, there is also effort)<br><br>As for encouraging people into increasing savings, the forced+voluntary savings rate in Singapore is already the world's highest. How much more do you expect people to save?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If ever the economy should slip and go into negative growth, then perhaps a cut amounting to a quarter of the Million Dollar and super scale salaries - from every minister, minister of states, permanent secretaries, and all the super scale salaried Civil Servants - will be justified, and can help make lives easier for the maintenance of the Old Folks Homes.<br><br>Do you know how many ministers we have to-date (with and without Portfolios), as well as Minister of States ?<br><br>If the Government believe that we can get by with a diet of a dish of cheap ikan kurau (or even ikan belis), kangkong and porridge on a daily basis, then why are we paying million dollar salaries, while the rest of the population earn less than ONE Percent of that amount ?<br><br>Seriously, do you think that negative growth in our budget can occur ?<br><br>It is a numbers game, with the amount of funds that the Government has to "play with" - coming from all the GLCs - and categorised as "surplusses" in holding accounts all over the place.<br><br>It is little wonder that when the late President Ong Teng Cheong requested for an accounting of the Reserves that he was supposed to look after, there was so much 'hee-hawing' from the Government.<br><br>When GST was first implemented, the result after the first year was so embarrassingly and shockingly good that the ex-Finance Minister Richard Hu had to recommend a "refund" by way of the Singapore Shares.<br><br>This is to make peace with Singaporeans by giving out Singapore Shares from time to time.<br><br>At the end of the day, if we cannot look after so many old folks in the Charity Homes for the Aged, perhaps the salary that is paid to SM LKY can go a longer way to support the many instead of supporting one 80 Year Old, who surely do not need so much money in the twilight years of his active and already prosperous life ?<br><br></div>
