Every 5 years we can have an election but the same people will be elected as there is no one of substance left to stand for election now.<br><br>Our original westminister democracy has been taken over by a new system based on legal manipulations by men with GRCs, depolisation, co-option and machination put in to ensure the same party will always be re-elected for formality to serve the narrow interests of those who happened to believe their supremity to run the country.<br><br>Individuals cannot do anything and no one will be able to remove the whole artificial barriers erected to perpetuate the power rule. Right or wrong let the people finally be the judge. But for now they cannot do anything.<br><br>There is no more free election as no individuals will ever freely exercise their right to elect whom they want. Every candidate will be produced by the new system with no alternative as it is too late now to find people to serve. All political talentsco-opted, depoliticised or squashed or banished.<br><br>The free market forces, lasses faire or boh cheng hoo assume that people still have certain free will or choice but in our case people are no longer able to exercise any will.<br><br>Democracy can be hijacked and taken over by power. Can anyone changed the power rule. My guess is it is too late now to salvage the situation.</div>
