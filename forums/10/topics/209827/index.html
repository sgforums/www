            <div class='col-md body'>A little write-up from Ex-Teacher Lee Seck Kay:<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>How's the sports school doing? Ministry should have a report on it</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Your report 'RGS top girls' sports school for third year' (ST, Sept <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> should worry many parents and the Sports School authority. It would seem that its students are far from being the creme de la creme of sports expected of such an institution.<br><br>If the RGS girls can beat their counterparts in the Sports School three years in succession, something must be wrong with its delivery system. I wonder how its boys are doing when compared to those in say, Chinese High or Raffles Institution.<br><br>With all its state-of-the-art facilities and top-notch coaches at the disposal of students who were admitted because of their sports talent, shouldn't they be setting new standards in sports for the rest to emulate?<br><br>The Sports School was set up at high cost to enable students to excel in sports without compromising their studies. One wonders to what extent these measurable objectives have been achieved, and if not, what are the obstacles and proposed actions?<br><br>It will not do if the Sports School eventually turns out to be no better than schools such as those named above that never fail to impress with their sports and academic performances.<br><br>The whole creative effort would have been in vain, let alone the high costs involved and loss of credibility. In the years since its inception in 2003, the Sports School must have established milestones through both its sports and acdemic programmes, achievements that could support its continued viability.<br><br>I suggest that the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports produce a report to highlight these and the institution's standing vis-a-vis other schools.<br><br>This report should come out soon and as it would be of public interest, it should be made freely available.<br><br>Lee Seck Kay</span><br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:8640610b7cb9d010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">Reference</a><br><br>While Lee has posted some really good points that give pause for thought, i believe he has marginalised the fact that SSS is already producing some quality talents in Swimming, Sailing and Fencing.<br><br>RGS has managed, on an overall basis, to maintain their stranglehold on sports <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>as a whole</strong></span>, not <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">individually</span></strong>. This means that RGS is impressively consistent in all sports but not consistently impressive in most of them. That is where the SSS outperforms their rivals.<br><br>That fact that an elite school like RGS retains their sporting prowess points to an underlying innuendo that indicates that while our youth continue to excel at sports, their intrinsic goal remains to get a first class education; and when that happens, sports will have to take a back seat.<br><br>It is not the system that has 'failed', but rather the mindset and stereotype of parents and youths alike, that still insist on a recognized paper degree, first and foremost. That mindset will take years to change.</div>
