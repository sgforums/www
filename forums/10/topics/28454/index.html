            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, Singapore is no likeable pretty Prom Queen either. Malaysians dislike us for historical and economic reasons. Aussies and US etc think that we are some sort of police state until they needed our help in countering Al Qaeda terrorism in the region.

Our diplomats are answerable to our own people as well.<br><blockquote><br>just as hosts are obligated to honour their guests, guests are expected to pay common courtesy to their hosts and not insult them. they arrived late, abruptly changed the agenda and left without eating the meals we, as hosts prepared for them. u call that good manners?<br></blockquote>What about LKY going on diplomatic visits to the former Soviet Union when Singapore is still a part of Malaysia?
