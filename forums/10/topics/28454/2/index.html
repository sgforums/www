Sg is short of men due to declining birth rate, but we do not need to double the pool of human resource by conscripting women. thats overkill.<br></div></blockquote>What for? To cope with a dire shortage of manpower in services such as nursing, the logistical/service arm of the SAF and other areas. Neither Sudaimiki, nor many guys in Singapore, are calling for women commandoes in the SAF or anything like that. Wouldn't conscripting Singaporean women into non-combat vocations in the army, or into the civilian sectors such as nursing serve the purpose of freeing up more men into combat vocations as well making up manpower shortfall? And if NS is so good for fostering national identity like its proponents always claim it does(very subjective IMO), why foster national identity in Singaporean men and not women?<br><br>I've said it before and wil say it again. IMO AWARE, as an organisation fighting for equal rights for women in Singapore, has lost all credibility in my eyes when they consistently speak up against NS for women in Singapore. In fact, a while back, their webite even had articles condemning the award of points for entry requirements into university for men who have served NS. The cheek! Its when they say things like that when they prove themselves to be nothing but a group of sexist, militant, men-hating feminists whose sole agenda is to fight for special treatment (as opposed to equality) for women.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against equal rights for women, and I'm not a MCP whose idea for women is to stay at home to peel prawns and make babies for their men, but the bottom line is, inequality towards men is just as bad as inequality towarrds women.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yah,  Sudaimiki...<br><br>About your country's NS. While I agree that it is intended for nation building purposes, it still poses a danger to Sg, reason being that My is providing training for your people (even women) and indoctrinating them to give their lives for Malaysia. Thus, although My is not exactly training them to be line troops, what they are doing is to create large numbers of trained, motivated guerilla fighters. Since our country relies on conscripts and reservists, a long guerilla war with My will eventually lead to heavy casualties for Sg. So I believe you can understand our concerns.<br><br>On the other hand, there may be some problems for you, too. There will be the traditional resistance to soldiering, especiallyfrom the chinese. Also, have you ever considered the possibility of NS benefiting islamic extremists by providing trained, impressionable recruits?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
