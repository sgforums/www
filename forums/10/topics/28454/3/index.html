While I agree that it is intended for nation building purposes, it still poses a danger to Sg, reason being that My is providing training for your people (even women) and indoctrinating them to give their lives for Malaysia. Thus, although My is not exactly training them to be line troops, what they are doing is to create large numbers of trained, motivated guerilla fighters. Since our country relies on conscripts and reservists, a long guerilla war with My will eventually lead to heavy casualties for Sg. So I believe you can understand our concerns.<br></div></blockquote>Any war with My will ultimately lead to heavy casualties not only on Sg side, but on My side as well. If possible, we would like to avoid a war at all cost as well. Battling JI would be a more viable task at hand. About the point of indocutrination, I believe that Sg should be doing the same thing as well...think of it more as a reminder that we should do more for our country and have a nation before self thinking.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Typhoon:</div><div class="quote_body">On the other hand, there may be some problems for you, too. There will be the traditional resistance to soldiering, especiallyfrom the chinese. Also, have you ever considered the possibility of NS benefiting islamic extremists by providing trained, impressionable recruits?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>I believe that Sg faced similar resistance towards soldiering during 1967 but gradually, people come to realise it as a part of life. I believe it would be the same for My. The point on islamic extremists is not that viable...if so Singapore with their more rigourous trainning of troops would provide a even more fertile area for such impressionable minds. The onus to educate these minds lies with the proper religious authorities, that is to impart to them proper islamic values. Otherwise, if one wants to follow the extremist code, he could easily get recruited by JI and they would give him or her trainning that is far more suited to their purpose.<br><br>This is another anser to your point on indoctriation. By doing so, in the long run, races will gell together and would crease to view each other with suspicion if they are working towards a common good.</div>
