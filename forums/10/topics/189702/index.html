            <div class='col-md body'>Asia<br><br>Lee, With Less Support, Gets Singapore `Wake-Up Call'<br><br>May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Singaporeans returned Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to power with a smaller share of the vote at weekend elections, signaling a growing appetite for political change in the city-state, analysts said.<br><br>The People's Action Party, which has ruled since 1959, won 67 percent of votes cast on May 6, down from 75 percent at the last election in 2001.<br><br>While the economic policies of the People's Action Party have entrenched Singaporeans as the wealthiest in Southeast Asia, voters took a stand on domestic issues, personal liberty and the expense of day-to-day life, analysts said. The country's government has been criticized by groups including Human Rights Watch and billionaire George Soros, who have called for fewer restrictions on speech and political lobbying.<br><br>Young voters ``want more than just economic stability,'' said Dr. Terence Chong, a fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. ``They want political openness and most importantly, more opposition in parliament, hence the overall good showing of the opposition this time round.''<br><br>Opposition groups for the first time since 1988 mustered enough candidates to prevent the People's Action Party from being reinstated without a vote. The government won 82 of 84 seats in Parliament.<br><br>`Change'<br><br>``Perhaps Singaporeans would like the style of government to change,'' said Jeanne Conceicao, research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies in Singapore. ``People are trying to get them to cut the cost of living. We can expect programs on this in months to come.''<br><br>Last month, Lee Kuan Yew, founder of modern Singapore, said the gap between the city's rich and poor was an ``increasing problem'' that might persist for a decade.<br><br>The government's election campaign, which highlighted the lowest unemployment rate in more than four years and the country's growth prospects, was overshadowed by lawsuits against senior members of the rival Singapore Democratic Party and a spat with opposition candidate James Gomez.<br><br>Gomez, the subject of a police investigation over complaints made by the elections department, was part of a Workers' Party group competing in the government-held constituency of Aljunied. Though Gomez and four colleagues failed to dislodge a team that included Foreign Minister George Yeo, the reduced margin of victory may have concerned the People's Action Party, at least one analyst said.<br><br>`Wake-up Call'<br><br>The Workers' Party in Aljunied drew 44 percent of the vote. In 1997, the government took 67 percent of votes in the area. The district is a so-called Group Representation Constituency, which may have as many as six members of parliament. In 2001, Aljunied was unopposed.<br><br>``The PAP nearly lost a GRC,'' said Conceicao. ``If a GRC is lost, it would be a wake-up call to all. In fact, because it was such a close call in Aljunied, we've woken up already.''<br><br>A Workers' Party victory in Aljunied would have more than doubled the opposition's seats in Parliament. The result suggests the electorate needs only a ``credible opposition'' in the future to give the government ``a run for its money,'' said Conceicao.<br><br>In the two seats retained by the opposition, Hougang and Potong Pasir, the government's share of the vote declined, even after it wooed voters with accommodation upgrades.<br><br>``The electorate is clearly telling the government they are willing to exercise their vote,'' said Antonio Rappa, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. ``The PAP will have to pay attention to local issues. In future, the battle will be tougher.''<br><br>`Very Strong Mandate'<br><br>Prime Minister Lee called the election result ``a very strong mandate.'' It was hard to take the two opposition seats because Singaporeans had a ``natural loyalty'' to incumbents, he said.<br><br>About 94 percent of the 1.22 million Singaporeans who live in contested electorates voted. There were no polls in areas where opposition candidates did not stand.<br><br>The electoral system allows for extra seats to be provided in Parliament. As many as three members of the opposition and nine others unconnected to any parties may be selected.<br><br>The People's Action Party, after securing its 11th straight victory, is seeking to freshen its appeal with new candidates. After this year's election, 80 percent of lawmakers will be those who entered Parliament after 1997, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said.<br><br>The ruling party aims to bring in more than 20 new candidates at the next election, Prime Minister Lee said at a press conference.<br><br>The Asian Network for Free Elections yesterday recommended that the government create an independent elections department, make vote-counting accessible to the public, and liberalize the country's media.<br><br>Victory Margin<br><br>The margin of Lee's victory was the second-largest since 1980.<br><br>``I don't think this is the kind of result that will lead to much softening or reform,'' said Diane Mauzy, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who has written on politics in Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>``This is really a pretty solid performance by the PAP and they must be secretly quite pleased and relieved,'' she said. ``The only way the opposition can improve its position is if the PAP runs into trouble, as dominant parties sometimes do.''<br><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&amp;sid=ah.rCt6B1HR0&amp;refer=asia" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&amp;sid=ah.rCt6B1HR0&amp;refer=asia</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If they can do something about the cost of HDB housing to bring it down to levels closer to what public housing should be like, it will immediately lighten the burden to at least 80% of Singaporeans which will then bring down the cost of living significantly.<br><br>But this is a very complicated economics problem which is a lot more complex than just reducing the sale price of HDB flats.

Only they are unwilling to do so. They can:<br><br>1) reduce the price of water since many of us are either unemployed or underemployed. Moreover the price of water we buy from Malaysia has not changed, at 3 Malaysian cens, since we started buying from them forty years ago!<br><br>2) reduce or abolish the water conservation tax -  this will bring down the utility bill<br><br>3) reduce the petrol tax -  this will reduce the utility bill; for those who drive, reduce their expenses; for cabbies, reduce their cost.<br><br>4) disallow transport fares hike when the transport companies are making handsome profits.<br><br>5) disallow the hike in university fees when the reason given is something as bizarre as "it is a gobal phenomenon"<br><br>6) stop increasing the S&amp;C charges when the opposition wards are able to maintain theirs.<br><br>there are many more.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But this is a very complicated economics problem which is a lot more complex than just reducing the sale price of HDB flats. A crash in property prices is no small matter to national economy...</blockquote>That is exactly the problem...a crash in HDB and property prices will also mean the poor will have to pay more out of the pocket because the mortgage value on their flat would have dropped. If you cannot afford to top up to service your loan, you may lose your flat AND be sued by the bank.<br><br>Singaporeans who are baying for lower property prices might not have taken that into consideration.</div>

We should reduce our reliance on water bought from KL for our own national security.

There must be a tax to discourage activities that pollute the environment. Petrol tax should be increased but those who drive hybrid and electric cars should have their petrol tax greatly reduced.</span><br><br>4) disallow transport fares hike when the transport companies are making handsome profits.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Agree</span><br><br>5) disallow the hike in university fees when the reason given is something as bizarre as "it is a gobal phenomenon<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Agree. Undergrads in NUS and NTU are getting a raw deal. The hike in fees is necessary to attract top researchers to Singapore but students should not pay the price for that. Most of these researchers spend more time on their research than teaching students anyway.</span><br><br>6) stop increasing the S&amp;C charges when the opposition wards are able to maintain theirs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Agree. Although the way to lower charges might be to employ more foreign talent who accept low wages. You are prepared for that?</span><br></div>
