            <div class='col-md body'>Foreign NGOs can hold protests but not locals<br><br>The Straits Times<br>March 11, 2005<br><br>I AM surprised that the Government has allowed 300 accredited foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to hold peaceful protests and demonstrations during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Summit to be held in the Republic next year.<br><br>This contrasts sharply with the ban that the police imposed on attempts by ordinary Singaporeans to stage peaceful demonstrations, particularly in the recent protests against the US war on Iraq.<br><br>More recently, the application for women's groups to hold a walk in support of the White Ribbon Campaign on violence against women was also denied. In reply to a query by a foreign journalist recently, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong stated that Singapore is too small to allow public protests and demonstrations which would have clogged the streets.<br><br>While I am not against these NGOs, I am disappointed that the Government is practising double standards by allowing foreigners to stage demonstrations, a right rarely granted to Singaporeans.<br><br>Liew Kai Khiun<br>London, United Kingdom<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>And we wonder why us locals feel so aggreived.This is clear equivocation and a sham.</div>

All the passengers and crew of that flight were evacuated to search for the bomb and the flight was delayed for over an hour. Recently a local was jailed for 2.5 years for a similar offence on SMRT though no passengers were evacuated and the train was not delayed at all. Maybe our local had no money to pay the govt.<br>There are many more such cases.<br><br>In Singapore locals are 2nd class citizens.</div>
