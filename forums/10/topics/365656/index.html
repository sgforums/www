              <p>hey hey</p>
              <p>it is a great insult to me that i am not included.Count me in!!</p>
              <p>1.FYI,a dog here is better a lion in other country..</p>
              <p>2.PAP is not perfect yet,like other gavaman.</p>
              <p>Tell me which nation is better than SG ''IN OVER ALL''.</p>
              <p>Dunt just pick small matters to compare.</p>
              <p>Just tell me which nation currently is better than SG in over all.</p>
              <p>Then i look at it and see i am eligible migrate there...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.Take public debt as example (debts borne by governemnt)</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>Tell me which country can be Net Public Debt free,like current SG.</p>
              <p>i think u know almost all First world countries are bearing heavy Net public debt</p>
              <p>ie Gross assests <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>less</em> </span>gross debts.</p>
              <p>I think SG may be one of very few vountries in the world</p>
              <p>is Net Debt Free!!</p>
              <p>Pl note currently SG Gross Public debt is near 100% of GDP.</p>
              <p>Dunt just quote without thinking,like CSJ!!</p>
              <p>He also made mistake in this Public Debt issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But this debt has not been spent,like other countries which borrow and spend.</p>
              <p>This is just to pay interest to CPF holders.</p>
              <p>CPF Board cannot take risks to invest and get profits to pay you</p>
              <p>the interest fr 3.5 to 5 %.Right?</p>
              <p>Town Councils lost $$...</p>
              <p>So,SG gavaman issue Spore Government Securities to CPF.The latter</p>
              <p>then can pay u lah....</p>
              <p>The net assets in Temasek and GIC,totally estimated at US$400 billions,</p>
              <p>are different from CPF money...</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>But i dunt know where do SG park the CPF money.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>before u sleep every night,pl tell me the reasons why SG</p>
              <p>GDP per capita can catch up UK.The latter GDP per capita i<span style="color: #ff0000;">s 4 times</span></p>
              <p>of SG in 1960,around the time PAP started ruling SG!!</p>

              <p>actually PAP is not as bad as what people think... In fact i appreciate what PAP has done for the country. If not for Lee KY and his leadership, would singapore be where we are now?</p>
              <p>Yes it might seem that he and his sons Lee HL are like controlling singapore, one being MM and the other being PM, but arent they doing a fine job? Yes you guys may say, they screwed up with our money, the invest in the wrong things, lost billions of dollars, they created so much ERP, up the GST so many fucking times, but they gave us what singapore is today.</p>
              <p>We grew up having a good life, we grew up pampered, therefore it is difficult to understand life in the past. We want always the best for ourselves, we compared ourselves to the other countries, like why australia no ERP, or why brunei gives their citizens money etc.</p>
              <p>Imagine yourself living in thailand or vietnam, those guys are many times worst off than you guys. We must be grateful to Lee KY and what he has done to get us to this position in the world. Further more Singapore is still a young country, it takes hundred of years for America to be successful, singapore took only few decades to be that well doing, is simply impressive. Our country is small, we need the citizens to be united. We cannot afford to have any discord among the citizens.</p>
              <p>However, saying all these, I am not saying that I am the dog of PAP or what shit. I AM NOT!! I do not agree with what the PAP is doing sometimes. Like too much foreign talents in the country. Too much china scholars in the country. I hate all these. Can they just fuck off?</p>
              <p>Therefore, not everyone is perfect. We must always weigh the pros and cons. PAP has done the goods and the bads, we must always look at both sides, not one.</p>
              <p>I dont care what happens in the future, being it SDP, WP or PAP wins the election or wat, I dont care. All I want to see is a leader that is capable of leading singapore to greater heights. Of all the opposition leader that I see now, the feeling i have towards them is that they are all talks and no actions.</p>
              <p>I wanna see someone with the calibre of barrack obama. If that person emerges, and wins over PAP, then I would no doubt feel that the country is in safe hand. Unless that person emerge, the country is better placed in the hands of Lee HL and Lee KY, for they are the only one with the leadership.</p>
              <p>Many of you will talk big and say that its easy or wat blah blah blah, should not do this, should do that blah blah blah... its all only talk. I want someone like barrack obama, someone that can really come out and be the special one to lead singapore. I dont believe the Lee family will forever be ruling singapore. This is impossible, one fine day they will either let go, or they will lsoe the election.</p>
