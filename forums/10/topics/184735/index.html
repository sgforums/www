            <div class='col-md body'>In the 1970s and late 1980s, average singaporeans were too busy tackling daily bread and butter issues to be bothered by politics. To them the idea of a strong and stable government to bring about political stability was appealing.<br><br>Nowadays, we are all living comfortably in a safe and pretty luxurious environment, and with better education we begin to question the governments policy.<br><br>But one party rule will never last. Even now, more and more well educated people are becoming wary of the government's suppressing oppostion policy.</div>
