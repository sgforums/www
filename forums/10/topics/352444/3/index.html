              </div>
              <p>Life would be easier if the mainstream media stop spinning such disgusting lies to spoil my day.</p>
              <p>Below is an excerpt of PM Lee’s interview with BBC in which he defended his family’s heavy involvement in Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Easy" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/pmeasier.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="596"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
              <p><strong>Source: Straits Times, 19 March 2009</strong></p>
              <p>Save for the Lee family themselves, I seriously doubt anybody in their right mind will buy the words of PM Lee.</p>
              <p>PM Lee is insulting the intelligence of all Singaporeans by proclaiming that MM Lee is the best man to lead GIC. GIC is a financial institution charged with overseeing our reserves.</p>
              <p>With due respect to MM Lee, he is a lawyer and was never trained in finance. Neither had he worked in any of the reputable financial giants such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs or Citibank. How can somebody with literally no experience in the finance industry be allowed to manage our largest SWF?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sure there are many more Singaporeans out there who can replace MM Lee as Chairman of GIC and do a better job than him. He is not irreplaceable. In fact, he should be replaced soon.</p>
              <p>Figures don”t lie. GIC has lost some S$50 billion dollars (and probably more) so far under the leadership of MM Lee and this is the result of paying top money for the wrong “talent”.</p>
              <p>In other countries, the Chairman will be sacked or forced to step down to take responsibility for the disastrous results. Will PM Lee please do the right thing and hold his father accountable for the losses?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM Lee can still afford to laugh because his position is so secure that there are nobody from within and outside his party who can challenge him. Life is so much easier for him precisely because his father is MM Lee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the way the PAP has exerted its control over all the important pillars of the nation such as the media and civil service to make its system work. Sorry Mr Lee, but I do not understand how the PAP system is working for the benefit of the people.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are desperate to render their judgement when elections come if only PM Lee is bold enough to abolish the GRC system and allow single ward contests in all constituencies in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP never had the mandate of the people to change the rules as and when it likes to suit its own partisan interests. Not when almost 50% of the electorate has no chance to vote and one third of those who did so voted for the opposition.</p>
              <p>Either PM Lee is living in his own ivory tower when he said those words or he is merely putting up a “wayang” to sound credible.</p>
              <p>There is a Chinese idiom called “Pointing the deer as a horse” - even when the truth is laid blatantly naked for all to see, they persist in believing in the untruth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When will PM Lee finally wake up from his deep slumber?</p>
              <p>Life would be easier for all Singaporeans if he resigns from his post now and call for a free and fair election with immediate effect. Don’t you agree with me?</p>

                          is a "freak", because it is lacking in

                          culture, said former communist leader Fang Chuang Pi,

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He added
                          that, in his assessment, the country had "narrow

                          difficulties in future".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He gave

                          a freak of history</strong></span>, in an interview with Malaysia's
                          Chinese-language newspaper, Nanyang Siang Pau, in
                          which he disclosed that he had discussed the

                          Mr Lee: "I said that Singapore was a 'freak',
                          but a 'freak' was often a genius, and most geniuses
                          died young. For in terms of geopolitics, economics,
                          size and population, Singapore is congenitally
                          deficient."</span></p>

                          Malayan Communist Party (MCP) in the 1950s and 1960s.
                          He held several secret meetings with Mr Lee, one of
                          which led to the cooperation between the MCP and the
                          People's Action Party (PAP) in fighting against
                          British colonialism.</span></p>

                          reported to have left Singapore in 1961 for
                          Indonesia, from where he directed the MCP's

                          Kim Teck, who interviewed him, described him as
                          "no longer the mystery underground man or the
                          guerilla fighter", noting that he had worn a
                          long-sleeved shirt and long pants, and carried a
                          handbag.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"His
                          simple attire made him look like a retiree,"
                          said the interviewers, adding that "his mind
                          remains alert and he is also sharp-tongued".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In the
                          wide-ranging interview, Mr Fang acknowledged the
                          economic progress that Singapore had made over the
                          past three decades under Mr Lee and his People's
                          Action Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The
                          country was "economically advanced", he
                          noted, adding that it might not have achieved this
                          progress if the leftist forces had taken control in
                          the 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"If
                          we look at the experiences of communist countries,
                          Singapore could be chaotic and its economy very bad
                          today.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"But
                          I will dispute this statement: If there was no Lee
                          Kuan Yew, Singapore would sink. This was only a
                          possibility.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Singapore

                          to rule, Singapore's politics could be very active
                          and vibrant,</strong></span>" he said in the interview,
                          published in several parts over the past week in the
                          Malaysian newspaper.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Asked
                          about the merger between Malaysia and Singapore in
                          1963, he said that the issue had created a
                          "serious sense of distrust" between him and
                          Mr Lee because it was raised suddenly. All along, he
                          had believed the merger was "merely an
                          objective, not an item on the agenda", he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He added
                          that Mr Lee had explained when they met in 1995 that
                          he had not lied or misled him intentionally. But when
                          the Tengku agreed to cooperate suddenly, he decided
                          to go ahead with the plan for a merger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Asked
                          what he thought of a merger now, he said: "I
                          think Singapore and Malaysia must merge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"It
                          was an illegitimate split. The brief period of merger
                          during 1963 showed that conditions were not conducive
                          then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Thirty
                          years have passed and both Singapore and Malaysia
                          have since developed in their own directions. It
                          looks like the separation is final.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"But
                          more people will begin to realise that a merger will
                          benefit both countries as well as their people. If
                          both sides are separated, both parties are being
                          weakened."</span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Singapore
                          was a 'freak', but a 'freak' was often a genius, and
                          most geniuses died young. For in terms of
                          geopolitics, economics, size and population,
                          Singapore is congenitally deficient ... I think that
                          Singapore has narrow room for manoeuvre in various
                          areas and will run into difficulties in the
