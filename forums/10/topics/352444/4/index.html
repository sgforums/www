              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Message to the Singaporean Youths</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></strong>In
              a rare public interview in 1997 Radio Corporation of Singapore, Dr Toh
              passionately <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bemoaned the lack of idealism and creativity among the
              young and its implications for the future of Singapore. </strong></span>He said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“I
              would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into
              politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the
              benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today’s generation
              has no culture and averse to taking political risk. Really, an interest
              in politics is very necessary for the future. But I cannot blame the
              present generations, because they see the heavy-handed response by the
              government to dissenting views, even though they know that these
              matters involve their daily lives.</strong></span><br><br>So the result is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we have
              produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very
              calculating. They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative.
              It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics
              and business. </strong></span>Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like,
              can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>computers lack soul
              and what we need in Singapore is soul. Because it is soul that makes
              society.”</strong></span></p>

              <p>Singapore turned into a freak by Lee Kuan Yew?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">SINGAPORE is a "freak",
              because it is lacking in terms of geopolitics, economics, size,
              population and culture, said former communist leader Fang Chuang
              Pi, dubbed the</span> <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">"Plen" by
              Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He added
              that, in his assessment, the country had "narrow room for manoeuvre
              in various areas and will run into difficulties in
              future".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He gave
              this assessment of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore as an unnatural
              country, a freak of history</strong></span>, in an interview with
              Malaysia's Chinese-language newspaper, Nanyang Siang Pau, in which
              he disclosed that he had discussed the Republic's prospects with
              the Senior Minister when they met in Beijing in August
              1995.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/plenwife.jpg" alt="Mr Fang and his wife in Thailand" width="200" height="114"><br> <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #808080; font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Mr
              Fang and his wife at the interview in<br> Thailand. Pic/ Nanyang Siang Pau</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He told Mr
              Lee: "I said that Singapore was a 'freak', but a 'freak' was often
              a genius, and most geniuses died young. For in terms of
              geopolitics, economics, size and population, Singapore is
              congenitally deficient."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The two
              men also discussed the issue of culture, he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"I said
              that using a certain language to create a culture, the culture
              created can at best be a commercial culture, or technology culture,
              or we may call it pasar culture. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It has no roots, and
              identifies itself with a certain material interest. It is the
              product of expediency.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/duck.gif" alt="Like duckweed, floating at the harbour" width="194" height="46"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"It is like duckweed,
              floating at the harbour. When it absorbs fertilisers, it will
              flourish very quickly. But once it rains and floods set in, it will
              perish,"</strong></span> he said in an interview conducted in a
              restaurant in Haadyai, near the Thai-Malaysian border.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Mr Fang,
              71, was a powerful linkman for the now-defunct Malayan Communist
              Party (MCP) in the 1950s and 1960s. He held several secret meetings
              with Mr Lee, one of which led to the cooperation between the MCP
              and the People's Action Party (PAP) in fighting against British
              colonialism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He became
              a legendary figure for his ability to "disappear" and avoid arrest
              and was reported to have left Singapore in 1961 for Indonesia, from
              where he directed the MCP's underground activities.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/mystery.gif" alt="No longer the mystery underground man" width="162" height="80"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He and
              more than 20 Singaporeans who were ex-MCP members now live in
              Thailand, following a peace accord signed in 1989 by the MCP, and
              Thai and Malaysian governments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Nanyang's
              editor Lee Soo Puang and senior feature writer Kua Kim Teck, who
              interviewed him, described him as "no longer the mystery
              underground man or the guerilla fighter", noting that he had worn a
              long-sleeved shirt and long pants, and carried a
              handbag.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"His
              simple attire made him look like a retiree," said the interviewers,
              adding that "his mind remains alert and he is also
              sharp-tongued".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In the
              wide-ranging interview, Mr Fang acknowledged the economic progress
              that Singapore had made over the past three decades under Mr Lee
              and his People's Action Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The
              country was "economically advanced", he noted, adding that it might
              not have achieved this progress if the leftist forces had taken
              control in the 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"If we
              look at the experiences of communist countries, Singapore could be
              chaotic and its economy very bad today.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"But I
              will dispute this statement: If there was no Lee Kuan Yew,
              Singapore would sink. This was only a possibility.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Singapore
              now is economically advanced, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but politically backward ...
              If they (Mr Lee and PAP) were not there to rule, Singapore's
              politics could be very active and vibrant,</strong></span>" he said
              in the interview, published in several parts over the past week in
              the Malaysian newspaper.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/merger.gif" alt="Merger now" width="131" height="26"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Asked
              about the merger between Malaysia and Singapore in 1963, he said
              that the issue had created a "serious sense of distrust" between
              him and Mr Lee because it was raised suddenly. All along, he had
              believed the merger was "merely an objective, not an item on the
              agenda", he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He added
              that Mr Lee had explained when they met in 1995 that he had not
              lied or misled him intentionally. But when the Tengku agreed to
              cooperate suddenly, he decided to go ahead with the plan for a
              merger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Asked what
              he thought of a merger now, he said: "I think Singapore and
              Malaysia must merge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"It was an
              illegitimate split. The brief period of merger during 1963 showed
              that conditions were not conducive then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Thirty
              years have passed and both Singapore and Malaysia have since
              developed in their own directions. It looks like the separation is
              final.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"But more
              people will begin to realise that a merger will benefit both
              countries as well as their people. If both sides are separated,
              both parties are being weakened."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;"><strong>*
              On the Republic:</strong></span></p>

              <p>“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge
                                      into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and
                                      the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today’s
                                      generation has no culture</strong></span> and averse to taking political risk.
                                      Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future.
                                      But I cannot blame the present generations, because they see the
                                      heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even
                                      though they know that these matters involve their daily
                                      lives.<strong><br><br> </strong>So the result is that we have produced a younger
                                      generation who are meek and therefore very calculating. They are
                                      less independent-thinking and lack in initiative. It does not bode
                                      well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and
                                      business. Robots and computers can be programmed or
                                      if you like, can be trained. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the trouble, of course, is that
                                      computers lack
                                      soul and what we need in Singapore is soul. Because it is soul that
                                      makes society.”</strong></span></p>

              <p>tamil for indians, malay for.... malays. mandarin for chinese.
              Since there are fucking alot of dialect, the lesson is conducted in
              mandarin. This is to follow the format of <span style="font-weight: bold;">taiwan</span> and china. who also conduct
              lessons in mandarin</p>
              <p>so... is <span style="font-weight: bold;">taiwan</span> losing

              <p>now answer the taiwan question. are they losing their culture since majority of lesson is not taught in dialect?</p>
              <p> </p>
