              <p>Lim Chin Siong won alot of hearts from the chinese at such a young age. He was actually "founded" by LKY, same secondary school as LKY. LKY brought him to politics and Lim gained alot trust and respects from the public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY is afraid that Lim will outshine him, then there was something about riots / protest (i've forgotten abit on this story) that LKY framed him and sent him behind bars using ISA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lim also founded his own opposition party called Barisan Sosialis.</p>

              <p>Without Lim Chin Siong it is doubtful that PAP could had won the 1959 elections.</p>

              <p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The PAP never convincingly demonstrated that the electorate favoured
              them over the top Barisan leaders. They won the 1959 election with the
              left-wing leaders as part of the PAP</strong></span>; The 1961 referendum had only one
              reasonable choice (the other two would have reduced Singaporeans to
              second-class citizens in Malaysia); the 1963 election was a snap
              election fought in the wake of Operation Cold Store, which arrested all
              the top Barisan leaders; and the 1968 election was boycotted by the
              Barisan.</p>

              <p>In his memoirs, Lee wrote that 'Lim Chin Siong wanted to eliminate
                  the Internal Security Council because he knew that ... if it ordered the
                  arrest and detention of the communist leaders, the Singapore
                  government could not be held responsible and be stigmatized a colonial
                  stooge.'</p>
              <p>What the Minister Mentor did not say, but what Harper reveals in
                  his chapter, is shockingly contradictory: 'In mid-1961, therefore, to
                  seek a way out, Lee suggested to the British that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his government
                  should order the release of all [the remaining] detainees, but then
                  have that order countermanded in the ISC by Britain and Malaya.'</strong></span></p>
              <p>Such a craven act was even rebuffed by the British. The acting
                  Commissioner, Philip Moore, stated that the British should not be
                  'party to a device for <strong><em>deliberate</em></strong> misrepresentation of
                  responsibility for continuing detentions in order to help the PAP
                  government remain in power.' (emphasis added)</p>
              <p>Moore suggested that the best solution would be 'to release all the
                  detainees forthwith.' Lee, however, 'was unwilling to present the left
                  with such a victory.'</p>
              <p>In a most damning indictment, Moore said that Lee '<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>has lived a lie
                  about the detainees for too long, giving the Party the impression that
                  he was pressing for their release while, in fact, agreeing in the ISC
                  that they should remain in detention.'</strong></span></p>
              <p>And if one thought that Lee Kuan Yew could not sink any lower, he
                  did. He turned to his saviours and warned that should he lose in an
                  upcoming by-election, he would call for a general election, which he
                  fully expected to lose.</p>

              <p>Poulgrain claims it
              was actually Singapore's then Chief Minister, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lim Yew Hock, who had
              deliberately "provoked" the bus and other industrial workers and
              Chinese middle students to riot in 1956 in order to have Lim Chin Siong
              arrested. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lim Yew Hock's own
              admission to responsibility for the riot appears in an official report
              to the British Government </strong></span>which Poulgrain found in the Colonial Office
              records in London which are now open to researchers.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Lee Kuan Yew was
              secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock,"</strong></span> adds Poulgrain, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"in urging the
              Colonial Secretary to impose the subversives ban in making it illegal
              for former political detainees to stand for election." </strong></span></p>

              <p>Lim Chin Siong won alot of hearts from the chinese at such a young age. He was actually "founded" by LKY, same secondary school as LKY. LKY brought him to politics and Lim gained alot trust and respects from the public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY is afraid that Lim will outshine him, then there was something about riots / protest (i've forgotten abit on this story) that LKY framed him and sent him behind bars using ISA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lim also founded his own opposition party called Barisan Sosialis.</p>

              <p>Lim Chin Siong was already a popular political figure amongst Singaporeans in the 1950s - when LKY was only a young lawyer representing the Trade Union members and have not even immersed fully into the Singapore political water.</p>
              <p>When LKY decided to enter politics with the other founding members that included Toh Chin Chye, Rajaratnam and Goh Keng Swee to form the PAP - LKY had to join forces with Lim Chin Siong to ride on this popularity.</p>
              <p>LKY even introduced Lim Chin Siong to Chief Minister David Marshall - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporegovt.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_archive.html">"as the future Prime Minister of Singapore" </a>- but later schemed to have Lim Chin Siong imprisoned by the British ISD.</p>
              <p>To LKY - everyone against him and his PAP has always been a Communist, but the only Communist that exist in Singapore seems to be himself with his autocratic Communist style of governance as already seen in the ONE-Party supermacy.</p>

              <p>  </p>
              <p>This revival of the "Learn Mandarin" issue is a typical LKY style of regaining the public popularity - after the disastrous damage to his supposedly stoic and astute reputation with the recent loss of US$100 Billion from GIC and Temasek - both occurring under his watch.</p>
              <p>The revival of the "Learn Mandarin" issue in the official medias is an attempt to feed on the 'chauvisnistic' feelings amongst the Chinese community - (especially the influencial and successful Chinese Businessmen) - and grow their swollen pride with another campaign - so as to divert everyone's attention from the publicity on the more important US$100 Billion loss to our National Reserves.</p>
