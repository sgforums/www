              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Offcourse Yes, wouldn't english more than good enough? why there is need of extra language mandrin? Are you implying that  majority of the chinese population in singapore are not english educated?</span></p>
              <p>Knowledge of a language is, in my opinion should be treated like a skill just like C++ or engineering. If you don't have it, then i won't hire you.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unless you need extra language as a requirement for some solid reasons, otherwise it is a racism</span></p>

              <p>personally i see this as an act of racism especially when i see most job requirements requires people to be able to communicate in mandarin or heard from my friend's job interview that the interviewer will ask if wheter they could communicate in mandarin.<br><br>this of course would give our chinese friends an upper hand at finding jobs while our indian and malay friends are losing out because of the so called "job requirement"</p>
              <p>should'nt the government enforce the use of english more?? since most of the singaporean citizens are thought basic english , is'nt it more easier to understand?<br><br>even China are enouraging their citizens to pick up english language so that they are on the same page as the rest of the develop countries in the world in terms of ability to speak internationaly<br><br>so in conclusion i'd say no to the question as it is seen as an act of racism in my opinion. where ever has the meaning of our national anthem has been man???</p>

              <p><br> Depending on the job in my opinion, if it's a sales job then

              <p>But if it's a tech job or manufacturing then yes, it would be
