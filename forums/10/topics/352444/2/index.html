              <p>actually hindi is the working language of India, tamil is just one of their many national languages, just like malay is here.</p>
              <p>anyway im really sickened by this super admiration of china that the system to be adopting. i was really shocked when they were like showing off how they felt the need to learn so much from the Youth Communists of China. It really scares me, really does.</p>
              <p>there's this jc i heard is promoting china studies in english so aggressively, that from 40 students taking the subject last year, to 400 this year. everything in the jc is china. china this, china that. they have like 4 overseas trips to china alone. think it held some china seminar a few weeks back, supposed to be the leading college in china studies</p>

              <p>actually hindi is the working language of India, tamil is just
              one of their many national languages, just like malay is here.</p>
              <p>anyway im really sickened by this super admiration of china that
              the system to be adopting. i was really shocked when they were like
              showing off how they felt the need to learn so much from the Youth
              Communists of China. It really scares me, really does.</p>
              <p>there's this jc i heard is promoting china studies in english so
              aggressively, that from 40 students taking the subject last year,
              to 400 this year. everything in the jc is china. china this, china
              that. they have like 4 overseas trips to china alone. think it held
              some china seminar a few weeks back, supposed to be the leading
              college in china studies</p>

              <p>Who is learning from Communist Youth...? You mean some Indian organizations in India..?</p>
              <p>Or do you mean from Singapore..?</p>
              <p>But anyway, there is nothing to be scared of.</p>
              <p>Communist Youth is just a name. Like Young PAP. Are you afraid of Young PAP?</p>
              <p>A lot of ideological struggles in the past is over already....there is no need to fear of anything or any label.</p>
