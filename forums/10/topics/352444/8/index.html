              <p>nantah graduates market value plummeted meh? in the early days, nantah graduates had no values in the eyes of the colonial government and the Singapore Government. But if you go to university in the US, you wound find more recognition of  nantah degree. if you said you were from nantah, the US angmoh would say, arh..the Singapore univisity. That was because the bright nantah graduates, many of them from Malaysia, Indonesia all went overseas for further studies, the bright SU grads stayed to work for their colonial master, or join the civil service.</p>
              <p>The rest of the nantah graduates would join private Chinese companies, join their family business, started their own business....different route to success.</p>
              <p>When China opened, the nantah graduates gained recognition from companies venturing into China. They value was enhanced further.</p>
              <p>When the government tried to merge the nantah alumi with that of NTU, they then realized, these two weren't the same university. tried to get the real nantah to contribute money....good try.</p>
              <p>the real world is outside Singapore, with values that is far greater than those recognized by the Singapore government.</p>

              <p>nantah graduates market value plummeted meh? in the early days, nantah graduates had no values in the eyes of the colonial government and the Singapore Government. But if you go to university in the US, you wound find more recognition of  nantah degree. if you said you were from nantah, the US angmoh would say, arh..the Singapore univisity. That was because the bright nantah graduates, many of them from Malaysia, Indonesia all went overseas for further studies, the bright SU grads stayed to work for their colonial master, or join the civil service.</p>
              <p>The rest of the nantah graduates would join private Chinese companies, join their family business, started their own business....different route to success.</p>
              <p>When China opened, the nantah graduates gained recognition from companies venturing into China. They value was enhanced further.</p>
              <p>When the government tried to merge the nantah alumi with that of NTU, they then realized, these two weren't the same university. tried to get the real nantah to contribute money....good try.</p>
              <p>the real world is outside Singapore, with values that is far greater than those recognized by the Singapore government.</p>

              <p>Just out of curiosity, what exactly do you suggest?</p>
              <p>That the minorities be given special attention so that they would, in the end enjoy more rights and attention than the majority? Would it not make business sense to hire someone who can converse with the majority of the population especially in a sales job?</p>
              <p>If a minority is capable of speaking Chinese fluently but still couldn't get the job then yes there would be discrimination. Knowledge of a language is, in my opinion should be treated like a skill just like C++ or engineering. If you don't have it, then i won't hire you.</p>
              <p>Short of the army(even then, just Malays), minorities have no obstacles in being on par with a Chinese Singaporean as long as they work hard enough. School systems do not attempt to marginalize minorities, they study their own mother language and are tested accordingly.</p>
              <p> How fair would it be to have a system that gives the minority more privileges and rights in an attempt to force them to be on par with the majority ?</p>

              <p><br>Depending on the job in my opinion, if it's a sales job then speaking mandarin would be essential to be able to communicate with the majority of your customers.</p>
              <p>But if it's a tech job or manufacturing then yes, it would be racist. However, i don't see it being a requirement on the classifieds. Have you seen such a requirement on a job that should by right have no need of knowledge of Chinese?</p>
