              <p>if you realised, the reason that the mandarin one is more popular is because they put in more effort to make it nice, as compared to the hokkien ones, and it is geared towards the youth audience, but not so much towards the older generations.</p>

              <p>hmm...ange chia, if you are a chinese, you should know that Emperor Qing made all Chinese write the same Chinese æ±‰å­—ã€‚He did the job for Hu Jintao, and all his predecessors, even the Korean and Japanese were using æ±‰å­— in their early history. China is united today because because all Chinese know æ™®é€šè¯�ã€‚Dialects are retained because the people value the culture that is associated with them. otherwise chinese would be like indians, with so many dialects, they have to use english as a common language.</p>

              <p>I think this you should know, Taiwan never had problem with cultures before ah bian came on stage.  the old taiwanese who were jap educated, the local hakka and hokkien, and the tribal aborigines, and those who came from the many provinces in China, all speak mandarin, AND their dialects.</p>
              <p>later ah bian came into power, too much emphasis on the use of taiwanese, and åŽ»ä¸­å›½åŒ–ï¼Œ actually tore the country into blue and green, north and south, wai shen ren and ben shen ren.</p>
              <p>Please do not use dialects for your own political agenda!</p>
              <p>The cantonese value their dialects, most overseas chinese in the US, Canada, Australia, .... speak cantonese, you think the local government allow the use of chinese dialects?</p>
              <p>teaching of dialects is the responsibility of the parents, the hokkian culture, the cantonese cultures, the Chinese culture in general, It is all up to the family. If the government provide a conducive enviornment for you to learn dialects, call it bonus. But in most cases, the learning of a language like english which would help you to get better job is much more attractive to you than learning mandarin or dialect to retain your cultural identity. Dont' agree? ask your parents why they never teach you dialects?</p>
              <p>or if you are old enough to have children, and if your parents speak to your children in dialect and they reply in english, would you tell them to speak to them in dialects?</p>

              <p>I think that is Lee Kuan Yew's bullshit propaganda, being the anglo dog that he is.</p>
              <p>I don't see Japanese people learning english.</p>
              <p>And also, the chinese had quite a big business community in colonial malaya and Singapore. They were all dialect speaking.</p>
              <p>You should change the economic system instead of the language.</p>
              <p>But then, Lee Kuan Yew is an anglo dog, you can't expect him to change economic system to a dialect or mandarin oriented one.</p>
              <p>His power base would be weakened.</p>
              <p>The hokkien dialect speaking chinese in 1950s/60s would follow people like Lim Chin Siong, not anglo dogs like Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>The only way is to weaken that group and to strengthen the anglo group.</p>
              <p>Which of course, is what we have today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The largest Chinese dialect group in the late nineteenth century <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>were
                      the Hokkien, who were traditionally involved in trade, shipping,
                      banking, and industry.</strong></span> The next largest group, the Teochiu, engaged in
                      agricultural production and processing, including gambier, pepper, and
                      rubber production, rice and lumber milling, pineapple canning, and fish
                      processing. Cantonese served as artisans and laborers and a few made
                      their fortunes in tin. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The two smallest groups, the Hakka and Hainanese,
                      were mostly servants, sailors, or unskilled laborers.</strong></span> Because wealth was
                      the key to leadership and social standing within the Chinese community
                      at that time, the Hokkien dominated organizations such as the Singapore
                      Chinese Chamber of Commerce and supplied most of the Chinese members of
                      the Legislative Council and the Chinese Advisory Board. The latter,
                      established in 1889 to provide a formal link between the British
                      government of the colony and the Chinese community, served as a place to
                      air grievances but had no power.</p>
              <p>The affluent among Singapore's Chinese community increasingly saw
                      their prosperity and fortunes tied to those of the crown colony and the
                      British Empire. Western education, customs, and pastimes were adopted,
                      and the sons of Chinese businessmen were often sent to Britain for
                      university training. The Straits Chinese British Association was formed
                      in 1900 by Baba Chinese leaders to promote loyalty to the British Empire
                      as well as to advance the education and welfare of Singapore's Chinese.
                      Visiting British royalty were warmly received and British causes and
                      victories enthusiastically supported. The Straits
                      Chinese contributed generously to the British war
                      effort in World War I.</p>
              <p>Although the Chinese upper class, particularly the Straits-born
                      Chinese, grew increasingly Westernized, the homeland exerted a
                      continuing pull on its loyalties that increased during this period.
                      Visits to China by Singapore Chinese became more common with the advent
                      of steamship travel.</p>

                  there was tremendous applause every time he spoke. By the end of the
                  campaign, Lim Chin Siong was seen as a charismatic figure and a person
                  to be reckoned with in Singapore politics and, what was of more
