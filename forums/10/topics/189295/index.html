            <div class='col-md body'>The GE is about micro issues partly because the PAP offers (i) upgrading carrots and (ii) questions the ability of opposition to run town councils.<br><br>If MPs are to run town councils, then some candidates will campaign on municipal issues eg. clogged drains in the estate, sheltered walkway, conservancy charges.<br><br>To have candidates focus on national issues, we should have separate municipal elections like in many other countries. The town councils are elected separately from the MPs. Then the candidates cannot hide behind municipal issues, or upgrading carrots. Look at Seetoh Yee Pin. Other than upgrading, what national issue has he raised for the people of PP? Will he be a good MP?</div>
