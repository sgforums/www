            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ELECTRONIC road pricing (ERP)</strong> will be expanded to three stretches of expressway from Nov 1, while current operating hours on the Central Expressway (CTE) will be extended. In addition, five new gantries will be erected across the island but will remain unactivated unless vehicle speeds fall below the optimal speed range.<br><br>Heavy going: Govt will review the vehicle growth rate because the current 3% growth rate cap is based on an ever increasing base, and road growth ahead will shrink, says Transport Minister Raymond Lim<br>Transport Minister Raymond Lim announced this yesterday during a visit to the Kallang/Paya Lebar Expressway Operational Control Centre.<br><br>'Over the last two years, traffic levels have been gradually but noticeably building up,' he said. 'More roads are congested, especially during peak hours, including in the evenings.'<br><br>As a result, a Land Transport Authority review concluded that morning ERP along the south-bound CTE will be extended. The existing gantry between Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Braddell Road will change its operating hours to 7am-11am on weekdays from 7.30am-9.30am currently.<br><br>The review also includes the building of three new gantries. The first is along the north-bound CTE to cover the stretch from Bukit Timah to just before the Pan Island Expressway (PIE). It will operate from 5.30pm-10.30pm on weekdays. Evening ERP already exists farther up the north-bound CTE after the PIE exit. This gantry was erected in August 2005.<br><br>Another area of congestion to be addressed is the east-bound East Coast Parkway (PIE). A gantry each will be built at the two accesses into the east-bound ECP from the city and the Ayer Rajah Expressway, that is, before the Rochor Road exit and at the Ophir Road slip road. The pair of gantries will operate from 6pm-8pm on weekdays.<br><br>The third new gantry will be for the morning peak period on the south-bound Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE). It will be located after the Dairy Farm exit, before the BKE joins the PIE, and operate from 7.30am-9am on weekdays.<br><br>Five other gantries will also be installed on the south-bound Upper Bukit Timah Road and in the Outer Cordon area, namely, Toa Payoh Lorong 6, Upper Boon Keng Road, Kallang Bahru Road and Geylang Bahru Road.<br><br>Mr Lim said the ERP system has been effective in keeping Singapore's roads and expressways smooth-flowing - above 45 kmh for expressways and above 20 kmh on arterial roads.<br><br>'With the introduction of ERP in 1998, the government has been able to rely more on car usage charges and less on car ownership taxes to manage traffic demand,' he said, adding that vehicle ownership taxes have been reduced and as a result, annual vehicle ownership revenue fell from $3.4 billion in 1997 to $1.7 billion in 2006 compared with about $90 million in annual ERP revenue collected during that period.<br><br>'ERP has thus proven to be a more effective approach to managing traffic demand, and it costs motorists much less overall.'<br><br>Mr Lim also mentioned that the vehicle growth rate will be reviewed because the current 3 per cent growth rate cap is based on an ever increasing base.<br><br>'In 1990, when the 3 per cent cap was introduced, it amounted to 16,000 additional vehicles a year. Today, 3 per cent amounts to 24,000 additional vehicles every year. Against this is the fact that road growth was only one per cent per year in the last 15 years, going down to about 0.5 per cent over the next 15 years.'<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>July <strong>CPI </strong>rises at fastest pace in a decade<br><br>SINGAPORE'S consumer prices rose in July at the fastest pace in more than a decade after an increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), suggesting the central bank will maintain a policy of a strengthening currency to curb inflation.<br><br>Rising cost of eating out: Food prices rose 2.9 per cent in July from a year ago<br>The consumer price index increased 2.6 per cent from a year earlier, after gaining 1.3 per cent in June, the Department of Statistics said yesterday.<br><br>That was the quickest clip since January 1995 and exceeded the 1.7 per cent expected by economists. Prices rose 2.1 per cent from June.<br><br>The government raised the GST by two percentage points to 7 per cent on July 1 to make up for a revenue shortfall after corporate tax rates were reduced.<br><br>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) last month warned that consumer prices may pick up in the second half as the economy expands, underscoring the need for policy makers to remain alert on inflation.<br><br>'The spike up in inflation from the GST pass-through is not unexpected,' said Joseph Tan, a strategist at Fortis Bank SA in Singapore.<br><br>'With the pick-up in inflation, there's no reason for a change in the policy stance for a gradual appreciation in the Singapore dollar,' he added.<br><br>The MAS in April reaffirmed a three-year policy of allowing the Singapore dollar to strengthen, a move that has reduced import costs and helped keep inflation within its forecast range.<br><br>It has sought a 'modest and gradual' appreciation in the Singapore dollar since April 2004 to contain inflation. The policy will be reviewed next in October.<br><br>The GST increase will add between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent to consumer prices this year and next, the MAS said last month.<br><br>The MAS expects inflation in 2007 to be at the upper half of its 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent range, before rising to as much as 2 per cent next year.<br><br>Food prices, which make up 23 per cent of the index, rose 2.9 per cent in July from a year ago, following June's 1.7 per cent increase. From June, food prices gained 1.4 per cent.<br><br>Transport and communication costs, the second-biggest component at 22 per cent of the index, climbed 2.9 per cent in July from a year earlier. From June, transport and communication prices rose one per cent.<br><br>Housing costs, the third-largest component of the consumer price index, gained 0.7 per cent from a year ago, after a 2 per cent slide in June, yesterday's report showed. From a month ago, housing prices rose 4.9 per cent as electricity prices climbed and rents increased.<br><br>Singapore Power, the island's biggest power company, raised electricity tariffs for the July to September quarter by an average 8.8 per cent, citing higher oil prices. It reviews rates every three months.<br><br>Recreation costs, which include holiday travel, gained 4.2 per cent in July from a year ago and rose 0.5 per cent from the previous month.<br><br>Prices of clothing and footwear gained 1.2 per cent from a year earlier and increased 3.9 per cent from June. -- Bloomberg<br></div>

Just like Japan, while China is experiencing inflation, Japan is experiencing recession. Our increase in inflation is mostly due to the 2% increases in GST. Of course, pundits for the government will deny it, to put the government in a good light, relinquishing it's effect to other things non governmental like global trade.<br><br>On the other hand, China has been producing cheaper cost goods for the global market, shouldn't this have led to a decrease in inflation?<br><br>Tax holiday for which industry in China has lapse?

            <div class='col-md body'>Govt keeping a close eye on inflation: Lim Hng Kiang<br>By Julia Ng, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 27 August 2007 1703 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE : The Government is keeping a close eye on the inflation rate in Singapore, Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang said on Monday.<br><br>Speaking during question time in Parliament, Mr Lim pointed out that the inflation rate here has remained low by global comparison.<br><br>Inflation rates in the first half of this year were just between 0.5 to 1 percent.<br><br>But in July, the rate went up to 2.6 percent over the same period last year.<br><br>Mr Lim said he expects the inflation rate in the second half of this year to be higher, in line with global inflation trends due to rising cost pressures in the US, Europe and China.<br><br>Dr Lily Neo, MP, Jalan Besar GRC, had earlier commented, "May I ask him whether he's concerned of the recent very high inflation rate in the last quarter, and how would it affect Singapore and Singaporeans on the whole if this should continue? And are there measures that you plan to take to contain this inflation rate?"<br><br>In response, Mr Lim said, "We're watching this closely of course. We expect generally in the second half, costs to go up higher than in the first half. Then of course we also have the one-off impact of the GST. But our experience shows in the past, when we had similar increases in GST, that this is a short-term impact, and that over time the impact of course will be mitigated.<br><br>"So overall we still look at an inflation path of between 1 (and) 2 percent this year, which is a little higher than what we had in the past years, but definitely still very reasonable, considering this is already more than 16 quarters of growth." - CNA/ms<br><br></div>
