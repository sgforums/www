Very convincing about the electoral, media processes about how the incumbent seeks to enhance and consolidate its position in politics. However, are such measures only restricted here? No no no. In fact, it is so prevalent everywhere, even in so-called democratic havens such as USA, Britain and Taiwan. Jerrymandering (redrawing of electoral boundaries to favour the ruling party) is a widespread practice overseas and the way they do it really make the Serangoon-North-in-Marine-Parade-GRC incident look very very normal. Another example, the first-past-the-post system which were invented by the British and still used here. It allows the ruling party to control the Parliament even though they get the minority of the votes.<br><br>Ok, the restrictions on protests and public speeches are a tad too restrictive but I do not wish to see oversea situations of riots and violent protests breaking out here either.<br><br>Yes, the ruling party is not perfect, but neither is the opposition. Are there avenues for them to broadcast their political ideas and policies? Yes there are legal ways. Since the last GE, I have not ahd a whiff of the opposition in my GRC. It would have been good if they gone around distributing their newsletters but no, I have not seen them in action. Please give me an opposition that does not disappear during non-election days and only mysteriously materialise during election period.<br><br>Give me a credible opposition that bothers to engage the people even during normal non-election periods, not some people who keeps protesting for the sake of protesting and getting into trouble with the law repeatedly.<br><br>Seriously, I may not like the ruling party that's not a good enough reason to vote the opposition, not when the quality of some of them I see (some of the GRC teams seem to be just banded together for the sake of elections).<br><br>You can go an call me a PAP-centric elitist boot-licking lap dog, but I will tell you that for now, I will NOT vote the opposition, but neither will I vote the PAP either.<br><br>You can list all the bad points and shortcomings of the PAP all you want, but at the end of the day, if given a choice to choose between 2 rotten apples, I will prefer not to eat and drink water instead.<br><br>BTW, I am only 18. You can label me as a person who has been blinded by pro-govt propaganda and education but I believe if you were to take this to the normal man-in-the-street, chances are, they are probably more likely to agree with my viewpoint compared to yours.<br><br>I would not label your views on the PAP as bigotic but it is pretty much one-sided and subjective.</div></blockquote>Teraexa,<br><br>I am just 1 year older than you, but I'm afraid I have to say that what you say sounds like what Wee Shu Min said to Derrick (Rmb the incident?) With the same pompous tone as she uses. But let me talk to you:-<br><br>1-2) They are fragmented and divided. But this fragmentation and division should have no impact whatsoever on who you decide to vote. So plainly, you are going OOT here.<br><br>3) Sure, Gerrymandering may be practiced in other countries, but not as openly as here. And there will be lots of criticism coming from the local press on the govt's abuse of power, sometimes going to the extent of a re-election. Unlike here, where the Straits Times/ TNP/ TODAY doesn't even bother to report changed electoral boundaries, making poor uneducated voters unsure of what GRC they are in from one election to the next.  Yes, the first-past-the-post system was invented in the UK. But the UK's FPTP is solely for Single-Member Wards. There is no such stupid thing as GRCs there. It is not like TOny Blair, Gordon Brown and Ruth Kelly could contest as a team in a single ward.<br><br>4) Don't believe everything the media shows. One purpose of the media is to sell news, so it usually produces sensationalism. Overseas protests are usually thousands and thousands of people. These people are usually peaceful. The ones causing the riots and other disturbances are usually a small band of fanatics or desparados. And usually, such unrest only occurs when people have been pushed beyond their limit. Put it this way, you can hardly expect inhabitants of a war-torn Iraq to offer the USAF a Christmas present, could you? But most other demonstrations in US and UK and AU are usually peaceful. Sadly, these don't make it to the press.<br><br>5) Unlike what you think, the opposition does not disappear during non-election periods. I was with a friend from the WP last week. he had spent an entire week in a walkabout in Hougang. And the SDP sells its newsletters at some of the MRT stations. Unfortunately, they are cash-strapped (unlike the PAP, which can bribe the MNCs) and operate under alot of restrictions which the PAP simply doesn't face.

Sorry for my tone just now cos I was not really in the best of moods when writing that.<br><br>Just in case you are wondering where I am from, was from RI, currently in RJ.<br><br>And oh yes, back to topic, shall we?<br><br>Fragmentation and disunity. My personal beliefs (not too sure if it extends to others as well) are that if the opposition is disunited and fragmented, they certainly ain't giving me the confidence to vote them in. Would I want my MP to be bickering in Parliament, or worse, during my Meet-The-People sessions? Chances are that if the opposition show themselves to be credible, professional and united, my inclination to vote them is certainly going to be higher.<br><br>Now onto Gerrymandering (sorry for the earlier spelling error). Oh yes, certainly, Gerrymandering has, is and will continue to be used by incumbents to consolidate their position. I am one who is not blinded by the fact that our media is pro-govt (hey if not why they never ever reviewed The Hatchet Man?) but I am pretty sure that they DID report on boundary changes during elections. Yes, we lack a truly free press in Singapore but that's not really the issue of this point, yet. Anyway, regarding the point on GRCs and gerrymandering. These are both legal tools (within the provisions of the law). The problem is that people often view legality and ethics interchangably. Sure, such tactics aren't ethics, but they are legal (within the laws of Singapore) and without a strong 4th estate to criticise them, we'll just have to leave it at legality.<br><br>Next onto the media. It is rather unfortunate that we only get to see the sensational side of protests or public gatherings through the media. However, I went to Taiwan during 2005 when they were holding their local elections. Boy, I saw with my eyes how a 'peaceful' gathering could go wrong simply because some opposing supporter started saying criticisms. Perhaps, it is a case of what we lose out (the chance for free speech) vs what we gain (relative peace?). This, unfortunately, can be argued till the cows come home and we can never reach a consensus.<br><br>Regarding the activities of the opposition, it is unforunate that I lack personal experience with some of the members and that financial support for them is still sorely lacking. However, if the opposition is to achieve anything significant, they will have to reach out to ordinary, ignorant people like me to convince of their votes.<br><br>Taxi drivers rants. What a familiar scene. Perhaps, if we listen to them carefully, most of their concerns are mainly economic in nature (rising minister pay, rising GST, rising costs, lower wages etc) but they have long resigned to the fact that PAP is dominant in politics and as long as they are economically well-off, they do not really care if PAP is all-dominating (ain't most people of the older generation like that?).<br><br>I wouldn't defend the PAP cos I think they have faults. Yet, I am just perturbed by the confusion between legality and morality in politics. What is immoral can be legal, like GRC, minister pay etc. Yes, some of PAP's actions are ethically wrong and only strong public sentiment can turn that lack of ethics into an issue worth examining, else we are probably resigned to living under a PAP that sometimes skirt around the grey areas of the law for some measures that perhaps lack in ethics.<br><br>Just my $0.02.</div>

Personally I really feel that Singapore is very very near the middle where the democracy starts to toe the red line that inclines it towards an authoritarian regime. However, what sets Singapore apart from other authoritarian regime is that most of the tools used by the government has been to enhance and consolidate their position by making the conditions for opposition to grow rather unfavourable. What makes it exasperating instead of other countries like say Iran is that often this actions are done within, or some say just skirting the edge, of the law. How many Consitution changes have we seen so far? Perhaps the major ones are really the GRC, the popular vote for President. The government has not done is to change the laws drastically to suit their methods. Instead, they have made pretty good use of existing spaces within the laws to consolidate their position.<br><br>Let's first talk about upgrading, or rather the lack of it in opposition wards. No matter how ethically wrong it is (yes people living in those areas are taxpayers too), they have not changed the law to stipulate that opposition wards do not receive funds for upgrading (hey they are also scared that one day they become the opposition). Instead, they just make it difficult for MPs of those wards to receive funding as they control the ministry after all. Legal? Yes. Ethical? No. Did the law really explicitly say that opposition wards do not receive upgrading funds? No. But then why no upgrading funds? They just make it difficult for you to obtain them.<br><br>Exasperated by such an action? It is not Uniquely Singapore. In fact, widely employed in the world wherever there are partisan concerns. You can always see opposition wards getting deprived of certain benefits to allow the government to better win it back next elections. Common tactic. Even our dear Malaysia also has such situations. When I went to KL some years back, the tour bus passed by this area which looked shabbier than the rest. The tour guide said that it was because the ward belonged to the opposition. Familiar?<br><br>Now back to my analogy. Political parties are just like competing fruit stalls. Lets imagine a hypothetical situation of 2 stalls fighting to sell apples. The stall (party) with better prices (policies) and better quality (publicity) will get more customers (votes). Singapore is like 2 fruit stalls, 1 mega fruit stall and 1 small push cart stall. The mega fruit stall frequent uses different tactics to gain more customers, like price wars, monopolise supply, use big billboards to block the push cart stall, use bright lights to mask the push cart, use loudhailers to outshout the competitor. Sounds like the normal durian stall competition? It's just like the govt. They just use legal methods to frustrate you and hope you close shop.<br><br>What about Fascist regimes? They will try all means possible to drive you out of business, ALL means, be it bribing the police, setting fire to your stall, beating you up, basically doing anything they want, legally or not.<br><br>Enough of the analogy. Back to my point, all along I have been saying that I recognise that the opposition faces a hard and frustrating time here, just like the push cart in the first scenario. However, the problem is, the fruits that the push cart offers are still inferior compared to the mega stall. Then in that case, as a customer, why should I buy inferior goods just because I hate the flashiness of the mega stall? Rather, the push cart has not given me enough reasons to patronise it. The opposition faces a tough challenge which they may or may not surmount. If they are truly able, they are able to rise above these challenges.<br><br>Until then, I will just have to keep waiting for them to sell better fruits.</div>

No doubt, anecdotes can be biased and inaccurate, but hey if a person's first impression of something is through that anecdote, he is probably going to base most, or if not some, of his judgement based on that anecdote.<br><br>That said, I chose the anecdote of Taiwan to make a point that democracy, or what is being marketed as democracy, is not necessarily desirable. Not only it is inefficient (look at the time parliament takes to debate and pass bills overseas) but it assumes preconditions which some societies may not fulfil such as voter maturity. Populist measures are popular but do they really serve any long term purposes (NSS, ERS etc)? American and Australian politics are also not untarred from such ills. Inefficiencies, partisan bickering, voter immaturity.<br><br>Free speech. A touchy topic that is a potential banana skin or minefield. I do not want to touch on it cos the boundaries and definitions alone can involve quite a pain in the head.<br><br>And yes, I am pretty much a centrist. I have no illusion that my views will change later but my base principle is always that of pragmatism.</div></blockquote>It takes time to get things done because of accountability issues. Can't pass a legislation without consultation. If it is done properly and correctly first at a slower pace , why not? Inefficiencies? I don't think Australia is that inefficient. Consider this , Singapore hubs - look at them- hub here hub there, not no.1 hub yet.<br><br>Partisan bickering is good fun to read about. Everyone you know has an idea to improve the country or improve their paypacket but it shows that Politicians are equally human as well. I don't want some goody elite twoshoe who scored A1s all the way and  be all saintly as a politician. I want someone I can identify with and know how it is like to be in my shoes.<br><br>I am an equally pragmatic person and I like to see a balance of power. Opposition with no credibility still beats having an overpowering number of a particular party in parliament. That way it cannot become a runaway train of ministers paying themselves ridiculously well for crappy progress. If any american or australian minister attempts to pay themselves that amount of our dear ministers, they have to pass thru senate/ parliament and get the votes from the opposition to support them. Or else ...next round, out they go.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eagle:</div><div class="quote_body">Would you risk your life and limb to defect in a system that you live in? Why blame the PAP for the political apathy when you would not want to embark on any concrete action but instead wait for others to do so?<br><br>Comparison between Singapore and other countries can never be equal nor justified. Would your compare your relationship between you and your spouse to the relationship between another couple? Furthermore, there's nothing wrong with subscribing to the notion that Singapore is handicapped by being "small" when it's true. Although this may sound cliche, we have limited land, limited resources and a young nation of citizens without any strong sense of belonging.<br><br>Again, what I'm going to say will sound very similar to the media. The people of Singapore hold themselves much worse than European countries (if we compare with Luxemburg, Finland, etc). But this is a fact; I have personally observed it. How many of you were actually impressed by the service standards in Singapore? Yes, we are a "FIRST world Country". However, it seems to me that the majority of our people do not display the qualities of a "First world" citizen. In this sense, do you truly think the country as a whole deserve greater rights?<br><br>Even if we do deserve greater rights, is the Opposition strong and capable enough to persuade you to give them your vote? Some members of the Opposition do have the qualities, but the numbers are not many. Internal strifes in SDP, miscalculations of the Barisan Socialis, have caused great hurt to the Opposition.<br><br>In my opinion, the strongest Opposition now is the Worker's Party. If you want a credible opposition to vote for in the future, just hope that no misfortune befall them as what happened to other Opposition in the past.<br><br></div></blockquote>Does the fact that there're people out there willing to risk their lives and limbs to defect in a system they live in not suggest there're people who actually value their liberties, rights and freedoms above everything else? As a matter of fact, why should anyone who wishes to exercise his/her rights play within the rules set down by oppressive despots running regimes which you conveniently claim as having arisen because people "would not want to embark on any concrete action"?<br><br>If comparisons with other nations can neither be equal nor justified, then why make a ruckus about Singapore being small then? If you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">didn't compare</span></span></strong> with the land masses/populations of other nations, how would you even know that Singapore is small and deprived of resources and human capital as you claim? Evidently, Iceland, Luxembourg and the Nordic nations are great living testaments to the fact that even countries with small populations are capable of achieving exceptional things on par, if not better, with other first world nations with a far greater land mass and/or population. Just because this regime can't do it, it doesn't mean it can't be done, does it?<br><br>And what has service standards got to do with rights? Are you telling me someone suspected of kidnapping, murder or arson <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">does not deserve a right to a fair judicial trial and should just serve whatever punishments the law enforcement officials should throw at him/her without a right to defend the charges levied at him/her</span></span>? This just begs the question : if you do not even understand what your inalienable rights are, it makes little sense to talk about your stance. If your argument stems from the fact that rights should only be accorded as reward for greater maturity/responsibility, you certainly wouldn't look out of place in regimes run by despots and tyrants.</div>
