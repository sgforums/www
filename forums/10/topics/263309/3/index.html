Personally I really feel that Singapore is very very near the middle where the democracy starts to toe the red line that inclines it towards an authoritarian regime. However, what sets Singapore apart from other authoritarian regime is that most of the tools used by the government has been to enhance and consolidate their position by making the conditions for opposition to grow rather unfavourable. What makes it exasperating instead of other countries like say Iran is that often this actions are done within, or some say just skirting the edge, of the law. How many Consitution changes have we seen so far? Perhaps the major ones are really the GRC, the popular vote for President. The government has not done is to change the laws drastically to suit their methods. Instead, they have made pretty good use of existing spaces within the laws to consolidate their position. </div></blockquote>I'm not sure if you're missing out on something here. Granted, if your argument stems from the fact that they're playing the game within the confines of the law, you can't be wrong. That said, that's just the tangible aspect of it which can be qualitatively quantified.<br><br>In theory, the Legislative, Judiciary and Executive are independent entities - I doubt you could really make a case for that to be true in practice if certain judicial precendence is anything to go by. Just browse through some threads <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Atobe</span></span> has posted with opinions from learned individuals who are legally qualified and have had prior experience working with this regime. Alternatively, just get your hands on Francis Seow's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To Catch a Tartar</span></span>.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teraexa:</div><div class="quote_body">Let's first talk about upgrading, or rather the lack of it in opposition wards. No matter how ethically wrong it is (yes people living in those areas are taxpayers too), they have not changed the law to stipulate that opposition wards do not receive funds for upgrading (hey they are also scared that one day they become the opposition). Instead, they just make it difficult for MPs of those wards to receive funding as they control the ministry after all. Legal? Yes. Ethical? No. Did the law really explicitly say that opposition wards do not receive upgrading funds? No. But then why no upgrading funds? They just make it difficult for you to obtain them.<br><br>Exasperated by such an action? It is not Uniquely Singapore. In fact, widely employed in the world wherever there are partisan concerns. You can always see opposition wards getting deprived of certain benefits to allow the government to better win it back next elections. Common tactic. Even our dear Malaysia also has such situations. When I went to KL some years back, the tour bus passed by this area which looked shabbier than the rest. The tour guide said that it was because the ward belonged to the opposition. Familiar? </div></blockquote>It hardly makes sense to draw parallels with Malaysia to begin with. With the greatest respect, you could pretty much paint a rosier picture of this regime if you drew parallels with what is preached in North Korea - then again, if North Korea were used as a benchmark, just about every other country on the planet would come across as a paradise.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teraexa:</div><div class="quote_body">Now back to my analogy. Political parties are just like competing fruit stalls. Lets imagine a hypothetical situation of 2 stalls fighting to sell apples. The stall (party) with better prices (policies) and better quality (publicity) will get more customers (votes). Singapore is like 2 fruit stalls, 1 mega fruit stall and 1 small push cart stall. The mega fruit stall frequent uses different tactics to gain more customers, like price wars, monopolise supply, use big billboards to block the push cart stall, use bright lights to mask the push cart, use loudhailers to outshout the competitor. Sounds like the normal durian stall competition? It's just like the govt. They just use legal methods to frustrate you and hope you close shop.<br><br>What about Fascist regimes? They will try all means possible to drive you out of business, ALL means, be it bribing the police, setting fire to your stall, beating you up, basically doing anything they want, legally or not.<br><br>Enough of the analogy. Back to my point, all along I have been saying that I recognise that the opposition faces a hard and frustrating time here, just like the push cart in the first scenario. However, the problem is, the fruits that the push cart offers are still inferior compared to the mega stall. Then in that case, as a customer, why should I buy inferior goods just because I hate the flashiness of the mega stall? Rather, the push cart has not given me enough reasons to patronise it. The opposition faces a tough challenge which they may or may not surmount. If they are truly able, they are able to rise above these challenges.<br><br>Until then, I will just have to keep waiting for them to sell better fruits.</div></blockquote>What you perceive to constitute a Fascist regime is hardly in line with the reality of what such regimes get up to for a start. From Hitler to Mugabe, Saddam to Milosevic, variations of the exact practices adopted by such regimes are hardly identical although they're run on similar fundamental principles which aren't that distant from the concepts of tyranny and despotism.<br><br>As a matter of fact, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"They will try all means possible to drive you out of business, ALL means, be it bribing the police, setting fire to your stall, beating you up, basically doing anything they want, legally or not"</span></span> just about sums up the paradox you have failed to address. Just to illustrate an example : the Gestapo often turned a blind eye to thugs deployed by the Nazis to deal with the opposition, but this could very much be attributed to their incompetence rather than the Nazis legitimately endorsing state-instigated violence, doesn't it? So once again, who decides what laws should be acceptable? If you needed any evidence on a similar parallel adopted by this regime, just take a look at the heavy-handed methods deployed against dissidents and other advocates of interests compromising those of the incumbents' - and mind, refusals to issue permits for public speaking, demonstrations are all pretty conveniently dismissed on account of them being a threat to law and order. I don't suppose you could make a case for truly First World governments to resort to such measures, could you?<br><br>Going back to your example of the fruit sellers. What you get here is effectively a scenario whereby the bigger stall resorts to driving the smaller stall out of business by whatever means possible - by fair means or foul. Through aggressive marketing gimmicks for themselves and depriving the smaller stall of doing so (well, there's certainly a role for the media <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) and enticing customers through offering a seemingly better deal when there really is no alternative to begin with, the monopoly and stranglehold the bigger stall holds on the market share just about effectively kills off any effective competition from the smaller stall. While you may not patronise the smaller stall in view of what you perceive to be products of "inferior quality", I don't think it'd make a lot of sense to patronise the bigger stall who resorts to bullying tactics to drive others out of business and in fact, actually offers products which - although offering better value between the 2 stores - is truly inferior to other stalls elsewhere on this planet.</div>

That said, with an electoral system which is nothing short of being in shambles (just consider the gerrymandering and how the elections commission actually accounts to the PMO), it'd indeed be ludicrous not to send a message of disapproval to the despots perpetuating a brand of tyranny masked under a democratic smokescreen.<br><br>Quite simply, "the day" you're hoping for to come would simply never arrive so long as the opposition continue to play the game by the rules laid out by the despots.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teraexa:</div><div class="quote_body">Woot I sound like Wee Shu Min? I should be damned. Sorry for my tone just now cos I was not really in the best of moods when writing that.<br><br>Just in case you are wondering where I am from, was from RI, currently in RJ.<br><br>And oh yes, back to topic, shall we?<br><br>Fragmentation and disunity. My personal beliefs (not too sure if it extends to others as well) are that if the opposition is disunited and fragmented, they certainly ain't giving me the confidence to vote them in. Would I want my MP to be bickering in Parliament, or worse, during my Meet-The-People sessions? Chances are that if the opposition show themselves to be credible, professional and united, my inclination to vote them is certainly going to be higher.<br><br>Now onto Gerrymandering (sorry for the earlier spelling error). Oh yes, certainly, Gerrymandering has, is and will continue to be used by incumbents to consolidate their position. I am one who is not blinded by the fact that our media is pro-govt (hey if not why they never ever reviewed The Hatchet Man?) but I am pretty sure that they DID report on boundary changes during elections. Yes, we lack a truly free press in Singapore but that's not really the issue of this point, yet. Anyway, regarding the point on GRCs and gerrymandering. These are both legal tools (within the provisions of the law). The problem is that people often view legality and ethics interchangably. Sure, such tactics aren't ethics, but they are legal (within the laws of Singapore) and without a strong 4th estate to criticise them, we'll just have to leave it at legality.<br><br>Next onto the media. It is rather unfortunate that we only get to see the sensational side of protests or public gatherings through the media. However, I went to Taiwan during 2005 when they were holding their local elections. Boy, I saw with my eyes how a 'peaceful' gathering could go wrong simply because some opposing supporter started saying criticisms. Perhaps, it is a case of what we lose out (the chance for free speech) vs what we gain (relative peace?). This, unfortunately, can be argued till the cows come home and we can never reach a consensus.<br><br>Regarding the activities of the opposition, it is unfortunate that I lack personal experience with some of the members and that financial support for them is still sorely lacking. However, if the opposition is to achieve anything significant, they will have to reach out to ordinary, ignorant people like me to convince of their votes.<br><br>Taxi drivers rants. What a familiar scene. Perhaps, if we listen to them carefully, most of their concerns are mainly economic in nature (rising minister pay, rising GST, rising costs, lower wages etc) but they have long resigned to the fact that PAP is dominant in politics and as long as they are economically well-off, they do not really care if PAP is all-dominating (ain't most people of the older generation like that?).<br><br>I wouldn't defend the PAP cos I think they have faults. Yet, I am just perturbed by the confusion between legality and morality in politics. What is immoral can be legal, like GRC, minister pay etc. Yes, some of PAP's actions are ethically wrong and only strong public sentiment can turn that lack of ethics into an issue worth examining, else we are probably resigned to living under a PAP that sometimes skirt around the grey areas of the law for some measures that perhaps lack in ethics.<br><br>Just my $0.02.</div></blockquote>Teraexa,<br><br>1-3) I'm biased against Rafflesians, which is why I chose to go to HCI. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>But back to the topic...<br><br>4) Hmm, do Sylvia Lim and Chiam See Tong do exactly what you describe in this para? Does the PM's Questions in UK operate like that?<br><br>5) Gerrymandering was named after a President something Gerry who drew up electoral districts shaped like salamanders. (This is a historical fact; I am not kidding) But the term is a derogatory term in Western politics anyway. And no, the media didn't report on boundary changes; they only reported on boundaries, which is a different thing. And their "Report" was online, which many people are not rich enough to afford.  GRCs are a provision of the law, but then I can always ask the philosophical question: What is the Rule of Law if the Law can be changed at the whim of a political party? And interestingly, why do we not have a strong 4th estate? Never leave a stone unturned.<br><br>6) Taiwan is a garbled example actually because of the whole Chinese-imperialism issue. Taiwan is almost an Asian Chechnya, minus the theaters with nerve gas in them.<br><br>7) The issue was who the man-on-the-street support, and not what they support for.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Hmmm... and you wouldn't vote for those who would stop the PAP from skirting round those areas?<br><br>My $0.02 as well.<br><br>Rgds,<br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teraexa:</div><div class="quote_body">Well I like this paragraph of yours. It aligns perfectly with what is happening here. I am just a person who neither likes the incumbent nor the opposition. I am still inclined to playing within the rules although that may change. The problem is, I just hate opposition candidates asking people to vote for them simply because they are "non-PAP". That is not a good enough reason to vote for them to any mature voter.<br><br>It seems like many of our ideas have a confluence, just that we come from different points of view. At the end of the day, I guess our opposition still has much to improve as much as we would like to see more of them in Parliament.<br><br>We can only wait and hope for that day to come.</div></blockquote>Here is a good question:<br><br>What can the opposition really say except "we are not the PAP"? Unlike Mozilla and FSF, which can argue that they are superior to Microsoft or SCO Systems, whenever the opposition tries and make a statement of what they have which the PAP doesn't, some PAP idiot will steal their ideas and then sue them for defamation, like what SCO did with the Linux Core. Unfortunately, we don't have an independent European Union Fairtrade Commission here to judge the cases for us, so well the commercial party (SCO/PAP) will always win in our case, and the alternative (FSF/Oppo) get blacklisted for no good reason.<br><br>I think by now the opposition probably just wants the intelligent voter to fill up the blanks by himself or herself.<br><br>Rgds,<br>the pikamaster</div>
