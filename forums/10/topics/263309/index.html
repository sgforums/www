            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's democracy is a joke. Fullstop.<br><br>Lionnoisy and all other's critical against the state of opposition in Singapore, didn't Singapore experimented with a new party back then?<br><br>PAP was formed on 21st November 1954 with every intention of ending the British colonial rule. Fast-forward to the 21st Century, couldn't we argue that our opposition party could also achieve the same, ending PAP's iron-fist rule over the political scene?<br><br><blockquote>Lee contested and comprehensively won the Tanjong Pagar seat in the 1955 elections. He became the opposition leader, pitting himself against David Saul MarshallÂ’s Labour Front-led coalition government. He was also one of PAP's representatives to the two constitutional discussions held in London over the future status of Singapore; the first being led by Marshall and the second by Lim Yew Hock, Marshall's hardline successor. It was in this period when Lee had to contend with rivals from both within and outside of the PAP. While Lee had to keep a safe distance from his pro-communist colleagues as they actively participated in mass and often violent actions to undermine the governmentÂ’s authority, he also consistently maintained his opposition to the ruling coalition, often attacking the latter as incompetent and corrupt. </blockquote>The PAP is in danger of becoming what it has fought to overcome and overthrow. With a new generation of increasingly disgruntled, young educated Singaporeans, PAP is finding hard to secure sentimental votes in the elections.<br><br>I vote based on what I see now, results I saw after the last election, not results and legacies of the past generation of PAP ministers.<br><br>What i felt strongly however, was that MM Lee made a mistake in assigning the post of PM to PM LHL... PM LHL has taken an almost scholastic approach in tackling issues close at heart to Singaporeans, resulting in the displeasure and ire of the general public.<br><br>His exceptionally bad timing in implementing touchy policies is extraordinary to say the least; not to mention the often humourous reasoning behind those policies.<br><br>Singapore took a big step forward with MM Lee. On the other hand, will PM Lee prove to be the catalyst in PAP's downfall?</div>

More people with kidney problems are qualified for admission and patients get more subsidies.<br>The new CEO is paid less than SGD200K per year(although I  think the pay is still too high to run a charity organization).<br>Some people can continue to give reasons to justify the ministersÂ’ high pay to govern Singapore.<br>IÂ’m hoping to see more opposition members voted into parliament in the next election.<br></div>

However, all the mentioned countries has a much larger population than sg, with the exception of HK, which has just abt 3 mil more than sg. In my humble opinion, a larger population is usually followed by a larger political arena. In the case of Singapore, our population is only at 4 mil, with many still being 1st/2nd generation citizens. I would expect them to be contented with a roof over their heads and a full stomach, and thus not as interested in the Sg politics.<br><br>This continuous criticism of the lack of political rights has been around for a very long time, and this is the main point that certain Opposition members are putting forward to garner votes, i.e. "VOTE ME JUST BECAUSE I'M AN OPPOSITION".
