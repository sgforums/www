            <div class='col-md body'>FOREIGN students have aced the O-level examinations again.<br>Of the 25 students who scored nine A1s, half were from outside Singapore: nine of the 25 were from China, two from Malaysia and one from Korea.<br><br>Last year, about a dozen out of 39 students with nine A1s - also about a third - were from China.<br><br>Their teachers say these students deserve their grades because they work hard and are motivated.<br><br>What is more remarkable about the China students is that most of them arrived here as recently as two years ago, with barely a Primary 4 foundation in English.<br><br>But if the foreigners seem to figure prominently among those who bag straight As, it is also because the cream of the Singapore student cohort has left the O-level route for the Integrated Programme (IP).<br><br>IP students bypass the O-levels, but go on to take the A-level or International Baccalaureate exams.<br><br>Among the China students whose results shone on Friday was 18-year-old Cai Sang of Anderson Secondary.<br><br>Just 18 months ago, she failed the first English exam she sat for at the school because she could not even understand the questions.<br><br>The only daughter of a teacher and civil servant then decided to pour all her energy into the language: She started by memorising the Longman dictionary.<br><br>She covered it in half a year, but when that did not improve her grades by much, she decided to change tack by reading the classics.<br><br>She said: 'I was frustrated and demoralised because I kept getting C5 and C6 no matter how hard I tried. But I just told myself to keep working at it. It finally paid off.'<br><br>She is one of Anderson's two students with nine A1s. The other is Singaporean Tim Wei Lun.<br><br>Local students like him are being spurred on by healthy competition from their foreign-born peers.<br><br>River Valley High English teacher Muhammed Faizad Salim, 28, who had 12 China students in his class, said they start outdoing the Singaporeans in English in Secondary 4, which stirs up the locals 'because they don't want to lose out'.<br><br>The competition pushed at least one Singaporean student to excellence.<br><br>Dunman High's Foo Wei Ting, who scored nine A1s, said she often studied with her classmates from China as they were so motivated.<br><br>'I heard they studied late into the night in the hostel...so I...wanted to work hard as well,' said the eldest daughter of a senior supervisor and a housewife.<br><br>The Ministry of Education also released lists of the top students from each ethnic group on Friday.<br><br>The top Malay student was Zulaiha Said from Tanjong Katong Girls, with eight A1s; the top Indian student was Norshima Nashi of Bukit Panjang Government High, with eight A1s and two A2s; and the top Eurasian student was Marialaura Lui from Zhonghua Secondary, with seven A1s.<br><br>A total of 38,593 took the exams last year, out of which 31,490 (81.6 per cent) got five or more O-Level passes.<br><br>This is slightly better than in 2005, when 80.7 per cent of the 30,212 students bagged five or more passes.<br><br>(Straits Times 9 Feb)<br><br></div>
