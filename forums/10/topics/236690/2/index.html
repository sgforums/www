I think PSLE math is a much more cerebral exercise than O' level E or A maths ...<br><br>at O' levels with a couple of decades of 10 years series you can hardly get surprised by anything they throw at you ...<br><br>it's no distinction when approximately 70 to 90 % of students get distinctions for E and A maths and certain schools (yes, I'm talking about mine, a non-SAP neighbourhood school )<br><br>ditto the sciences ...<br></div></blockquote>I think going through the 10 years series, students get to practice how theories can be applied, may be also learn some exam technique, but don't think anybody can memorize the answers in the 10 years series. We memorize the theory, the technique of applications, but certainly not the solution and answers.<br><br>Last time students never had 10 years series, and there were little practices they could do with the theory they learned.  Now, with the 10 years series, more students, not so intelligent, can also score, with practice. In the end, it is hard work that really matters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Big deal. Standards have dropped significantly as schools take more students per cohort and our education system is being revamped to being creative than academic. Anyway this is wake up call for SG parents that not only jobs will be lost to foreigners, even places in school will go to them.(Those that pay gahmen lots of money to get in).
