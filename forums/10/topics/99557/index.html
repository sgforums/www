            <div class='col-md body'>Whether LTA has abused the COE system or not, one thing is for sure that Singaporeans do not own a car! You pay a hefty sum to pick a car of your choice and rent it from the government for the next 10 years!By all circumstances you need to keep and maintain the car in working conditions. You need to pay a hefty sum to maintain it and for the rising petrol bills in order to run it and pay for the carparks all over Singapore!<br><br>You can rent the HDB flat for a longer period-99 years, and whatever you earn each month you must make sure you can afford to pay these two big rental instalments for the next 7 to 20 years. Many Singaporeans are wondering how they could be entrepreneurial when they have no saving or no capital to start a business. More are beginning to wonder what to defend in time of war when they practically own nothing ?</div>

Those cars get refurbished and sold to asia and mebbe even singapore and even after 10yrs here a fren once a dealer told me confidentially sometimes after they scrap it buy cutting it in half, it again gets secretly "unscrapped" and sent back to singapore roads for another 10 years like the recent cases uncovered. Or it finds it's way to the streets of indonesia or vietnam.<br><br>Personally I wouldn't ever buy a car not in singapore, it will never be an asset only a liability, rather deploy that money for more profitable investment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We were once a colony of the British empire, and it follows logically that it would be easier to follow their way of doing things.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">In traditional Brit, all land is property of the crown. Only royalty can own property (ie. a Baron can own large piece of land and raise taxes, a page owns his own horse). All peasents, that's me too, rent our homes from the ruler and we have to pay for it via work or payment.</span><br><br>That's why you have only lease hold on any land you buy in Sg. Buying freehold high rise does not count as owning land unless you can float.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Back in traditional Brit, whenever there is a military threat, the local lords raise local militia to fight. That means farmers wear govt issued armour and use govt issued weapons and run into flying arrows.</span><br><br>Same thing here today. You wondered why govt so nice, give you free uniform, free SBO, then ask you to run into flying bullets. Its all following tradition.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Local lords control their own taxes, some lords that love their people raise lower taxes. Some lords that care only about drinking and womenising raise higher taxes to support their extravagant lifestyle.</span><br><br>Sounds familiar? Enuff said.<br><br>Singapore's system is nothing new.
