I don't think so...<br><br>Do you think the info or data in Janes' or the book "Defending the Lion City" is up-to-date? i don't think so...<br><br>I have read through the book and came across info which are wrong or incorrect.<br><br>Never assume that Singapore will be safe and fine forever. It will never be.<br><br>Even with the various intell or security depts in singapore, things will still happened.<br>It's just that some or most of the incidents have been classified, unknown to the general public.<br>Its only made known to those who needs to know them (Need-to-know-basics) only.<br><br>Like what happened in Taiwan, one of the magazines printed out classified info on tawian's security, info of some of its overseas spying posts and agents disclosed.<br>In the end, the relevant depts have immediately "evcauated" these people from the various places, back to taiwan.<br><br>What does these tells us? you think there's no overseas spys in singapore? I don't think so at all.<br><br>Looks like I have commented too much over here. would like to know how others think. please kindly place your comments.<br><br></div>
