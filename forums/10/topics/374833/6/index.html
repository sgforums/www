              <p>Angel7030, (this time most certainly not a mistake), I am deeply moved by your posts on this thread and feel honoured and priviledged to see such works, comming from a 19 year lady.</p>
              <p>Regardless if others think you are guy, or a girl, call you hurtful names, or cast aspersions on your goodself, you had shown great control and handling beyond your age, of intelligence and precocious maturity rarely seen.</p>
              <p>This is not flattery, or idol worshipping, only honesty on my part for I can feel you are writing from your heart - a Singaporean. You are the kind of young people this country needs, to elevate our nation to the next higher level. May more of our young think  like you.</p>
              <p>There is hope, inspite of the gloom, rants and ventings some seem determined to splash around.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>PS: This is a rather uplifting tune, a mash up of the hits from 2008. It kinda represents the mash up of us all, all kinds of people - some angry, some in serenity, and when combined, it is us all - you and me - Singaporeans, working together towards a common and resolute better future.</p>

              <p>I am not in any PAP group, but i was taught by my grandma to understand the word Peace, it is very important for our civilisation, without it, nothing, not even money can sustain happiness. People tends to take Peace for granted even when peace is serve directly on their plate. Whether PAP is good or no good in each and everyone perspectives, i do respect it, for no govt is perfect. But to understand that PAP bring about Peace to this very country is a great blessing for us. Changes there will be, and i hope in whatever changes is make in politics, whether oppositon take over or PAP change old guards, that very fragile Peace must be maintained, otherwise, we are history.</p>

              <p>Do you know what is the price of peace that has been paid by Singaporeans ? </p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that Singaporeans should step back, watch and allow our senses to be raped by all the injustices and arrogant politics served as <em>fait accompli</em> ?</p>

              <p>Therefore in whatever the ruling party is doing, as long as it bring along peace, harmony and a place for us to make a living with 3 meals per day on the table, i am contented, any extra will be a bonus. Whether PAP is doing business or whatsoever, you have to respect them for bringing this essence of life into us for the last 2 to 3 generation from my Dad to me..why should i then choose to create trouble just because someone said you need to have more opposition in the parliament, for what? to create war and chaos? So, for heaven and earth sake, let there be peace </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Obvioiusly you do not know the functions of a Parliamentary Democracy - to ask for the reason of having more opposition in parliament ?</p>
              <p>Does having more opposition in Parliament means more chaos and wars created ?</p>
              <p>How does more opposition in Parliament result in war and chaos ?</p>
              <p>How has your creative mind develop such events to happen ?</p>
              <p>War with another country ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, US$100 Billion of our hard earned money is lost without any clear accountability.</p>
              <p>Do you know how much good that US$100 Billion could have done for the jobless, the aged, the infirmed, the terminally sick in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>We have instead seen US$100 Billion used to chase worthless stakes offered at high prices for sinking banks without any clear understanding of the situation, only to find out that the cash injection that was supposed to save the sinking financial institutions had been diverted to pay bonuses of the Top Executives who cause the disasters.</p>
              <p>Without checks and balance, any government will move to monopolise power to themselves, and become the law for themselves, dealing with arrogance and impunity that result in non-transparency and inaccountability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>History has already shown in some countries who underestimated peace. I agree that rulers are greedy, but who dun as greed is a human nature, when ousted Ferdinand Marcos, the philipinos went into a total economy collapse, terror war, coup after coups, and their ladies hv to work as maid in other countries, get torture or mistreated or even raped, when Suharto was ousted in Indonesia, what happen? president after presidents cannot control the system, full corruption, racial riot leading to chinese killing and beheaded, need full IMF support, lowering of currency into a crisis etc etc..., and when Thaksin was ousted, you look at thailand, protest after protest, killing, fighting, prevention of meetings, etc etc..till now. But if you look at the times during their reigning period, you see the country economy at full swing, everyone got work, peace and harmony was in there. YOU UNDERSTAND, the sacrification of opposition to hold their temper and stop creating problem for the govt for the sake of the Singapore Citizens is a great sacrification, and to me, if they can do that, it bring about peace in Singapore, and i will respect them more than PAP.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you justifying that as long as the Philippines had thrived they should allow the Marcos family to raid the Philippine Treasury ?</p>
              <p>The fact that the Philippine economy finally crashed was due to the Marcos Family transferring more Billions into their overseas account during the final days of the regime, when they have already been caught for all their illegal transactions.</p>
              <p>The Philippine economy was already on thin ice and the momentum came to a screeching halt as a result of their misplaced Nationalism when they threw out the US Military facilities that had sustained their economy before they could get their house in total order.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the sake of Peace - are you suggesting that as long as you get 3 meals a day, and get a NWC approved bonus annually - we should allow the PAP to bankrupt the Singapore Reserves with more losses on the scale of the unaccountable loss of US$100 Billion ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans like the Thais, or the Filippinos, or the Taiwanese ?</p>
              <p>Your ability to measure us downwards is amazing considering that you do not even know how to aim high even for your ambitions and hopes but will prefer to hangout in the dumps as long as you can scrap enough for 3 meals a day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If in the 1950s, Singaporeans are all like you - having already 3 meals a day, and when 1 cent was worth something, and a univesity fresh graduate can earn $1,500 a month and purchase a terrace house in Serangoon Gardens for $35,000 - would LKY have been motivated to struggle for independence ?</p>
              <p>The British Colonial Government was doing a good job until the Japanese came and disrupted the peaceful environment; and the British restored the economy up until the time when a bunch of passionate young rebels decided to form the PAP to call for Freedom and Human Rights for Singaporeans - and independence for Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you were around then, we could have heard you saying -</p>
              <p>"<em>Freedom for what ? Human Rights for What ? Independence for What ? We already got 3 meals a day what ?</em> "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your kind of talk is dangerous for Singapore's Future - and I am not sure if you are a fake Singaporean or a real Taiwan National who is an economic immigrant and have yet to imbued the Singapore Spirit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we were to listen to your kind of PEACE preaching - we may as well roll over and allow any foreign nation to walk into Singapore and takeover the Government for the sake of Peace.</p>
              <p>For the sake of Peace, we should not invest 6 per cent of our GDP to build the SAF, we should abandon National Service as it is an instrument for War - and according to your kind of talking, we should avoid all actions that lead to War.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The simplistic and shallow thinking that you continuously insist in offering can only result in misleading the unthinking to your kind of feeble minded, submissive apathy, and irresponsible indifference that can only lead to the development selfishness, self-centeredness in Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Such attitude will sabotage all efforts to build a cohesive society.</p>
              <p>Can a nation be built - let alone excel - with your kind of low drive, passionless, and submissive acceptance of the status quo ?</p>
              <p>No wonder you have to get out of Taiwan when you cannot stand the heat of intense competition that has honed the best from all the crap.</p>
              <p>Only the stunted brain of a X-rated Marvel will fall for the shallow, passionless, simplisitic ideas from a fake 19 year old horny she-male migrant with a "la la la" attitude towards Singapore Politics.</p>

              <p><br>wow! Mash up dude!!! kind of set me dancing in the morning sun..Thanks</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for heaven sake, i am already 21yo girl. No more a kid on the block ya, I lost my mother since young, she was a taiwanese, very beautiful, that is why my Dad, a true singaporean fall for her, she give birth to my brother (aka longinchjohn) and me. But i am a kind of jinx to her family, cos, not long after giving birth to me, she passed away. Then my Dad give up his job at taiwan, he bring us here, to Singapore to stay with his mother (my grandma). He started the bubble tea business in Singapore which he learned in taiwan in the early 90s, I was very young then, but i believe that time, business was very good. We bought property in joo chiat, then later his business went into deep shit, he also get conned by PRC, we have to sell some properties to cover the losses during the Asian financial crisis, then my family decided to set up Pubs, till now, so far so good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore in life there is up and down, I understand it because I have learn to be independent at a very young age, Dad is always busy with his career and gals, Brother is alway busy with his job and family. Grandma is old and just do the cooking with a maid. I am not those sg childrens who are well spoon feed by their parents and govt. Even when i go out with my sg young frens, i find them very lack of creativity, initiatives and immature. Many lack the respect for elders, knowledge of sex, and cannot take hardship in life. Unlike in taiwan, at a very young age, i learnt about confucian theory on the respect of elder, we go help farmers, we also learn about sex openly. However before i can go into a primary school, i was ploughed back to Singapore to study. But that little education and experiences in taiwan taught me that we are not alone and the basis of peace start from YOU.</p>

              <p>Hi Atobe,</p>
              <p>I like your views and the language articulation is really good.  You wirte like a well trained journalist.  Angel7030 is young and due to her limited &amp; different exposure thus far in her life (only 21 years old, not to discriminate against her age of course), her views can be rather different from many of us.  I will say she is talking beyond her age, partly due to her different background - being born in Taiwan - the foreever fighting state.</p>
              <p>Be gentle with her, mate...</p>
              <p>Btw, care to express your views on my other forum "Top 5 Questions u wanna ask d Government"?  I would like your views...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you know what is the price of peace that has been paid by Singaporeans ? </p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that Singaporeans should step back, watch and allow our senses to be raped by all the injustices and arrogant politics served as <em>fait accompli</em> ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Obvioiusly you do not know the functions of a Parliamentary Democracy - to ask for the reason of having more opposition in parliament ?</p>
              <p>Does having more opposition in Parliament means more chaos and wars created ?</p>
              <p>How does more opposition in Parliament result in war and chaos ?</p>
              <p>How has your creative mind develop such events to happen ?</p>
              <p>War with another country ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, US$100 Billion of our hard earned money is lost without any clear accountability.</p>
              <p>Do you know how much good that US$100 Billion could have done for the jobless, the aged, the infirmed, the terminally sick in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>We have instead seen US$100 Billion used to chase worthless stakes offered at high prices for sinking banks without any clear understanding of the situation, only to find out that the cash injection that was supposed to save the sinking financial institutions had been diverted to pay bonuses of the Top Executives who cause the disasters.</p>
              <p>Without checks and balance, any government will move to monopolise power to themselves, and become the law for themselves, dealing with arrogance and impunity that result in non-transparency and inaccountability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you justifying that as long as the Philippines had thrived they should allow the Marcos family to raid the Philippine Treasury ?</p>
              <p>The fact that the Philippine economy finally crashed was due to the Marcos Family transferring more Billions into their overseas account during the final days of the regime, when they have already been caught for all their illegal transactions.</p>
              <p>The Philippine economy was already on thin ice and the momentum came to a screeching halt as a result of their misplaced Nationalism when they threw out the US Military facilities that had sustained their economy before they could get their house in total order.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the sake of Peace - are you suggesting that as long as you get 3 meals a day, and get a NWC approved bonus annually - we should allow the PAP to bankrupt the Singapore Reserves with more losses on the scale of the unaccountable loss of US$100 Billion ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans like the Thais, or the Filippinos, or the Taiwanese ?</p>
              <p>Your ability to measure us downwards is amazing considering that you do not even know how to aim high even for your ambitions and hopes but will prefer to hangout in the dumps as long as you can scrap enough for 3 meals a day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If in the 1950s, Singaporeans are all like you - having already 3 meals a day, and when 1 cent was worth something, and a univesity fresh graduate can earn $1,500 a month and purchase a terrace house in Serangoon Gardens for $35,000 - would LKY have been motivated to struggle for independence ?</p>
              <p>The British Colonial Government was doing a good job until the Japanese came and disrupted the peaceful environment; and the British restored the economy up until the time when a bunch of passionate young rebels decided to form the PAP to call for Freedom and Human Rights for Singaporeans - and independence for Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you were around then, we could have heard you saying -</p>
              <p>"<em>Freedom for what ? Human Rights for What ? Independence for What ? We already got 3 meals a day what ?</em> "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your kind of talk is dangerous for Singapore's Future - and I am not sure if you are a fake Singaporean or a real Taiwan National who is an economic immigrant and have yet to imbued the Singapore Spirit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we were to listen to your kind of PEACE preaching - we may as well roll over and allow any foreign nation to walk into Singapore and takeover the Government for the sake of Peace.</p>
              <p>For the sake of Peace, we should not invest 6 per cent of our GDP to build the SAF, we should abandon National Service as it is an instrument for War - and according to your kind of talking, we should avoid all actions that lead to War.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The simplistic and shallow thinking that you continuously insist in offering can only result in misleading the unthinking to your kind of feeble minded, submissive apathy, and irresponsible indifference that can only lead to the development selfishness, self-centeredness in Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Such attitude will sabotage all efforts to build a cohesive society.</p>
              <p>Can a nation be built - let alone excel - with your kind of low drive, passionless, and submissive acceptance of the status quo ?</p>
              <p>No wonder you have to get out of Taiwan when you cannot stand the heat of intense competition that has honed the best from all the crap.</p>
              <p>Only the stunted brain of a X-rated Marvel will fall for the shallow, passionless, simplisitic ideas from a fake 19 year old horny she-male migrant with a "la la la" attitude towards Singapore Politics.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Uncle, I quote you an example, let say you are given a chance with LKY face to face with nobody around, and you got a gun that can kill him anytime, i know u hate him because of what he did to you, so you are very happy to be given a chance, then God say to you, my Son, go ahead and kill him, but did think of what happen after you killed him, managed to run away. What will happen to millions of citizens, families, Singapore as a whole, the economy, the security, the 3 meals the table, the old, the sick and the people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>All will be in chaos, fragmented, power struggle leading to civil fighting and protesting...just because you put that bullet into his head. LKY may not be good, a dirty politician but that is his job, his job scope, his way of holding to power and his way of survive. Cruel it might be at time, but in exchange for peace and harmony, can u just dun mess it up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these problem started when my God said "Let there be light", i told him so many time to say "Let there be peace" but he dun listen, that is why i am here to trying my best to make you all understand because who dun make mistake, even God also make mistake, he created humankind, that was the greatest mistake.</p>

              <p>You are really sweet, not just becuase you look presentable, also because you have substance.  I do not agree with some of your views, not because of the direction you take them, but the angle &amp; sometimes the depth that you take them.</p>
              <p>I notice you tend to take comments and opinion as a challenge, why is that?  You should find that many a times many people are saying things that is consistent with your views, but the tone you used make it sound like a debate.  Hey, you have your style and one should always respect that.  But for the sake of all people who really contribute (not the crap talking kind of course), I view everyone as a POTENTIAL FRIEND (at least in the cyberspace), and it will help develop our network if we could conduct our discussions in a more cordial way.</p>
              <p>I know sometimes discussion can be emotional (that makes it juicy right?), but be our sweet swwet angel will ya... :)</p>

              <p>I do not assume you are a sweet sweet darling.  I used the word "Sweet" because you are tasteful in terms of looks and you have content in your comments - it was a compliment you know.  See what I mean, you tend to take things negatively.</p>

              <p>With your daily horny feelings to park yourself in this Forum every morning to disrupt every thread, everyone here knows how "yang" you feel looking for the "ying" daily at the regular times - and only to be disappointed with the dysfunction when everyone encounter your "hum". </p>
              <p>Do you seriously know how fragile this small island can be when an irresponsible government continue unchecked and abuse all the powers to become unaccountable and non-transparent to lose billions of our Reserves ?</p>
              <p>Even MM LKY had claimed that IF ever this country were to be runned by incompetent people, this country cannot be put together again.</p>
              <p>Taking him on his words - do you know what future he has left for Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The future for Singapore is a government that has all the powers being monopolised by a PAP that dominates all political, economical, social and cultural activities through all the Government Ministries, Parliament, Judiciary, Civil Service, Military, Police, People's Association, Grass-root Organisations, Trade Unions, Manufacturing and Service Industries, Transportation and Utilities, and all other essential services.</p>
              <p>Is there anything to check the PAP ?</p>
              <p>Can the PAP be the same throughout the decades ahead into the future ?</p>
              <p>Does it answer to any Public Audit, or will the Public Auditor not succumb to the political powers wielded by a PAP no longer led by MM LKY ?</p>
              <p>If you pretend to be a young adult - male or female - at least learn to grow up and take charge of your future, and if you cannot have any idea how to grow up and face the future - step aside, and try not to get roll over.</p>
              <p>If you insist in participating then get involve, take charge and not participate by letting others take charge and involve on your behalf.</p>
              <p>If you must let others get involve on your behalf, take an interest to protect your stakes to ensure that proper and honest representation has been made.</p>
              <p>If you insist on resigning 100 per cent to allow others to represent your interest, then let others do the confrontation to get the answers - stop being a wet blanket to douse the smoke so as to conceal the flame - as you are too afraid that the flame witll consume you and what you have.</p>
              <p>A smoke can be concealed, the flames on the surface can be doused, but the ambers that continue to burn beneath will slowly and surely affect the sub-soil, which will surely bury you whole when it collapse without warning and then you will be immerse completely in slow fire that will consume all that you have.</p>
              <p>By then if you still retain any conciousness, and can still be awake - it will be too late.</p>

              <p>It will be ultimately satisfying to prove wrong his political model of a singular strong PAP controlled by his genetic clones, and dominating all spheres of Singapore Life is the only model for Singapore.</p>

              <p>All will be in chaos, fragmented, power struggle leading to civil fighting and protesting...just because you put that bullet into his head. LKY may not be good, a dirty politician but that is his job, his job scope, his way of holding to power and his way of survive. Cruel it might be at time, but in exchange for peace and harmony, can u just dun mess it up.</p>

              <p>Your imagination is a result of an uneducated mind accustomed to the nightmares fed with the "hum" juice from the bogey man skilled in the arts of weaving frightening events to mould blank minds to move in his ways.</p>
              <p>Have you seen the strengths of mental power can bend silver spoon at a distance ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, it will be cruel to bend minds like yours that sticks out like "hum" from the cockle shell.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>All these problem started when my God said "Let there be light", i told him so many time to say "Let there be peace" but he dun listen, that is why i am here to trying my best to make you all understand because who dun make mistake, even God also make mistake, he created humankind, that was the greatest mistake.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you blaming God for saying "Let there be light" ?</p>
              <p>Why did you not blame yourself for not using the light to search for your brain, when you had placed your "hum" into a small shell and could not fit your brain into it ?</p>
              <p> Or did you lose your brain in the darkness and blame God for creating the light to allow everyone to see your brainless "hum" ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, you will want peace, so that the 6 per cent GDP need not be spent for the SAF, and all Singaporeans can spend it on your useless "hum" and in your preferred darkness too .</p>
              <p>Only you will believe that your God can make a mistake.</p>
              <p>If my God can make a mistake, it was to have made you into a "hum".</p>
              <p>Should I question or blame my God for this supposed mistake that my limited knowledge can understand ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps your existence as a "hum" has a purpose - to keep men in a constant state of dysfunction at the sight of your "hum".</p>
              <p>So much for the "la la la" philosophy from a self-admitted 30 year old "hum" that was thrown out of Taiwan - and pretending to be 19 at one moment, 21 at another, and above 21 when convenient.</p>
