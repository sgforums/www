              EarlNeo,
              
              I am overally ok with my government thus the 7.5 rating.  I know they "play tricks" as in "CRAP" that Angel3070 refers to quite often, I just wanna help to improve the situation.
              
              We WILL NEVER get a genuine and whole-hearted government as politics is not about LOVE for the people, it is about the control of resources for whatever causes the ruling party deems fit.  I am sure most people who have contributed to this forum are not naive enough to think we have a loving and kind government, just like me.
              
              But despite all these, it does not stop me from communicating to the government as it is our country n our lifes, so I hope we can see beyond the government and the imperfections that exist in our society.  In short, be positive and do something about it.  I am just a regular Joe hoping to do my part, that's all.  I think some of us could consider changing our attitude from being passive to proactive.

              <p>Angel7030,</p>
              <p>Not wrong in terms of seeing things on the surface, people do complaint especially during tough times and the government does try to win votes from various avenues especially during voting times.</p>
              <p>In a way, some individuals (whose name I shall not mention) tend to treat politics as a <span>BUSINESS</span> and Ministers are being treated and measured like professional managers. If you ask me, this is wrong!!!!! There should be a sense of service towards ones country and if we need to give out high salary to exchange for patriotism, then something is really wrong here. This could be another topic for another day.</p>
              <p>Btw, r u in the <span>PAP</span> youth?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I am not in any PAP group, but i was taught by my grandma to understand the word Peace, it is very important for our civilisation, without it, nothing, not even money can sustain happiness. People tends to take Peace for granted even when peace is serve directly on their plate. Whether PAP is good or no good in each and everyone perspectives, i do respect it, for no govt is perfect. But to understand that PAP bring about Peace to this very country is a great blessing for us. Changes there will be, and i hope in whatever changes is make in politics, whether oppositon take over or PAP change old guards, that very fragile Peace must be maintained, otherwise, we are history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore in whatever the ruling party is doing, as long as it bring along peace, harmony and a place for us to make a living with 3 meals per day on the table, i am contented, any extra will be a bonus. Whether PAP is doing business or whatsoever, you have to respect them for bringing this essence of life into us for the last 2 to 3 generation from my Dad to me..why should i then choose to create trouble just because someone said you need to have more opposition in the parliament, for what? to create war and chaos? So, for heaven and earth sake, let there be peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>History has already shown in some countries who underestimated peace. I agree that rulers are greedy, but who dun as greed is a human nature, when ousted Ferdinand Marcos, the philipinos went into a total economy collapse, terror war, coup after coups, and their ladies hv to work as maid in other countries, get torture or mistreated or even raped, when Suharto was ousted in Indonesia, what happen? president after presidents cannot control the system, full corruption, racial riot leading to chinese killing and beheaded, need full IMF support, lowering of currency into a crisis etc etc..., and when Thaksin was ousted, you look at thailand, protest after protest, killing, fighting, prevention of meetings, etc etc..till now. But if you look at the times during their reigning period, you see the country economy at full swing, everyone got work, peace and harmony was in there. YOU UNDERSTAND, the sacrification of opposition to hold their temper and stop creating problem for the govt for the sake of the Singapore Citizens is a great sacrification, and to me, if they can do that, it bring about peace in Singapore, and i will respect them more than PAP.</p>

              <p>to qualify to be PAP party member, one must first have a PHD in robbery($$), only then, will your application be considered,</p>

              <p>btw, if im not wrong.</p>
              <p>sg is one of few (what the govt claims as)- democratic country, which has a political party making up the govt. The govt, by right, should be independant, but this one special case.</p>

              <p>Therefore in whatever the ruling party is doing, as long as it
                  bring along peace, harmony and a place for us to make a living with
                  3 meals per day on the table, i am contented, any extra will be a
                  bonus. Whether PAP is doing business or whatsoever, you have to
                  respect them for bringing this essence of life into us for the last
                  2 to 3 generation from my Dad to me..why should i then choose to
                  create trouble just because someone said you need to have more
                  opposition in the parliament, for what? to create war and chaos?
                  So, for heaven and earth sake, let there be peace.</p>

              <p>okok.. i get what you mean. sooooooo.....</p>
              <p>if you dont get 3 meals a day and the country is in chaos, will you vote otherwise and support the opposition or will you root for the PAP? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>alright. Besides this. Have you though of beforehand that not everyone is as fortunate as you, to have (as what you describe) a decent lifestyle. Some folks dont even have 3 meals a day, heck, even a roof over their head.</p>
              <p>Im not saying that this only applies to sg, in other developed countries, there are also homeless and less fortunate people. Its just that the % in sg is much more. Perhaps, as some might think. Despite me/you being well off, my/your vote can actually transpire a change or reform in the policies (good or bad, well... thats up to the opposition), which may help loads of other people.</p>
              <p>Well. Im not saying that the opposition is always right, but, their views should too be considered, and noting, the impacts of an implementation of a policy.</p>
              <p>Ok, just some things i disagree and agree with. Some things which contradict. Like for example the POA, which was introduced, several months back. One thing is that it restricts the freedom of the people, but another, it goes against what we used to pledge everyday in the morning as "to build a democratic country". I do not see how democracy is progressing with this. But then again, old man Lee recently stated that "the pledge is just an aspiration".on one hand, yes, its justifiable as it enforces peace. But on the other, if you'd look at it, its actually attempting to suppress the publics rage/frustrations. And if this boils over(in the long run), well... it would deem the POA as a failure.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it would seem much better and more relieving that the PAP scraps the idea of claiming sg as a democratic country, when people are even restricted to the basic rights of freedom of speech.</p>
              <p>also to what you pointed out. Yes, too much corruption is bad. But what makes you think that the PAP is not corrupted? And about the riots and killings, yes, those are true. But once again. I personally feel that a compromise is much much much better than a restriant.</p>
              <p>So.... im not saying that you're wrong in your views, you're right infact, but i'd just like to add in certain points which you didnt cover- which would make it a fair argument.</p>
              <p>well.. so id like to say, to compromise is the key. Too much or too little of something, and the system goes out of balance- and it proves true in society, as what you've stated. Compromise. Compromise.</p>

              <p>That is quite a popular film on internet these days. I have only seen the first one.</p>
              <p>I consider it to be rubbish. There are a lot of similar documentaries like Zeitgeist, spreading nonsense and confusion. I think it is very bad.</p>
