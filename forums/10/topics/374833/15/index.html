              <p>Hi Fellow Singaporeans,</p>
              <p>So where are we now, after opening this forum for over a
              month?  Taking stock of what we have, I see mostly negative
              feedback.  Ok for those who have written in, you have made
              your point.</p>
              <p>What about others, people who have visited this forum and not
              posted anything?  Do you anything GOOD to say?</p>
              <p>Surely, with the country doing rather well (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YES</span></strong> with deficiencies
              and questionable policies/ actions at times), something is wrong
              here if most things said about our country or government is
              negative??!!</p>
              <p>So c'mon, hope to hear from you!  Thanks.</p>

              <p>I can appreciate your opinion and my personal conclusion is that negativity is so overwhelming that people who wish to state otherwise just dun find enough support/ audience.  Hence, we are where we are...</p>
              <p>I am about to stop visiting this forum as this site no longer gives me incentive to come back for more.  There are a few neutral and thinking forumers, but I can't say the same for most, who are in my opinion, a tad on the emotional side.</p>
              <p>Anyway, good luck.</p>

              <p>I will attempt to answer your question with some form of justification.</p>
              <p>I am basing my rating of the govt on the oath brought up in our pledge</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Democratic Society (4/10)</strong></span></p>
              <p>Democracy is still a huge issue with Singapore today. We are still afraid of questioning the Govt face to face, we are short of options in our Govt, we are even afraid to vote for the opposition as some of us are afraid of backlash from the Govt</p>
              <p>but from another point of view, they have started to relax their controls on the internet, etc (which I believe its more a case of knowing they have no choice, rather than they are willing to), therefore instead of 3/10, I am giving the govt 4/10.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Justice (7/10)</strong></span></p>
              <p>Justice is quite good. The courts are very impartial when it comes to normal cases. However, for every case against the govt, it's almost always the govt wins. The PAP enjoys suing opposition members, and they almost always enjoy victory.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Equality (3/10)</strong></span></p>
              <p>Seeing people like DPM Wong who can still be there when the greatest terrorist of our history escape from prison.</p>
              <p>Seeing people like Ho Ching who can still be there when our funds lost 40% of its value.</p>
              <p>There is no equality between organizations and individuals.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Govt does not provide a safety net for white collar workers above $2k monthly pay (we are always on our own), if unfair dismissal, you are on your own</li>
              <li>Govt does not prevent age discrimination. </li>
              <li>White collar workers can lose their jobs even if they are performing (read your contract. Organizations can ask a person to leave giving 1 month in lieu of salary, no reasons need to be given). No job security</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Unspoken discrimination preference given to foreign talent vs local talent. Enough said.</p>
              <p>3/10 in my opinion. After all, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Equality is an aspiration, NOT an oath, according to MM Lee</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Happiness (5/10)</strong></span></p>
              <p>Are we happy? I don't know about you. But with escalating costs and suppressed wages, this is 5/10 for me. I am neither happy nor extremely upset. I just merely found a better way of life. Obviously for me, I will always want to score an 8 or 9 out of 10 in all my exams, including the examination of happiness.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prosperity (7/10)</strong></span></p>
              <p>Economic progression is good. Our govt is doing well in surviving the credit crisis, though we were one of the 1st to go into recession.</p>
              <p>Give it due credit for being a great corporation. However, give it due credit for going into recession so quickly as well, plus the loss of value in our funds in GIC and Temasek.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Progress (5/10)</strong></span></p>
              <p>Progress is broken into economic progression and social progression for me. Economic progression is good (See prosperity), but social progression is almost ZERO for me. The govt has been focusing too much on economic progress, believing that economic progression will cure all other aspects of issues.</p>
              <p>However, its not the case. Too many people get left behind, life gets tougher in Singapore due to rising costs</p>
              <p>(8 pts out of 10) for economic progression. (2 out of 10 for social progression), average to 5/10</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">TOTAL: 5.2/10.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore scores well in the economy and in the courts, but everything else is "JUST PASS", or "Have to do better"</p>

              <p>I am impressed with the breakdown, a reflection of well organized thoughts and certainly something I ought to have began with.</p>
              <p>My overall rating approach (based on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">safety/ affordability/ quality of living/ overall quality compared to other governments</span></strong>) was not clear enough for some people, and I agree.</p>
              <p>Looking at my criterias, in itself, one can see I wasn't looking beyond quality living as far as this government was concerned.  Does it mean I had not much hope for them to perform like true leaders?  May be, but at the point of posting I wasn't thinking that much about them.  Probably, I had a bad experience with Mah BT &amp; Lim SS - so arrogant, not too long ago.</p>
              <p>Your criterias should be the benchmark for ratings as far as this thread is concerned, unless there are good additions from the people.  I would also suggest, since we live in a inter-connected world and not in isolation, where we stand relative to other countries.</p>
              <p>Bravo.</p>

              <p>I am impressed with the breakdown, a reflection of well
              organized thoughts and certainly something I ought to have began
              with.</p>
              <p>My overall rating approach (based on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">safety/ affordability/ quality of
              living/ overall quality compared to other
              governments</span></strong>) was not clear enough for some people,
              and I agree.</p>
              <p>Looking at my criterias, in itself, one can see I wasn't looking
              beyond quality living as far as this government was
              concerned.  Does it mean I had not much hope for them to
              perform like true leaders?  May be, but at the point of
              posting I wasn't thinking that much about them.  Probably, I
              had a bad experience with Mah BT &amp; Lim SS - so arrogant, not
              too long ago.</p>
              <p>Your criterias should be the benchmark for ratings as far as
              this thread is concerned, unless there are good additions from the
              people.  I would also suggest, since we live in a
              inter-connected world and not in isolation, where we stand relative
              to other countries.</p>
              <p>Bravo.</p>

              <p>Actually, I am a more moderated anti-PAP Singaporean versus some of the others here. Quite a number here want the PAP to be brought down.</p>
              <p>I, on the other hand, want MORE opposition into parliament. The PAP can still hold the majority, but opposition should have a significant voice to ensure the PAP continues to listen to the people's opinions.</p>
              <p>Basically, Singapore will collapse today, if PAP falls, because we have NO alternative to them. Look at Thailand. Thaksin was brought down WITHOUT a credible alternative. That set the collapse of Thailand's economy and its credibility as a place for investment.</p>
              <p>In general, I believe change must happen to the fat people at the top of the tree. Many of today's problems are caused by them. Once you trim the fats, and the people's opinions are taken seriously, then Singapore would be a good place to live in.</p>
              <p>The pro-PAP supporters will have you believe I am whining (people like sgdiehard who do not give due respect to others) about the Govt, with no true solution. When in fact, I am targeting the root cause of all the problems in Singapore's society today</p>

              <p><br>Given the current laws, even if a sudden opposition majority in parliament happens the PAP will still retain executive power (Only the President could remove them and we all know the chances of that happening).</p>
              <p>I certainly wouldn't be surprised then if they deliberately drag their feet or sabotage any policies that the opposition brings forward then moan about how incompetent the opposition are.</p>
              <p>I see the opposition taking over as a good possibility but i don't see it happening without a great deal of hurt to Singapore itself and whether we could even recover from it, well i don't know.</p>

              <p>Agreed. No one beats the PAP in terms of the word "kiasu". They have put so many checks in place, with the pretext of putting safeguards for us, when it is MORE for THEM.</p>
              <p>Anyway, seriously, I advocate a moderate govt with more opposition MPs, and a majority still in the hands of the PAP. With that, they will start to listen to the people more, because if they make decisions (eg more ERPs at your doorstep) that cause more pain to the people, they can be sure they will lose more seats in the next round.</p>

              <p>On a blissful and harmonious perspective of myself - there is no rating. However, on the context of medical health and worry in Singapore. I rate it as 6 as there are still many rooms for improvement on the upbringing of ppl. There is an increase in number of hospitals in Singapore, which means the number of ppl suffering medical sickness has increased, this is not a good sign. I would think the number of sickness and worry reflect the success of Singapore as a whole.</p>

Mr Liao Fan met a Master Yun-Gu, a great and well-known Zen Master of his times. Master Yun-Gu told Mr Liao Fan that life can be changed even if it's predestined. (In Buddhism, it's our mind, speech and body action that determine our life). Mr Yu Jing met the Kitchen God whom he had worship every day and also to whom he complaint about his misfortune.<br><br>Comparing the both stories, you'll find that both of them are scholars that are well in Chinese literature but can be said as unfortunate people. They are very unfortunate cause their life are hard but they are also very fortunate to have met a person who can tell them how to change their life.<br><br>In our real world, in fact, we probably have met someone who has told us not to do something wicked or bad. The person could be a saint or sage in disguise. Anyway, misfortune can be change to fortune. Bad luck can be changed into good luck. Everything is within you. From the two stories, we also learn that "repentance" is the main factor for changing life. Learning without repentance won't give you real benefit.<br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/liaofan.pdf"><span class="a"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/liaofan.pdf</span></span></span></a></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Thank you for sharing and I like your approach to this thread, though not as direct for the benefit of those reading in.  Forumers here in general, tend to take words directly (as I learned along the way) and good intentions sometimes bounce off them like ping-pong balls.</p>
              <p>But thanks for the effort you have one audience here...</p>

              <p><br>It is interesting that you will ask this question concerning what does Singaporean really want from the Government - considering that the Singapore Government has decidedly impose themselves onto Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans have any choice whether to have "more or less government" ?</p>
              <p>One will expect you to know that if the Government has imposed and involve itself totally in the lives of Singaporeans - should it not be right for Singaporeans to expect the Singapore Government to be responsible and to do the right thing to correct the situation that Singaporeans and Singapore have now been caught in ?</p>
              <p>While it has sucked away the bulk of the monthly wages that Singaporeans earn - through a plethora of essential services all owned by the Government through pseudo private companies that are all Government Linked - surely there is some minimum social responsibility that the Government should have towards Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>If large Corporations are expected to have a minimum sense of social responsibility towards its customers and society in general, should anything less be expected from a Government - who operate as Singapore Inc. ?</p>
