              <p><br> It is interesting that you will ask this question concerning what
                  does Singaporean really want from the Government - considering
                  that the Singapore Government has decidedly impose themselves onto
                  Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans have any choice whether to have "more or less
                  government" ?</p>
              <p>One will expect you to know that if the Government has imposed
                  and involve itself totally in the lives of Singaporeans - should it
                  not be right for Singaporeans to expect the Singapore Government to
                  be responsible and to do the right thing to correct the
                  situation that Singaporeans and Singapore have now been caught in
                  ?</p>
              <p>While it has sucked away the bulk of the monthly wages that
                  Singaporeans earn - through a plethora of essential services all
                  owned by the Government through pseudo private companies that are
                  all Government Linked - surely there is some minimum social
                  responsibility that the Government should have towards Singaporeans
                  ?</p>
              <p>If large Corporations are expected to have a minimum sense of
                  social responsibility towards its customers and society in general,
                  should anything less be expected from a Government - who operate as
                  Singapore Inc. ?</p>

              <p>You're interested in the here and now - Solving the problem at hand. </p>
              <p>I'm more interested in the aftermath. I look in the context of that the PAP's peak has passed and they will be gone, whether in a peaceful manner or not i don't know and think of what choices we might make. </p>
              <p>To put it simply, you're interested in winning the war i'm just more interested in what we're gonna do after that and if history is of any judge, a far more difficult war would await us.</p>

              <p>As far as<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Atobe's take</span></strong> on the US ability to swing around the situation is concerned, I think he/ she is being optimistic, probably sighting what the Clinton administration did back then.  Knowing him/ her (from this forum), there must be good reasons.</p>
              <p>I tend to be less optimistic.  The current economic turmoil spanding from US to the rest of the world is actually, according to my understanding, 60 years in the making since the 2nd world war.  Without going too deep about the subject matter, as it is not the focus of this thread, I would say the US is actually bankrupt and the financial system is insolvent.  There was an interesting study and it was discovered that the real value of the US is only 2% of the published figures.  2%!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Interesting way to see Obama's so called stimulus package of 5 trillion dollars....If you line up the one dollar bills of the green bag, 5 tirillion can take you from earth to the sun and back!!!  That's how much was thrown into the system.  Where have all the money gone?  This is what the congress is asking.  I can tell you, it is probably written off, hidden behind multiple accounting entries.  Obama knows it, but he cannot acknowlege it.</p>
              <p>With the relentless persuit of dimocracy (yeah right!), and force eating other countries with T-Bonds (like China), US's strong influence on world financial super-system (meaning we'll all be dragged in and share their shit back home), its overly reliance on oil, the arrogance of some western giants (many of them from US, for that matter some oriental giants too) to take the environment for granted - I just cannot see a rosy picture that lies ahead.</p>
              <p>Still, life goes on and we should do something for ourselves for more storms that will inevitably come again. </p>

              <p>He remained only as a Parliamentary Secretary, while others have made it as Acting Ministers, or full Ministers.</p>
              <p>Like the other person from Academia - Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee - both do not seem to have made any impact in politics, nor in the social  arena.</p>
              <p>What could possibly have attracted them into Politics ?</p>
              <p>Could they have succumbed to the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporegovt.blogspot.com/">‘Politics of Money’ (*2) </a>practised by the PAP ?</p>

              <p> Hi Atobe,</p>
              <p>The second link is damaged.</p>
              <p>He was very low key whe he went around visiting China with Mah BT, during his capacity as IES CEO, and now suddenly two year later, he beomes the, is it, the Minister of Defence?  I am surprised.</p>

              <p>Can any one country affect the History of this Globe, or does it not take armageddon to happen as a result of multiple negative players and non-players included ?</p>
              <p>The US Government is not the "be all and end all" of any issues, as the US political and social system and culture allow for more players than the Government alone.</p>
              <p>Lionoasis remark - "There a much bigger picture and beyond the Obama Administration" - is characteristic of his declared position of self-reliance, which is abundant in the USA where the <strong>individual remains the pillar of the community</strong>.</p>
              <p>While I may have a different take with what he had concluded with his reading of his recommended - "Money, Gold, Banking &amp; Government Spending" - I took it with a positive note when this second remark came quickly to the previous comment made.</p>
              <p>The USA remains the single country on this globe, in which the strong vibrant energy in personal creativity, entrepreneurialship, industry can find success, as there are willing risks takers in venture capitalists to support such individual private enterprise.</p>
              <p>With the US openess that encourage individual independence, creativity and enterpreneurialship that are uninhibited and readily supported by the Community - there is hope that the humongous US debt can be trashed in good time with the new co-operation from rival economies such as China.</p>
              <p>Unlike in Singapore, "private capital" in the USA is not feared by the Government - as the political parties that form the US Government of the day do not interfere in the manner that private money is dispensed, whether to support lawful political or clever commercial ideas from any side of the community.</p>
              <p>The US Government do not indulge in pseudo private company to compete with private enterprise, nor to take monopolisitc controls under the pretext of strategic interests or better use of limited resources - and end up soaking up all the capital in the private sector.</p>
              <p>Private Capital can grow quickly when left to manage itself, as seen in the rise of the private family owned Korean Chaebols with a shorter history than Japan's public listed zaibatsues; and which rival in size to the public listed European and US public stock corporations.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the recent spate of positive financial results from US Corporations - since the rescue plans were introduced after the Obama's administration was sworn into office - clearly show the resillience and energy to rebound after each crisis.</p>
              <p>It is for the Obama's Administration to instill discipline in its management of the multi-facetted US economy.</p>

              <p>Thanks I will take a look.</p>
              <p>As far as <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atobe's take</span></strong> on the
              US ability to swing around the situation is concerned, I think he/
              she is being optimistic, probably sighting what the Clinton
              administration did back then.  Knowing him/ her (from this
              forum), there must be good reasons.</p>
              <p>I tend to be less optimistic.  The current economic turmoil
              spanding from US to the rest of the world is actually, according to
              my understanding, 60 years in the making since the 2nd world
              war.  Without going too deep about the subject matter, as it
              is not the focus of this thread, I would say the US is actually
              bankrupt and the financial system is insolvent.  There was an
              interesting study and it was discovered that the real value of the
              US is only 2% of the published figures.  2%!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Interesting way to see Obama's so called stimulus package of 5
              trillion dollars....If you line up the one dollar bills of the
              green bag, 5 tirillion can take you from earth to the sun and
              back!!!  That's how much was thrown into the system. 
              Where have all the money gone?  This is what the congress is
              asking.  I can tell you, it is probably written off, hidden
              behind multiple accounting entries.  Obama knows it, but he
              cannot acknowlege it.</p>
              <p>With the relentless persuit of dimocracy (yeah right!), and
              force eating other countries with T-Bonds (like China), US's strong
              influence on world financial super-system (meaning we'll all be
              dragged in and share their shit back home), its
              overly reliance on oil, the arrogance of some western giants
              (many of them from US, for that matter some oriental giants too) to
              take the environment for granted - I just cannot see a rosy
              picture that lies ahead.</p>
              <p>Still, life goes on and we should do something for
              ourselves for more storms that will inevitably come
              again. </p>

              <p>My view is more optimistic</p>
              <p>The US will turn around, simply because the entire world cannot afford it to fail. It's the world's market. Its consumption is still the highest in the globe. If US falls, then which will be the next market to support the globe?</p>
              <p>China? Not enough morals. Unscrupulous methods of business will ensure China remain behind for the next few decades. I have very strong views that China will not become the world no. 1 force in our lifetime.</p>
              <p>Russia? Still having its own problems.</p>
              <p>The USA is the only country that can spend beyond its means, and yet, continue to remain strong. It's because the entire world subsidizes its debt. At least for the next few decades, I believe the USA will continue to be the world's leading economy.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I do not advocate the US will fall, but I do believe its leadership will be challenged.  The future will be interesting to watch, and I think the evolution is leading towards a multi-leadership scenario, in some areas the US will lead, and in some areas they are also runs.  The world is sick of the US bullshit (sorry for the language) and the time is right to swift the fulcrum.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the world while sick of the US, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not need</span></strong> to see it go down, but will find a solution to co-exist with it and redistribute global power.  Though det is forced onto others, debt is only as good as the confidence in the papers being issued, even currency.  With a bankrupt economy, "confidence" will be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>For China, having the benefit of living here for so many years, I tend to have confidence in the current leadership, and it will emerge and begin to surpass the US in many areas.  By next year, China's GDP is expected to surpass Japan and by 2020, surpass the US, as one trend expert says, I tend to believe him.  May I suggest to visit <a href="http://www.phoenix.com">www.phoenix.com</a> for more data, think you will find it interesting.</p>

              <p>Well China's GDP may supercede US by 2020, its possible. However, it really depends on how things are run, and how the global arena views China's rise.</p>
              <p>There is still substantial doubt that the Communist govt delivers on what they say in the long term. Basically, in communism, the govt can easily pull back on what they say without giving a fair reason. That is one reason a substantial no. of organizations still choose Singapore over Hong Kong or Shanghai as their Asia-Pacific base.</p>
              <p>China is still known for cheap (and not good) products. There are really not many good brands coming out of China. Most people still would not buy "Made in China" products for quality. Korea spent more than 2 decades remodeling itself (Korean brands will pretty lousy stuff in the past), and came out with several good brands like Samsung and LG. After decades in growth, what has China came out with? A massive Milk fiasco that KILLED lives and destroyed their image overnight.</p>
              <p>For China to truly surpass USA, I strongly believe its focus should be on education. Educating morals into the individual. I strongly believe that ethics, morals and business go together.</p>
              <p>Coming back to your discussion on the leadership, I concur that Hu is much better than the Jiang leadership, and that Hu, being the protege of Deng, will probably lead China to greater heights. However, what happens when he steps down? As I mentioned, the communist party can renege on their promises because it does not need to answer to any external party.</p>
              <p>Still, I concur with you that there will be a re-distribution of world order. US will still lead, but it will never be the monopoly of the world ever again (which is actually good in my opinion as well, we should never depend on a single economy). One thing's for sure though. You never see me mentioning Europe as a possible world order. Simply because I have seen Europe, and I feel that Europe is a "has-been". It's time at the top is a thing of the past (forever). And the EU consists of too many heads to really be an effective power.</p>

              <p>China products gaining global recognition, just to list a few: Haier, Lenovo (they probably cheated a bit here), Baidu, Alibaba, Bank of China, Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China (these two banks are ranked in the Top 50 banks in the world).  But I must say, for a country of this size and for the hype that has been created around it for years, there ought to be more brands, given time.  Yes they are not yet ready but getting there.</p>
              <p>I can certainly appreciate the sentiments towards China on other side of the world, I lived there once.  Firstly, there is brand loyalty and therefore equity, secondly, China's marketing is still not that well done.  I believe in their ability to adapt and change if they are to reach out to the world, but then, given the almost virgin local market, do they need to?  Their own domestic market could be the same reason they are not that advanced in internaional markets, but my observation is, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not tapping does not equate to unable to tap</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>The issues surrounding <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China is a very complex</span></strong> one and it will be impossible for me to do it now and here on this forum to explain them all (I am <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>still learning everyday</strong></span> myslef even though I have been here 16 years - yes indeed), but I will just touch on the few things you mentioned.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leadership</span></strong> - China has gone through very deliberate efforts to replace the old guards with younger and new ones.  The average age of Chinese leadership has gone down, average level of education has gone up, transparency in government policy &amp; work has improved, amongst other things.  They have taken many years to get where they are now, from Deng to Jiang to Hu and in a few years, Xi Jin Ping - who is now the Vice President.  As a China veteran, I speak from heart that I have witnessed fundamental changes and determination, and their leadership is top noch.  Yes, there are corruptions but things are moving in the right direction.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education</span></strong> - This is definitely not wrong.  I would add that it is the culture and environment that condition people's value system and the so called socially acceptable behaviour.  Education therefore, should take place in two areas - academics and social, more of the latter, as it is more complex, more temptations, much bigger and where people learn "bad" things.  The former is contained.  The western world has a hand in teaching the Chinese "bad" things too.  The Chinese have learnt a thing or two from foreigners who engaged in fraud or commercial cheating against the Chinese, and the sex liberation in China has probably surpassed many of the more developed countries.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I am sick of China (have been here too damn long), but I have to give credit to its progress, so much so that I wonder if our own leadership can achieve the same results if they ran this country.  Actually I already know the answer...</p>

              <p><br> Good to know that you spotted that my response was "interested
                  in the here and now" - how did you managed it ?</p>
              <p>How do you propose for any Singaporean to solve the
                  problems faced by Singapore at present ? </p>
              <p>Can you do it when you or anyone have no say in anything, and

              <p>If you cannot win the "present war", is there any importance as
                  to what you will do or even can do after the war ?</p>
              <p>If the present situation cannot be changed and is to be
                  treated with irrelevance - will it be of any consequence

              <p>The US Government is not the "be all and end all" of any issues,

              <p>Lionoasis remark - "There a much bigger picture and beyond the

              <p>Unlike in Singapore, "private capital" in the USA is

                  support lawful political or clever commercial ideas from any

              <p>The US Government do not indulge in pseudo private company to

              <p>Under the present circumstances, my contributions have been to straighten the record with whatever means available in a forum - being extremely robust towards those that prefer to deliberately indulge in twisting historical events and propagate the PAP's false interpretations to suit their political agenda.</p>

              <p>I guess our different interpretations of what "openess" means have caused your unnecessary view of contentions as to what make the USA prosperous.</p>
              <p>Your interpretation of "openess" is related to the conduct of the USA in its relations with other nations - as evident in your statement that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">It could well afford to be open when the stakes are to their advantage</span></em>".</p>
              <p>My interpretation of "openess" is as stated - "<em>the US openess that encourage individual independence, creativity and enterpreneurialship that are uninhibited and readily supported by the Community</em>".</p>
              <p>How did you manage to come to the conclusion of my position with your statement - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">you have Faith that the USA would resolve this issue <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on its own</span></span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Did you miss out the part in my paragraph that had mentioned "<em>there is hope that the humongous US debt can be trashed in good time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the new co-operation from rival economies such as China</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>With careful reading is there any need for any contentious shouting match ?</p>
              <p>Is there any need to over-react when your preferred position as stated in your piece has been placed under scrutiny and critiqued on ?</p>
              <p>Surely you must know that this is an open forum, and whatever you post will be subjected to scrutiny and if you cannot hold your position with reason, you may simply get discredited.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you and I are simply annonymous names in this SgForum, what does it matter if one slip and fall when someone spot an error ?</p>

              <p>China products gaining global recognition, just to list a few: Haier, Lenovo (they probably cheated a bit here), Baidu, Alibaba, Bank of China, Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China (these two banks are ranked in the Top 50 banks in the world).  But I must say, for a country of this size and for the hype that has been created around it for years, there ought to be more brands, given time.  Yes they are not yet ready but getting there.</p>
              <p>I can certainly appreciate the sentiments towards China on other side of the world, I lived there once.  Firstly, there is brand loyalty and therefore equity, secondly, China's marketing is still not that well done.  I believe in their ability to adapt and change if they are to reach out to the world, but then, given the almost virgin local market, do they need to?  Their own domestic market could be the same reason they are not that advanced in internaional markets, but my observation is, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not tapping does not equate to unable to tap</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>The issues surrounding <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China is a very complex</span></strong> one and it will be impossible for me to do it now and here on this forum to explain them all (I am <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>still learning everyday</strong></span> myslef even though I have been here 16 years - yes indeed), but I will just touch on the few things you mentioned.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leadership</span></strong> - China has gone through very deliberate efforts to replace the old guards with younger and new ones.  The average age of Chinese leadership has gone down, average level of education has gone up, transparency in government policy &amp; work has improved, amongst other things.  They have taken many years to get where they are now, from Deng to Jiang to Hu and in a few years, Xi Jin Ping - who is now the Vice President.  As a China veteran, I speak from heart that I have witnessed fundamental changes and determination, and their leadership is top noch.  Yes, there are corruptions but things are moving in the right direction.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education</span></strong> - This is definitely not wrong.  I would add that it is the culture and environment that condition people's value system and the so called socially acceptable behaviour.  Education therefore, should take place in two areas - academics and social, more of the latter, as it is more complex, more temptations, much bigger and where people learn "bad" things.  The former is contained.  The western world has a hand in teaching the Chinese "bad" things too.  The Chinese have learnt a thing or two from foreigners who engaged in fraud or commercial cheating against the Chinese, and the sex liberation in China has probably surpassed many of the more developed countries.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I am sick of China (have been here too damn long), but I have to give credit to its progress, so much so that I wonder if our own leadership can achieve the same results if they ran this country.  Actually I already know the answer...</p>
