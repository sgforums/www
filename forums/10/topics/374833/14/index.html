              <p>Hi Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;I believe the bigger picture could be the "culture' that exists
                      in our government.  A culture of "total dominance at whatever
                      cost", a culture of taking the people for granted", and a culture of
                      no or less accountability is no problem.  What it should be, is not what
                      we get (except the bare minimum to win elections), this is my take.</p>
              <p>Hear! Hear!<span>  </span>Both my hands and legs
                      are clapping.<span>  </span>You put it so well!<span>  </span>Are you sure you’ve been away for 20 years?</p>
              <p>My salute for pulling yourself out of bankruptcy twice.<span>  </span>Wish I could hear your story one of these
                      days.<span>  </span></p>
              <p>I was not born with a silver spoon either.<span>  </span>I lived in a kampong, and did not get to live in a HDB until I was 17
                      yrs old.<span>  </span>When I was young, my mother
                      worked in a bread factory.<span>  </span>In those
                      days, the locally baked bread has a hard outer crust that they shave off and
                      discard before selling the soft insides.<span>  </span>Whenever I went to the factory with my mum, I would gorge myself on the
                      discarded crust so that I can eat less at dinner and leave more for
                      others.<span>  </span>I told my mom I liked to eat
                      bread crust and she is none the wiser to this day.<span>   </span>I have always known the importance of money, and devoted the
                      early part of my adult life to accumulating and hording it.<span>  </span>While I am not rich, I have managed to
                      secure some level of financial security that I am comfortable with and my
                      parents will probably not have to worry about money again.<span>  </span>But I have never thought this was to my
                      credit.<span>  </span>I was just lucky, lucky to have
                      a brain that learns fast, lucky to be strong-willed, lucky to be able to
                      acquire skills that are marketable.<span>  </span>I
                      was born this way.<span>  </span>The most I could
                      claim was that I did not lay these gifts to waste.<span>  </span>Not everyone is as lucky.<span>  </span>Their gifts may not be so marketable within their lifetimes.</p>
              <p>I agree that the most important determinant is the state of mind.<span>  </span>But is it something that can be changed or
                      is it something that you are either born with or not?<span>  </span>If the latter, that will explain why people who accept your point
                      of view go back to their old ways.<span>  </span>But
                      I sense that this seems to be your area of expertise.<span>  </span>(?) If so, please share your experience.<span>  </span>It would be great if people’s state of mind
                      can really be changed.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;  But I care enough to plan for something which will remain
                      confidential for the time being.</p>
              <p>Then I shall wish you the best and wait patiently until such time as it can
                      be revealed.</p>

              <p>This is the generation that grew up awed with PAPa's selfish love, and know of no other alternatives except what is told to them by the official press and broadcast media - which will bombard all the "negativism" from the worst in the World, so that what is "bad" at home cannot be "worse" - and can only be "good" by any standard.</p>
              <p>This generation is the streamlined by-products of the PAP tinkering program, who will be afraid to compare ourselves with the Best in the World, and with value systems conditioned into them that is good only for measuring ourselves with the Worst.</p>
              <p>This is the feel good Singaporeans, who will travel and compare life anywhere with what they have in Singapore, instead of experiencing Life for what it can offer in any part of the World simply for the experience that will enrich ourselves, and to better our existing circumstances - even if we measure ourselves with the Worst.</p>

              <p>Hello to The Train,</p>
              <p>Your introductory pieces have detailed the general feelings of
              those - whom I would classify by income groups - as
              being in the Upper Middle Income Earners and or higher,
              educated, "secure" in employment, and having knowledge or some
              familiarity to the "Living Standards" of countries that are
              "better" in most ways that Singapore is "not as good at" and
              deliberately kept that way for obvious reasons.</p>
              <p>"Negativism" takes many forms - from the die-hard
              polarize "<em>negative extreme</em>", to the
              "<em>positive activist response</em>", to the resigned
              level in "<em>don't seem to care too much about</em>"
              anything.</p>
              <p>Each plays a push-and-pull role in a public
              forum attempting to change the public opinion as part of the
              entire political process, and it is good that the honest and robust
              debate exist here, when the national print and broadcast media are
              too "shy" to touch on the many sensitve issues involved.</p>
              <p>When arguments are based on researched
              information that can be further examined or disputed, those
              unable to protect their entrenched false positions will either have
              to withdraw, or face disgraceful recrimination, or subject
              itself to further ridicule - for whatever it is worth in an
              anonymouse place.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, in the rough and tumble world of politics - even
              in this public forum that is in an electronic format, "honesty" is
              conveniently thrown out of the window for the sake of some
              false logic that "reality is facts" - and right or wrong, fair
              or unfair - "facts" must be accepted, any challenge to the
              "facts" must be based on falsehood.</p>
              <p>Such "black" or "white" approach is hopelessly false, as any
              discussion on any political topic is killed as long as the
              "good for the larger majority" reasoning takes precedence.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, what is to be the measure of this "<em>good for
              the larger majority</em>" standard ?</p>
              <p>Who should formulate this standard, and how should it be
              implemented ?</p>
              <p>On issues that you have identified as success by the Government
              at "macro" levels and failures at the "micro" levels - there are
              differing views as to the success even at the "macro" levels
              when the judgment is made from the "glass and
              glitter" that exist.</p>
              <p>At the "micro" level the debate can be even more
              intense.</p>
              <p>In public forums, the sad fact is that some ordinary
              Singaporeans have taken on the same arrogant mental
              process in typical PAP style - when dealing with
              such "queries of concern". </p>
              <p>Some brainless entities will prefer to plagiarize the
              standard propaganda cliches without even a thought if
              they can defend the imitated positions they prefer
              to adopt.</p>
              <p>In reality, can we afford not to care ?</p>
              <p>How long can this indifference continue ?</p>
              <p>Who will pay the price and at what price in the future, if this
              generation is not willing to pay the price in this year or the
              next ?</p>

              <p>Hi Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;I believe the bigger picture could be the "culture' that exists in our government.  A culture of "total dominance at whatever cost", a culture of taking the people for granted", and a culture of no or less accountability is no problem.  What it should be, is not what we get (except the bare minimum to win elections), this is my take.</p>
              <p>Hear! Hear!<span> </span> Both my hands and legs are clapping.<span> </span> You put it so well!<span> </span> Are you sure you’ve been away for 20 years?</p>
              <p>My salute for pulling yourself out of bankruptcy twice.<span> </span> Wish I could hear your story one of these days.<span> </span></p>
              <p>I was not born with a silver spoon either.<span> </span> I lived in a kampong, and did not get to live in a HDB until I was 17 yrs old.<span> </span> When I was young, my mother worked in a bread factory.<span> </span> In those days, the locally baked bread has a hard outer crust that they shave off and discard before selling the soft insides.<span> </span> Whenever I went to the factory with my mum, I would gorge myself on the discarded crust so that I can eat less at dinner and leave more for others.<span> </span> I told my mom I liked to eat bread crust and she is none the wiser to this day.<span>  </span> I have always known the importance of money, and devoted the early part of my adult life to accumulating and hording it.<span> </span> While I am not rich, I have managed to secure some level of financial security that I am comfortable with and my parents will probably not have to worry about money again.<span> </span> But I have never thought this was to my credit.<span> </span> I was just lucky, lucky to have a brain that learns fast, lucky to be strong-willed, lucky to be able to acquire skills that are marketable.<span> </span> I was born this way.<span> </span> The most I could claim was that I did not lay these gifts to waste.<span> </span> Not everyone is as lucky.<span> </span> Their gifts may not be so marketable within their lifetimes.</p>
              <p>I agree that the most important determinant is the state of mind.<span> </span> But is it something that can be changed or is it something that you are either born with or not?<span> </span> If the latter, that will explain why people who accept your point of view go back to their old ways.<span> </span> But I sense that this seems to be your area of expertise.<span> </span> (?) If so, please share your experience.<span> </span> It would be great if people’s state of mind can really be changed.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;  But I care enough to plan for something which will remain confidential for the time being.</p>
              <p>Then I shall wish you the best and wait patiently until such time as it can be revealed.</p>

              <p><br>Hello Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>Thank God that we have intelligent people who said that "with friends like that, we don't need enemies".</p>
              <p>This is another sample of the kind of losers that I had referred to earlier, and I am surprised that one after the other had decided to appear from the woodwork - to claim ownership to the title that I had eluded in my earlier text.</p>
              <p>These are the characters who cannot stand being exposed for their stupendous ability for their X-rated and Hog-like thinking, and will depend on being fed without critical thinking - with the mechanical ability in absorbing all that is "said" to be "good" and responding only to what has been "told" to them that is "bad".</p>
              <p>This is the generation that grew up awed with PAPa's selfish love, and know of no other alternatives except what is told to them by the official press and broadcast media - which will bombard all the "negativism" from the worst in the World, so that what is "bad" at home cannot be "worse" - and can only be "good" by any standard.</p>
              <p>This generation is the streamlined by-products of the PAP tinkering program, who will be afraid to compare ourselves with the Best in the World, and with value systems conditioned into them that is good only for measuring ourselves with the Worst.</p>
              <p>This is the feel good Singaporeans, who will travel and compare life anywhere with what they have in Singapore, instead of experiencing Life for what it can offer in any part of the World simply for the experience that will enrich ourselves, and to better our existing circumstances - even if we measure ourselves with the Worst.</p>
              <p>Ironically, this is the generation that LKY has lamented for the total lack of uninspired creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, which has required such subjects to be taught as part of the school curriculum.</p>
              <p>It is a surprise that this X-rated kid has been able to see through the wall of text to pick on specific bricks to give his X-rated shallow crtique that sprung from the dry well of soreness from repeated exposure to the spotlight of truth.</p>
              <p>If only the X-rated kid spend less time plagiarizing the ideas and words of those whom he idolised, and learn to be honest with his own views about politics, perhaps he could have delivered those plagiarized politics with some conviction in the delivery</p>
              <p>As matters stand, it has always been a X-rated flop.</p>

              <p><br>Who's the hog, shithead? ATurdy, how about learning basic social skills before dropping into a forum and starting to crap shit? People who hold other alternative political views other than the main party line and your beloved CSJ are considered hogs and X-rated. What can I say of your farked up views? Self-righteous and self-centred. Learn to grow up and mature your thinking.

              <p>The hog is the one who will pick up a thread that is more then 6 day old and decided to fulfill the statement that it will appear from the woodworks to claim ownership to the title of "the hog".</p>
              <p>As to the "shithead" part - it falls on the "zwei-siao" character who is dumb enough to admit its own guilt at being "the hog".</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"main party line"</span></em> - which main party or political party are you referring to ?</p>
              <p>Your dubious politial "love-hate" relationship with the PAP as also with CSJ and SDP is as bad as your pretense at being "Germanic", and as ludicrous as the cartoon character from which you have plagiarized your nick from.</p>
              <p>People ?</p>
              <p>When there is only ONE dumb kid that has been X-rated, and a dumb pretender given the title of a "zwei-siao-hog" ?</p>
              <p>Surely, you and the X-rated kid cannnot encompass all of humanity that have their own axe to grind towards CSJ or the SDP ?</p>
              <p>"Self-righteous and self-centred" - did I make myself as the central issue in any of the exchange with you or the X-rated kid; or has the truth been you and the X-rated kid have been consistently trashed with simple facts that both prefer to walk away from ?</p>
              <p>Basic social skill begin with honesty - if you must learn to teach anyone.</p>

              <p>Hi Fellow Singaporeans,</p>
              <p>So where are we now, after opening this forum for over a month?  Taking stock of what we have, I see mostly negative feedback.  Ok for those who have written in, you have made your point.</p>
              <p>What about others, people who have visited this forum and not posted anything?  Do you anything GOOD to say?</p>
              <p>Surely, with the country doing rather well (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YES </span></strong>with deficiencies and questionable policies/ actions at times), something is wrong here if most things said about our country or government is negative??!!</p>
              <p>So c'mon, hope to hear from you!  Thanks.</p>
