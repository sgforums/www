              <p> </p>
              <p>With your "la la la" attitude - can you ever be serious ? </p>
              <p>Hold on to the size of your head, I was merely alluding to the X-Rated Marvel's horny response when he marvelled with his imagination of "your seriousness" as a 19 year old - as seen in his posted response at the top of this page.</p>
              <p>Calling you a "hum" is already a compliment considering some of the whore labels that have been applied by others on you - which was a reflection of the flippant and ignorant attitude that you degrade each and every thread - with ignorant words that even prostitute will be more discerning to even breathe out of their mouth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With your daily horny feelings to park yourself in this Forum every morning to disrupt every thread, everyone here knows how "yang" you feel looking for the "ying" daily at the regular times - and only to be disappointed with the dysfunction when everyone encounter your "hum". </p>
              <p>Do you seriously know how fragile this small island can be when an irresponsible government continue unchecked and abuse all the powers to become unaccountable and non-transparent to lose billions of our Reserves ?</p>
              <p>Even MM LKY had claimed that IF ever this country were to be runned by incompetent people, this country cannot be put together again.</p>
              <p>Taking him on his words - do you know what future he has left for Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The future for Singapore is a government that has all the powers being monopolised by a PAP that dominates all political, economical, social and cultural activities through all the Government Ministries, Parliament, Judiciary, Civil Service, Military, Police, People's Association, Grass-root Organisations, Trade Unions, Manufacturing and Service Industries, Transportation and Utilities, and all other essential services.</p>
              <p>Is there anything to check the PAP ?</p>
              <p>Can the PAP be the same throughout the decades ahead into the future ?</p>
              <p>Does it answer to any Public Audit, or will the Public Auditor not succumb to the political powers wielded by a PAP no longer led by MM LKY ?</p>
              <p>If you pretend to be a young adult - male or female - at least learn to grow up and take charge of your future, and if you cannot have any idea how to grow up and face the future - step aside, and try not to get roll over.</p>
              <p>If you insist in participating then get involve, take charge and not participate by letting others take charge and involve on your behalf.</p>
              <p>If you must let others get involve on your behalf, take an interest to protect your stakes to ensure that proper and honest representation has been made.</p>
              <p>If you insist on resigning 100 per cent to allow others to represent your interest, then let others do the confrontation to get the answers - stop being a wet blanket to douse the smoke so as to conceal the flame - as you are too afraid that the flame witll consume you and what you have.</p>
              <p>A smoke can be concealed, the flames on the surface can be doused, but the ambers that continue to burn beneath will slowly and surely affect the sub-soil, which will surely bury you whole when it collapse without warning and then you will be immerse completely in slow fire that will consume all that you have.</p>
              <p>By then if you still retain any conciousness, and can still be awake - it will be too late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can one possess a gun in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>In Taiwan, maybe ?</p>
              <p>Why will you want to imagine that I will want to kill LKY when I have the chance ?</p>
              <p>Can that come from a mind of one who had claimed "PEACE" for Singapore ?</p>
              <p>That post was a sham as I had thought it was - especially from a "la la la" she-male.</p>
              <p>IF LKY was to die a sudden death from whatever cause - will it not result in the sudden extinguishing of the source for my passion - and the reasons - to be involve in all the political controversies created by him ?</p>
              <p>It will be enough if he can live till age 120, and remain clear in mind - to see that an Alternative Party have the ideas to prove all that he believed in is wrong.</p>
              <p>It will be ultimately satisfying to prove wrong his political model of a singular strong PAP controlled by his genetic clones, and dominating all spheres of Singapore Life is the only model for Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your imagination is a result of an uneducated mind accustomed to the nightmares fed with the "hum" juice from the bogey man skilled in the arts of weaving frightening events to mould blank minds to move in his ways.</p>
              <p>Have you seen the strengths of mental power can bend silver spoon at a distance ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, it will be cruel to bend minds like yours that sticks out like "hum" from the cockle shell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you blaming God for saying "Let there be light" ?</p>
              <p>Why did you not blame yourself for not using the light to search for your brain, when you had placed your "hum" into a small shell and could not fit your brain into it ?</p>
              <p> Or did you lose your brain in the darkness and blame God for creating the light to allow everyone to see your brainless "hum" ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, you will want peace, so that the 6 per cent GDP need not be spent for the SAF, and all Singaporeans can spend it on your useless "hum" and in your preferred darkness too .</p>
              <p>Only you will believe that your God can make a mistake.</p>
              <p>If my God can make a mistake, it was to have made you into a "hum".</p>
              <p>Should I question or blame my God for this supposed mistake that my limited knowledge can understand ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps your existence as a "hum" has a purpose - to keep men in a constant state of dysfunction at the sight of your "hum".</p>
              <p>So much for the "la la la" philosophy from a self-admitted 30 year old "hum" that was thrown out of Taiwan - and pretending to be 19 at one moment, 21 at another, and above 21 when convenient.</p>

              <p>me is 21 yo, cannot be on the dot right, so 21yo and above lor, last time went i start posting i was 19yo only. I dunno who is that 30yo u talking about...siao liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Howcome  pro-oppositions and supporters all behave like this one ar?? why they like to insult and said peoples if they cannot take an arguement hard on..so lame one. Even me as a neutral party also dun said bad about peoples. Same attitude as CSJ, like to scold and insult peoples, that is a wrong move ya. Be nice lah, it doesn't need to pay to be nice right? That is why sometime i wonder if the opposition is going to win anything with such supporters and advocators.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, to what i observed, all your arguement do not focus on the citizens of Singapore, you are only against the ruling party PAP, your focus is to make LKY and his PAP fall, not on how to make singapore a safer and prosperous place. And because for you own personnal gain, you want people to follow you to go against PAP, other than that, you got no agenda here. Aren't you a selfish old man,..or selfish old uncle, with all due respect.</p>

              <p>Change is what many seeks in life, a new place, a new home, a new job, etc..to fulfil a desire for a better life. We all want improvements, not to remain stagnant or complacent in whatever stage of developement of life we are in.</p>
              <p>The only difference between us and the likes of you is that we seek change by improving upon an existing system, building up the foundations that thousands had gave and sacrifice their lives for - our forefathers whom had faced death, agony, tears, anxiety and a whole gamut of negative emotions to give us what we have today.</p>
              <p>It is our responsibility to ensure their efforts not be wasted, by ensuring we vote for the right person as our representatives, to not only be a voice, but a contributing brain as well for our future developement in a peaceful, conducive and constructive environment, with patience to see it thru even if it takes years.</p>
              <p>Wherelse, you and your kind are hell bent on breaking laws to achieve your aims. No wonder, for you are led by a outlaw yourself.</p>
              <p>Let me remind you that whatever laws that had been made, were made and approved by the majority of citizens in a free election. Otherwise, those laws would have been illegal. We are not a communist state.</p>
              <p>By figuratively thumping his middle finger at our approved laws, Dr.Chee had shown disdain and nil regard for our society, totally no respect for the millions of other citizens living on this island.</p>
              <p>By constantly taking the outlaw path to challenge our laws, not subjecting one to be voted but by street demostrations, this will only lead to chaos and anarchy.</p>
              <p>This is not improvement to change, but a total destruction of existing foundations, starting all over again to achieve what we have today, and what for? So that some ambitous outlaw can seat on the throne?</p>
              <p>How many millions of people must suffer for the delusions and selfish outlaw in the interim, which may take years, if ever peace returns?</p>
              <p>This is you and your kind's path to 'change' - outside of our society and its laws. Your outlaw is never the calibre or class of our current founding fathers, whom faced worse measures such as conniving brits, corrupt racist rulers and capricious commies, and yet managed to outwit, outfox and outclass them all, gaining our indepence without a drop of blood on the 9th of Aug 1965.</p>
              <p>Over my dead body in this form or another if you and your kind will ever get to rule thru the disregard of our precious laws thru anarchy, creating ill will with lies and half truths.</p>

              <p>Now we should seriously marvel at your abilities to read in figurative ways the "thumping of CSJ's middle finger" - when the printed words in clear simple English is myopically viewed as a Wall of Text.</p>

              <p>What was the objective behind the 1996 efforts to block CSJ from succeeding in further elections ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that LHL was already making his way to takeover from GCT by 2002, and that LHL's cancer recovery should not be allowed to deteriorate from any stress after he has taken over the PM's seat from GCT ?</p>
              <p>After demolishing the threats from veteran politicians posed by J.B.Jeyeratnam, Thang Liang Hong and Francis Seow - the only serious challenge then was from CSJ.</p>

              <p>Obviously, the small mind have no courage to dissect and confront your various controversies that were cut up for detailed response.</p>
              <p>Can we expect no more then a passing shot of disgruntled frustration ?</p>
              <p>With shameless X-rated types like you hanging arround - attempting to proselytize others to your unthinking ways - we should all be for pro-abortion in cases of incestuous relationship.</p>

              <p>Judging from the types of content and the vast differences in views/ angles of looking at things.  I could declare my forum a failure as it has failed to compile a meaningful sample of stats for us to gauge whether residents, Singaporean or otherwise, are truly happy with the government.</p>
