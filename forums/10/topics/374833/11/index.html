              <p>I like this sentence,and i quote them.Angel7030,what u say is that Singaporeans uncle n auntie blame the government but themselves,right?But,maybe u can send your above statement to LKY,LHL n Eunuch GCT.Coz throughout my 30+ years life,i have never heard them apologize or mend their ways when they make mistakes.</p>
              <p>When they give themselves highest ministerial pays in the world,n ppl criticise them,no apologise or blaming themselves.</p>
              <p>When they invite sooo many foreign workers into this tiny island country n compete jobs with Singaporeans,n Singaporeans started to protest,no apologise from LKY,LHL n GCT.They also never put the blame on themselves.</p>
              <p>When the Nicholl Highway bridge fall n cause death accident during GCT reign,n this is a government project.Our dear GCT,LKY,n LHL hide in their "castle",then they send their subordinates to investigate n make speeches.After the incident cooldown,then they appear to make stupid speeches.And again,no apologise,or put the blame on themselves.</p>
              <p>When GST raise from 3% to 5%,then 7%,again,no apologise was made by LKY,LHL n GCT.</p>
              <p>When electricity fees suddenly shot up not long ago n cause discontent among the public,again,no apologise or blame on themselves by LKY,LHL n GCT.</p>
              <p>So Mr. angel7030,what u want those Singaporeans uncles n aunties blame themselves for?</p>

              <p>You can try to figure out from the following sites that gave different perspectives on the government salary budget.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not by accident that Singapore has achieve the dubious record of having - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yeocheowtong.com/Salaries.html">‘the Singapore Ministers are the TOP 30 highest paid Ministers in the World. (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Does it comfort Singaporeans to know that the -  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/singapore_ministers_civil_servants_2009_pay_cut_up_to_19_on_gdp_decline_singapore_recession">Singapore Ministers and top civil servants will get a pay cut up to 19% in 2009 on GPD decline, even as they were supposed to get a pay rise in January 2009 and this has been deferred in view of the clouded economic outlook(*2) ? </a></p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans look at this with a cynical view when the Singapore Ministers must have seen the storm clouds approaching as early as 2006 ?</p>
              <p>In 2006, it was decided that the Ministers would be given a hefty pay rise of almost 30 percent payable in two parts.</p>

              <p>When both parts are combined they would have given themselves the hefty pay rise of almost 55% - despite the public outcry.</p>
              <p>Does it matter to have a pay cut of 19 percent in 2009, after receiving hefty pay increases in 2007 that amounted to almost 55 percent ?</p>

              <p>Btw, a very Singaporean question - do these sites ever get into legal entanglements?  You know how the government fights - unfairly.</p>

              <p>Dear Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>Great to know that you have enjoyed the recommended sites.</p>
              <p>Most of these sites are located outside of Singapore, and in safe havens that protect their rights to "self-expression".</p>
              <p>In fact, the "escapist" was practically inviting a law suit to be instituted in the USA, where a counter-claim can be heard in a neutral environment with the justice system being truly non-partisan to the causes from both sides.</p>
              <p>So much has been claimed as to who actually made the introduction, but it is unlikely that the party you named could be the one, as he was probably serving his NSF, or making use of his scholarship overseas.</p>
              <p>The most likely person to have been the match-maker was WKS, who had begun his career in MINDEF where the Jinx was discovered.</p>
              <p>Can anything be said about the "holy protection" given, despite the poor ministerial performance attempting to excuse himself, after the 'great escape' by a limping terrort suspect from the ISD ?</p>

              <p>People,</p>
              <p>So far 70% of people has voted 5 and under and there are some perfect 10's.</p>
              <p>I think they deserve some more points, but the decision is yours.  I just feel that despite some bad apples and arrogant ones, they have done well in many areas.  We should seperate work and "image".  Does it make sense to you?</p>
