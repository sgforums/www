              <p>Hi Atobe,</p>
              <p>Thank you, and Yes I will read the links provided by you, as always.</p>
              <p>I can share with you though, I am not insulated from the lower classes of Sinapore as I have relatives and friends, and from time to time, I hear different voices (not as detailed and articulated as yours) about various issues regarding life in Singapore.  While it could be due to my "still living outside Singapore" status that I do not feel the frustrations and anger back home, I think it could be the attitude I have adopted when facing these things.</p>
              <p>While not trying to be a motivational coach, I am convinced it is NOT what happens to us but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">what we do about it</span></strong>.  As much as I have read in this site regarding the hardships and should I say "betrayal", I hope fellow citizens can deal with it more positively, and really DO something good other than for oneself.</p>
              <p>I have plans for these causes upon my returning home, and I will stop right here as it is still premature.</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>Great to see a positive outlook in the seemingly dead end situation in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You are correct that one should not be stuck in one's predicament, but should always prepare for any eventualities by being pro-active by taking at least two or three steps ahead of the present events that are developing.</p>
              <p>There are always opportunities even in seemingly dead end situations, it is how one turn the dead-ends into positive openings for ourselves.</p>
              <p>Inspiration can be drawn from those old folks - who are either childless or abandoned by their children - and are living in rented cramped one room flat that are about 40sq ft size in an environment that resemble an HDB slum by "Singapore standard", and will reject the idea of seeking support from civic organisation.</p>
              <p>They will live on the CPF handouts of about S$260 a month from their past CPF savings, and will supplement these by daily rounds of collecting discarded cardboard cartons or boxes, aluminium drink cans, plastic bottles, and old newspapers - and selling these to a middle-man for an additional monthly income of another hundred to two hundred odd dollars.</p>

              <p> The US$100 Billion that the GIC and Temasek Holdings had lost would have gone a very long way to help the old folks underclass in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Instead, that US$100 Billion from the Singapore Surplus was used to bail out the troubled big names in the US Financial Businesses, and subsequently it was found out too late that part of the US$100 Billions were found to have been used to pay the bonuses of those executives who ignored the warning signs and led their institutions into a financial meltdown.</p>

              <p>Bravo! You chosed a negative portrayal vision that is common to ALL nations to draw inspiration for your future, as well despise the govt. Well done. Your beloved outlaw Dr Chee would be very proud of you.</p>
              <p>Let's raise our GST from 5% to 7% and increase their welfare payouts to $320 a month from $280!!</p>
              <p>No, wait, didnt your beloved outlaw took to the streets when the appeal was made, and then he made naive little boys put on tee shirts, sold by him and profits went into his pockets - to complain that the govt is sucking the people dry, and BEY TAHAN??</p>
              <p>Hang on a second there, how come those photos dont come with a date, and then no 'before' and 'after' pics of the same person? I thought many such as you complain about the state media propaganda, but hell! isnt these pics provide by your kind worse?</p>
              <p>At least the state media do provide before and after pics, as well as running commentaries and factual interviews. Where's yours? Or are we to expect your own 'words' in place of those people in the pics as representative of their plight? Your propaganda is much worse! Who is your editor? Someone from IMH? Oops..forgot..its your beloved outlaw Dr.Chee..</p>
              <p>And speaking of it, what's you and your outlaw's solultion?</p>
              <p>Er..US$100 billions for these old folks you said? Whose money is that? Yours alone? To give it away, with no returns? Bravo again!

              <p>And billions 'given' by the govt to earn dividens, yet to lose in the financial crisis? Wow?

              <p>C'mon Tubby, dont take Singaporeans as fools with your lies, half truths, twisted manipulations. You can fool some dissatisfied poor ignorant sod to get into trouble with our society's laws, but you cant fool everyone.</p>
              <p>You and Madoff are cut from the same cloth. At least he only cheat money, but your pathetic attempts are to cheat something more precious - my fellow citizens lives.</p>

              <p>Yes, and of course the brilliant LHL did not forget that help comes with strings attached <em>a la</em> PAP style.</p>
              <p>Was the T-Shirts worn with the words "BEY TAHAN" printed in protests for the acts of getting money into CSJ's pocket ?</p>

              <p>Sadly, would you be able to recognise those old folks when they were struggling through their prime ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, considering the X-rated intelligence that you are endowed with, should we hazard an argument with the ability of your X-rated character to dispute even with the "after" photos of the old folks lying in a box and made up to look their best ?</p>
              <p>You should try have a photo of yourself in a box, and have the cadaver artist dress you up, and ask if your parents can recognise your X-rated person as their son.</p>

              <p>I am surprised at your alertness shown that you have been able to acknowledge that portions of it was mine.</p>
              <p>Obviously the twisted X-rated mind could not fathom the fact that charity should begin at Home and that US$100 Billion would have benefitted those Old Folks and all of Singaporeans if it had been given to US here at home - and not to the U.S.</p>
              <p>We should compliment your stupendous joy in supporting the GIC and Temasek for giving away the US$100 Billion that had provided the bonuses for the US Executives that caused the loss to our Reserves.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that if the same US$100 Billion had not gone into a TRUST Fund for Singaporeans, it would not have paid for the insurance premiums to protect every one of the 3.5 Million Singaporeans in the proposed CPF-Life Plan ?</p>
              <p>We will surely doubt the ability of an X-rated Kid to graps that a US$100 Billion Trust Fund will be able to support a monthly cash returns of at least S$500 per month to every Singaporean above age 65.</p>

              <p>Can we trust the words of a X-rated kid who can be concerned about the lives of "my fellow citizens" - when you will dispute the existence of the abuses to the senior citizens left to pick up the pieces in their old age ?</p>
              <p>With your deliberate refusal to admit to the shameless acts of non-transparency and unaccountability by GIC and Temasek - to the loss of US$100 Billion - can your concern be genuine, or is this another one of your plagiarized acts from your limited knowledge of Shakespeare ?</p>
              <p>Would you be interested to know that the dishonesty of the PAP Government has extended to the withdrawal of almost S$4.8 Billion from our Reserves, with the approval from a crony as an Elected President - seemingly to protect our jobs in a Jobs Credit Scheme, but with the bulk of it benefitting the GLC who is the biggest employer of Singaporeans ? </p>
              <p>After annual surplus is reported at the GLC, will there be any independent audit to see if a money trail for the funds will lead back to GIC and Temasek - instead of the amount being returned to the Reserves ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, that US$100 Billion should have gone to the Reserves, as it was annual budget surplus that was transferred from the Ministry of Finance to GIC and Temasek - bypassing the authority of the Elected President as it had not been entered into the accounts of the Reserves.</p>
              <p>This was one of the contentious loophole that was raised in the debate with the late elected-President Ong Teng Cheong - when he attempted to establish the total value of the Singapore Reserves that his Second Key was supposed to protect.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated mind of a kid care less about such important issues that he can only claim the questions to be no more then insolence from another rebel - while his X-rated abilities are more interested in doubling the efforts to knock down anyone who dare to question the status quo.</p>
              <p>"tubby" ?? - that seems to be another plagiarised word from your partner who seems to have abandon you.</p>
              <p>Are you capable of any word, or phrase, or ideas that are not plagiarized ?</p>

              <p>Is this the return of the outspoken plagiarist with an X-rated mind giving the usual admiration and accolades laced with sour grapes ?</p>
              <p>While MOST nations will admit the existence of the negative side of their countries, our MILLION DOLLAR Elite Talent in Political Leadership are in self-denial.</p>
              <p>Should we give you any accolades on behalf of LKY that he will be proud of an X-rated plagiarist as a prodigy ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, a plagiarist knowing how to copy the ideas will never be able to copy the style, nor the where withall to even have any clue as to substantiate those copies made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was that not the clarion reason given by LHL that - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pap.org.sg/petir_articlepage.php?id=31&amp;amp;articleid=1528&amp;amp;cid=84">‘the raising of the GST from 5% to 7% was to help the poor and the elderly (*1) </a>?</p>
              <p>Thanks for the reminder.</p>
              <p>Yes, and of course the brilliant LHL did not forget that help comes with strings attached <em>a la</em> PAP style.</p>
              <p>Was the T-Shirts worn with the words "BEY TAHAN" printed in protests for the acts of getting money into CSJ's pocket ?</p>
              <p>It is certainly the creative minds of an X-rated intellect at its slandorous best when nothing else original clean can be expected on more serious matters.</p>
              <p>Yes, we can surely believe and trust in your slanderous X-rated fantasy in your shrill accusations made.</p>
              <p>Were you one of the little boys whom you claimed was dumb enough to have purchased the "BEY TAHAN" T-shirts for protests against CSJ ?</p>
              <p>It would have suited your plagiarist style to use someone's original ideas and use it to fit your own agenda.</p>
              <p>Did you manage to fill up the Triple-XXX fit all size T-Shirt ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is nice to know that you did take my advise to stay up at this quiet hour to be extra-productive in your X-rated activities.</p>
              <p>Obviously, I can understand that the keen sense of an X-rated mind accustomed to plagiarizing original works will have no ability to think beyond the present and will need copies of what is originally "before" and "after" in order to accept what is the "present".</p>
              <p>Sadly, would you be able to recognise those old folks when they were struggling through their prime ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, considering the X-rated intelligence that you are endowed with, should we hazard an argument with the ability of your X-rated character to dispute even with the "after" photos of the old folks lying in a box and made up to look their best ?</p>
              <p>You should try have a photo of yourself in a box, and have the cadaver artist dress you up, and ask if your parents can recognise your X-rated person as their son.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With an X-rated mind that is fed on State Media, we can understand the need for you to plagiarize the words of your great one.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, have you deluded yourself with the abiilty to deliver with the same impact as those whom you hope to emulate - wig, garment and shoe size ?</p>
              <p>Does your head fit the shoes worn by those whom you hope to plagiarize from ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How did your X-rated intellect managed to discern that part of the US$100 Billion was mine alone ?</p>
              <p>I am surprised at your alertness shown that you have been able to acknowledge that portions of it was mine.</p>
              <p>Obviously the twisted X-rated mind could not fathom the fact that charity should begin at Home and that US$100 Billion would have benefitted those Old Folks and all of Singaporeans if it had been given to US here at home - and not to the U.S.</p>
              <p>We should compliment your stupendous joy in supporting the GIC and Temasek for giving away the US$100 Billion that had provided the bonuses for the US Executives that caused the loss to our Reserves.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that if the same US$100 Billion had not gone into a TRUST Fund for Singaporeans, it would not have paid for the insurance premiums to protect every one of the 3.5 Million Singaporeans in the proposed CPF-Life Plan ?</p>
              <p>We will surely doubt the ability of an X-rated Kid to graps that a US$100 Billion Trust Fund will be able to support a monthly cash returns of at least S$500 per month to every Singaporean above age 65.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hindsight ?</p>
              <p>Yes, a kid can claim more then hindsight, especially an X-rated one.</p>
              <p>Did the X-rated kid managed to improve his reading abilities beyond kindergarten levels to note that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd129.htm">‘warnings were being screamed in the USA as early as <strong>2005</strong>(*2) </a>?</p>
              <p>Should we blame the poor kid for indulging in his pet X-rated activities to be ignorant or disinterested to the fact that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSN2962398720071029">‘Merrrill Lynch had even ignored its own subprime warnings as seen in a dated report <strong>29 Oct 2007</strong> (*3) </a>?</p>
              <p>Should we NOT blame GIC and Temasek not being more diligent in their fiduciary roles before being so gung-ho in investing our US$100 Billion dollars - when the writings were already on the Wall, and others in the same industry are aware as early as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/1822343/Sequoia-Venture-Capital-Warning-to-CEOs">‘<strong>2006 Warnings about Merrill Lynch</strong> – Sequoia Venture Capital (*4) </a>?</p>
              <p>Hindsight ?</p>
              <p>What does an X-rated mind know about hindsight except for the X-rated kind ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the X-rated plagiarist continue with his remarkable outspoken thinking that is no more then limited to the unique vocabulary of "<em>lies and half-truths and twisted manipulation</em>" - all shamelessly plagiarised from the vocabulary of the Grand OLD MAN - who is similarly shameless in his immoral approach in Politics.</p>
              <p>We should commend your ability to plagiarise the foolish words that are hollow when you cannot even plagiarise the delivery in the same forceful convincing style of the OLD Man - who has the ability to fool an unthinking X-rated mind of a young kid eager to emulate even the Old Man's fart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we trust the words of a X-rated kid who can be concerned about the lives of "my fellow citizens" - when you will dispute the existence of the abuses to the senior citizens left to pick up the pieces in their old age ?</p>
              <p>With your deliberate refusal to admit to the shameless acts of non-transparency and unaccountability by GIC and Temasek - to the loss of US$100 Billion - can your concern be genuine, or is this another one of your plagiarized acts from your limited knowledge of Shakespeare ?</p>
              <p>Would you be interested to know that the dishonesty of the PAP Government has extended to the withdrawal of almost S$4.8 Billion from our Reserves, with the approval from a crony as an Elected President - seemingly to protect our jobs in a Jobs Credit Scheme, but with the bulk of it benefitting the GLC who is the biggest employer of Singaporeans ? </p>
              <p>After annual surplus is reported at the GLC, will there be any independent audit to see if a money trail for the funds will lead back to GIC and Temasek - instead of the amount being returned to the Reserves ?</p>

              <p>I have been visiting this site for a month, and it seems I get more negative vibes that positive ones, speaking of course about the Politics - Speakers Corner.  I am just trying to fall back a bit and I wonder if we really feel that badly as a nation regarding Singapore politics, or that only people who are a bit negative about politics will visit this forum?  Or is it that politics in general &amp; naturally, will evoke such negative feelings?</p>
              <p>I mean, is the result a fair representation of the sentiments of Singaporeans?  My question is purely academic, please dun get me wrong.  Peace.</p>

              <p>Hi The Train,</p>
              <p>Thank you for approving my approach and I know I have found in you, yet another forumer (dun know if you wanna be called this) who is on my wavelength.  This is good.</p>
              <p>Noted on the possibility of having my rating dropped for the government should I live in Singapore again.  Things (nagative ones for the sake of this discussion) tend to look larger when you are close to it, it is just physics.  Yeah, I know certain certain sites will attract certain people, just like in a real world, and I have gathered for myself some conclusions about the crowd here.</p>
              <p>Regarding the MP's and Ministers, I am sure they know the importance of NOT being complacent and people power shouldn't be overlooked.  But politics is about control not about doing the right things.  As long as the people are looking for government support or changes that will grant them more power, I sincerely wish them good luck. </p>
              <p>That said, I just hope we Singaporeans would recognize that we need to be strong mentally, knowledgeable about the environment we live in, &amp; learn to be financially sound (forget the normal working class mindset).  And dun count on the government to empower us, this will never happen.  The end product will be true freedom - freedom to lead a more fulfilling life, freedom to change the political environment if willing.</p>
              <p>Dun wanna get carried away again...., just è‡ªå¼ºä¸�æ�¯ï¼ˆrelentless persuit of growth &amp; self-renewal).  There, there, I am being motivational again...shut up Lionoasis!!</p>

              <p>Hi Lionoasis</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;Regarding the MP's and Ministers, I am sure they know the importance
                  of NOT being complacent and people power shouldn't be overlooked. </p>
              <p>You would think so, wouldn’t you? Alas, if only that were true.<span>  </span>You mentioned you met some ministers some
                  years back, didn’t you?<span>  </span>Well, imagine
                  those same ministers plus 10% arrogance for each year that has passed, that
                  should be about right.<span>  </span>I must say that
                  the competent ones largely remained humble, it is always the tag-alongs who
                  grow super big egos. <span> </span>Incompetence
                  coupled with arrogance is the worst possible combination.<span>  </span>So difficult to stomach!</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;But politics is about control not about doing the right
                  things.  </p>
              <p>Ouch!<span>  </span>It pains me to hear that.<span>   </span>While my brain accepts the validity of that
                  statement, my heart persists in believing that there is a place for selfless
                  public service in politics.<span>  </span>No, I
                  believe politics should be about selfless public service and no amount of
                  rational argument is going to eradicate that.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; That said, I just hope we Singaporeans would recognize that we need
                  to be strong mentally, knowledgeable about the environment we live in, &amp;
                  learn to be financially sound (forget the normal working class mindset). 
                  And dun count on the government to empower us, this will never happen.  The
                  end product will be true freedom - freedom to lead a more fulfilling life,
                  freedom to change the political environment if willing.</p>
              <p>Yes, but you speak with the voice of the financially and intellectually
                  secure. What percentage of the population can achieve that?<span>   </span>Like you put it yourself – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">normal</span> working class mindset<span>  </span>- that is the
                  norm.<span>  </span>For most people, your standards
                  constitute an impossible ideal.</p>
              <p>The reality is that for the bulk of the population, the government and its
                  actions are very important.<span>  </span>That is why
                  govts exist in the first place, to protect the weak from the strong, the
                  powerless from the powerful and to re-distribute income.<span>  </span>But our government appears to have strayed
                  from that goal.</p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>Even for high achievers like yourself, I doubt you can
                  achieve true freedom as you hoped.<span>  </span>There cannot be true freedom without political freedom.<span>  </span>Without political freedom, financial
                  independence is but a mirage.<span>  </span>Our
                  ruling party is very good at bankrupting their political opponents.<span>  </span>You can have your freedom for so long as you
                  agree with them or leave them alone.<span>  </span>The minute you don’t, you start to see the previously invisible bars
                  around you.<span>  </span>But then again, most of my
                  friends don’t seem to care too much about that.<span>  </span>Maybe you don’t either.</span></p>

              <p><br>Hi The Train,</p>
              <p>I like your reply though I have some comments regarding what's is in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>red text</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>The Ministers I met are still in power and are amongst the top 10 Ministers in our country.  I was also given the opportunity to mingle with them in a "off-public scene" situation and got to know them in a more relaxed environment.  To me, MBT was not that appealing, Georgie was trying hard to bring himself down to our level, and LimSS was rather distant.  Can't work out the 10% increment in arrogance year on year, but I know there are some good intentions in most of the Minsiters (be it out of morality or propaganda requirment), but I believe the bigger picture could be the "culture' that exists in our government.  A culture of "total dominance at whatever cost", a culture of taking the people for granted", and a culture of no or less accountability is no problem.  What it should be, is not what we get (except the bare minimum to win elections), this is my take.</p>
              <p>Well, I was technically backrupt two times in my lifetime, except for my customers to help me out and I picked myself up again and again.  I have since then, gone through multiple up's and down's and I am putting in place, as we speak, a plan that will steer me home.  I was not born with a silver spoon and lived in HDB, took MRT, still eat in Hawker Centres (best food in town), and wonder why there are more and more ERP's, even inside Toa Payoh??!!  The point is, I had only myself to rely on, why should it be different for other Singaporeans.  Put in another way, I am not talking this way because I am above average, rather, I am above average because I think and act enough to help myself.</p>
              <p>One of the marks of the strength of a nation is the people's state of mind, for it is the people who will fuel a nation's development.  Mind not the government, mind not the econmic crisis, the <strong>MAIN FIGURE</strong> is us.  I just feel that people in general are missing the point about what really determines the outcome of their lifes.  The sad thing is, even for those to read and agree with my above statement, they will tend to resume to the old behaviour.  Again, this is their state of mind.</p>
              <p>I am not being idealistic, I am being realistic.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, it is also this "state of mind" that they have been exploited.  And if people get it, they will do something about it; else, most people gather in the dark alleys and reduce themselves to complaining and feeling sorry for each other.</p>
              <p>Yes, I do intend to leave them - the government - alone as the political climate is not condusive for opposition parties, and I am not cut out for it.  But I care enough to plan for something which will remain confidential for the time being.</p>

              <p>Hello to The Train,</p>
              <p>Your introductory pieces have detailed the general feelings of those - whom I would classify by income groups - as being in the Upper Middle Income Earners and or higher, educated, "secure" in employment, and having knowledge or some familiarity to the "Living Standards" of countries that are "better" in most ways that Singapore is "not as good at" and deliberately kept that way for obvious reasons.</p>
              <p>"Negativism" takes many forms - from the die-hard polarize "<em>negative extreme</em>", to the "<em>positive activist response</em>", to the resigned level in "<em>don't seem to care too much about</em>" anything.</p>
              <p>Each plays a push-and-pull role in a public forum attempting to change the public opinion as part of the entire political process, and it is good that the honest and robust debate exist here, when the national print and broadcast media are too "shy" to touch on the many sensitve issues involved.</p>
              <p>When arguments are based on researched information that can be further examined or disputed, those unable to protect their entrenched false positions will either have to withdraw, or face disgraceful recrimination, or subject itself to further ridicule - for whatever it is worth in an anonymouse place.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, in the rough and tumble world of politics - even in this public forum that is in an electronic format, "honesty" is conveniently thrown out of the window for the sake of some false logic that "reality is facts" - and right or wrong, fair or unfair - "facts" must be accepted, any challenge to the "facts" must be based on falsehood.</p>
              <p>Such "black" or "white" approach is hopelessly false, as any discussion on any political topic is killed as long as the "good for the larger majority" reasoning takes precedence.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, what is to be the measure of this "<em>good for the larger majority</em>" standard ?</p>
              <p>Who should formulate this standard, and how should it be implemented ?</p>
              <p>On issues that you have identified as success by the Government at "macro" levels and failures at the "micro" levels - there are differing views as to the success even at the "macro" levels when the judgment is made from the "glass and glitter" that exist.</p>
              <p>At the "micro" level the debate can be even more intense.</p>
              <p>In public forums, the sad fact is that some ordinary Singaporeans have taken on the same arrogant mental process in typical PAP style - when dealing with such "queries of concern". </p>
              <p>Some brainless entities will prefer to plagiarize the standard propaganda cliches without even a thought if they can defend the imitated positions they prefer to adopt.</p>
              <p>In reality, can we afford not to care ?</p>
              <p>How long can this indifference continue ?</p>
              <p>Who will pay the price and at what price in the future, if this generation is not willing to pay the price in this year or the next ?</p>

              <p>Though yes, his language ability is way above most of us, and therefore sometimes it feels intimidating, but let's try not to take this against him.  I am happy that my forum attracts such calibre...</p>
              <p>I did ask him for his choice of country and the answer was still Singapore, nothing negative about this.</p>
