              <p>People,</p>
              <p>What I am about to say is not to offend anyone ok?</p>
              <p>I have been visiting this site for a month, and it seems I get more negative vibes that positive ones, speaking of course about the Politics - Speakers Corner.  I am just trying to fall back a bit and I wonder if we really feel that badly as a nation regarding Singapore politics, or that only people who are a bit negative about politics will visit this forum?  Or is it that politics in general &amp; naturally, will evoke such negative feelings?</p>
              <p>I mean, is the result a fair representation of the sentiments of Singaporeans?  My question is purely academic, please dun get me wrong.  Peace.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Short Ninja,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your suggestions...</p>
              <p>I think our definition of "party" can be different.  For you could be something else, and for me to invest time here, I seek to reap other results.  When I first started my forum, my intentions were clearly stated and I meant every word that I said. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I am not here to organize a "party" to gather moaners or complainers</strong></span> (not suggesting you are), or to get any attention (I have too much of that in real life).  I am most definitely not here to please anyone or to live in an alter ego.</p>
              <p>I will understand, if you find my posts not meeting with your choice of expression or line of argument, that you choose to ignor them or do not respond.  This a web-based forum, and your actions speak the loudest.</p>
              <p>To me, a forum can only be meaningful if there are both sides of the argument.  Thank you still, for your comments.  </p>

              <p>I wasn't passing any judgement on the result, nor was I looking to achieve any rating.  I started this forum to GATHER DATA for myself as I have lived outside Singapore for a long time, and just wanted to keep abreast with developments back home.</p>
              <p>Whether the rating was 1 or 3 or 10, didn't matter.  The point I was asking, was to see whether the sample size collected in this forum was an accurate representation of Singaporean sentiments in general.</p>
              <p>Going along with this line of thought, if "sg.forums" attracts only people who are not happy, then the result will reflect a rating that will show - unhappy.  Likewise, if everybody gives a perfect 10, it is not a good sample either.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, this is just a discussion, not a judgement and there is definitely no political agenda behind it.</p>

              <p>What I am about to say is not to offend anyone ok?</p>
              <p>I have been visiting this site for a month, and it seems I get more negative vibes that positive ones, speaking of course about the Politics - Speakers Corner.  I am just trying to fall back a bit and I wonder if we really feel that badly as a nation regarding Singapore politics, or that only people who are a bit negative about politics will visit this forum?  Or is it that politics in general &amp; naturally, will evoke such negative feelings?</p>
              <p>I mean, is the result a fair representation of the sentiments of Singaporeans?  My question is purely academic, please dun get me wrong.  Peace.</p>

              <p>Hi Atobe,</p>
              <p>Thank you, and Yes I will read the links provided by you, as always.</p>
              <p>I can share with you though, I am not insulated from the lower classes of Sinapore as I have relatives and friends, and from time to time, I hear different voices (not as detailed and articulated as yours) about various issues regarding life in Singapore.  While it could be due to my "still living outside Singapore" status that I do not feel the frustrations and anger back home, I think it could be the attitude I have adopted when facing these things.</p>
              <p>While not trying to be a motivational coach, I am convinced it is NOT what happens to us but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">what we do about it</span></strong>.  As much as I have read in this site regarding the hardships and should I say "betrayal", I hope fellow citizens can deal with it more positively, and really DO something good other than for oneself.</p>
              <p>I have plans for these causes upon my returning home, and I will stop right here as it is still premature.</p>
