              Hi Angel7030,
              
              Not that happy, but overall satisfied with what is happening.  I know our government (commonly referred to as the PAP - which is wrong as it is just a party) is trying to re-model our society and redefine our economic pillars for future growth.  Nonetheless, I just feel they are not close to the ground enough, and the disturbing gap between their salary and a commoner (which explains in a small way why some people - in the government - think they are a different class), and the "need to improve" transparency eg. GIC spendings...on and on...
              
              I love my country, but does my country love me as much?
              
              7.5/10 rating is relatively higher also because I observe how other governments are doing - like the USA - and Singapore is much much better...
              
              BTW, what is the basis of the 6.66 rating?

              Hi Angel3070,
              
              Ah...I am talking to TWO angles, what are the chances of that?
              
              You are right, in a formal rating scale, we ought to define our basis clearly, like I asked angel7030 what was the basis of the 6.66 rating.  I keep the basis vague as we all seek different things, and it is meant to just measure our "feelings" towards our government, are we happy, so-so happy, hate them...and so on.
              
              It is a happiness scale, granted people define successful governments slightly differently; even the way the basis defined by international consultants can be biased and designed to obtain a certain outcome.
              
              I am not perfect, I will be the first to admit...

              <p>Frankly, my lion, who in this world is perfectly happy and satisfy with their govt?, no one. Anywhere u go, u ask peoples how their govt doing and they can have thousands of complain and comments, some even get very emotional over it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see, it is not easy being govt, you cannot please everybody, and especially those that alway have a hatre for govt no matter who took over as the govt. For them the govt is alway wrong and the citizens are alway suffering. Anything that cannot work or find failure in life, govt is sure to be blame. Ironically, they seldom blame themselves. Such blaming and flaming culture is especially so happening in most of Singapore old aunties and uncles mentality, i dun blame them, for they never are a happy lots, govt give rebates also complain, govt dun give anything also complain,..no end to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And more funny is that some can talk so bad about the govt giving them zero point but still cross PAP box in the election. Unlike lion, men are never satisfy, they only have regret and that is why the world go round, and that is also why my pub business is alway on.</p>

              Hi Angel3070,
              
              I have indeed lived in different countries in the last 10-15 years.  For listing sake, China (Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen), Hong Kong, Malaysia, Japan &amp; Vietnam.  Once upon a time I lived in Canada and USA.  What I talk about is out of my personal experience and conclusion.
              
              I really think Singapore is not doing that bad.  Look at our infrastructure, overall efficiency, econoic platform, ever improving demographic (talent pool wise), vision (re-modeling Singapore).  Not there yet, but in the right direction.
              
              Sure, we have the same problems in teens, healthcare costs, inflation, aging population, "arrogant" government (I partly agree), and so on...
              
              I like your observation and grounds covered.  Direct with charactor. :)

              My Angel70030,
              
              One day when I return to Singapore for a break, I should probably visit your pub for a long chat on this interesting and potentially emotional topic...
              
              I have lived outside Singapore for practically 1/3 my life, and yes, people from other countries think Singaporeans like to complaint, cause to them there is nothing to complaint about, they have more problems and life continues...
              
              Overall, our young country (comprising a young government and people) needs to grow up.  Just my thoughts.

              <p>Certainly, we are actually an envision state by citizens of some other countries, pples who insulted Singapore are mainly jealous of what we have achieved.

              <p>No one is deny a roof on top, no one is deny to medicate attention, and no one can go above the laws. Yes, housing maybe expensive, but govt never stop you from having a house, yes, medical can be expensive, but no hospital will stop curing you just because you cannot afford it, they cure first and talk later, unlike most other countries, no money, no talk, as simple as that..so people of Singapore are actually living in heaven, but most still think it is hell.</p>

              <p>Comments and critics are easier than just a fart, but if I ask you to be the govt, it is not going to be easy. It is just like onlooker seeing some workers digging the ground, he can comments this and that, but the workers who are digging is not easy, so what if they turn around and ask him to dig and they do the commenting.

              Hi Automator,
              
              This is meant be calm and friendly forum (at least this topic, can't speak for other topics), angel3070 can have her views, which I agree in some way.
              
              Cool man...cheers!
