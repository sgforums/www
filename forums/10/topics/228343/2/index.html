            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saddam Hussein executed by hanging: Iraqi official</strong><br>Posted: 30 December 2006 1120 hrs<br><br>BAGHDAD : Ousted dictator Saddam Hussein and two former allies were hanged Saturday as Iraq braced itself nervously for possible reprisals by his remaining supporters, officials said.<br><br>"The execution of Saddam Hussein is complete," state television said in a text headline broadcast against a background of Koranic verses.<br><br>"Saddam Hussein was hanged until death ensued. A black page in the history of Iraq has been turned," it added in a second news flash, as joyful popular music filled the airwaves.<br><br>Mariam al-Rayis, an official in the foreign ministry who attended the execution, said in an interview on state television news that the three men were hanged one after the other.<br><br>"It was between 5.30am and 6.30am," she said. "The whole thing was filmed."<br><br>Saddam and his two co-accused - his half-brother and intelligence chief Barzan Hassan al-Tikriti and revolutionary court judge Awad Ahmed al-Bandar - were convicted of crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court on November 5.<br><br>"Saddam was hanged first, then Barzan, then Bandar," Rayis said.<br><br>Over the previous months, the Iraqi High Tribunal in Baghdad heard how they oversaw a campaign of collective punishment against the Shiite village of Dujail, north of Baghdad, where Saddam escaped an assassination bid in 1982.<br><br>Dujail's orchards were torn up and 148 men and boys were executed after being dragged through Bandar's kangaroo court.<br><br>More than 20 years later, Saddam was overthrown by a US-led invasion and later put on trial by a new Shiite-led government.<br><br>The trio's death sentences were confirmed by a panel of appeal court judges on December 26.<br><br>The hangings then became inevitable, with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government determined to avenge Saddam's brutal 24-year reign and to strike a blow against a violent Sunni insurgency that still honours his name.<br><br>Saddam's Jordan-based defence team, which largely boycotted the year-long trial, made one last desperate shake of the dice by going to court in the United States to demand that the ousted despot remain in US military custody.<br><br>But US authorities in Baghdad insisted that the detainees have been under Iraqi legal authority for more than a year and were only being held in an American military base as a simple security precaution.<br><br>Saddam's trial was the subject of fierce criticism from Sunni Iraqis - who accused the court of being a puppet of Iraq's US occupiers and the Maliki government's Iranian allies - and from international rights groups.<br><br>Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International both complained that Maliki's government had pressured the judge to return guilty verdicts, and called for the accused to be brought before an international tribunal.<br><br>"Imposing the death penalty, indefensible in any case, is especially wrong after such unfair proceedings," said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's international justice programme, after the appeal failed.<br><br>But the hanging is likely to be broadly welcomed among Iraq's majority Shiite population, which held noisy street parties to celebrate Saddam's arrest in December 2003 and conviction this year.<br><br>Security officials fear a backlash, however, from hardline factions among Iraq's Sunni minority, including the Islamist and nationalist militant groups that make up the deadliest elements of Iraq's violent insurgency.<br><br>Ahead of the verdict, the head of Iraq's interior ministry command centre, Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf, told AFP that the country's beleaguered security forces were on high alert.<br><br>"Certainly, this is a big event, putting into effect the execution of this serial killer," he said. "We will take measures proportionate to this event. We will put all our forces on the streets so that no lives are jeopardised."<br><br>After Saddam's conviction in November, authorities imposed a three-day curfew across much of the country, shutting down all life in Baghdad and sealing Iraq's borders and airports in a bid to head off reprisals.<br><br>State television, the Iraqiya network, prepared the ground for Saddam's execution by showing gruesome footage of his soldiers mutilating and beating prisoners, throwing a detainee from a roof and filling mass graves.<br><br>National Security Adviser Mowaffaq al-Rubaie had told broadcasters that the hanging would be videotaped, and that footage might be released later, but officials said no journalists would be allowed to watch the hanging.<br><br><strong>Byebye Sadam... </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>byebye 2006. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know.. I feel kinda sad for Saddam.. he was just a US pawn.. he served the wrong master for many of his years and out-live his usefulness...<br><br>He wasn't a nice guy obviously.. did many bad things'n'such.. However, at those times they were done under the approving nose of the US... and since the Iran/Iraq war was sponsor by the US with Chemical waepons 'n' such..   Since the Iraq invasion and US occupation.. it has pretty much shown that he wasn't that wrong (under ME situation)and was walking a very tout string to stabalise Iraq. Many instances, the US coalition and puppets are doing the same things now.. take a look at the Iraqi Interior Ministry... death squads, kidnapped, torture by drill etc... whats the difference.<br><br>in fact, much more Iraqis had died thru the decades of sauntion, invasion and direct violence... that and the fact is that he is still the president of Iraq (Iraq did not surrender) when he was caught. Is he a POW ? If so under Geneva covention he can not be handed over to his adversory. If he is caught as  a head of state.. then why isn't he in Hague ??<br><br>Please remember prior to 1991 kuwait invasion, Iraq was secular and boast the shiny developing nation in ME. Kuwait was invaded for cross-drilling into Iraq.. diplomatic course was exhauted and the kuwait pretty much asked him to buzz-off.. and what would the US do is they were in the same shoe ?? Invasion isn't right .. I know .. but just pointing out the obvious.<br><br>600k iraqi kids died under US sanction.<br><br>Finally, where is the WMD(Nuclear) and where is the proof that Saddam was involved in 9/11 ?? Therefore the US lead invasion was a farce...and how is US going to answer to the destruction and 10X death of Iraqi ?? Hang Bush and Co.. too ??</div>
