              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>A massive outcry has erupted in cyberspace over Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s assertion that Singapore’s decision to explore the use of nuclear power on the small island state with most netizens voicing concerns over the move.</p>
              <p>PM Lee made the stunning revelation during a news conference yesterday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in Singapore for a two-day visit.</p>
              <p><strong>“We need to understand it, because I think this is something which will not go away. And even if we don’t do nuclear energy, our neighbours will do nuclear energy, and we need to understand the implications for us,”</strong> PM Lee quipped.</p>
              <p>The stunning news sparked a vigorous debate on TR</p>
              <div>garnering more than 150 comments in less than three hours.</div>
              <p>Henry Chai doubted the PAP regime’s ability to ensure the safe use of nuclear energy:</p>
              <p><strong>“come on lah, they couldn’t even keep an eye on mas selamat or manage the flood in orchard road, seriously u trust them to handle all the operations within the nuclear plant? One boomz and our country will be destroyed, where can we evacuate, P ubin and tekong? There is no second chance if there is a mishap this time round.”</strong></p>
              <p>Mark Lim concurred:</p>
              <p><strong>“There are people in nuke power and struggling to get out. And now we want to get into it? Probably that will need one big bunch of FTs to come study and another bunch of FTs to build then 1 more bunch of FTs to run the nuke power plant. Eventually, all it takes is just 1 honest mistake to get all Singaporeans to vaporize.”</strong></p>
              <p>Michael Chin thought it is another money-making venture:</p>
              <p><strong>“He’s just trying so hard to attract ‘foreign talent’ again so that it would benefit the bottom line of GIC and Temasek, isnt he? I am sure he is not going to waver and it’s just a show he’s putting up, despite the setbacks of Japan. After all, he’s going to make money either way.”</strong></p>
              <p>Besides safety issues, Singapore also has to consider how their neighbors Malaysia and Indonesia will react. Being a small island only 700 square kilometers in size, there will be no place for Singaporeans to evacuate to in the event of a nuclear accident and meltdown like what happened to the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan.</p>

              <p><br>It does not matter the market price of oil.  Whether increase or decrease in the oil/fuel price, the utilities bill keeps going up.    For all fairness, our utility bills should go down when the oil price drops but it is not the case here.</p>

              <p>Oil prices don't matter? wake up!</p>
              <p>Since the 1st and 2nd oil crisis, the world has been looking for alternative sources of energy. Now the US has 65 nuclear power plants, Uk has 19 and the Germany has 17, just to mention a few. Japan has 55 plants because they used to have to import fuel for 61% of their energy requirement. You think these people are nuts, spend millions of dollars to build power plants to create chernobyl or fukushima?</p>
              <p>Nuclear energy is still a debated issue all over the world, but many have used this for political reason. the present chancellor of germany is said to be buying votes by announcing the closure of ALL their nuclear power plants, but she hasn't come up with any alternatives source of energy, or if she is going to spend more time to suck up to those in the middle east, or send in troops into central asia to sure more supplies of oils, can wind power or hydropower replace the nuclear energy?</p>
              <p>to study doesn't meant we will have, but we don't rule out.</p>
              <p>people and the like of you are running out of idea, pick up anything on the ground and try to hammer your opponent, be careful, pick up a stone that is too heavy for your size, it will just drop and hit your legs. take care.</p>

              <p>Study of nuclear power option is a statement, not an observation.</p>
              <p>It is not built yet, so it is not a fact of life in Singapore.</p>
              <p>PAP supporter? haha, anybody who do not fight against the PAP is seen as a PAP supporter, that is pathetic.</p>
              <p>give some real argument why we should not even study nuclear power as a source of energy for this island country that lacks everything, one point in mind can be a result of a mightmare or a wet dream, don't need to say much.</p>
