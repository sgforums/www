I thought every year they claim that our economy is growing at 4% to 5%.<br><br>Hmmm....Wikipedia gave a higher GDP per capita for Singapore which is US$28,368, while Italy GDP per capita is US$29,700. Capitalistically we are there, but democratically, we are about 20 years behind. In another way, the old man does not want to relinquish his control till he's dead.<br><br>I sure hope he doesn't rise from his grave thereafter, if opposition were to win the election.
