            <div class='col-md body'>The way he is putting it, Singapore will be nothing more than a replica western city - standing up like a sore thumb in a region that is so culturally rich and vibrant compared to Singapore's  blandness. Will it be great? Hardly. That's the sad thing when you build a nation by means of suppression, discounting the people that make great cities what they are. You take away the soul and create artificiality, then that's what you are going to get - a toy city for the ruling elites to play with, then they bathed themselves in self glory over what they achieved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">As a matter of fact, Singapore has continue to grow in one area since the 90s, the ministersÂ’ salaries. ItÂ’s is worldÂ’s first and is also the highest. ThatÂ’s outrageous. If anyone were to ask LKY for comments, he will cut him down.<br><br>How does Singapore keep income tax low?<br>LetÂ’s say IÂ’ve $30K savings back in the 80s before GST was implemeted. IÂ’ve paid income tax for this $30K back then. Fast forward to the present. If I decide to spend it now, I Â‘ll have to pay 7% GST. To me tax is tax, whether itÂ’s income tax or GST.<br>IÂ’ll be paying tax twice for my $30K savings when I spend it today.<br></div></blockquote>That's was what I said in the GST thread. I think it's wholly unfair to those who were paying taxes at the higher tax bracket. The highest tax bracket in the early years were close to 40%. They decide to impose GST now, the savings of those old folks who use to save and tax at the higher tax rate, will then have to contend with the higher GST now. Gives new meaning to the expression double taxation. In countries like the UK, certain items are excluded from GST, things like basic necessities, because such goods are consumed by the poor and the rich. But it benefits the poor more, because they take up a greater percentage in the population than the rich.</div>

Days after, pictures of homeless vagrants started appearing all over the internet; some Singaporeans even took it upon themselves to seek out the forgtten minority of the people who sleep in void decks and pick up trash cans to make ends meet. Afterwards, they mockingly suggested MM Lee take a casual walk in the heartlands.<br><br>Again it was MM Lee who claimed the ruling party do not indulge in the politics of the 'gutter', yet who was the one who focused on name-calling during the Gomez incident? Which party members continued 'gutter politics' during elections 2006?<br><br>At this stage, its best he refrain from commenting on anything and let his 'young guns' take the reins, before he is labelled senile.</div>
