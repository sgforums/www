Means impact on the next generation if new host country are different in value system. Mean u must learn the life style from scratch. superficially it is easy but once you put your roots down, get your own home or whatever, u are than into the system.<br><br>So u must be willing to learn and accept the life style that is where ever u wish to go.  Having been moving back and fore i think some adaptation still require and u are not going to accept everything that your new host country gives.<br><br>2nd class citizens are people label on themselve.  Penetrating into a new country could be difficult because of legal issue,  Career be sure you take a job you already have experience in Singapore to reduce learning curve, cause you have to learn the local culture,system of work.<br><br>Communication with your family and friends are easy these days. Like i am working oversea right now talking to you.<br><br>The one thing about Being Singaporean is really Good because we are so small a population we are scattered so u don't find your kind u tend to be unique for most of the time. (For the record : I can't speak for individual who when to Australia.)<br><br>Adapting to host country. Usually initial shock and home sick would be 3 to 6  months after you settledown.  You ask yourself what the heck am i doing here!!!! Or when things don't get alone as you expected.<br><br>Once you settled down it would be 1 year later.<br><br>Remember though when you are already old and have kids. It is usually the kids that you are working for rather than yourself, your kids will intergrate far better than you and once you get involved in school you most likely to get into the system.<br><br>The question of Royalty..., but my view in this :<br><br>First you must have Your own inner family in your home than you can have a country to defend.<br><br>Not the chinese proverb you must have a Country first latter home to defend.<br><br>If you find yourself unconsiously unable to put down roots in Singapore. You decide which idea to adopt?<br><br>But Just because you live in another country does not means you totally throw away Singapore. it doesn;t work this way you will always make your connection to Singapore. Because your mind n your  psyche still bring you back to your childhood --- that is in Singapore!!!!<br><br></div>

I will state that emigrating is not for everyone and I will agree that only some of us will take that step and some will forever remain as loyal stayers of Sillypore.....then again, no one should question your loyalty if you want to quit.<br><br>Take a look around you and see what is going on in the world today, better yet if you have lived overseas to work and study, you will know what I mean and you can make a better informed choice. End of the day, whether you leave or not is your decision and yours only and let no one come and tell you that you are disloyal. Remember where all your ancestors come from. Sillypore is a land of immigrants too and so what is the big deal about emigrating. If you emigrate, some day your children will be citizens of another land and they may choose to emigrate or stay on in their land of birth to contribute, either way is good.<br><br>Anyway, look around and see where the economies of eastern europe, china, india and the US or russian is going, its getting globalized. Everyone is moving everywhere and those who tell you its bad to quit are narrow minded and so small in their outlook in life, we pity them. Best way to look at it is that its your own personal decision and they cannot influence you and neither should we influence stayers to leave.....take careful note that they proportion of people from PRC and India coming to settle in Sillypore will also grow...so what is the big deal...<br><br>In answering your questions.<br><br>Were we ever treated as 1st class citizens here in the first place. I feel more like a 3rd class citizens with FTs getting a better deal. I might as well become an FT somewhere else.<br><br>Of course its tough emigarting, leaving friends and parents behind, let no one kid you...its a tough decision and there are lots of adjustments to be made. Was it not tough on all the early immgirants to Sillypore in the early 1900s? I think our society has gotten soft, complaining about every little small damn thing instead of getting on in life.<br><br>I think if you want to do well eleswhere, you have to persevere, stand your ground and work very hard so that you will be respected. Of course a little help here and there helps and you need to be street smart.<br><br>Personally it took me about 2-3 years to adapt but oh boy once you adapt, you are really into it and gonna enjoy it. Don't forget you have to work hard too but you will enjoy all the intangibles that you would not have found in Sillypore....just read a little and find out what's going on around you and other parts of the world.......you will realize how small we are here and how we think....so narrow in scope...<br><br>Recommend that you read the book 'The world is flat' by Thomas L Friedman to see how fast the world is changing and if Sillypore is not careful, it will be overrun. Also go check out websites like webshots and pbase to see pics of how we lead lives overseas in Melbourne, Vancouver, SHanghai....beautiful man....also go read forums and discussion boards to ask around.....don't need to teach you all these man....you will know how to check it all out if you are street smart.....Now we are enjoying spring in Vancouver and we ex-Sillyporeans love it man.....<br><br>Ms me if you want to know more. I'm sure we have others here willing to contribute</div>

However, I hope I could shed some light on what it feels like to leave this place...<br><br>Seriously, worrying about your loyalty to this regime is the last thing you should have on your mind. Anyway, answer to your questions :<br>1) Let's be clear about it. You may be a 1st class citizen here, but is your lot better than those of the "foreign talents"? More importantly - and this may sound ironic, but I'm sure many of those who currently reside abroad can testify - <strong>do you still want to remain a 1st class citizen here if the treatment you get is actually worse than what you're subjected to as 2nd class citizens elsewhere</strong>? As someone I know aptly puts it, "why do you want to be the wife if the cocubine gets the better deal?"<br>2) This is an increasingly interconnected and globalised world - a phone call, video-conferencing session is just a button away. More importantly, you could always come back here to visit your family/friends regularly if you miss them. By the way, how old are you? Are you married? If you've got a family of your own, you could actually invite your parents/in-laws to move over with you.<br>3) No comments on Singaporeans specifically. In cosmopolitan cities like London and New York, you will be interacting with people from all over the globe - integrating shouldn't be a problem at all.<br>4) I didn't need much time to adapt at all.<br><br>Actually, if you have a particular city/country you'd like to go to. Why not try applying for a job in that specific city/country? You can decide if you want to emigrate there after having a stint there yourself...Hope it helps somewhat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

As someone I know aptly puts it, "why do you want to be the wife if the cocubine gets the better deal?"<br>2) This is an increasingly interconnected and globalised world - a phone call, video-conferencing session is just a button away. More importantly, you could always come back here to visit your family/friends regularly if you miss them. By the way, how old are you? Are you married? If you've got a family of your own, you could actually invite your parents/in-laws to move over with you.<br>3) No comments on Singaporeans specifically. In cosmopolitan cities like London and New York, you will be interacting with people from all over the globe - integrating shouldn't be a problem at all.<br>4) I didn't need much time to adapt at all.<br><br>Actually, if you have a particular city/country you'd like to go to. Why not try applying for a job in that specific city/country? You can decide if you want to emigrate there after having a stint there yourself...Hope it helps somewhat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> [/b]</blockquote>That's true, you know, the FTs earned much more than the poor Singaporeans, and the Singaporeans have to pay taxes, pay more GST, and do national service to protect these FTs. I don't blame the FTs, but more the govt, for the way Singaporeans are made to have low self-esteem (coz they want to make us cheap, such that more investments will come to SG, and they can pay more to themselves)<br><br>We are told from the start that we must accept lower pay, accept horrible working conditions, accept FTs earn more than us, only coz it serves the govt's needs. It is NOT TRUE. I assure all Singaporeans reading this, it is NOT TRUE, that we must live the way the govt want us to live, coz its only for their own benefit.<br><br>Am married, my wife is a FT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">, and I am looking currently at Australia, Shanghai or Canada. And yes, I have revamped my resume, and soon I am going to start sending my resumes to overseas postings.<br><br></div>

Move to a country with lower pop density, you will miss the buzzing of singapore life style. But you then to gain something else (more outdoor activities/outings, more time with immediate families, etc, etc).<br><br>2) Reports and discussions on forums may sometime over state the troubles and problems of a candidate countries. Go there yourself and take a look. Ask any friends who are there and then decided.<br><br>3) Generally for singaporeans, it is very easy for us to blend into both western and eastern societies, the adv of dual languages system. It is just luck on the types of people you meet. And also, it is in our blood to constantly move from places to places.<br><br>4) If anyone of you have the ability to migrate, go for it.

The cab driver said no, so the caretaker used his spoon as a catapult and lauched a scoop of ice cream on the driver's shirt.<br><br>By this time the cab driver was freaking, and the other guy had to choose this time to wind down the window and throw up all over the side of the cab.  Smartarse caretaker had to say, "Hey, if you're not happy about it, we'll get out here and not pay the fare".  Well, of course the cab driver stepped on it and headed right up to the cop shop, where he found the nearest uniform and started honking.<br><br>The cop came over and saw the other two guys falling over each other while I was still stone cold sober and looking really grumpy, so he pulled them aside for questioning.  I went over to the cab driver, slipped him a twenty and asked him to drop the matter, and he agreed.  Once the cops let the two jerks go, I grabbed them by the collars and dragged them back to the hostel, which was just up the street.<br><br>The next morning the caretaker came up and said, "Hey, thanks, that was really cool".
