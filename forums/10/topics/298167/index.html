            <div class='col-md body'>I'm writing this Singaporean-styled article for the good of the nation. HAHAHA!<br><br>An Australian Public Sector specialist researcher who takes interest concerning East Asia.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quote from Ross Worthington-<br>Â“all aspects of the governance of Singapore, including the judiciary, are carefully manipulated and ultimately controlled by a core executive of individuals who use their powers to maintain their own power and further their own political, economic, social and familial interests.Â”</span><br><br>How subtle. HAHAHA.<br>Wrecking your only-want-to-fun-now-but-disregard-the-future childish brain but still don't get it? I'll summarize it in a one-liner.<br><br>Face the Lee family 'dictatorship'! *scoffs*<br><br>Anyway, lemme explain why I'm most likely to be a quitter than a stayer.<br><br>Notice that from the Ministry to the Legislative Council to Temasek Holdings (to banks and media corporations), you won't find them without a Lee or Lee-related. HAHA.<br><br>Oh, vote for PAP and you Pay And Pay and then your life gets even more Pitiful And Pathetic (tougher). Lovely Singapore Government. Everything also increase, except our salaries. (Don't talk about the bonuses and private sector increment) Government ministers' salaries are the HIGHEST in the world if you don't know that. Most notably, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President SR Nathan. Go google yourself.<br><br>Hospital bills/medical costs are sky-high. My grandma tells me this: 'li aye sai si, buay sai pua bi. Bo lui tan si. Mou qin tan say' Translation: You can die but you cannot be sick. If you are poor/no money or can't afford to pay your medical bills, just wait for your death. How true. Ah, and your argument uses Medisave as a rebuttal. I say do some research.<br><br>I read elsewhere in the forums 'when will Mentor Minister Lee Kuan Yew die?' Haha. For fuck's sake, he's the richest elderly in the whole of Singapore! LOL! He can easily engaged a private jet to fly him overseas to have his balls removed!<br><br>Only the people in Hougang and Potong Pasir have the rights to be anti-PAP. Let's take it on the majority scale and all you idiots who voted for PAP are no better than greedy, hypocritical lackeys.<br><br>Look, you voted for them 'cause they dangle those enticing (monetary) carrots like shares, unit-trusts, bonus and some other redundant benefits &amp; subjunction at fools like you, you take 'em with an apparent obligation and a coupl'a months later, they take those money back through higher taxes, hikes, etc.<br><br>They cited rising cost of living to Singapore's progressive economy. True to a certain extent, but the bottomline is that those money circulating around are the people's/citizens' hard-earned cash. And the so-called investments by the Government certainly DID NOT improve the economy. Total bilharzias! What's more? Money given to other nations to (in a way) strengthen diplomatic relationships with other nations are not the backyard Government funds. Our money are on the qui vive, unfortunately.<br><br>Why will there always be people basking &amp; begging on the streets?! It's a gut-wrenching sight and when I look at those hoochie-mamas and bloody arrogant pricks, I really feel like being Robin Hood. LOL!<br><br>NSmen being paid peanuts, and Foreign Talents (FTs) or rather Foreign Todgers [with no relation to SarongPartyGirls (SPGs)] are smart, ridiculously-paid scheming asswipes. The Government is blinded, and I don't see how locals can lose out to them. If it's for exchange-pointers projects, I hugely encourage it. But the truth is, many do not wanna get Singapore Citizenship and choose to take their pot of gold back to their own countries and discover more pots of gold! URGH!<br><br>Now that the Government had realized how severe the ageing population problem (and ageism) are, they must have regretted about their 'Stop at 2' campaign. (citation needed)LOL!<br><br>Baby Boom? Rather - Baby Boom Boom! And again, almost half of the 4 million people in Singapore are foreigners. I'm still wondering, very few China girls whom I've come across are really very nice (in most/all aspects). Other than their increased bust size and contribution to the red-light district businesses which in turn decrease the number of rape cases involving the elderly (aka. Dirty Old Man [D.O.M, it's also a type of wine by the way]) and Hokkien pengs, I see no major contribution to our economy. What's more with their poor grasp of the International language - English.<br><br>Please bear in mind that if a Mainland Chinese's English is better than you Singaporean's English (of a certain standard), go fuck yourself 'cause you're a total disgrace. Why? Cause she only took 2 months to master the basics of the English language and I see SO MANY of you who speak an alien language much worse than Singlish!<br><br>I can go on writing about Singapore in a self-opinionated perspective subject to claims of satire caused by controversial issues and relentless rebuttals. But who cares?
