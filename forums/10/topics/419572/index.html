              <p>The PAP’s slogan for the last general election is ‘Staying together, 
              Moving ahead’. More than four years later, has it fulfilled its 
              electoral pledges to Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>In his New Year day message, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong 
              proclaimed to Singaporeans that the Singapore economy has grown by 14.7 
              percent last year, but have ordinary Singaporeans benefitted from the 
              stellar growth?</p>
              <p>Let us now examine and compare three key economic indices of 
              Singapore which are often ignored by PAP leaders in 2006 and 2010 based 
              on the authoritative study ‘Price and Earnings’, done by international 
              bank UBS which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.ubs.com/1/e/wealthmanagement/wealth_management_research/prices_earnings.html">here</a>.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Wage levels:</strong></p>
              <p>In 2006, Singapore has a wage index (net) of 38.9 which is higher 
              than Hong Kong (34.9). It declined to only 35.0 in 2010 while Hong Kong 
              has surpassed us at 43.9.</p>
              <p>Despite the robust growth of the Singapore economy, the real wages of
               Singaporeans after accounting for inflation have actually declined.</p>
              <p>The UBS findings commensurate with that of the Manpower Ministry 
              which showed a gradual decline in the average monthly wages of 
              Singaporeans in 2010 while median monthly wages remained stagnant at 
              $2,500, not too far off from 10 years ago.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Domestic purchasing power:</strong></p>
              <p>This is a more accurate indicator of the ‘wealth’ of citizens as it 
              also measures our disposable income. Many Singaporeans are ‘asset rich’ 
              because of their HDB flats, but are ‘cash poor’ after spending the bulk 
              of their salaries on housing loans and other living essentials, thereby 
              leaving little spare cash in their hands.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Singapore has a domestic purchasing power of 50.8 (by hourly
               income) which is less than half of Zurich (115.6). It decreased to a 
              mere 38.8 in 2010 while Zurich’ remained stable at 110.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore is purportedly a First World nation, the low 
              domestic purchasing power of Singaporeans put it along the likes of Doha
               (Qatar), Warsaw (Poland) and Bratislava (Slovakia), far below the other
               first world cities in Asia such as Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei and Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>To add insult to the injury, Malaysians living in Kuala Lumpur have 
              higher domestic purchasing power than Singaporeans in both years though 
              our diplomats had decried them as being governed by ‘incompetent’ 
              politicians!</p>
              <p><strong>3. Cost of living:</strong></p>
              <p>While the wages and domestic purchasing power of Singaporeans have 
              declined under PAP rule in the last four years, the cost of living has 
              sky-rocketed.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Singapore is ranked the 32th most expensive city in the 
              world after Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo in Asia. Its ranking shot up to 
              11th in 2010 and Singapore is now the second most expensive city in Asia
               after Tokyo.</p>
              <p>The result is hardly surprising given the annual inflation rate of 5 
              percent or more and the shocking increase in prices of resale HDB flats 
              by more than 50 percent since 2007.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>In the last four years, Singaporeans are earning less and have less 
              disposable income while the cost of living has continued to rise 
              relentlessly. Is life getting better under PAP rule? Have they managed 
              the economy well? Do the PAP ministers deserve their out of the world 
              salaries?</p>
              <p>You may ask: how is it possible to have such impressive GDP growth 
              figures and yet Singaporeans are not earning more and having higher 
              domestic purchasing power? Why do other countries have lower growth than
               Singapore and their citizens have higher wages and spending power?</p>
              <p>There is no secret to Singapore’s GDP growth. In fact, it is 
              brainless. Singapore’s GDP growth in the last few years is fueled 
              largely by the open-door immigration policies of the PAP regime which 
              has allowed a rapid influx of foreigners into Singapore within a short 
              period of time leading directly to a burst in economic activity, e.g. 
              demand for services, thereby translating directly to higher GDP figures 
              as GDP is merely a measure of the total economic output of a country.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the easy inflow of cheap foreign workers has depressed 
              the wages of Singapore workers while contributing to the higher cost of 
              living, especially housing given the small size of the island.</p>
              <p>If other First World countries adopt the PAP’s immigration policies 
              and open their doors to foreigners, they will surely have higher GDP 
              figures than Singapore! However they cannot do so because their people 
              will take to the streets and protest, but not in Singapore where the PAP
               regime enjoys absolute power and is able to do anything as it pleases 
              without fear of any political repercussions.</p>
              <p>Judging from PM Lee’s New Year day message, it is pretty obvious that
               the PAP has run out of ideas to take Singapore forward because of its 
              perennial obsession with ‘GDP’.</p>
              <p>Singapore cannot depend on cheap foreign workers indefinitely to 
              boost its GDP growth artificially. We can never compete in terms of cost
               with our neighbors and it’s only a matter of time before their cheap 
              workforce become more educated, well-trained and attractive to foreign 
              investors after which we will lose our competitive edge.</p>
              <p>We have to nurture our own local talents and develop our moribund SME
               sector so that we can become a net exporter of technology, products and
               services like South Korea which is now the 7th largest exporter in the 
              world.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation cannot be 
              taught in schools. They can only survive and thrive in an environment 
              that foster independent thinking which is severely lacking under our 
              repressive political system. When you are not even allowed to question, 
              challenge and criticize, can you be creative?</p>
              <p>Will the PAP sacrifice its own partisan interests for the greater good of the nation?</p>
              <p>One thing for sure, it has definitely fulfilled its election pledge 
              of 2006 in a way: – The PAP ministers, MPs and their top civil 
              servants have moved far ahead with their obscene wages, leaving the rest
               of us together behind to be plagued by low wages, low spending power 
              and high cost of living.</p>

              <p><br>Better than HDB flat, the tentnants there are all very warm peoples, help each other out, share foods and water,..unlike HDB flat, all concrete and wall, once go to a fren's flat, go in only all rectangle shape, make you feel like as tho you are a square block head...and the door will close shut and lock, i notice there is also very less or completely no interaction among neighbourhood, a very poor community there. To me, HDB flat are nothing but a place to sleep at nite, not for living and certainly, for enjoyment. Look out only, either opposite flat or car park or road or a plot of unnatural garden...yak!</p>
