            <div class='col-md body'>Just to evaluate how much talent our leaders really have when they keep referring to their own talents as worth millions.<br><br>When they go to the parliament to vote for their own million-dollar salaries and bonuses and life-long annuities, were they doing the right thing or did they send the wrong signals to the whole civil service resulting in all the NKF problems where CEOs began over-paying themselves with boards of directors supporting their self-rewards.<br><br>Was the NKF problem of self-promotion of CEO's own rewards created by the leaders.<br><br>It is time after the NKF for the leaders to recognize that the whole problem affecting our society where public and private companies CEOs in power are unabashly recommending to pay themselves the same way as the ministers have done. These CEOs could easily say that they are just following the public sector practice of paying the highest self-recommended rewards to retain talents (within invested commas)<br><br>Our leaders have been presenting a false picture of themselves that only scholars like themselves who score certain academic grades are talents or people who are creative or entrepreneurial or effective in running the bigger companies.<br><br>Let us look at the fact from the discoveries of many wrongful practices in NKF case whether we are experiencing the same problem throughout the whole public sector - self-promotion and self-recommendations of ministers' and senior civil servants' salaries.<br><br>For example, through years of self-promotion of public sector's so-called talents or the need to retain talents, normal teachers are nowadays being paid S$8,000.00 pm.<br><br>These teachers were not found to be exceptionally talented as experiences have found that many backward or weak students continue to be weak in their studies and were sometimes condemned with no insightful or new solutions until parents went straight to minister for education to demand explanations of wrongful teaching.<br><br>Some adjunct teachers on other hand taken in from somewhere in the private sector were found surprisingly able and more capable in turning around the weak and condemned classes with many students beginning to make advances in various learning and application processes with interesting results.<br><br>So much have been the successes of these adjunct teachers that many private or government-aided schools are engaging more adjunct teachers who can teach better than the normal teachers but who are currently paid only S$100 per day or S$2,000 + pm.<br><br>So many private or government-aided schools are now saving hundreds of thousands in salaries per month at S$5,000.00 pm per teacher and are now getting better values for their monies and are making the students and parents happier.<br><br>In the same way, many public sector services like postage, minor construction and maintenance services, licensing, car park services, glass-root and PA and Town council services do not require the true-blue talents but their incumbents were upgraded to wear fanciful CEO titles like Durai and overpaid at S$10,000.00 - S$15,000.00 pm.<br><br>Like Durai, these CEOs/GMs/Senior Managers of GLCs can be replaced by adjunct managers retrenched and waiting for employments who are willing to accept lower salaries of S$2,000.00 - S$5,000.00 without any loss of competitiveness or productivity.<br><br>In fact at lower pay of S$2,000.00-S$5,000.00 many of them still can perform better jobs than those Durai-type CEOs because of their really varied practical experiences most needed now by the economy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>January 26, 2007<br><br>Your Excellency<br>The Honourable President of the Republic of Singapore<br>Istana<br>Singapore<br>[via e-mail s_r_nathan@istana.gov.sg]<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>Re:  The Compensation for the President<br><br>I was surprised and shocked to hear that the Parliament of Singapore considered it necessary and/or appropriate to increase the annual salary for the President of the Republic of Singapore.  I appears that an annual bonus is also paid to the said President, regardless whether or not it is necessary, without consideration for the numerous needy and financially or medically or physically challenged citizens.<br><br>Any fair minded compassionate individual who cares for his or her fellow citizens would decline to accept the raise regardless whether or not Parliament approved the increase and the amount of the increase.  It is not a matter that the President should be paid a sufficiently high salary to ensure that he is not corrupt, because I have heard that you are a person with integrity and one of the most trusted and respected citizens of the Singapore.  In addition, any individual (who is retired) with a net worth of more than $2 million, if not $5 million, would humbly notify the government and the citizens that $2.6 million a year is too much, and perhaps suggest that he or she would gladly accept $365,000 a year or $1,000 a day (because almost everything is provided at the Istana), and designate the difference of approximately $2.2 million a year for fellow needy citizens.  Otherwise, I urge you to forthwith donate the said amount per year to your favourite charitable organizations, and encourage others to do the same.<br><br>With respect, I urge you to consider changing the perceived materialistic attitude amongst Singaporeans, including the extravagantly paid Ministers, very generously paid members of the judiciary and senior civil servants, who do not consider service to country and citizens before "market value based" compensation.  Please consider leaving a legacy by changing the materialistic image of Singapore and Singaporeans.<br><br>Yours respectfully,<br><br>CKL<br><br>Actually I don't just think in the general context of the pay increase of the President, or the general points.<br><br>Obviously the criticism of the pay increase is of well merit, and I confirm that its very true, and very valid.<br><br>But what I'm worried about is that, in the general context of the tax increases, which funds all these recent pay increases is that, the new revenue is not for government policies that would help people, and in some cases, new businesses, but for selfish intentions such as personal benefits for the politicians in power.<br><br>Any tax increase must have valid reasons, because its affects a damn well lot of people and their life hoods, and if it was passed because of selfish financial personal reasons of the politicians instead of the people, then the motive is extremely questionable and in severe doubt.<br><br>Besides, if the government wants to have more money for the policies for the people, its very simple: cut government spending on certain areas and use the saved amount of money to fund these initiatives. Why don't they? If other governments can do it in their own countries, why can't the PAP do the same?<br><br>Why must they keep on increasing the taxes(that affect the general population) to fund the pay increases of top ministers instead? Why can't they save the money?<br><br>And why can't they think in terms of people policies, instead of just of their selfish personal financial reasons? I'm unhappy because the amount they raise could have helped more people(or in any case, any non-movement or even a tax decrease too), instead of just funding selfish reasons.<br><br>That's why, in the context of the people, and their sufferings, this pay increase, and this GST increase are fundamentally unjustified and very, very questionable. And that's why I strongly disagree with the tax increases, and the wage increases for top tier civil servants and the government ministers in general.<br><br></div>
