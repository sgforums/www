            <div class='col-md body'>LTA's age limit hike to benefit 293 drivers this year<br><br>By JENNANI DURAI<br><br>TAXI drivers in Singapore will now be allowed to work until the age of 73 - provided they are deemed fit enough.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced yesterday that it was raising the age limit for taxi drivers from 70 years to 73 years. This will take effect from July 1, and is aimed at allowing older drivers who are still fit and healthy to continue working.<br><br>LTA said that it had increasingly received feedback from taxi drivers that they wanted to continue working beyond 70, and attributed this to the general improvement in the health of Singapore's population over the years.<br><br>As at May 2006, there were 84,746 taxi drivers. The change is expected to affect 293 of these drivers who are currently 69 years old.<br><br>In order to qualify for this extension, taxi drivers will be required to undergo a Therapy Assessment for Elderly Taxi Drivers.<br><br>This fitness assessment is in addition to a modified annual medical examination, which is based on the medical examination that all drivers above 65 are already required to undergo.<br><br>Drivers that pass both tests and are certified fit will have their vocational licences renewed for three years.<br><br>The Therapy Assessment, offered by the Occupational Therapy Clinic of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, consists of two components: an off-road test to assess cognitive abilities and reaction times, and an on-road test to assess the cabby's ability to drive safely.<br><br>The ComfortDelGro group, which has around 32,000 taxi drivers, welcomed the change.<br><br>Tammy Tan, group corporate communications officer for ComfortDelGro, said that the group had noted that older cabbies provided reliable service and knew the 'ins-and-outs' of Singapore roads, a skill valued by commuters.<br><br>ComfortDelGro expects over 130 of its cabbies to be able to choose not to retire on turning 70 this year.<br><br>One of them is Teo Chye Teong, who came under the ComfortDelGro umbrella in 1997. The clearly happy CityCab driver told BT that most of the other older drivers were similarly pleased. He said: 'It not only generates more income for us, but it also keeps us alert.'<br><br></div>

But what about those who have held managerial positions or even higher posts and have to drive a cab in their old age? The only vacancies I see for older people are clearing tables in foodcourts, order taking in fastfood outlets, and road-sweeping jobs. I mean, lets leave "choosiness" out of the picture, and lets talk about "sense of belonging", &amp; "meaning of life" as a Singaporean.<br><br>I just feel that our government has neglected older Singaporeans.

            <div class='col-md body'>Shutterbug: We mustn't confuse upping the age limit of taxi drivers to the overall unemployement of the elderly. This is a localised issue probably made public because of the large numbers of elderly who wanted to continue driving and earning a living through being a cabby. That doesn't inply that being a cabby is the only outlet for a job in your twilight years.<br><br>There are other opportunities for old people past their prime. Granted cleaning tables or serving customers at run-of-the-mill food outlets may be unglamouress; nevertheless, it's a job. It may not pay well, but it's a job. Take out choosiness in job-hunting, it's still a job.<br><br>Oh, just for everyone's interest, the 100-year-old lady who renewed her license is a 7th day adventist californian featured in National Geographic. They were doing a study on a select group of people: Okinawa locals, countryside Sardinians and 7th day Adventists in the sunshine state.<br><br></div>
