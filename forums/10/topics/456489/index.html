              </div>
              <p>In a Cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday, the Government 
              announced the restructuring of two ministries -- the Ministry of 
              Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and the 
              Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA).<br><br>Three new ministries will be formed -- the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSFD), the Ministry of 
              Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), and the Ministry of Communications 
              and Information (MCI). They will take effect from 1 November.<br><br>Tharman
               Shanmugaratnam will relinquish his appointment as Minister for 
              Manpower. He will remain Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
              and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Tan Chuan-Jin will become the new Acting Minister for Ministry
              of Manpower and Senior Minister of State for National Development.<br><br>Read the Prime Minister's press statement:<br><br>Singapore
               is in a new phase of development. Social and community issues are 
              increasingly important in our shared home. First, we need to strengthen 
              our families and enhance our social safety nets to help those in need. 
              Second, we must foster the arts and sports, and build social capital 
              through volunteerism, while engaging our youth to shape our future 
              together. Third, we have to improve public communications and 
              engagement, so as to reach out more effectively to our increasingly 
              diverse society in the age of social media and rapid technological 
              progress.<br><br>The above priorities are currently overseen by MCYS and
               MICA. To focus more sharply on these increasingly important areas of 
              work, and to improve synergies across related issues, the current 
              portfolios of MCYS and MICA will be re-distributed to three ministries:<br><br>a)
               A new ministry - the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) - 
              will be established to focus on building a cohesive and vibrant society,
               and deepening the sense of identity and belonging to the nation. It 
              will assume MCYS' current roles in strengthening community bonds, 
              promoting volunteerism and philanthropy, engaging youth, and developing 
              the sports. It will also assume MICA's arts, heritage and national 
              resilience functions;<br><br>b) MCYS will be renamed the Ministry of 
              Social and Family Development (MSF). It will focus on building strong 
              families, developing our social services and looking after those in need
               of social support. There is synergy between these portfolios as the 
              family unit is, and should rightfully remain, the fundamental building 
              block of our society; and<br><br>c) MICA will be renamed the Ministry of
               Communications and Information (MCI). It will oversee the development 
              of the infocomm technology, media and design sectors; the national and 
              public libraries; as well as Government's information and public 
              communications policies. REACH will be transferred from the current MCYS
               to MCI. The reorganisation will enable the Government to focus more 
              sharply on communication and information.<br><br>The above changes will take effect on 1 Nov 2012.</p>

              Thursday welcomed new appointees to the two ministries under his care.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said Ms Indranee Rajah, who has been appointed Senior 
              Minister of State for Law, brings with her a wealth of experience and 
              described her as a great addition to the ministry.<br><br>Ms Indranee 
              has been a Member of Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC since 2001 and is a
               top lawyer and Senior Counsel in private practice at Drew &amp; Napier.<br><br>She will assume her post in November.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam also thanked his outgoing Senior Parliamentary Secretary for 
              Law Sim Ann for her contributions in championing community mediation, 
              intellectual property outreach efforts and geo-spatial initiatives.<br><br>He
               said she was also instrumental in moving substantive amendments to the 
              Moneylenders Act, which saw a tightened licensed moneylending regime to 
              better safeguard the interests of borrowers; and more recently, for the 
              Patents Act, which would better position Singapore in its development to
               be Asia's IP hub.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam also welcomed the appointment of Ms Grace Fu as the Second Minister for Foreign Affairs.<br><br>Speaking to the media at a reception for ASEAN Day on Thursday, Mr Shanmugam called Ms Fu "a tremendous asset".<br><br>"She's
               effectively bi-cultural and would be very helpful in many areas and 
              also we're discussing with her, I've started speaking with her on how we
               can share responsibilities."<br><br>In a statement issued to the media 
              later on Thursday, he said Ms Fu's new post would be extremely helpful 
              "at a time of increased responsibilities and workload" at MFA.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam added that Ms Fu will help in managing Singapore's external 
              relations in an "increasingly fluid and challenging regional and global 
              environment".<br><br>Ms Fu's appointment came into effect on August 1.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam also paid tribute to Mr Lui Tuck Yew, who relinquished his post as Second Minister for Foreign Affairs.<br><br>He said Mr Lui, who is also the current Minister for Transport, gave MFA tremendous support despite his heavy portfolio.<br><br>He added that Mr Lui contributed to policy planning with his sound judgment and clear analysis.<br><br>- CNA/ac/wm</span> </span></p>
