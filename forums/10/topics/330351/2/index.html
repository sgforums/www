              <p>You need to revert to my previous quote to understand the reason for making a distinction between democracy and government.</p>
              <p>You still FAILED to correctly identify and highlight the "issues" you mentioned in your post. It's not even a popular dissent as you have mentioned, only a few "rebels" here in sgforums and all their clones are not sufficient to pass off as "popular dissent".</p>
              <p>And what makes you think there are purer examples overseas? Again this is another vague comments of yours without any names of any countries overseas to back up your claim. If you are unable to back up your claims with any purer examples, you are just arguing for the sake of doing so. </p>
              <p>Is this another one of your arguing for the sake of doing it?</p>
              <p>One more mistake that you've made, governmental values are based on democratic values. If not, convince us the difference between your governmental values and democratic values. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>By the way, I won't be surprised if you launch another personal attack because you are unable to prove your point. I rather take that than have people like you to confuse others with your headless argument. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>You should have quoted and replied to the TS's post if you want to argue about your elusive "main argument". I'm not TS, and by quoting my post does not provide you with any arguments, cos my post were not meant for you in the first place.

              <p>And the governmental values in the argument were referring to Singapore governmental values, so don't try to change topic and bring out communism which is totally irrevelant in here.</p>

              <p>Well, i guess the question i would post is that will it ever be enough, given human nature? I don't mean it as a sarcastic comment or personal attack but humans always have a bad habit of wanting more once they get something.</p>
              <p> The PAP has always have a reputation of being authoritarian and i see it as a major concession already. I rather see it being done in slow, cautious steps than let it blow up in a major uprising, in the likes of Thailand, Philipines and Indonesia.</p>
              <p> I agree with parn, Democracy is an ideal much like a Theocracy and Communism. It has its flaws just like any system. The current PAP government is more of a democractic/socialism mixture where the society is prized more over the individual.</p>
              <p>Your vote is there, vote for the opposition if you feel that they are capable enough but don't do it simply out of spite. That is irresponsible and you mess up the future generation because of it.</p>
              <p>To stick with the topic, Elitists will exist in all forms of society and systems. Some people will always be more "equal".</p>
              <p>The only thing we can do is to make sure it doesn't get out of hand, to prevent them from abusing the less privileged. We can't exactly get them to shut up, then we deprived them of the right to free speech as well no?  </p>

              <p>Wow, all this over the same word with a small caps p or a capital P. the last i checked all forms of spell check identify them to be the same word with the same meaning. A challenge to the educated, find another word to use. Or at least try to awaken the masses without offending them.</p>
              <p>Art is up to the interpretation of the viewer, Debating for a cause is not art. Good luck convincing everyone that there is a difference in meaning between Peasant and peasant.</p>
              <p>Also, people live their own daily lives filled with various complexities, trials and tribulations. Though i find the sight of many current media icons revoulting, far be it for me to decide who the masses should or should not give their attention to. (this doesn't mean i can't criticize the heck outta said media icons... xp)</p>
              <p>While i may have a false elitist notion from judging on high the calibur of people by their interests and attention, that is not to say that i am in any way correct in by elitist opinions.</p>
              <p>That said, this innitial post is kinda elitist. Sure there are smart people in colleges and bookstores but don't be fooled to think that there aren't any smart peasants.</p>

              <p>genie... you seem really fired up on this topic. i assume you felt personal conviction pertaining to this issue?</p>
              <p>in any case, i agree with your views. peasant mentality is an illness. However, so is elitism i guess. i suppose we can all be balanced in our world view. think beyond the box with humility and don't self defeat?</p>
