              <p> </p>
              <p>Alright everybody. Education time. I have been accused of being rude and offensive by calling people peasants. I would like to clarify the difference between a peasant and a Peasant in this post.<br><br>A peasant to me is a member of the mass of people in any society that are the average joes or janes that form the main working community of that society. There are no classless societies; even in communist societies of yesteryear, some were more equal to others. It is my opinion that all societies are still feudal to one extent or another.<br><br>In Singapore, we live the lie that there are no classes. Wake up, smell the roses - it is actually lalang grass. It is a myth propagated by the ruling class to subjugate the masses. The HDB dwellers to me, are the peasants of Singapore. Many have no interest in their lives except to keep the roof over their heads, get a mode of transport, and look after their young. That the roof is now an HDB flat rather than a mud hut doesn't make a difference. That the mode of transport is now a Nissan Sunny rather than a water buffalo also doesnt change anything. The life of the HDB peasant isn't SUBSTANTIALLY SPEAKING, any different from the peasant in feudal china. As long as the powers-that-be keep the economy rolling, the country safe, the sun shall shine, hay shall be made and oxen shall grow fat. They do not care for disorder, nor will they rise up in revolt as long as this status quo is maintained. They will do as they told as long as there are goods to be sold. Freedom of speech, democracy, human rights, and all that jazz are for the bourgeoisie and the petit bourgeoisie, or the intelligentsia, or the chattering champagne socialists. The peasants don't care, nor do they want to care.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with being a peasant. Many peasants work hard and do well. They get a bigger mud hut, maybe upgrade to an attap hut, get a bigger water buffalo albeit with a 10 year loan. Some do even better and their children become bourgeoisie or intelligentsia. Some even become faux aristocrats - their children become bona fide ones.<br><br>But there is a problem with being a Peasant. I hate Peasants.<br><br>Peasants have a certain mentality. They think in herds. They follow tabloid news. They worship celebs and call them idols. They believe everything they read and go all ape-shit. They spend hours scouring the internet for proof that a certain individual they do not know, nor is a threat to national security, lied. They hate with a vengeance people they do not know. They love with a passion the same people. They make personal attacks on people on their blogs. Most of all they do not think.<br><br>Peasanthood is a state of being - you can emancipate yourself through a hard work, education and a dash of luck.<br><br>PEASANTHOOD is a state of mind. It is an illness. Most of the time, it is terminal.</p>

              <p>I love my peasants, they are like children.</p>
              <p>A society is pretty much like a huge family.</p>
              <p>The government plays the role of parents in a society (cos they are unreachable for you at the moment),</p>
              <p>your bosses/anyone that is highest than you at your work/study environment (cos you can reach/overtake them eventually) at work plays the role of a husband in a society,</p>
              <p>your colleagues/friends (your peers/rivals/anyone at your level) plays the role of your cousins in the society,</p>
              <p>those strangers or people that are below you plays the role of the children in the society.</p>
              <p>Like in a family, I can love my husband, but I'll love my children more. And I of course respect my parents. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>My opinion differs from yours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education gives you a fighting chance to be an elite but in no way is it an easy road nonetheless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a very reliable source that makes quite abit of money *peasant* terms with properties alone cause Singapore is a good place to invest for the rich.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They would rather invest in Singapore than in Australia because every investment property requires you to pay stamp duty 20-50k AUD (each time you buy a property u pay stamp duty). Also your income for the year scales with your tax rate as the more rental income you gain the higher your tax rate. Of course you can go negative gearing to help reduce that but you still have the stamp duty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore I don't think you have that stamp duty and if so it pales in comparison. My source is going rampant with District 9,10,11,12 properties and with lucky enbloc sales they make even more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>End of the day I think the wage gap in Singapore is going to widen and it'll breed more "elitist princesses".</p>

              <p>The 1% raffles "royalty", next 9% of top school "aristocracy/nobility", next 20% of average "lower gentry", 50% of neighbourhood school "peasants", last 20% of the "hopeless cases".</p>

              <p>You still FAILED to correctly identify and highlight the "issues" you mentioned in your post. It's not even a popular dissent as you have mentioned, only a few "rebels" here in sgforums and all their clones are not sufficient to pass off as "popular dissent".</p>
              <p>And what makes you think there are purer examples overseas? Again this is another vague comments of yours without any names of any countries overseas to back up your claim. If you are unable to back up your claims with any purer examples, you are just arguing for the sake of doing so. </p>
              <p>Is this another one of your arguing for the sake of doing it?</p>
              <p>One more mistake that you've made, governmental values are based on democratic values. If not, convince us the difference between your governmental values and democratic values. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>By the way, I won't be surprised if you launch another personal attack because you are unable to prove your point.

              <p> </p>
              <p>They would rather invest in Singapore than in Australia because every investment property requires you to pay stamp duty 20-50k AUD (each time you buy a property u pay stamp duty). Also your income for the year scales with your tax rate as the more rental income you gain the higher your tax rate. Of course you can go negative gearing to help reduce that but you still have the stamp duty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore I don't think you have that stamp duty and if so it pales in comparison. My source is going rampant with District 9,10,11,12 properties and with lucky enbloc sales they make even more.</p>

However, unlike in many Western countries, this is happening without the safety net of a welfare state.
