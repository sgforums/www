              <p>Singapore single penalized by HDB housing policies</p>
              <p>A36 year old Singaporean single lady by the name of Toh Siew Peng has written a letter to the Straits Times Forum today to complain about HDB’s discriminatory policies against singles.</p>
              <p>Only married Singapore couples are permitted to buy new HDB flats and qualified for the housing loan and grant.</p>
              <p>Singles will have to wait till they are above 35 years of age to buy a resale flat. However, PRs are not subjected to the same restriction.</p>
              <p>Miss Toh claimed in her letter that she wrote to HDB five years ago to ask if she could buy a flat at age of 30 which was allowed, but she did not proceed with the purchase because of the “unattractive conditions” as she did not qualify for the HDB housing loan and grant.</p>
              <p>Now at 36 years of age, she wanted to buy a flat under the singles scheme, but was rejected as her income exceeds $3,000.</p>
              <p>She took issue with the fact that HDB “took the same circumstances into consideration” in allowing her to buy a flat five years ago, but not now.</p>
              <p><em>“HDB staff advised me to get a bank loan, but I cannot fork out the huge amount of cash upfront. The bank will loan me an amount equivalent to only two times my monthly salary.</em></p>
              <p><em>I feel that the HDB should increase the income ceiling. Five to 10 years ago, a three- or four-room HDB resale flat was priced from $150,000 to $250,000, but now the price has increased to $280,000 to $350,000. In addition, there is the $20,000 to $40,000 cash upfront, “</em> she added.</p>
              <p>The prices of HDB flats, especially that of resale flats have sky-rocketed in recent years due to limited supply of new flats and rising demand fueled by immigration.</p>
              <p>Only about 3,100 new flats were built in the year 2008 when there were more than 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens in the same year alone.</p>
              <p>Singapore singles have no choice but to compete with PRs in the resale market as they do not qualified to purchase new flats which are to “encourage” Singaporeans to marry and start a family.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s octogenarian leader Lee Kuan Yew admitted lately that property prices have increased as a result of PRs and foreigners:</p>
              <p><em>“We’ve grown in the last five years by just importing labour. Now, the people feel uncomfortable, there are too many foreigners. Trains are overcrowded with foreigners, buses too, property prices have gone up because foreigners with permanent residence are buying into the market.” </em></p>
              <p><strong>[Straits Times, 28 January 2010]</strong></p>
              <p>An Indonesian PR “spoiled” the market lately by paying a record $653,000 for a 4-room resale flat in Queenstown when he could well afford a private condominium.</p>
              <p>Prices continued to increase by 8.2 per cent in 2009 when Singapore is mired in a recession and median Cash-Over-Valuation (COVs) have doubled from $12,000 to $24,000 in one quarter alone.</p>
              <p>Though National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said he was “caught off guard” by the rising prices, he is adamant that HDB flats are “affordable” to ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>To Singaporean singles like Miss Toh, they will either have to get married to buy a cheaper BTO flat or wait till their parents pass away to inherit a roof over their heads.</p>

              <p>What's your view?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are in Miss Toh shoe, what would you do.</p>

              <p>She does have a point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean singles by law cannot buy a resale flat until they are aged 35 while a single PR can if she applies with her sibling/parent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somebody in another forum gave the example of a Singaporean male who has served NS, done his reservist duties every year, pays his taxes every year but is not allowed to buy a resale flat because he is not 35 yet. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They may need to relook this policy to even the advantages the PR has over Singaporeans in this case.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
