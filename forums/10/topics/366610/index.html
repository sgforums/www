              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>SAN FRANCISCO, July 15 — On the Internet nobody knows you’re a dog — or the chief executive of a Fortune 500 company.</p>
              <div id="articleInline">

              <p><a name="secondParagraph"></a></p>
              <p>Or so thought <a title="More articles about John P. Mackey." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_p_mackey/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">John Mackey</span></span></a>, the chief executive of <a title="More information about Whole Foods Market Inc." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/whole_foods_market_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Whole Foods Market</span></span></a>, who used a fictional identity on the <a title="More information about Yahoo! Inc." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/yahoo_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Yahoo</span></span></a> message boards for nearly eight years to assail competition and promote his supermarket chain’s stock, according to documents released last week by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mackey used the online handle “Rahodeb” (an anagram of his wife’s name, Deborah). In one Internet posting sure to enter the annals of chief-executive vanity, Mr. Mackey wrote as Rahodeb, “I like Mackey’s haircut. I think he looks cute!”</p>
              <p>With all a chief executive has to do, the 14-hour days spent barking orders, digesting reports, motivating employees and courting Wall Street, why would they spend their time sparring with anonymous critics online? And what makes them think they won’t be revealed?</p>
              <p>Certainly ego is involved. Chief executives are used to having their own way around the office, where criticism is usually tempered. Successful executives like Mr. Mackey, whose company’s share price has risen fourfold since 2000, are apparently seduced by the Internet’s promise of anonymity and the temptation of joining heated rhetorical battles about the issues closest to their hearts — even when the law requires them to stay on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>“We have the most protected, covered, cautious and public relations-barricaded generation of leaders in history,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor of corporate governance at Yale. Today’s tightly controlled, artfully packaged executives, he said, “want to release and spout off, and they somehow think this is a forum where they’ll be held less accountable.”</p>
              <p>But in many cases, that promise of anonymity is an illusion. Recently caught promoting themselves or their causes have been a handful of chief executives and political operatives, a critic for a major magazine, as well as dozens of lesser-known bloggers, authors and entrepreneurs who sneak changes onto their own entries on <a title="More articles about Wikipedia." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/wikipedia/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Wikipedia</span></span></a> or the reviews of their books on <a href="http://amazon.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Amazon.com</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>This digital-age deception has a name, “sock-puppeting,” and a precise definition — the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p>For executives like Mr. Mackey, sock-puppeting is probably more gratifying than effective in swaying opinion or stock prices — until they get caught. Then it is embarrassing, and for chief executives, at least, potentially illegal. Laws carefully prescribe what executives of public companies can say. The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Friday night that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun a formal inquiry into whether Mr. Mackey violated security laws with the posts.</p>
              <p>Whole Foods maintains that Mr. Mackey did not break the law because he did not disclose any confidential company information.</p>
              <p>But the consequences could be damaging to the company, if not to Mr. Mackey. Securities lawyers say the Federal Trade Commission might use the comments to scuttle Whole Foods’ proposed acquisition of a competitor, Wild Oats, a company Mr. Mackey derided in his posts. Wild Oats may also use the comments as the basis of a lawsuit against Whole Foods.</p>
              <p>Other chief executives have found their sock puppetry coming back to haunt them. At the criminal fraud trial of <a title="Hollinger International" href="http://www.nytimes.com/mem/MWredirect.html?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&amp;symb=HLGAF"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Hollinger International</span></span></a>’s chief executive, <a title="More articles about Conrad M. Black." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/conrad_m_black/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Conrad M. Black</span></span></a>, prosecutors introduced evidence that the former press baron had once proposed joining a Yahoo Finance chat room to blame short sellers for his company’s stock performance.</p>
              <p>When his chief of investor relations declined to post the message because of securities rules, Mr. Black wrote in an e-mail message, “don’t be so strait-laced ... Get our story out.” Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Black then posted the message himself, using the name “nspector.”</p>
              <p>Mr. Black was found guilty Friday of mail fraud and obstruction of justice, and he faces a maximum of 35 years in prison.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mackey and Mr. Black are only the latest examples of high-profile figures who tried to exploit the anonymity of the Internet to promote their companies and combat enemies under false pretenses.</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in
              speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people
              the impression that there are others out there that would agree
              with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a
              false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of
              support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being
              hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in
              which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned.
              Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen
              responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never
              posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread
              called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify
              gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and
              phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by
              this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually
              indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we
              can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting
              of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their
              context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos
              and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY
              make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence
              lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20
              minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace.
              Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But
              after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to
              makepeace</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he
              pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote
              himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really
              hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying
              back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny,
              frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from
              the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked.
              Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what
              really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was
              caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>Wikipedia also makes this important point:</p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>It goes on to list examples of noted individuals who have been caught sockpuppeting over the years. Is that list about to lengthen? On Friday I returned from a few days away to discover the Tory Troll claiming to have denuded another significant sockpuppeter. The naked hand, said the Troll, belongs to none other than Andrew Gilligan, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3446391.stm"><span style="color: #005689;">formerly</span></a> of the BBC and more recently, of course, the chief political attack hack of Veronica Wadley's Evening Standard.</p>
              <p>The Troll's delicate nose first wrinkled when he read the second paragraph of Gilligan's <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23578147-details/Ignore%20the%20bleatings%20of%20the%20bendy%20bus%20brigade/article.do?expand=true#StartComments"><span style="color: #005689;">recent salvo</span></a> against critics of bendy bus-haters.</p>

You wonder what's next a support group for double-glazing salesmen? A bid to rehabilitate that misunderstood feminist icon, demonised by the Right-wing media, Rose West?</p>

              <p>Where had the Troll read something like that before? Well, there was an <a href="http://torytroll.blogspot.com/2008/10/next-generation-routemaster-designs-are.html?showComment=1223003460000#c1189685663456392638"><span style="color: #005689;">anonymous comment</span></a> posted at his blog on the 3rd October:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>There's a certain mad nobility in this blog's obsessive support for the most unpopular vehicles in London. What's next - a campaign to rehabilitate Rose West?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And then there was this:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"There's a certain mad, self-destructive nobility in the Ken Left's dogged defence of some of the most disliked things in London - Sir Ian Blair, bendy buses."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That was posted <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/kennite/comments?commentpage=1"><span style="color: #005689;">here</span></a>, three days later, under the name "kennite".</p>
              <p>Now, kennite is a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/kennite/comments?commentpage=1"><span style="color: #005689;">pseudonym</span></a> familiar to me as it will be to readers of this blog and of articles by me and others about the London mayoralty on other Guardian sites. It's always been obvious he was a dedicated Boris supporter and backer of the Evening Standard's anti-Livingstone line on bendys and other matters. I'd thought he might be a member of Johnson's campaign team. Certainly, his interventions were rather predictable so I'd stopped paying him much attention. It had never crossed my mind that he could be Andrew Gilligan in disguise. After all, Gilligan had commented at Guardian sites <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/andrewgilligan"><span style="color: #005689;">under his own name</span></a>, so why would he hide behind a false one?</p>
              <p>That's a curiosity, but even if kennite is indeed Gilligan it's not necessarily a sin. Commenters use pseudonyms for a variety of reasons, good ones included, and I know that other players in London mayoral politics comment under pseudonyms here. However, sockpuppeting takes pseudonymity into more controversial territory. It is a pretence of a different order, one designed to create a false impression of support for an individual and their position on an issue. It involves praising yourself while pretending you are someone else. If Gilligan is kennite, then he has clearly engaged in this activity. The Tory Troll found this example of kennite's work from a thread under a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/jun/30/kenlivingstonesrefusaltofa"><span style="color: #005689;">piece I wrote</span></a> about Livingstone's LBC radio programme.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"Dave Hill's famously unbiased reporting has unfortunately omitted to mention the several callers who suggested that Ken was "bitter," that he should stop "slagging off Boris Johnson" and that his mayoralty had "lost its way." As for Ken's claim that Gilligan is obsessed with him, I counted about fifteen mentions of Gilligan. Who, exactly, is the obsessive one here?"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Also, this, responding to a piece by Polly Toynbee <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jul/17/comment.pressandpublishing?commentid=bd8834fc-0ccc-4435-a2c0-e29f64b7f1d5"><span style="color: #005689;">attacking</span></a> Johnson last July.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Polly's absurd description of Boris Johnson as a "sociopath" betrays, I think, her real panic about his excellent chance of sweeping away Ken. Nor will it do to write off everyone who opposes Ken or New Labour as, by definition, a Daily Mail reactionary. If Polly had ever read any of Gilligan's columns, she would see someone writing from a broadly left-wing, if anti-New Labour, perspective.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What attitude should be taken to sockpuppeting? At one level it is just a prank, albeit one that can make perpetrators look egotistical and silly when they're exposed. It's hardly a crime. But some employers in the media have taken a dim view of their writers indulging in it. In September 2006, The New Republic <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/04/technology/04republic.html?ex=1315022400&amp;en=cc629c6ec5d5805d&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss"><span style="color: #005689;">suspended</span></a> one of its editors Lee Seigel after he was found to have sockpuppeted on his own TNR blog. In April of the same year the LA Times suspended the blog of financial reporter Michael A Hiltzik after he admitted sockpuppeting both at his own blog and <a href="http://patterico.com/2006/04/20/three-in-one-michael-hiltzik-mikekoshi-and-nofanofcablecos/"><span style="color: #005689;">at others</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Will Veronica Wadley be annoyed if she becomes satisfied that Gilligan has been sockpuppeting at the Guardian and elsewhere? Is it a pastime the editor of "London's Quality Newspaper" is happy for her journalists to engage in? I have no idea, but there appear to be grounds for her to take an interest in the matter. Gilligan commented at the Tory Troll's second post on the issue, but didn't take the opportunity to deny being "kennite." I have received no reply to the emails I sent him yesterday evening and this morning inviting him to do so. Neither has Gilligan responded to challenges about sockpuppeting placed under his "<a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23578147-details/Ignore%20the%20bleatings%20of%20the%20bendy%20bus%20brigade/article.do?expand=true#StartComments"><span style="color: #005689;">mad nobility</span></a>" piece by Tom of <a href="http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/"><span style="color: #005689;">Boris Watch</span></a> and Time Out's Peter Watts, who has been <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/big-smoke/blog/6088/Bendy_boys_and_Route_martyrs.html"><span style="color: #005689;">following developments</span></a> too.</p>
              <p>This blog is eager to provide a platform for a variety of guest posters. Should Andrew Gilligan wish to enlighten me about any connection he has with kennite and the reasons for it should one exist, I will be more than happy to publish his words here - under his real name, and everything.</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Internet"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>

              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>

              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>
