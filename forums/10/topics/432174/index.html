              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Nathan: The work I have done as President is immeasurable <br><br></strong><span class="goog_qs-tidbit-0">PORT LOUIS (Mauritius) - After 12 years in office as the Republic's second Elected President, Mr S R Nathan - who has yet to decide whether to run for a third term</span> - indicated yesterday that he had many thoughts on the role and how he has performed it, including the highlights and challenges of his tenure and criticism that he had been "doing nothing". <br><br>But Mr Nathan, 87, who was speaking to the Singapore media at the end of a state visit to Mauritius, would not elaborate despite repeated requests from journalists - at least not now, not when the country is poised for its most hotly-contested Presidential Election to date. <br><br>Mr Nathan said all will be revealed in his memoirs, which are expected to be published in September. "When that book is published, you will know that, although I've been quiet, I've been doing work." <br><br>Mr Nathan said his age was a factor he would consider when deciding whether he would contest the election. He added: "I have to think of my age. People say, 'This old man, what the hell is he still there, wanting to do it? <strong>Some others think I'm doing nothing, so it's a waste of time for them to think of me. But all this noise will always be there in the world. You have a sense of what you want to do and you just do it because </strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>if you listen to the world, your work will never be done." <br></strong><br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr  Nathan  acknowledged  that there is a perception that he had not been as aggressive in his approach as his predecessor, the late  Mr Ong Teng Cheong, who was Singapore's first Elected President. <br></strong><br></span>Said Mr Nathan:<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"There are voices saying that but I can't answer them. I know the limitations of the Constitution and what you have to do. So I'm not there in a boxing match." <br></strong><br></span>Mr Nathan declined to be drawn into whether the role of the elected presidency has to evolve in response to the new political landscape. Doing so would be unfair, he reiterated, as it is for the presidential hopefuls "to think what they want to do and to face the realities" eventually. <br><br>Former NTUC Income chief executive Tan Kin Lian, who confirmed that he will put himself forward for election, has proposed to clarify the role of the President, should he be elected. <br><br>On Mr Tan's plans, Mr Nathan said: "You must remember that the Presidency operates on the Constitution - and what is possible and what is not possible is determined by that ... I won't want to belittle his enthusiasm. If he can do it, good luck to him." <br><br><span class="goog_qs-tidbit-1">Still, Mr Nathan pointed out that the elected presidency has to "strike roots" as well as "adjust to changing situations".</span> He added: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"It's a new institution and Singaporeans must understand that there's a difference between that institution and the executive Government." <br><br></span>On his work over the past dozen years, Mr Nathan said: "Often I ask myself: What have I done? (I have) done nothing ... It's hard for me to quantify. I mean it's not like building a housing estate and saying I've got so many units and so on. We can't ... It's a very intangible thing. You may have to go round (asking) the people in the heartland and see how many of them were satisfied with whatever I did or whatever I did not do." <br><br>And it is the heartlands that the presidential hopeful will have to appeal to, Mr Nathan noted. He said: "Each one should have a fair chance of presenting their viewpoint, of convincing the heartlands that they are the most suitable person to lead them. Most of my time over the last 12 years, I've endeavoured to develop a bond with the people of the heartlands and I value that very much."Additional reporting by Hoe Yeen Nie</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br><br><br></span><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Hotnews/EDC110608-0000315/Although-Ive-been-quiet,-Ive-been-doing-work"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #006699; font-size: x-small;">http://www.todayonline.com/Hotnews/EDC110608-0000315/Although-Ive-been-quiet,-Ive-been-doing-work</span></span></a></span></p>

              <p>He is enjoying his role as a puppet and has not decided if he wants to run for the presidential election.  Please spare us, nathan, please do not run for the next presidential election.   Enough is enough.     Nathan, you have collected so much money millions and millions from Singaporeans, it is time you just retire.    Highest paid president in the world does not listen to the world, arrogant !</p>
              <p>I have respect for our late dear President Ong not nathan.</p>
              <p>He does not want to be blacklisted so not performing the same as late President Ong, what a bloody coward!      Selfish to be thinking of himself.</p>

              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>After keeping ‘very quiet’ for the past 12 years, President S R Nathan has been making quite a lot of ‘noises’ lately to please his PAP masters and to belittle ordinary Singaporeans who have been paying his obscene salary.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the NUS Commencement yesterday, Mr Nathan described criticism against him as “noise in the environment”.</p>
              <p><strong>“It cannot be stopped, hence there is no point adding to it,”</strong> he added.</p>
              <p>He also found his ‘voice’ to warn Singaporeans against voting for a president who bows to ‘populist pressure’, claiming that it would pose a ‘greater danger’ for the country without substantiating his wild claims.</p>
              <p>Noting that Singapore has come a long way to what it is today, Mr Nathan said unhappiness might have arisen among some sectors of the populace along the way in a blatant defence of the unpopular PAP regime:</p>
              <p><strong>“It would be best for everyone to look back, see the big picture and ask: ‘How did we arrive here? What are all the good things that we’ve done?’”</strong></p>
              <p>When asked about his future plans, Mr Nathan quipped:</p>
              <p><strong>“I’ve not made up my mind. You know, I’ve been working from the age of 14, 15, so the only thing I know is work.”</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Nathan has indeed worked ‘very hard’ during his two terms as Singapore’s first ‘walkover’ President so much so that few Singaporeans other than the PAP leaders are sad to see him leave office.</p>

              <p>i have mentioned in other post the need to clarify on the powers, role, and duties of the president-elect...and with vested power of the people, the president-elect must speak for the people...and that should include reviewing the constitution and monitor that it observes balance, transparency and upholding it with utmost integrity.</p>
              <p>the citizens are still unsure who and what they really want...as citizens, we are responsible to know what the president-elect can and should do..... not for the individuals...but for the people and the whole nation....</p>
              <p>one should not rush into election without knowing who and what he or she is voting for... </p>
