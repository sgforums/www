Of course it is PAP.  What irk me is that the guy actually say, the law requires us to pay up.  I ask him not to mention law since the law allow him to sit there and do nothing and expect the people to just pay up...  it not fair to poor people like us !!!</div>

They treat you like dirt.  Appointment made and they make you wait.  Then say they have no appointment with you.  You give them names as who asked us to go down, they then say PIC in meeting, want to wait or not.  About an hour, cannot wait, go back to counter to be served by counter staff.  Counter staff will tell you how much to pay per month,  They don't care you can afford or not. It's like take it or leave it.  Not happy, go wait for officer....  I left without having any arrangement made.  I did not meet their installment demand, they send lawyer letter, then they came and cut off electricity.  After still no payment, they reduce water supply.<br><br>Well, who say Ah Long are wicked.  SP ( Singapore Paikeh ) can do anything they want yet the law is on their side...

If we can solve, why bother to go to MP...  In the first place, problem arises from the civil services.... then we get suck into their stupid system.  You expect them to reprimand their own people, no they don't. Instead they go round and round until you gave up....  So call MP working for you.   Mind you they are paid just to be MP siting in parliament to listen to debats.  And you don't have to attend to all the sessions too.  Isn't that good money.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just spoken to GMof Town Council...  Told her the place not sweep and she say it could be a sabo by residents..  I think she meant to say I did it.. They don't admit they didn't clean the place.  They don't appreciate resident calling them to tell them they didn't do their job....  This is the Pasir Ris Town Council ...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>COuld the reason why Town Council suck is that they think they are part of the ruling party ???  When I was living in Serangoon many years ago, my encounter with the Town Council there is just as bad ..... Don't they understand that they have a job to do and a duty to fulfill, why make life difficult for others ...</div>
