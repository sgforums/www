            <div class='col-md body'>Francis Seow is a Singapore-born political dissident who is in self-imposed exile from Singapore. He was educated at Saint Joseph's Institution in Singapore and at the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple in London. Seow is currently a United States citizen, and a University Fellow based in the Department of Asian Studies at Harvard University.<br><br>Seow joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1956 and rose through the ranks to become Solicitor General 1969, a position he held until 1971. During his career he served under the administration of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and was appointed senior counsel to a Commission of Inquiry in the Secondary IV examination boycott by Chinese students in 1963, prior to Singapore's entry into Malaysia. For his work, Seow was awarded the Public Administration (Gold) Medal. He eventually left public service and entered into private law practice in 1972.<br><br>He was later suspended from law practice for 12 months by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin for breach of an undertaking made to the Attorney General while in private practice. Nonetheless, he was later elected a member of the Council of the Law Society in 1976, and eventually became its President in 1986.<br><br>His new appointment led to a falling out with Lee Kuan Yew after he became embroiled in the politics surrounding the role of the Law Society. He ran for the Parliament of Singapore as part of the Workers' Party team that contested the Eunos Group Representation Constituency in the 1988 Singapore general election. His team secured 49.11% of valid votes, losing marginally to the PAP team.<br><br><strong>Just before the election, he was detained without trial under the Internal Security Act for 72 days, accused of having received funds from the United States and advice for the purpose of promoting democracy in Singapore. </strong>According to his account, he was subjected to torture, including sleep deprivation and intense air-conditioning. During the elections, he was criticised as being an American stooge. Later, while awaiting trial for tax evasion, he fled the country and was convicted in absentia. These events are alleged by many to have been politically motivated, and part of a pattern of lawsuits and criminal proceedings against dissenters in Singapore.<br><br>Francis Seow tells his story in the semi-autobiographical To Catch a Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's prison (1994). In the book, Seow recounts his career in the legal service and his personal experience of being detained by the Internal Security Department. He also accuses the government of Singapore of authoritarianism and human rights abuses under Lee Kuan Yew. The book also contains a foreword by former Singapore President Devan Nair that is equally critical of the Singapore government. Since then Seow has written another book, The Media Enthralled (199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, which describes how he believes the Singapore government undermined freedom of the media and turned them into pro-government mouthpieces.<br><br>Despite his exile he has spoken at events organized by Singapore student societies in universities outside of Singapore.<br><br>Since when does receiving funds from the US constitute a violation to the security of Singapore?<br><br>I guess the old man deem Francis was a threat to his continued dominance over Singapore, that's why he was detained without trial and sujected to ill treatment. Getting funds from US and running in an election is deemed subversive? I think it's a blatant abuse of the ISA.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Francis Seow was a power player in SG politics in the 80s. Eloquent and hard-hitting. He knew the Establishment inside out, maybe he knew too much.<br><br>That man in Parliament, the ex Solicitor-General of Singapore and at one time, potential candidate to be the Chief Justice, debated with vigour and did not take any crap from other MPs. By the way, he was awarded the Public Administration (Gold) Medal in 1972.<br><br>I suppose he's better off today as a University Fellow in the Human Rights Program of Harvard Law School, and a Orville Schell Fellow of Yale Law School.<br><br>Those who do not know much about this man, should read his works. You will realise that he is fiercely nationalist, more so than many can say about some of our leaders. The only problem is that he has a different view of how Singapore should be. A more free society with greater respect for plurality. He believed that the Law Society should have a more active role as an NGO to speak for the people on legislation that could have an impact on their lives.<br><br>Simply put, his ideology and LKY's ideology could not have enough space in one room, and he lost out due to reasons that are bleeding obvious.<br><br>Maybe one day people will have a fairer pov. And remember, do not always believe one side of the story, especially in our country where the media has admitted to playing the role of the administration's spokesman. That in itself is enough to say a lot about the levels of comparative veracity and balanced reporting.<br><br>--<br><br>He was recently invited to give speeches at Brown University and Uni of Penn, to the Singaporean diaspora. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
