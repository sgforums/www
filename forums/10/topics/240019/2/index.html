But i just don't agree with outright biasness that comes from either sides when tackling a political issue (that's why i rarely ever comment on any heavy topic, because i believe that it's not going to achieve anything). Of course it is very easy to point out other's mistakes, all you need is a mouth and fingers to type.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that complaining is wrong, my point is that, when people are too biased, they can't have any objective views and somehow, can become detached from reality. They live in what i would call a 'big brother' world, where they get overly paranoid and turn even the most simple thing into something political. That is just my observation.</div>

You seem to forget that there are those of us who don't care that much about politics, don't care for the gov enough to try to defend them and don't care about the opposition enough to support them. Like i said, i'm not that interested in talking about heavy politics, 'cos there's so much better things to do than to talk about politics. I don't take this forum too seriously, it's safe to say that there are others who don't really take it that seriously either, why should we? haha<br><br><blockquote>If "those who write seem to forget about those who read their writing" - then what is the purpose of writing at all ?<br><br>Has any alternative views frightened anyone from expressing their own views and prevent anyone from writing what they really think ?<br><br>It is a fact that the Ruling Party aka the Government has allowed and encouraged the FEAR FACTOR of legal reprisal to persist in the minds of many Singaporeans, so as to prevent them from participating in POLITICS.<br><br>This undue pressure has prevent anyone from writing, and silencing anyone - more than the alternative views from those who dare to write aggressively and bravely with the RARE ORIGNALITY and REFRESHINGLY ALTERNATIVE WAY.<br><br>If at all, those who are standing on the side-lines, observing the verbal bouts between two sides, are encouraged to participate and take sides - according to their opinions on the points of arguments and hidden facts that have been suppressed, and being exposed to NEW and ORIGINAL THINKING towards the OFFICIAL LINE OF THOUGHT.<br><br>When OPINIONS are formed from ONLY ONE SOURCE, the chances of a SKEWED OUTCOME can only be greater.<br><br>The SKEWED OUTCOME can happen when skewed arguments persist in a stubborn fashion without responding to the points of arguments raised on one side.

The purpose of those who write and don't take things so seriously, well, it's just to have fun, sometimes poke fun at the ruling party, which i think it's much better than being too serious.<br><br>i think that if one is too die-hard in expressing their cause, ultimately their actions will backfire on them, 'cos people will be too scared or  find it a waste of time to challenge those who hold very strong views.

You guys may win by no of voices in this forum but not by no of 'silent' voices. There are many reasons why people choose to be 'silent' when it comes to political discussions and getting 'blastered' by those die hard anti-pap is one of the reasons. I had someone complain to me about this, so i'm not imagining things, it really is happening in this forum.<br><br><blockquote>What drives you to write in this forum - if you believe that "those who write their brand of politics only seem to be interested in their own writing and don't have much regard for those who read it" ?<br><br>If you believe that those who write in this forum are 3 year olds, and are not suitable to be exposed to the REALITY of POLITICS in this REAL WORLD, are you not being typically patronising - similar to PAPa.... and OM ?<br><br>After 40 over years of monopolistic grip to maintain the status quo, do we need to guess what will happen in the next election ?<br><br>With your persistent condescending manner in viewing Singaporean as being incapable to handle ALTERNATIVE OPINIONS, can we expect any healthier change to the existing SKEWED political development in Singapore ? </blockquote>What drives me to write?
