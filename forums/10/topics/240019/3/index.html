I already said that i'm writing for fun, and based on my observations on what's happening in the forum is that there's lots of biasness going on. I don't like this sort of thing, so sometimes i write something to counter the biasness.<br><br>Since when have i tried to prevent others from reading your writings? Are you nuts? How am i suppose to do that? Just 'cos i challenge your views from time to time, doesn't mean that i prevent others from reading your writing, what are you? A sore loser? You are so paranoid. I'm writing based on my observations, if you don't like, lump it.<br><br>From a previous discussion, i found that you lied about something that you found on a website, so don't talk about the ''the other side of the coin'' ok? Your writing has been inconsistent, and another forumer has pointed that out too. so far, you haven't found any so called 'lies' from me, so don't imply that i'm like you ok?<br><br><blockquote>Why are you troubled by the link to the parallel of your thoughts to that of OM ?<br><br>If the characters of Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde exist, surely the good Doctor Mushroom and the Saffron Jekyl will be quite an entertainment in this Speaker's Corner.<br><br>Is it co-incidental that OM also felt persecuted by maurizio13 - in a similar way as you ?<br><br>We see the birth of Saffron in an anguished display of red torment in the other thread just as OM made his characteristic sly get away. </blockquote>Why are you obsessed with this other forumer? why don't you talk it out with him instead of bringing your issues with him here, so childish. At least for me, if i make fun of someone, like mau**13, i admit it openly, i don't try to hide. Whatever is stirring in that demented mind of yours about the other forumer has got nothing to do with me, ok? I'm not crazy like you, like the way you pretended to you trap for me with the help of your poodle.<br><br><blockquote>If you do not take this forum too seriously, you have revealed your emotions in pitifully loud red in a simple political discussion that only centered on a simple interpretation of an economic term - "per capita income" and it revealed the dark depths of human stupidity. </blockquote>Errmm....i'm still waiting for your refutal on my last post in that thread, you haven't answered me yet, why did you try so hard to hide the other uses of the term 'per capita' in other contexts?<br><br><blockquote>If "the purpose of those writing their 'brand' of politics is to make them feel better about themselves and it's ultimately self-serving"; it only make us wonder what was the purpose of your emotional expresssion in loud red across several days ?<br><br>Did you take yourself too seriously with yourself and forgotten your own Red Colored Printings that seemed to scream for attention to your own impotence ?<br><br>You should listen to your own advise about being too die-hard in expressing your cause - did this come as a result of your own lesson that ultimately your actions will backfire on yourself, as had been proven in the other thread - "SG top in foreign reserve per capita".<br><br>Even the prolific Robertteh has always looked forward to a thorough sparring with any Pro-Government supporter in this Speaker's Corner, as he had been locked out from their forum and blogs.<br><br>Are they not creating their own ideal world over at their websites ? </blockquote>The outburst i had was aimed at you only, of course i know other people read, but i don't care, 'cos you deserved to be blastered for your disgusting display of arrogance. When i first wrote to you on that subject, overall, i was quite polite, but you since you don't appreciate politeness, i decided to give you a good dose of your own bitter medicine. I know i was very harsh, but i really think you deserved it.<br><br>No, i didn't take it too seriously, but i took it personally, there's a difference. If i took it too seriously, meaning that i cared about my image and what other people might think,  i wouldn't have been so harsh on you...haha<br><br>What cause am i expressing in a die-hard way?

Anyway, you always use colored fonts in all your replies, so what if i only used it just a few times with you? It's not presumptious because it took a couple of weeks for me to realize what's happening in the forum and i was telling it like it is, from my personal observation. You have people like robertteh who 'claimed' that he got banned from the young pap website and immediately he came here to complain, and other people pointed out it could be a technical problem. But it went ding dong, upside down until people now don't know what to believe. At least for me, it took some time to see what's going on.  So if i compare myself with what robert did, am i presumptious?<br><br><blockquote>For one who seems to have quite a few opinions expressed in the Speaker's Corner, and still will claim that "i don't get into those heavy politics", and for one who thinks it is a waste of time, you certainly know how to waste it here.<br><br>If you are not bothered, why allow yourself to be annoyed ?<br><br>No, you did not state that those who write in this forum are 3 yr olds.<br><br>Unfortunately, like your PAPa, your continued dishonesty reveal in your suggestive words used - that Singaporeans are 3 yr olds and incapable to discern or judge for themselves the issues that confront Singapore.<br><br>If your writings and thoughts are similar to your PAPa - and also OM - what does that make you out to be ? Seeing your capacity towards aggression, you can hardly be a poodle that will quietly obey your master, and your behaviour is at worst that of a pariah - as you have been so treated by quite a few others in this sgForum.<br><br>If you see me as arrogant, are you capable of taking me on - considering the hopelessly rabid frustrations shown in RED that surely revealed your impotence on a simple topic involving a simple interpretation about Per Capita INCOME ? </blockquote>I already said earlier, i write for fun, yes, i'm human, i get annoyed and take some things personally as well.  You really don't understand what i'm trying to say, i have to repeat again.<br><br>I SAID THAT I'M NOT BOTHERED TO TALK ABOUT HEAVY POLITICAL TOPICS IN DETAIL, ESP THOSE WHICH INVOLVE PAP  and this does not mean that i don't bother to talk at all, but it means that when i do, i choose to be on the fringe of the debate rather than the 'thick' of it. I hope you understand now. Because i know what will happen when i get into the details, lots of tedious explanations, maybe some attacks from the likes of you and others as well,  that is if i challenge the 'popular' views. You see? even when i'm on the fringe of the debate i get blastered heavily by other people, and that's why i choose not to discuss politics in detail. Yes, it would be a waste to talk about politics in detail, the die hard anti-pap are just looking for new victims every day, so why should i allow myself to be in that position? I already got blastered even when i don't talk about heavy politics in detail, why make it worse than it already is?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>however, if i agree with the popular views, i know i am safe, and i have made these comments before and i have never been involved in a flame war when i agree with the popular views. I really hope that you understand what i'm saying here, cos i'd really hate to keep repeating myself because of you.<br><br>Pot calling the kettle black, you are equally as agressive, you sound like someone who can't swallow his own bitter medicine that he has been giving others. Well, too bad...<br><br>Yes, i am capable of taking you on, isn't that what i'm doing now? you are one really funny person. I don't mean to write such a long reply to you, but i have no choice since you make such wild crazy accusations about me, lucky thing it doesn't take up much my time otherwise i would have been really cross with you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If you thought i was talking about you, i apologize, i should have been more clear about that. I guess you are one of those few here who can see things 'objectively', from what i've been reading, there's quite a lot of people who seem to be anti, just for the sake of it, i say that because when others try to give reasonable explanations, they outright reject it. i think that sort of mentality is not right, that's how i feel about it. I'm a realist, meaning that i don't think that there would be many govs in the world that would admit their mistake.<br><br>Sheesh...i don't like to talk about issues like the GST hike and ministers high salary, i believe both issues have got it's own pros and cons.<br><br>Back to the topic, i don't believe in the ISA, it's only abused by those who are in power. Maybe in the past, it served a purpose when it comes to national security but not anymore. Ever since 9/11, Bush has been using 'this excuse' to create worldwide fear of terrorism and ISA seems to fit perfectly with the terrorist agenda.</div>
