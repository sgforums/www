            <div class='col-md body'>I have this theory... I started the thread "All out to defame people critizising THE governement" because I noticed that some people here are using propaganda techniques...<br><br>They start a thread like "All out to defame our governement" or when some one start a thread like "All out to defame our governement"; this group of people will keep on bumping the thread up so that the title: "All out to defame our governement" gets repeated, repeatedly.<br><br>It does not matter if inside, the motion has been soundly debunked.<br><br>Many people do not read the contents inside the thread and every time they scan the "Newest Topics"; they see: "All out to defame our governement" and soon, because the thought keeps repeating in their heads... they start to believe that people are ""All out to defame our governement"<br><br>So please bump this one up and soon, everyone will see that dishonorable people are "All out to defame people critizising THE governement"<br><br>See how I on purpose use the same spelling "governement"?<br><br>so someone please start a topic : <strong>Can anybody proof that our ministers are NOT corrupted?</strong> and use the same word "proof" instead of "prove".<br><br>Then bump it up every time "Can anybody proof that our ministers are corrupted?" is bumped up. Notice how "All out to defame our governement" stops after I started this thread?<br><br>Better someone else do it than me, or I could have registered a clone to do it.<br><br>We have no control over the "controlled press" doing it but we can surely prevent such underhand tactics from manifesting in sgforums...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee has directed Minister Lui Tuck Yew to send counter-insurgency (treating ordinary citizens who have views, suggestions and feedbacks on government policies as enemies) to counter postings of forumers at sgforums and other forums.<br><br>He has prohibited newspapers from engaging in crusading journalism for whatever it means.<br><br>He has announced to the people he wanted to build an inclusive cosmopolitan society.<br><br>Now let us review his performance. Lately there are many counter-insurgency agents who issued threats to sue forumers for replying to their own threats and intimidating remarks and provocations.<br><br>Is PM Lee still interested in building an inclusive cosmopolitan society and is he being coherent in his policies so far to build an inclusive and cosmopolitan society?<br><br>Is he changing his mind now by sending counter-insurgency cyber agents to forums? Is he serious in engaging the forumers in robust arguments to debunk them (if wrong) or is his objective to use his political power to intimidate them with libel suits with forumers having no right whatever to reply even to his own cyber-agents' extremely uncalled for provocation like calling them whiners and quitters?<br><br>PM Lee has still not made any clarification what were his objectives in governing Singapore over the past 3 years.
