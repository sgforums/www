            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Zelphon:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi to all,<br><br>I have been reading a lot of anti-govt posts and even some articles posted by CSJ.<br><br>Personally, I do agree that I am beginning to be influenced by all the anti-PAP sentiments.<br><br>I do not wish to comment abt anyone but for me, after witnessing the stark difference in PAP's polices made before and after the General Election; after listening to LHL's speech at National Rally; after reading all the articles and the big hoo-haa abt AMK MP Wee Siew Kim's daughter abt Mr Derek's Wee plight; after looking at the ridiculous pay increase in Ministerial salary; after the recent article in Today's abt some Sitoh guy who lost his sit to Cham See Tong and his refusal to meet the residents after his defeat, etc...<br><br>I am beginning to feel that Singapore is becoming more like a corporation rather than a country. Seems to me that Money is more important than a sense of public service. Data and data have been published to show that the economy is doing well but not much is being shown to highlight the plight of the poor and aged who helped build singapore to what it is today.<br><br>Best of all, the poor is being used as an excuse to raise more taxes under the pretence to help them. To me, raising the GST to help the poor is a riduculous notion.<br><br>With regards to education, it is sad to say that our govt is providing free education to bright China students and hope that these people will continue to serve Singapore after their university graduation. The fact is that many of these people fled back to China after their graduation from local universities and did not stay to contribute to Singapore. Personally, I do hear a lot of these stories from my PRC friends in NTU. While the locals are stranded in debts for local university education, the foreigners like these PRC students gets to enjoy free education sponsored by the locals taxpayer's money. I often wonder why the government do not wish to invest in our local people.<br><br>As for the cost of living, Singapore has crept up to be the 14th most expensive city to live in. I wonder how that news is gonna affect the urban poor that is increasing in proportion each day. After spending 6 mths in Shanghai, China as well as 1 and a half month in Tucson, USA, I realised that the cost of living in these 2 cities are comparatively lower than Singapore. For Shanghai's case, assuming that I am drawing a local salary, the proportion of my income spent on food is lower than that in Singapore. Same case for USA. What does that mean in the long term? For me, it means that I can get to save more proportion of my income in the long run in these places rather than in Singapore. No wonder there is rampant talk about the erosion of savings in Singapore.<br><br>I do not know much details about the many govt policies made, nor do I really care to know who my MPs are. But the one thing I am beginning to realise is that our govt has lost their sense of public service and sad to say, one day I may really migrate to other countries for the sake of survival.<br><br></div></blockquote>The pro-govt supporters can continue to delude themselves, but as I said, many of my friends lost hope for Singapore, the day the ministers raised their pay. That one single move destroyed all the credit the past PAP people did, as it serves to show that this batch of leaders are self-serving, and materialistic.<br><br>You would think that the top talents are not affected by this, but I was surprised to find many of my friends from Biomedical, IT, Engineering, Accounting (many of these who have obtained scholarships and have completed their bonds), etc losing all respect for the govt, and planning an exodus from this place.</div>

This nationalistic spirit is the one that can propel many to go back to their motherland to help it in times of crisis.<br><br>Why the lack of spirit? Coz Singapore is run too much like a corporation. It causes many people to become detached from the country. By removing Singaporeans' sense of belonging through the explicit limiting of their ability to vote in elections, and the lack of a genuine willingness to listen to the citizens, the PAP, in effect, is the one responsible for the current state of affairs today.</div>

Is he serious in engaging the forumers in robust arguments to debunk them (if wrong) or is his objective to use his political power to intimidate them with libel suits with forumers having no right whatever to reply even to his own cyber-agents' extremely uncalled for provocation like calling them whiners and quitters?<br><br>PM Lee has still not made any clarification what were his objectives in governing Singapore over the past 3 years.

If it is true of what you said above, then those residents in the constituency with Lui as MP, shall not trust him fully.  oops, better tell my relatives about it as some of them stay there.<br><br>If Lee hsien loong is serving the nation with sincerity, wholeheartedly he need not resort to such a way.  Is he fearful?  He has no calibre to be a PM, doubt he will list his objectives in governing Singapore over the past 3 years.

Our problem is that each see different ways to tackle the issues. In our opinion, migrating is not one of the ways. We prefer people who stay together and face the issues together.<br><br>Singapore a bubble ready to burst? you think so, and this is what the PAP wants us to believe, just that their version is "without PAP, Singapore will burst like a bubble". Fat hope, singapore will stay as a country, with or without PAP, with or without those who migrated.<br><br>Please cut off all these hypocricies about coming back to Singapore to help when the country needs you. If you are so bitter about Singapore, if you see Singapore is nothing but a bubble that will burst anytime, and yet you choose to leave, even leaving behind friends and relative who can't leave, who would believe you would come back and help when the country is in trouble? If you are ready to pull your roots plus all the history from Singapore, how can Singapore be your 'homeland'??<br><br>You and your family decide what you want to do, you are free to stay, you are free to go, but your hypocricy really irk!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>++++++1</div>

Seems to me that Money is more important than a sense of public service. Data and data have been published to show that the economy is doing well but not much is being shown to highlight the plight of the poor and aged who helped build singapore to what it is today.<br><br>Best of all, the poor is being used as an excuse to raise more taxes under the pretence to help them. To me, raising the GST to help the poor is a riduculous notion.<br><br>With regards to education, it is sad to say that our govt is providing free education to bright China students and hope that these people will continue to serve Singapore after their university graduation. The fact is that many of these people fled back to China after their graduation from local universities and did not stay to contribute to Singapore. Personally, I do hear a lot of these stories from my PRC friends in NTU. While the locals are stranded in debts for local university education, the foreigners like these PRC students gets to enjoy free education sponsored by the locals taxpayer's money. I often wonder why the government do not wish to invest in our local people.<br><br>As for the cost of living, Singapore has crept up to be the 14th most expensive city to live in. I wonder how that news is gonna affect the urban poor that is increasing in proportion each day. After spending 6 mths in Shanghai, China as well as 1 and a half month in Tucson, USA, I realised that the cost of living in these 2 cities are comparatively lower than Singapore. For Shanghai's case, assuming that I am drawing a local salary, the proportion of my income spent on food is lower than that in Singapore. Same case for USA. What does that mean in the long term? For me, it means that I can get to save more proportion of my income in the long run in these places rather than in Singapore. No wonder there is rampant talk about the erosion of savings in Singapore.<br><br>I do not know much details about the many govt policies made, nor do I really care to know who my MPs are. But the one thing I am beginning to realise is that our govt has lost their sense of public service and sad to say, one day I may really migrate to other countries for the sake of survival.<br><br></div></blockquote>yes, it is obvious the country is run like acorporation.  WE hear someone talks about branding!!!  PAP is a brand!!!  Their top priority is to make $$$$ instead of serving the nation.  A good politican will not place making $$$ as the top priority.
