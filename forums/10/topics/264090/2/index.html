Just post our views and opinions on government policies as this is what speakers' corner is for anyway. If criticisms are not substantiated by facts or logics the government ministers may ignore them.<br><br>If they are substantiated by logics and rationale even if not well written or researched the ministers should go to the extra mile to give us citizens a good service by taking all necessary actions and not engage in calling us names through their countering agents for this kind of attitude is immature and wrong.<br><br>PM Lee has just last year before IMF meeting advised citizens to put up 4 million smiles and go to the extra mile to give good service to their customers. Are ministers citizens' paid servants ? If do we citizens have to answer to provocations or questions of their counter-agents here challenging us with threats of libel suits.<br><br>It is as simple as this so I do not need to answer why we citizens are criticizing the government as it is their jobs to answer to any problems or issues raised. They are not paid millions to do nothing or just to challenge why citizens are querying them.<br><br>With the above-stated larger perspective of government we as citizens would continue to expect ministers to conduct themselves with proper decorum like servants and not lord over us.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all,<br><br>I have been reading a lot of anti-govt posts and even some articles posted by CSJ.<br><br>Personally, I do agree that I am beginning to be influenced by all the anti-PAP sentiments.<br><br>I do not wish to comment abt anyone but for me, after witnessing the stark difference in PAP's polices made before and after the General Election; after listening to LHL's speech at National Rally; after reading all the articles and the big hoo-haa abt AMK MP Wee Siew Kim's daughter abt Mr Derek's Wee plight; after looking at the ridiculous pay increase in Ministerial salary; after the recent article in Today's abt some Sitoh guy who lost his sit to Cham See Tong and his refusal to meet the residents after his defeat, etc...<br><br>I am beginning to feel that Singapore is becoming more like a corporation rather than a country. Seems to me that Money is more important than a sense of public service. Data and data have been published to show that the economy is doing well but not much is being shown to highlight the plight of the poor and aged who helped build singapore to what it is today.<br><br>Best of all, the poor is being used as an excuse to raise more taxes under the pretence to help them. To me, raising the GST to help the poor is a riduculous notion.<br><br>With regards to education, it is sad to say that our govt is providing free education to bright China students and hope that these people will continue to serve Singapore after their university graduation. The fact is that many of these people fled back to China after their graduation from local universities and did not stay to contribute to Singapore. Personally, I do hear a lot of these stories from my PRC friends in NTU. While the locals are stranded in debts for local university education, the foreigners like these PRC students gets to enjoy free education sponsored by the locals taxpayer's money. I often wonder why the government do not wish to invest in our local people.<br><br>As for the cost of living, Singapore has crept up to be the 14th most expensive city to live in. I wonder how that news is gonna affect the urban poor that is increasing in proportion each day. After spending 6 mths in Shanghai, China as well as 1 and a half month in Tucson, USA, I realised that the cost of living in these 2 cities are comparatively lower than Singapore. For Shanghai's case, assuming that I am drawing a local salary, the proportion of my income spent on food is lower than that in Singapore. Same case for USA. What does that mean in the long term? For me, it means that I can get to save more proportion of my income in the long run in these places rather than in Singapore. No wonder there is rampant talk about the erosion of savings in Singapore.<br><br>I do not know much details about the many govt policies made, nor do I really care to know who my MPs are. But the one thing I am beginning to realise is that our govt has lost their sense of public service and sad to say, one day I may really migrate to other countries for the sake of survival.<br><br></div>
