Salute.<br><br>Yes, we do not have a strong culture. Our ethnic culture, espcially Chinese, disappear with our western education; with the rise of PRC, we confuse our own chinese ethnic identity with PRC nationality; our Singaporean culture need a long time more to form in a multi racial society . we are bombarded with materialism and consumerism, nationalism hardly can raise its head, again, confusion between a Singaporean identity and a PAP supporter retard the progress of singapore nationalism. All these talk about migrating does not help in building up singapore nationalism.<br><br>The govt is largely to be blamed, not many people have the gut to admit like you do. We have our own problem, our love for 'a good life' at the expense of good moral value, our fear for instability drive many to vote blindly, our careless lifestyles is the reason why the government can blackmail us for speaking against them.

Many times, when others or I voice our concerns about how the country is run by the present ruling party, people are just so fearful that they stop us from talking about it.  The only thing they say is mind your own business.  For eg, my cousin who is also not happy with the way of the ruling party, stopped me from talking by saying Â“nothing wrong, they are doing very well . . .. . .Â”  this is so hypocritical.<br><br>If the mindset of the people doesnÂ’t change, I am afraid there is nothing we can do to be united as one.   People of Singapore though are full of grievances about the ruling party, majority of them are too timid, fearful, or too self centred to want to be united.  Sad!!<br></div>
