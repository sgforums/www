            <div class='col-md body'>Higher foreign worker quotas will give businesses more breathing space from Jan<br><br>Teo Xuanwei<br>xuanwei@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>THE economy is booming and unemployment has sunk to a 10-year record low Â– but for businesses here, it has been a tough struggle to stave off the effects of a tight labour market and rising costs.<br>.<br>Which is why the Government has decided, for their sake, to open the doors to foreign labour a little wider.<br>.<br>Businesses across the spectrum Â— from primary industries like construction and manufacturing, to the processes and services sectors Â— will benefit from the relaxed hiring quotas of foreigners from January.<br>.<br>And it is not just a matter of adding numbers, but also quality.<br>.<br>Across all sectors, the new rules will allow companies to get foreigners to fill mid-level skilled jobs like technicians. This group can now make up 25 per cent Â— up from 15 per cent Â— of their foreign workforce.<br>.<br>The Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) scheme that was launched earlier this year will see changes from March next year too. Granted on the strength of a person's merits instead of being tied to a specific employer, the pass lets holders remain in Singapore for up to six months between jobs.<br>.<br>To attract more global talent, the pass will soon be granted to skilled foreign professionals whose last drawn fixed monthly salary overseas is at least $7,000.<br>.<br>Currently, they have to be working in Singapore for at least two years and drawing at least $2,500 monthly to qualify for the PEP. The changes will grant the PEP to those who meet the new salary threshold and who are either abroad or already here, without the two-year qualifying period.<br>.<br>Said Manpower Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen, who announced the measures last night: "To succeed as an economy built on high innovation and value added-ness, relying on talent within Singapore alone will not suffice. Size is against us.<br>.<br>"We need to augment our workforce in areas where there are insufficient numbers of skills with foreign workers."<br>.<br>Pointing to the "robust growth in Asia's energy markets and global demand for petrochemicals", the ministry will allow employers in the construction and process sector to have seven foreign workers for each local, up from the current five-to-one ratio.<br>.<br>In the marine sector, employers will be able to hire five foreign workers for each local worker, instead of three-for-one.<br>.<br>With the manufacturing and services sector "expected to enjoy continued strong employment growth", the ministry will also allow foreigners to make up a bigger proportion of their workforce Â— 65 per cent for manufacturers and 50 per cent for services-related companies, such as hotels and retailers. This is an increase of five percentage points from the current quotas.<br>.<br>Said Dr Ng: "These measures will enable businesses to have access to the manpower they need to support their growth, which in turn will create more jobs for Singaporeans."<br>.<br>Industry players and analysts Today spoke to praised the measures, although there were some cautionary caveats.<br>.<br>Madam Halimah Yacob, who is in the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for manpower, said that while the measures are a "necessity from an economic viewpoint", the Government has to ensure employers do not look at foreign workers as an "easy first option". She stressed the importance of creating job opportunities for older workers and women employees.<br>.<br>MP Denise Phua, also on the GPC, said "vulnerable" employees Â— those who are older and lower-skilled Â— had to be taken care of, and there would be "social and political costs if the situation is not managed proactively".<br>.<br>Mdm Halimah was also concerned about the "significant increase" in the hiring quota for mid-level skilled workers.<br>.<br>She urged the ministry to "continue to monitor the situation so that it does not affect our graduates and polytechnic school leavers".<br>.<br>On the whole, however, economist Song Seng Wun said the measures were a timely "step in the right direction", with businesses facing "stronger pressures on wages, rentals and other business costs".<br>.<br>Allowing companies more access to foreign labour ensures they do not get "priced out of the global economy", he added, and gives them "a bit of breathing space".<br>.<br>He added: "It is a holistic approach to tackling strong demand-and-supply imbalances in the labour market."<br>.<br>Prof Chew Soon Beng, an economist from Nanyang Technological University, said the demand for more workers is natural, given the increase in Singapore's GDP growth.<br>.<br>Also, with an already tight labour market, the increase in foreign workers may lead to "more business opportunities, and thus more jobs".<br>.<br>A spokesperson for the Singapore Manufacturers' Federation said: "These measures will help in meeting the immediate shortage of labour and support manufacturing growth in Singapore."<br>.<br>Mr Simon Lee, the executive director of the Singapore Contractors Association, said the changes would "help to maintain the momentum of construction work here".<br>.<br>Still, Mr Lee noted, there were unresolved issues: Construction companies may get access to more labourers, but they are having problems recruiting enough local skilled workers, such as engineers, draftsmen and surveyors.<br>.<br>As for the managing the social impact of a bigger foreign workforce, Mdm Phua said it was important to "close the social divide between locals and foreign employees" and minimise "feelings of resentment or hostility among locals".<br>.<br>Economist Mr Song also felt the Government should work towards ensuring that "resources and infrastructure for foreign employees are put in place", such as recreational facilities.</div>

Using FTs to increase GDP is like using steroids to artificially increase strength/performance. Over use can cause health problems and even death. Don't try to lift something your body isn't equipped to lift, you'll hurt yourself.<br><br>Also, the main function of FTs is to fill up the gaps in the workforce, as a supplement. The already loose regulations to employ FTs has already caused employers to use FTs as a cost take-down measure.<br><br>Almost direct intervention by the Govt in this case to keep wages low. But they raise GST and no intervention on other increases, like daily essentials like food and transportation.<br><br>And I dun even have the right to chose to be on the same level playing field as an FT. like "No CPF for me, give me my whole salary, employer no need to contribute." If a resident costs more to an employer than an FT, for the same job, where does that leave the residents then?</div>

And I believe SMEs are the biggest employer of cheap FT in Singapore.<br><br>c) One of the reasons why high tech companies are investing in Singapore is because we have ample supply of skilled labours (FT or local) it is not because we have cheap labour.<br><br>d) I have no clue about what target, deficit GDP you are talking abuot.
