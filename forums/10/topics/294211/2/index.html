            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">I think you got it all wrong again.<br><br>a) No MNCs will invest a labour intensive operation in Singapore, if they want cheap labour, they go to China, Vietnam, India or other developing countries.<br><br>b) SMEs usually has to compete on price and fight for smaller projects because they lack financial power, technology and branding. And I believe SMEs are the biggest employer of cheap FT in Singapore.<br><br>c) One of the reasons why high tech companies are investing in Singapore is because we have ample supply of skilled labours (FT or local) it is not because we have cheap labour.<br><br>d) I have no clue about what target, deficit GDP you are talking abuot. Lets skip this discussion as it will lead to nowhere.<br></div></blockquote>a)Sorry wrong choice of words. SMEs higher less people. Labour intensive not the correct phrase. NMCs hire alot more people. (comparing within the same industry). Lets say, the 25% quota of FT. NMCs will save more, due to economies of scale. Again, assuming the firm in question is using FTs to save cost. Which is the point of this thread. Where an MP in the 1st post said that there is a danger of Firms using FTs as a cost takedown measure. What she didn't know or say was, its already happening and the govt is making it easier.<br><br>b)FT laws are a common denominator, its applies to all SMEs. If laws are tightened,  its still a level playing field between SMEs. As for how NMCs stifle SMEs, I'll go into that prolly later after I get home.<br><br>c)Thats your opinion, not mine. I believe its due to the fact that we have cheap skilled labour. The Govt knows that, which is why they are trying to keep wages low, buy the "widening the doors". Which is again, the title of this thread.<br><br>d)The influx of investors create jobs (which will contribute to GDP increase, which is what the Govt is aiming for). Not enough local residents willing to work for the packages these companies are giving. Here comes the injection of FTs to fill the gap to sustain the GDP growth. Which is was what I was trying to say. But yeah, lets skip it. I just explained for the benefit of anyone else who would misunderstand. (Edit: which goes back to point A, where companies have an option of using FTs as a cheap way out)</div>
