              <p>I regularly catch class 95 on the internet 'live' broadcast as well.</p>
              <p>They are entertaining but they work for media company of singapore.</p>
              <p>I mean, I feel they could be even more entertaining if what they say is not as much censored.</p>
              <p>I heard that your media is ranked very high on censorship according to a well known organisation that ranks on this aspect.</p>

              <p>Mr Sean,</p>
              <p>Doing smth right does not compensate for the fact that youre doing smth wrong in the first place. It would have been better if they do not have this contest in the first place? I'm sure no one likes it when someone takes a voyeuristic video of you, regardless of what you're doing.</p>

              <p>I caution the DJs their suggestions may backfire on themselves.</p>
              <p>For example, if people 'accidentally' also film themselves or their family members or loved ones doing something unpleasant, how would they feel?</p>
              <p>This, to me,  is actually a form of paparazzi.</p>

              <p>Looking at their personality, I guess they will mind if they are filmed, especially G Ong.    They are doing the job of apple polishing when they touched on the issue of owning cars is cheaper here.    Time for a change for Fm95, get some new blood to do the morning show.     Anyway, I don't prefer Venetta Lopez, her performance is just mediocre.   </p>

              <p>Talk is really not difficult.</p>
              <p>They talk and talk and talk every morning sounding very wise. For example, they like to comment on this and that and criticise this and that.</p>
              <p>Most if not all of the time they are on air, its a one way communication where no one directly immediate can rebut them or comment on what they said. Only sometimes, they allow some people to call in and talk to them.  But this is only a small fraction of their air time. So, they talk more than listen to listeners, in this sense. </p>
