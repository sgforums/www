            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Orcishwarrior:<br>speaking about Israel and singapore defense relationship,do u remember a strait times news article on Singapore-Israel Satelite co-operation if i didnt recall wrongly singapore is said to invest S$1 billion into the satelite research while Israel will provide the technology the article was printed in yr 2000<br>.we have the reason to believe that military satelite is long being up in space without one noticing its present maybe it is launched under one of IAF satelite<br>as a cover up.<br></blockquote>Well, the Americans and the Russians will know. They track every low orbiting satellites (as part of their ABM defence). Both countries have the capability to knock out any low-orbiting satellites with their anti-satellite weapons.<br><br><blockquote><br>Singapore really cover stuff well to be kept really confidential but lack the depth of transparent over such things althru each armed force reserve the right not to announce to the public,it seems singapore just didnt even touch the borderline of the transparent<br>depth at least MY somehow done it.<br></blockquote>Well in my book, there are two kinds of defence:<br><br>1. psychological defence. Making a lot of noise about what your capabilities are. Buy this and that (not necessary have to be 100% proficient in using them) so that the "enemies" will think twice or even three times before attacking. Good but sometimes doesn't work well, eg. Sadam and the current Iraq regime.<br><br>2. substance defence. Making sure that your "enemies" know that you have substance but can never quite the depth of your substance. In this kind of defence, one may acquire significant capabilities but never made it "quite" public. The "enemies" are constanlty trying to assess how strong you are but could never quite tell. If they choose to attack, the "enemies" will suffer considerable amount of damage to make any attack not worthwhile. This also achieve the above defence.<br><br>I guess Singapore chose to adopt the latter kind of defence whereas some of our neighours choose the former one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

It would give us the ability to look for the Malaysians MLRS and Artillary positions with out the need to send out fighters or UAV. Upon discovering the enemy's position, it gives us the ability to lauch our own battery fire or if it is too out of range deploy fighters to take them out</div>

But from what I know, you can find <strong>Malaysian</strong> girls in Geylang , Massage Parlours or KTV offering their services for a rate lower than those offer by the China girls.

Why should we be an ally to a country, where it is well-known for its corrrupt, half-fucking leaders (G.W.Bush and his herds). Are your leaders trying to follow the suit. If So, i think Goh Chok Thong sampah and his herds of cabinets can be a good example. Flame me if you want, but I'll just 'yawn' and wait till you done. By the way, is it really that US is your reliable ally. I just thought your nation is 'mama's boy' for them. About us pissing others off, is it all our neighbours or it is your telinga panas who just can't to listen to healthy advice on truth about ur country's childish behaviour and attitude, whose just waiting to be flamed in n'papers.

Let me go 1 by 1.<br><br>1. First of all, you right about the logistic base for those American fleet. Remember, you just mentioned 'logistic base'. Do you expect those people to start 'scrambling' their fleets to save your ass? If do, from what?! Us?? I don't think so. As you see, our military is based on defending and  not for war. For what purpose we should have one. Unless u wanted to poke us near JB for our water, than I'll call it as an act of self defence from unscruplus nation like Kiasuland. We know that its not gonna happened. Then, what is really your threat? It isn't the threat like Malaysia and Indonesia, but your atttitude to go for alliance with US is the create threats for u. Sad to say it but it is the truth. Why? The American itself are not very safe nation, plus its people and biz corps. around the world. What do you aspect from this 'alliance'. At the end of the day, you got save your own ass as this americans are not gonna safe u from terror attack. Try not to deny it. Every of your people knew that somehow it is your government who need to defend totally its people. U said that US is your allies??? Please, just because they supported you in some areas, doesn't mean it is an alliance. You know why you are supported by them; it is u whose are the nations that can be 'massivelly' used and exploited by them. You said that Thai hate us. Based on what, minorities.Plz, check your facts first. Maybe there is has different view on us, doesn't mean that they hate us. Why? Can't bear to realise that we actually having a very good relation with them. By the way, who are your sources for this facts. What i think is that they are having a good time playing around with you. PITY!!<br>What are you, a political analyst?? By the way, i almost forgot. Wait till the filipinos to reopen back the old american base for the americans to land their troops. Being opposed by their citizens will not stop them to come up with that plan, as for the situation which can really force them to initiate that plan. What will happen next? your 'logistic base' will remain as a 'ghost hub' with americans whose certainly had then  not intereted to berth their ships there. Be careful with it. It will the best example for being the luxuries waste for the taxpayer's money. PITY!<br><br>2. Are you denying that ur not arrogant for your good relations with US. PLZ, its too big to be covered up. Just show it, we don't care about it!! We have our lifes to take care off.<br><br>3. Being good in diplomacy with others is something which is not the same for all of countries. U have ur own style and we ours too. If we decided to be friend and 'ally' to anything that US say, we just end up to be another Turkey, another Islamic nation and a very strong ally to US. I admit that we can have the chance to be a developed nation by being supporter to them, and sad, it is the way the world evolved. Our nation believes that being a powerful nation cause of military is not the one they intended to acheive. As i said just now, we develop military for self-defence. I admit that you have the advantage over us, but what do you get in return. besides of being a very safe nation, there are nothing else that are acheiveable. Unless your nation started to be like the second Israel of S.E.A. and invade Johor. Do you think you can achieve it? Doubtful.<br>We are only intended to be one of the nation to voice our concerns in the international arena and our stand being neutral. If there is misinterpretation on our stands, it is not said to be that our nation is being a pissing others. Maybe it is another fragment of your imaginations, or your 'sources'. Maybe your jealous with us and starting to deny all that real facts. As it is, ur all are bunch of kiasus where there no end of kecemburuan. Its ok we accept it with 'irkness' and 'disgustedness'.<br><br>4. We abuse that girl? Did you get it on your local newspapers, which is commonly known for deniebility in news coverage (you all are too kiasu; From people to the Government and there are no even a leftover!!) Sorry for you all but that girl is a Malaysian. There are no abuses as u 'claim'. Plz, for the sake of the AlMighty, flame me with quality and not with rubbish. Such a fool of you who can't even get your facts up-to-date. My god! Just giving another reason to yawn!! Get the facts right and get back to me later, ok boy!!<br><br>5. Thanks for the suggestion but I think Sgforum.com is better for me to remind you of your personal nature, which is KIASU of cource.  We don't have to make myforum.com, it will be a waste of the youth's quality time. Try suggest something constructive next, ok boy. And the main reason I'm here is because of not to have support from my opinion. I don't need one and i'm not intended to be one. Support on truth, and just because ur are a citizen of a country.Support will only diminish my efforts to give an opinion. I only take 'flames' from my 'gasoline' and not rubbish which only waste my quality time. I don't need my people to support as they were not even through yet with each other in our country. The main reason i'm here is sometimes i'm supporting on facts that sometimes speaks the truth, for at least. I admit Malaysia is somehow a 'racist' country(not directly) and we are the one who facing it each day. Don't consider me as a enemy just because of my nationality. I'm here to oppose your fact with something to blast u. Take this as a debate and i'm the opposing side of urs. I'm not HARIMAU or Innocent_Malaysia and from what i see in their replies, they are MALAYS. They voicing something on their part because they personally hates u. I not supporting them. If u blast my country, i'll do the same for urs. I join on some issues created by your side and not to create one, like those two. If u don't want accept wat have i just said just now, nevermind.<br><br>Let me remind you I will stick on this forum. Try to knock me off if you can. I'm waiting for it.Plz, don't make me bored with 'flaming' of  yours, which indeed not workable. Try something hotter next time. Try laser, your nick itself. I'll be waiting for u.

Wait till the filipinos to reopen back the old american base for the americans to land their troops. Being opposed by their citizens will not stop them to come up with that plan, as for the situation which can really force them to initiate that plan. What will happen next? your 'logistic base' will remain as a 'ghost hub' with americans whose certainly had then  not intereted to berth their ships there. Be careful with it.
