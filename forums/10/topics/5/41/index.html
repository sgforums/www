However, I have read numerous reports and military information (including Flight Internation and some reputated journals) that RSAF have air launch Exocets. I cannot confirm the validity of such claims. I can only "guess" that it might be possible. I remember seeing this particular claim as early as mid 90s so I thought this is one of those "not public domain but everybody knows" kinda "secret".<br><br>Anyway, it is no secret that for a short time, RSAF did practice using A/B version of Maverick as an anti-ship missile. However, the roles are usually given to the Skyhawks.<br><br>Got to check with my pilot friend one day since I think he is still in the Skyhawk sqn.<br><br>One other comment about the quality of RSAF pilots... I do agree with Viper52. My sources from RSAF pilot friends told me that they were quite highly regarded during the exercise with the US especially during the Red Flag. RSAF pilots did come up with some very good and pratical tactics which impressed the American and European pilots alike.<br><br></div>

The French are good at building subs (even conventional diseal subs). I am sure that the Scorpene SSKs will give RSN Challenger class SSKs a run for their money.<br><br>Secondly, most of the new convention SSKs are new designs. You can say the same for the Swedish A17, A19, Israeli (German made and designed) Dolphine, European U212s,  etc. So far, none of the new builts does not come from a purely new design. Are you saying then these "unproven" subs are all junks?  In fact, all these new design improve many things over the "proven" design in the area of acoustic signature, engine design, fuel cell and air-independent technology, integrated combat systems, sonar technologies... I would rather RSN go for a totally new design sub than a "proven" sub like the U206 class.

RSN haven't even decided which sub design to go for, what kind of combat capabilities the new subs are going to have. They (RSN) are still learning the art of underwater warefare to determine what kind of sub suites the South China Sea, Singapore and Malacca Straits environment. I don't think we are anywhere near to determine the spec yet, not to mention start building one soon to be ready by 2010.

Of course they are also operational subs until 20xx when RSN see the needs to have new built boats that are much more technologically advanced. I think it will be sooner rather than later, between the 10 to 15 years timeframe?<br><br>As for why RSN went ahead and purchase the Sjoormen class, I can only guess that they are dirt cheap cause the Swedish are going to send them to the scrap yard. The Sjoormen class had a combat system upgrade in the late 80s to early 90s with a cut-down version of the A-17 combat system. So, they are still pretty potent in low sub threat environment. Furthermore, it provides RSN initial capabilities to build a decent submarine force and sub surface warefare skills at a miminal cost possible. Each new built SSK today can cost up to nearly a full sqn of F-16s. That is why RMN can only afford 2 right now, RSN chose to acquire decent enough secondhand SSKs to equip a whole sqn rather than 2 !!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I guess SE Asian countries are new to the sub surface warfare and needed time to build up knowledge and skills especially around the surrounding waters. RSN is still quite new to this art evidence by the recent "sinkings" of the PVs and MCVs during war games with Australia, India and other countries.<br><br>Secondly, RSN is and will continue to conduct studies to determine what kind of subs are suitable, I mean what type of sonars for the higher temperature and "saltier" water found around Singapore, whether to use flank array, towed array, agility of the subs (X-rudder or the conventional T-rudder configuration), what kind of integrated fire-control system, topedoes, acoustic ID library etc.<br><br>All these knowledge and skills will take quite a number of years to accumulate, then compiled into a spec for RSN next gen subs. So, in a way, RSN is taking a whole new approach to customise local needs for very very very expensive platforms.<br><br>We are not talking about just buying a couple of planes. Each sub will cost roughly about an air force sqn. Each Navy sub sqn will cost Mindef and Singapore an equivalent of 4 to 6 sqn of fighters (almost entire air force)....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> get the picture ...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Joe Black (edited 13 June 2002).]</div>

There were the top mast being too heavy issue, the MCV rolled too much during heavier sea states. The integration of Barak came later than anticipated, my only guess is that IAI much have been delayed in some technical issues with Baraks.

"<br><br>Let's not get too carried away with the US Army's vision of the FCS. First of all, we have to recognise that the requirements of the US Army are different from ours. They are an expeditionary force, having to deploy to conflicts anywhere in the world when called upon. This means that in addition to requiring tactical mobility, their land forces requires strategic mobility. Their lack of rapid deployability is glaring in the fact that it took 6 mths to build up their forces in S.Arabia during ODS. (only 101st arrived early, and they had no stopping force against any attack) Its understood that should China try to invade Taiwan, China will prevent the entry of American forces into the theatre. In fact, as recently reported, China has been trying to acquire such a capability for some time, though its more directed towards America's carriers.<br>America thus came up with the FCS. Its supposed to be a system which is highly air-deployable, and will have an offensive capability disproportionate to its size. It will rely on maximum situational awareness achieved through UAVs, the Wolfpack system (whole range of other sys lah), and exploit the info gathered to engage at places and times of their choosing. Currently, the concept is that engagement will be 'stand-off', as they would not be survivable against close-in engagements againts heavy armour. However, I believe research is going on to improve the defenses of the FCS vehicles to enable close-in engagements too, but this will most probably rely on 'active' defense measures like Boeings SLID. At 20 tons, insufficient amt of current armour can be installed, and even new concepts of passive armour in development would not be able to handle a direct hit from a tank's main gun, if they still wanna keep to the 20-ton limit.<br><br>Now, the question is, do we really have to follow the US Army's vision? We must understand that should war break out, the theatre of operations would be right HERE. There is no requirement for strategic mobility, tactical mobility is more than enough. We should, however, aim to reduce the logistical tail of our forces. Electric drive systems, decreasing the size of our ammo while increasing their lethality and Pks etc are some of the technologies we should invest in.<br><br>Another point of the FCS is their over-reliance on situational awareness. Due to their lack of armour, they try their best to engage at a stand-off distance. In other words, FULL situational awareness is not just important to the survival of the FCS, but critical. Should they come unexpectedly into contact with the enemy, they will be at a serious disadvantage. On a land terrain, with uneven ground limiting LOS, land features like trees, etc, situational awareness is not acquired as easily as at sea. Add this to the fact that the enemy will try their best to not be seen, and you will have hell of a trouble trying to get and maintain your situational awareness. The US, even with all their ISR equipment, (which is by far the best in the world) would be seriously challenged. If possible at all, all this can only be done with an extremely comprehensive network of sensors with extensive integration between sensors and shooters. This leads us to the question of<br>1. do we have the technology to integrate our systems to such an extent required by an FCS like concept? And if so, make the links robust enuff to continue to function under heavy jamming conditions? Its important to note that should the links fail to work for whatever reason, the whole system will actually be LESS capable than the systems today.<br>2. Do we have the financial capability to develop the extensive number and types of systems required to carry out the concept?<br>The US will have to utilise all the resources available to them, like the J-STARS, U-2, RC-135, Prophet EW system, future Wolfpack system, Space Radar, blah blah blah. Can we afford to put in place such a system?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not saying we do exact copies whatever US Army does, besides we do not have the big $$$ like US does. But the days of the large expansive MBT is consider over, unless you have newer counter measures against the latest generation of anti amour missiles like the hellfire II, javelin or spike (which has the capability to overcome the thickest composite armour even equipped with reactive armour). If based on the conventional tank design like M1A2, Leapord II, Challenger II or the T-90, you need to have at least a metre thick of composite armour wall for protection which is totally unpractical. Moreover majority of our organic assault bridging capabilities are limited to MLC30 so there is no point of obtaining an MBT heavier than 30 tons which will reder them useless in our terrain (where every few kms there is a 4-8m wide longkang). I would rather suggest we get a light armour based along the Israel Maverick design but armed with chain cannon against soft/medium targets and also can be against AA targets and incomming AT missiles plus a couple of spike AT missiles againt hard/armour targets.</div>

SAF has always shown interest in MLRS but deemed too hot to have because Malaysian govt will sure to complain that we are about to invade them. MLRS is too offensive oriented.

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of MLRS systems, assuming we are getting the US MLRS system, should we get the HIMARS version or the normal version. I believe that getting the normal tracked version is better as the HIMARS air-mobility is not really needed, and it has only half the firepower of the normal version. What say you guys?</div>
