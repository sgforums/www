            <div class='col-md body'>According to Defence Analysis:<br><br>One sign of Dassault's desperation is the plethora of options that the co. and the French govt. are offering in export support. "What do you want? You can have it!" Which possibly raises a question in many customer's minds: if the aircraft is as good as it claimed, why offer all the options?<br><br>The fact that is known that the existing model is underpowered, especially in HOT and HIGH conditions (Singapore).<br><br>Another problem. Why buy a Rafale F2/Block 05 standard aircraft for delivery at the end of 2004 when you can get a better version in 2006? HMS and full weapons capability were not ready on this standard aircraft. But were on offer fromthe Grippen and Tyhoon from the start.<br><br>On top of this, Rafale F3/Block 10 will see an active array radar replacing existing passive E-scan RBE2. Now, there tends to be a rule of thumb: if there are that many chances in a programme, then wait until thehome customer had taken delivery of the system and had discovered all the bugs. this could mean that potential clients wait until well after 2005 before looking at Rafale.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Dig on the "bugs."<br>The Hornet is totally a jackshit aircraft to maintain on airbases.   The Airframe, thrust to weight ratio, is designed specifically to operate on carriers.  Hence the little under-carriage problems the M'sians had up north. (rumors, unconfirmd) I feel that the hornet is more suited to the mud-moving role than the interceptor/fighter role.  According to some Air Force puke, he said the F/A-18 Can out maneuver and out-turn the F-16 and Mig-29, when unarmed.  I seriously doubt modern combat aircraft are designed to fly "unarmed."  However, its versatile air-frame almost guarantees it to be "suitable" for any role.  Word says that a new F/A-18G "growler" would be out to replace the existing EA6-B Prowlers<br><br>Anyway about the combat radius.<br>The F/A-18C/D has an approx combat radius of 537km.<br><br>The combat radius of the MiG-29 is probably between 750 to 850km.<br><br>As for the hawk, it has a range of 2500km+, which leaves its combat radius around 1250+km.  Longer legs than their MiGs and BuGs.<br><br>Asean Spirit?  What kinda ASEAN spirit made that Malaysian MiG-29 Shadow a 747 into Singaporean airspace?  They thought that by hiding under a jumbo jet, our EW aircraft can't see them.  I feel that if anybody tries anything funny with us, we should give them a nice shrill on their threat recievers.

            <div class='col-md body'>i may b wrong. But as far as i noe, the tail chase range of AIM-120 is 22.5 km. This is still inferior 2 the R-77.ALso, the MIGs i doubt they have such long combat radius, longer den f-18.. n 1 more thing. R-77 E has a combat range of onli 75km<br><br>[This message has been edited by F-14 Tomcat (edited 22 August 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Combat radius does not equal range divided by 2. You have to factor in stuff like warload, mission profile(hi-lo-hi, lo-lo-lo etc) and stuff like power settings over target, loiter time over target etc. Range specs are often taken from manufacturers data for aircraft in clean condition(no warloads), max internal fuel, and most econ power setting(ie cruise). IIRC to estimate combat radius its best ot use a figure of around 30% max range.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More fuel to the Rafale vs EF2000 fire, courtesy of Air Forces monthly forum:<br><br>Basically in A/A, current Typhoon and Rafale are on par, with the following measured:<br><br>- AMRAAM vs MICA(both will eventually get Meteor)<br>- T/W ratio sees original Typhoon with the lead, although with the new A/G requirements for Typhoon and M88-3s for export Rafales we're back to even stevens<br>- Turn/climb rates are pretty similar<br>- RBE2 vs CAPTOR radar. RBE2 is more advanced, but performance doesn't difer much. Both are scheduled to receive AMSAR anyway, but the Rafale will be 4 yesrs before Typhoon.<br>- Rafale has TV for its passive search/track system<br><br>As you can see, we're in a virtual dead heat here, the so called weight advantages Typhoon had was due to its originally being designed for the counter air role in mind. Adding in the A/G burdens Rafale takes a pretty strong lead, which even Eurofighter concedes, as Rafale has<br><br>- more hardpoints capable of carrying fuel tanks, more harpoints for carrying heavy loads, and more hardpoints.<br>- was designed from the outset with multirole in mind, while Typhoon was added A/G role later. Hence Eurofighter uses the A/A Typhoons data to lie about its AUW<br>- With increased tanks and CFTs, it can easily fulfil our range requirements<br>- It has passive track and search systems along with a "active stealth" EW suite, and is generally more "cutting edge" than Typhoon<br><br>A look at our requirements or the new fighter will easily see what is better suited. Now just hope that those who decide feel the same way...<br><br>Besides,(here me being flippant again), someone once likened the Rafale with CFTs as being a cross between Ashley Judd and JLo.
