We used to be one country which later acrimoniously broke up.  But just remember this: There will always be politicians who will talk nonsense (usually from our side) and those that are more than happy to capitalise on the turbulence between Malaysia and Singapore (to some extent I think both sides are guilty of this). But thats all to it. No one gets physically hurt. Period.<br><br>Anyway, to some extent, Malaysians nowadays are less succeptible to manipulation by politicians from the gov. after Anwar's case (but they could still be manipulated by those from the opposition i think).<br><br>Now regarding any potential conflict btween Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>I think it is clear from Malaysian defence spending pattern (how much we spend overall and what we buy), our training (minimal joint arms, fibua and amphib)and our dispositions (units scattered all over the country in peace time formation, armour forces on all approaches to KL rather than bunched in Johore) we do not intent to ever use force on Singapore. And I think Singapore leaders (mil and gov) know about this too.<br><br>SAF capabilities are known to everyone in the region. We never tried to fully match SAF capabilities but only try counter them in a limited manner (i.e. limited number new long range arti , sams, atgw ) even when SAF clearly develops offensive capabilities to be directed against Malaysia (i.e. Combined arms divisions, Heliborne trained inf, Amphib trained inf, long range Arty, New LSTs, Attack Helicopters). These are capabilities designed to rapidly attack &amp; destroy our forces and hold land without prior warning.<br><br>I understand from your defence doctrine that these are essential capabilities but I think the quantity of assets and training SAF have has  crossed the line between having a deterrent force (If you attack me you will suffer) to a threatening force(I will and can attack you any time). It is also becoming more and more provocative.<br><br>From looking at our purchase of naval and aviation assets,  it is clear in my opinion that our threat orientation is towards the Spratly Island and dealing with LIC.<br><br>We bought frigates with close in AD weapons and fast corvettes (second hand by the way) simply because our navy is hard pressed to maintain a credible detterent force in the Spratly area. We rushed into buying some of these assets and were very annoyed when they were delivered late as we (i.e. our navy commandos)were very exposed in the Spratlys.<br><br>It could also be noted that the new Naval base for the proposed Sub Force will be in Sabah, East Malaysia.<br><br>Our navy simply do not have the resources to put a strong and credible blockade without exposing our territory. We just have short of enough vessels (to illustrate, during the Sipadan crisis, our assets were streched really thin).<br><br>As for our fighters, our principal strike fighters (the FA-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> is geared towards Maritime Strike with the MIG-29s providing air cover. The Migs were purposely modified recently to allow them to provide sufficient air coverage over the South China Sea.<br><br>The unprotected bases such as Lumut Naval Base, Kuantan AF &amp; Naval base and Butterworth AF base are clearly signs to Singapore and SAF that these assets are not directed towards Singapore. Our aircraft are only parked in sun shelters not too dissimilar from a car garage (no hardened shelters). All our bases (Lumut, Kuantan, Butterworth + army bases)and facilities (i.e. EW radars) does not have medium or long range air defense.<br><br>Our officers are trained and exposed enough to know that these assets are sitting ducks to Singapore but I think the goverment have decided long ago that this will be a sign of our goodwill.<br><br>What more do Singapore wants as a sign that we will never use force on them?<br><br>We do not have illusions that our Armed forces is the mightiest in the region capable of destroying anyone (nor do we aspire or profess to be one).<br><br>And we do not want to try matching SAF simply for the fact our money is simply needed for development.<br><br>What is my point from writing this post?<br><br>Stop thinking that Malaysia poses a serious military threat to Singapore. We never were and hopefully never will.<br><br>But if  Singaporeans continue to treat Malaysia as a military threat even when all the signs given is that we are not,it might become a self fulfilling prophesy simply because we also need a deterent against all potential threats (in this case the SAF threat is real). It also provides fuel for those who want to capitalise on our turbulent relation.<br><br>If you want to compare strenght of armed forces, do it with another country. We were never in a contest with Singapore.<br><br>Force would not make our relations smoother.<br><br>Should there be anyone offended by my post, im sorry as i do not mean any offense.<br><br>Thank You.<br><br>Note to all readers: All the above opinions were based on publicly available information that i have inferred from.<br><br>[This message has been edited by eye (edited 14 April 2001).]</div></blockquote></div>

Due to some reasons, they may not get decent equipment or proper training even if they are regulars.But a huge % of our soldiers are NS ppl so i am saying that without regular training they may get rusty, no longer fit etc. About the iraqi army defeated by air-raids.....hmmm....I think its more due to tactical and equipment inferiority.They are not prepared 4 air strikes and thus are defeated easily.

Yes, maybe they can, but this only to a certain extendÂ…. Do u know that SAF in term of weapon, technologies etc are much more better then our neighboring countries????  Do you know that we have more active soldiers then them? Do u knowÂ…Â…Â….

DonÂ’t open ur mouth without thinkn!!!<br><br>Btw if u r referring to the size of Singapore that gave u the idea that we are to small to emerge in war, then I tellÂ…. U r totally wrong!!! Go n get some information on Israeli !!!! and, for what I know, if there is a war, Singapore will definitely not goin to fight ON OUR LAND!!! if this gonna happenÂ…. By then we are all dead duck liao!!!! ThatÂ’s why we are so emphasis on our air forcesÂ….  Go and read others ppl comments on this topic and u will get some good information on these area!!!<br><br>Last but not least, if u r saying our regulars r not so compatible with others countryÂ… then I got no choice but to fuck u againÂ… yes, I do agree that not all regulars are giving their best to the organization. However, there are still lots of them who has not only proved to the country that they are outstanding/best but to the world as well. we did have Best pilot from the Top gun, best diver in Navy seal courses etc!!!!!!

BTW war is not just bout superior training(if SG is soooo good), equipment is definitely an advantage.But SG<br>defending(i don believe SG would willingly go offensive)is quite different i believe SG depends too much on other countries and our neighbours are hostile.We are unlikely to get aid from em.So SG without the ability to survive on its own wif out food + water.<br>BTW how tactically effective are our senior officers are unproven.So i believe u are too cocky and overconfident.BTW i am airing my views and welcome ppl to 'enlighten' me.

Due to some reasons, they may not get decent equipment or proper training even if they are regulars.But a huge % of our soldiers are NS ppl so i am saying that without regular training they may get rusty, no longer fit etc. About the iraqi army defeated by air-raids.....hmmm....I think its more due to tactical and equipment inferiority.They are not prepared 4 air strikes and thus are defeated easily. Thanks 4 ur interest in my posts.Ur comments are appreciated unlike UND's</div></blockquote>although a huge percentage of our guys are NSmen with no regular training, it must be noted that training is not such a simple subject.<br><br>trainings can have a wide spectrum of different qualities and standard.<br>training could be for the purpose of learning a new skill or refreshing an old skill. the later obviously require less time then the former which will require proper guidance and a longer period of time to be proficient in it.<br><br>the question is not really how often we are trained but how well we are trained. it makes no sense charging up the hill everyday if u learn nothing after all these effort.<br>i can charge up the hill 100 times a day, but that does not make me a better or more competent soldier than someone who probably charge up the hill less the 5 times under a good instructor<br><br>so training technics, training design, training operations and training objectives such as the ICTs for the NSmen ensure a certain level of competency.<br><br>next, a regular army though regular could suffer from lack of training as well, either due to lack of funds, leadership, guidance, advisory or due to plain politicking.<br><br>Iraq lost the war becos it puts more faith on the army then in the air force, an experience they gained from the 8 year iran iraq war.<br><br>Iraq lost of the war, becos from its experience, air force has never won a single war against iran and neither has iranian air force won anything during the long 8 year war.</div>

While at the same time deny such access by our enemies and force them to run down their reserves especially in spareparts and ground their high tech weapons like warships and warplanes plus ammunition stockpile.<br><br>singapore's victory lies in the hand of our navy, it is great to know that our govt have finally awaken to the realization of the importance of warships and have begun to actively upgrading it through the purchase of submarines, MPA, stealth warships and many other project including inviting friendly nations to use our naval base with the purpose of increasing our deterence value. (do anyone think malaysia or even indonesia would dare attack singapore whenever there is a US carrier battle group berthing at CNB??)<br><br>War in present terms are no longer between 2 states or between a few states, WAR nowadays are an international and global affair. under such a situation, it is very beneficial to have alot of powerful friend around the world who though may not send troops to your aid, will do what they can to keep your country supplied while making the lives of your enemies difficult through global sanctions.<br><br>Lastly, there is nothing to be ashamed about seeking foreign help. there is nothing wrong in such a move, in fact, it will be stupid for anyone to think that they can stand alone in the dark. other then the super powers of the world, every other nations including all of the SEA nations are dependent on super power and first world nations for investment, market, technology, informations and Weapons!!<br><br>While it is always comforting to be able to rely on oneself, such as when we develope local defence technology product like FH2000 and SPIKE that is of comparable standard to the best in the world today. WE must realise that our lone effort may not be enough.<br><br>IN fact, no SEA nations are capable of producing its own fighter planes!! we are all reliant if not 100% dependent on foreign purchase of such items. so if singapore is too dependent on foreign aids, are not then all of the other SEA nations doing likewise?? how much stronger are they then compare to singapore in truth?? at least singaporeans can repair our own planes though we cannot produce the respective spare parts, while our neighbours have to send their fighter planes to singapore for major repair!!<br><br>It matters not how you win a war or deter an enemy. the important thing is you win the war and live to write the history whichever way you like and gets to trample on your enemy's grave. HONOR is meant for the victor PEACE belongs to the dead.</div>

Why should I be jealous of a country where the bulk of the population live in pigeon holes and pays through their nose for a car and...(fill in your laments here) if I could own 2 cars that cost as much as a COE, a house with a garden and backyard, and earn enough for me and my family to live comfortably in my country?<br><br>If that is true, then Singapore would have been the country with the highest number of migrants. Instead, we have foreign workers who treat our country as nothing more than a stepping stone to let them scale to greater heights. They will leave gracefully the moment our economy shows signs of instability.<br><br></div></blockquote>The cost of living in singapore is high, that is what u really want to say. there is nothing worth lamenting about the high cost of living, because it is the result of high salary. the wealth effect if u understand economics.<br><br>the problem is never the high cost of living but rather the equitable distribution of economic goods and services.<br><br>The answer is simple, too much money chasing a limited number of resources within a set geographical boundary. with little land to spare, we live in high rise flats, with little space available, we have to restrict the number of cars on the road.<br><br>yet dispite all of this negative points, why did many singaporeans still choose to stay and many migrants knocks on our door?? because of the lure of opportunity, wealth and prospect?<br><br>while other countries can boast of cheap car, cheap land, cheap house and lots of cheap stuff if not entirely FREE stuff. why isit that not everyone migrated to this land of utopia? the land of cheap and plenty??<br><br>because either the pay is low or the taxation is high, ultimately leading to low disposable income. its not possible to have high salary and low cost of living hand in hand unless u are at the top of the salary scale in the area, another possibility that is possible is in arab nations where the govt can subsidise everything with money pouring out of the oil field.<br><br>otherwise, normal logic would see a huge influx of migrants to this land of plenty unless there is a strict restriction against migrants as the presence of migrants automatically increase labor supply and depress wages and the increase in demand for food and basic neccessities push up the cost of living in the form of inflation.<br><br>the influx would continue until either a restriction is in place OR when the economy reaches a new level of equilibrium that will see the land of plenty and cheap turning  into the land of the scare and expensive like singapore, japan, hongkong and all the metropolis around the world.<br><br>jeolousy?? jeolousy give no reason, it has no logic, no understanding and no desire to accept the reality. jeolousy is simply pure non-sensical rage and hate which is usually kindered by a sense of self inferiority complex which leads to fear, then to hate and then to the lost of all logical faculty of the mind.<br><br>tell me, did malaysian felt that singaporeans are snobbish, carrying that attitude of i am holier than you attitude, a perception resulted from their own inferiority complex?<br><br>or was it from their own perception that singaporeans are not humble or subservient  enough toward them in view of singapore's small size vis a vis the other nations.<br><br>so was singapore branded snobbish because we are so, or was it because other nations in view of singapore's size do not wish to accord us the equal mutual respect that all sovereign nations deserve?<br><br>in short, did we get branded snobbish because we have the pride and courage to demand being respected as equals among all nation irreguardless of our size?</div>

The way many of our people behaves the moment we stepped on foreign land makes one wonder what we had gained from years of courtesy campaigns. Ask around. Tour operators can spot Singaporeans miles away.</div>
