Sure I know that US support us with all the best weapons,help us to build the economy this and that, but then, look at their policies with a deeper insight and you would see a darker side of US.Just take a look at the missile defense shield that they were trying to promote, all of us know that it was against China,but compare the nuclear arsenal of China and US,China has 12 nuclear bombs in their inventory wherelse US have thousands of nuclear bombs.Besides, this son of starwars project would never be succesful.Its technology is way ahead of its time.Well , I am not exactly pro china, nor am I pro US, it is just because of some bigots call Bush decided to turn the whole world against him thats why I type this.Well, lets hope we would see a more peaceful China and US in the future  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Ok.

Maybe they want to test their weapons( Persian Gulf War ), maybe they want people to know that they are the true super power, but i dun like the way China keeps blaming the US, from my view, the fault lies with the 2 nations. Why does the US need to keep gathering intelligence and info from China and why does China pilots have to keep intercepting the US in a dangerous(unprofessional) way? Knowing that the fast and agile J8 fighter can easilly crash into the slow and lumbering EP3 plane and i believe that the US is continueing its spy plane job. As for the taiwan matter, China keeps massing land forces to islands nearest to Taiwan. even though they said that these are regular trainings, they don't really have to train on that particular island, and th exercise is resembling that of the scene when China conduct a full-scale invasion of Taiwan across the strait but if war breaks out between the two, Taiwan is going to be thrashed because of the Chinese Naval Fleet and modern land forces.<br><br></div>

For example, during the Korean war, the Americans attacked pass the 38th parallel although the chinese warned them not to do so.The result,US nearly got overran by the Chinese troops.<br>Now look at Kosovo.Why did US want to commence an airstrike? Very simple, US always wanted to get rid of all their surplus ammunation. However, dumping these would cost money so what better way to dispose of them than to dump it on kosovo.And furthurmore, by supplying other nato forces with the ammo, they would not need to pay the cost of disposal, in fact they will profit from the bombs they have supplied. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tripwire:</div><div class="quote_body"> China laid claim and has historical basis on its claim to the SEA islands for decades if not centuries. but it is open to discussion about the ownership of the islands with all involved in the dispute. BUT as a full sovereign nation, it cannot allow others from passing through its sovereign land unchallenged.<br><br>Phillipine asserted its claim only recently,  base on geographical proximity (which is bullshit). Phillipine has not shown any conclusive evidence it owns those isle, in fact, what makes up the country of phillipine was not decided by the pinos, it was the spanish and then later the american colonial masters that decided which land or isle constitute their colony, the question is....was there any records that prior to the establishment of the nation call phillipine, was there any legally documented evidence that those isle belong to phillipine.<br><br>IN FACT, the americans which is the former owner of the entire phillipine isles and later granted it independence has rejected the phillipine claims that the spratelys belong to the phillipine and that USA is bounded by a joint defense treaty to come to the phillipine aid in the event the chinese move into the sprately's. so the pinos case is weak and little more then a pile of cow dung.<br><br>malaysian claim to the isle is even more absurd, it claim the isle as theirs because under a 1980s agreedment on EEZ, malaysian EEZ happen to overlap the islands and thus they claimed its theirs. twisting the agreedment to a deform level of absurdity.<br><br>malaysians self selective interpretation is equal to saying that using malaysian coast as a baseline, the EEZ of malaysia will effectively make the entire sumatra, half of klimantan, half of thailand and myanmar and the entire singapore and riau islands MALAYSIAN TERRITORY!!!<br><br>this is worst than bullshit!<br><br>SO....as u can see, the SEA nations are not so angelic as u might wish to think. they are all including PRC and japan, a pack of wolfs.<br><br>So china has bases in the spratelys,.....so does phillipine, malaysia, taiwan and vietnam.....so everyone is a devil actually. ehehehe<br><br>AS long as china abides by the IMO treaty and observe the free passage of the SLOC.....no one, not even USA, not singapore and not even GOD will come and help those loud mouth screaming (nothing else better to do jokers) pinos....because they have nothing to offer us.<br><br>America has no need of the oil in SEA, it already has a secure supply in the middle east, thanks to iraq.;&gt;</div></blockquote>Yes, it's true our neighbors sometimes act out of character. Same goes for US. THE point here is NOT who is a devil or the USA is a much bigger devil. The point is if they do find huge amount of oil and gas there, will there be a fight for it and how will the outcome turn out?<br><br>Those guys in the War room love scenario planning....think about it. If they find that the oil reserves in the Spratleys is really more than what is available in Kuwait (God forbid, and I hope they never find any), the geo-political landscape in SEA will change. Would China use force? If they do, would the SEA countries (excluding Singapore) stand a chance?<br><br>If China is not a threat, why continue to hold FPDA (if memory serves me correctly, it was for communist insurgency in Penisular Malaysia and Singapore is involved in this, unless this has changed?) air/sea exercises? The latest one was on 26th Apr to 4th May.

The only possibility of them going to war is IF and ONLY IF, there is a strong hand in the background hiding in the shadows pushing for a war by supporting one of the conflicting party.<br><br>As far as singapore goes, singapore would not permit a war between these 2 nations and would make good use of its close ties with both countries to limit or entirely prevent such a war from happening, with or without foreign support.<br><br>As for the war spreading to malaysia, that possibility is even more remote, given singapore's clear and strong message that it will fight on malaysian soil if ever the war threatens singapore's security, with or without MAF approval.
