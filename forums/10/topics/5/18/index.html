I think its WAY easy with dumb fucks like yourself.  Jane's rate Singapore's military as one of the BEST in the region, what was that said about Malaysia's?  "What Malaysia?"<br><br>I have Malaysian relatives, and I think most Singaporeans do.  Do you think we are preparing for war against Malaysians up North? HAH!  We are preparing to help you people defend your own country in case you CAN'T!  Do you think you can survive an invasion on your bloody own?  With the RSAF's current abilities, we can knock out 3 RMAFs or more, what makes you think we want to waste our time and missiles on your lil collection of MiG-29s?<br><br></div>

The Rafale is NEVER slated to get the CAPTOR radar, only the Tranche 1 and (i think) Tranche 2 Typhoons get them(not confirmed... if all goes well, Tranche 2 sircraft may well get AMSAR too)... I believe you got the Captor mixed up with the AMSAR radar, which is an AESA currently being co-developed by France, Germany, England blah blah, as a replacement for the RBE2 and the CAPTOR. And the Typhoon Tranche 3s as well as the Rafale Mk2s(not so sure on this one) will get the AMSAR. apparently, the French Govt selected the AMSAR over an upgrade of the RBE2.... sure must mean thet the RBE2 offers a little something less rite?<br>As for engine power, no worry! EJ200's successor will be the EJ230, which will boast a 20% increase in thrust.<br><br>[This message has been edited by YourFather (edited 23 August 2001).]</div>

We can use this opportunity to slow down the arms race before it gets too out of hand.

Could they have formed a secret pact against Singaporean "Aggression?"  The reason why regional countries standardise equipment is for operational and logistics purposes.  The possibility is that the Indon's are really strapped for cash and the best they can get are Su-30s.  Coincidence?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Shotgun (edited 25 August 2001).]</div>

Stinger itself is long in the tooth, and sad to say, other than in the hands of the tribesmen from Afghanistan, US AD systems havn't had *that much* combat experience. I would get everything else from the West, but stick with the Russians for AD systems.<br><br></div>

The Rafale is NEVER slated to get the CAPTOR radar, only the Tranche 1 and (i think) Tranche 2 Typhoons get them(not confirmed... if all goes well, Tranche 2 sircraft may well get AMSAR too)... I believe you got the Captor mixed up with the AMSAR radar, which is an AESA currently being co-developed by France, Germany, England blah blah, as a replacement for the RBE2 and the CAPTOR. And the Typhoon Tranche 3s as well as the Rafale Mk2s(not so sure on this one) will get the AMSAR. apparently, the French Govt selected the AMSAR over an upgrade of the RBE2.... sure must mean thet the RBE2 offers a little something less rite?<br>As for engine power, no worry! EJ200's successor will be the EJ230, which will boast a 20% increase in thrust.<br><br>[This message has been edited by YourFather (edited 23 August 2001).]</div></blockquote>Yup! I'm wrong, meant to say AMSAR instead of CAPTOR for Rafale radar. If, by your reasoning, then there must be something lacking in the CAPTOR too, since the Eurofighter consprtium aren't even bothering to upgrade the CAPTOR and choosing AMSAR instead. Personally, I feel that replacing CAPTOR of RBE2 doesn't mean theres something wrong, just that AMSAR represents an improvement over current radar technology.<br><br>M88-3 is available for export Rafales now, while EJ230 is only available for Typhoon at 2010 *at the earliest*. Singapores new fighter is expected to be chosen by next year to 2004, with deliveries 2-3 years from order date...<br></div>
