No,I'm not saying that Indonesia or Malaysia is our opponent. I'm just saying that we shouldn't think that we are invincible.<br><br>Let's not talk about the conditions of the war machines, let's not talk about whether are they well-maintained for war because I can tell you that every army is the same. You think all the 400+ Tanks/APC SAF are in full operationally status? I don't think so.<br><br>Okay, let's talk about the tanks of Indonesia. PT-76 is a Russian/Chinese tank. About the size of the BX, slightly lower profile when compared with AMX-13. It also has a good amphibious capability. The Tank was a potent 75mm cannon. Armor wise is not as thick is the AMX-13.(without addition armor)<br><br>AMX-10 is fully Amphibious. And very fast on water too cause it has specially built propellers for water missions. 90MM cannon can rip through a T-72 in a single shot. Relatively light armor without addition plates. The vehicle is very difficult to maintain due to many "delicated" parts. Even SAF complaints about the maintaince if it's AMX-10s.<br><br>AMX-VCI, although old, has a strong armor. It's even stronger than the PT-76 and the M113's aluminium armor. It has a lower profile too but the engine isn't as powerful. The standard Armament is weak too. It's also as cramp as hell inside.<br><br>Scorpion 90, dunno much but 90MM cannon?....nuff said.<br><br>V-150, BTR and saracen are very light-armored vehicles. But they are very Fast(wheeled)<br><br>Anyone knows anything about the Stormer APCs?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Silenthunter (edited 03 June 2001).]</div></blockquote>i agreed that in every army, there is no such thing as 100% standby or readiness. But i wish to point however, is that nations like singapore which have a strong emphasis on defence and have the financial ability to support such a defence platform would understandably be in a higher level of readiness vis a vis another nation which can barely afford to pay its civil servants.<br><br>secondly, the PT-76 is truely a vintage vehicle. eversince suharto came to power in the 70s, the russians have barred further sale of spare parts to indonesia. it has been nearly 30 years since then.....it does post the question how many if any of those PT-76 is still functional even if they are still around.<br><br>OH....i want to ask...what 90mm gun can take out a T-72. last i heard, u need a minimum of a 120mm to knock a T-72 out.<br><br>but T-72 dont work in our environment so..well, even if it does, i am pretty sure those hellfire, SPIKE and Mavericks can take it out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm new here but i got several pts 2 make. many military sources have proven that even the combined force of malaysia and indonesia are not enough 2 defeat singapore,much less conquer. many military experts said that if singapore were 2 conquer malaysia, all we need 2 do is capture the pumping stations at johor. those of u hu had read the book (defending the lion city)will noe wat i mean. i'm a malay n wonder if it is advisable 4 me 2 be in the armed forces? actually, i dun mind killing my own race if i had 2 defen the country.the logic is, y will i give in 2 them even if they are my of my own race? the fact is that they are the invaders or aggressors n ultimately our enemies. i have written this 2 the ministry as my opinion. RSAF will oso most probably purchase the EF2000 or the GRIPEN. in case u dun noe wat a GRIPEN is, it is the first 4th-generation fighter in operation in the world 2day. it is a tactical fighter-bomber,interceptor and oso describe as a ufo because of its ability. now 4 the navy, they haf already ordered 8 stealth frigates but i heard rumours that they are looking into buying nuclear submarines n oso tomahawks surface-to-land missiles. that will really scare our neighbours n start an arms race.dun u all tink so? anyway, i'm curious, i'm an NCC cadet, does that mean that singapore really emphasize on military? oso will ncc cadets hu are better experience make an impact on the armed forces?</div>

If i'm not wrong, you must be talking about Malaysia. But from what i see, the T84 stands a greater chance than the T72MS Moderna.<br><br>actually, you must talk to malay friends you know of their idea of not killing their own race. Thats not a healthy sign in the SAF. Malay, Chinese and Indian al made up the fighting force of SAF, if one race, malay either shoot themself or surrender their weapon like what you say ( i'm not saying all malays), the already small amount of soldiers would even be smaller, then your comrades would be even more exposed to death. in war, either you die or your enemy die. As for malaysia, their soldiers are mostly Malay, but if that large number of malays were also to think like some of the malays in Singapore, Malaysia then no need to fight already lar. We may even win with no casualties! HAHA. just kiddin. Take ot this way, IF WE DON'T SHOOT, THEY WILL SHOOT IF THEY SHOOT, COUNTRY WILL FALL. WHEN COUNTRY FALL, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE BEAUTIFUL HDB ESTATES, NO MORE BEST AIRPORT AWARD, NO MORE GREEN CITY PRAISES AND WORSEOF ALL!!!! NO MORE PORK!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Conclusion: NO WAR!!!!!!   Wonder if the new elected Singapore Government can take the fucking insults and talkings from the Malaysian Government like the present PAP. Then if the new government cannot take it, these young and inexperienced ministers would declare war. HAHAHAHAH. Thats the time when the whole world will know our power!!!!! HAHAHA. Just kiddin, another dream.<br><br></div>

Being able to undertake the mission of the Super Skyhawks and F5S, it will only need one Typhoon to replace 1 F5S and 1 Super Skyhawk. Eventually, the fleet would be minimised but still, maintain the power and capability of the previous large fleet.<br><br>From what i know, other than the 40&gt; Super Skyhawks that are operational now, there are hundreds of Skyhawks stored in the storage.

Its armour is not able to withstand the ipact of modern anti-tank projectiles but it can be armed with medium calibre weapons and automatic cannons. Its forward slope is a design that make it difficult to be destroyed by modern anti-tank missile fired at its front. Teh Malaysian Army is using it too. It can rival the Singapore Army Ultras but not the Bionix IFVs.<br><br>The PT-76 tanks are low-tech weapons. No source saying that the TNI-AD has any upgrade plans of it. As for the economic status of Indonesia now, maintaining these tanks may not be as important as providing quality weapons and equipments for the Riot police. Looking at the News, it tells us that Indonesia invested alot on providing quality bullet-proof vest for the police/troops. A standard weapon for all troops. Standard uniforms and equipments. So the not all Indonesian armour units is going to be operational. However, the air defence may not be very poor. Even though they had little modern fighters, they may be able to use their fleet as point defence fighters. With their Rapiers and thousands of low to high calibre anti-aircraft guns, they are ablt to defend the Capital for some time.<br><br>As for their Navy, they are good! They are big.

            <div class='col-md body'>As for what I knowÂ…. The RSN will always look for some unique feature on the warship and equipments that being use in our waterÂ… I even heard that all those design of our warship was purposely designed for us only!!!<br><br>Just like the MCVÂ…. ThatÂ’s no others navy who has the same class of warship as we have (although thatÂ’s some which look quite similar)Â… the design of the ship was done in Germany and the weapon that fixed on the shipÂ’s are the latest and must suit the environment for us if we gonna engage in warÂ….<br><br>What I feel when I get to know that the RSN are getting those frigates wasÂ…. This time round we are really Â‘over powerÂ’!!!! the current MCV would consider one of the best warship in this region!!! No joke!!! The capability and performance have always gain excellence remarks and comment from countries like US, UK, Aust etcÂ…. one of the senior officer even told me that, the RSN can depend on 2 MCV to safe guard our waterÂ… and 6 of its have already position ourself as one class above othersÂ…(compare to mÂ’sia and indo)<br><br>As for the weapon or missilesÂ… I donÂ’t think we will use Exocet hence the harpoon although has never proven in war (if im not wrong) has better range than the exocet!!! RSN will normally get weapon thatÂ’s BETTER and not something thatÂ’s equivalent to our neighbors!! Just look at our MCV main gunÂ… although thatÂ’s lot of navy using the same gun but they are not using the Â‘super rapidÂ’ version!!! Our gun can fired at 120rd/min and theirs only 80rds/minÂ…. rite, thatÂ’s allÂ… gonna prepare for my examÂ… hope to see more comments and info from u guysÂ… really miss those stuff as its really update me alot!!!!

That Communist(slowly moving away from it) country is the main threat! Look at their rapid arms buildup, wah lau, as if preparing for mass invasion of Asia. I think the PLA, PLAAF, PLAN is not only used to defeat Taiwan, but also small and countries that is weaker than her. OR!!!! Maybe even the US!!!!! BTW, the Chinese really have great weapons. Very great indeed. Their Type 85M II MBT and Type 98 MBT of the army is better than the American M1A? Abrams. No need to compare their armour. M1 surely wins. But compare agility, speed weight, ability to cross very very muddy terrain where heavy weight vehicle's wheel s will sink into it. Weaponry also very good.<br><br>Their SU27, J11 as they call it, is increasing in numbers and i think that the SU27 family is better than the F15C. The J10, which is a copy of the Israelli Lavi, is damn good. Equivelant of F16 technology.<br><br>The Navy. The Submarine force is getting bigger and their submarine are not very lousy. There are some "MADE IN CHINA" products that are really good attackers. Their fleet, wah lau. One day if war break out, the fleet comes towards the south china sea, the combined force will be greatly demoralised on seeing the fleet covering the whole radar screen. HAHA. Just a joke. They even want to embark on a mini aircraft-carrier programme. If SEA is to combine, chances of winning is 50/50. Why?<br>1) If they come by sea. Harpoon, ecocets and any rubbish would be thrown at the amphibious ships and normally the LST, LSDs are not very well defended by ECM etc. Chinese SSM missiles are not good in range whereas the Harpoons can finish at least some of the important frigates before they reach here.<br>2)But if they come by land, which means incade Vietnam, Cambodia and fight until the Thailand borders, wa lau. NO need to fight already. We can never defeat their land forces. Somemore countries in SEA have very few attack helicopters or totally no.<br><br>Conclusion: May all countries in SEA build up a good relationship, purchase great weapons, not for fighting each other, but combine and make a lethal force that is capable of defeating the Northern Giant by air, sea and most importantly, land!<br><br></div>

The main threat is the Northern Giant! actually, if SEA is to combine, chances of winning is 50/50. If they attack by sea, which means amphibious landings, there may be chances of defeating the whole amphibious forec, especially after we receive the frigates. But if they attack by land, which means having to defeat and invade Cambodia, Vietnam and reach the Thai borders, the result is loss for sure. By the time they attack is about 2006,7 and their force is so big that they can fight the US! once they successfully took land, their attack/fighters then got chance to land in Vietnam and Cambodia air bases and then every10 mins got Chinese jets doing bombing runs and fkatten the once crowded with tall buildings, Singapore.<br><br>BTW, you guys watched ENEMY AT THE GATES? you saw stalingrad? ar! that how Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand would look like once Chinese jets can get near us.<br><br>So the best thing is to make all SEA nations set up good relationship with each other and purchase weapons that are meant to deal with the Northern neighbours but not each other, Once they can do that, The Northern Giant willl never be able to come near us.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please lah, China have no reason to invade SEA one lah.Firstly, they are concentating more on building up their economy.If ever they go on war ,their country would be devastated.Don't be too influenced by western media that china is the villian of the world.In fact, when you look closer, you would discover that US is the big bully after all.Poking their nose into everyone's buisness except their own, saying that the whole world have no human rights except themselves.They may say that china have no human rights, imprisoning people without trial,but look at the CIA, how many people have they assasinated without trial? Sure I know that US support us with all the best weapons,help us to build the economy this and that, but then, look at their policies with a deeper insight and you would see a darker side of US.Just take a look at the missile defense shield that they were trying to promote, all of us know that it was against China,but compare the nuclear arsenal of China and US,China has 12 nuclear bombs in their inventory wherelse US have thousands of nuclear bombs.Besides, this son of starwars project would never be succesful.Its technology is way ahead of its time.Well , I am not exactly pro china, nor am I pro US, it is just because of some bigots call Bush decided to turn the whole world against him thats why I type this.Well, lets hope we would see a more peaceful China and US in the future <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
