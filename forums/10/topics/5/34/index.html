They did not purchase the 32 rockets version thus signify that they intend to simply outrange SAF FH2000. However, rockets are known to be less accurate. Their intention is not to destroy targets at pinpoint accuracy but more for area bombardment. I wouldn't worry too much unless all their rockets are armed with cluster munitons. Secondly, SAF could well purchase ASTOR too or MLRS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that the ASTROS2 system togather with their JERNAS system is their most significant buy of recent times. About counter battery capability, I share the same sentiments with a lot of you that loitering armed UAV is a excellent way of dealing with this. An interim solution would perharps be the formation of hunter killer groups consisting of wild weasels and fighter bombers to patrol certain sectors. The terrain in the region however makes the task of spotting the launchers much more difficult vis a vis Desert Storm. The worst thing about the counter battery mission is that the adavantage of first strike rest with the MLRS. Its extremely difficult to target a battery for suppression when it refuse to reveal its presence by firing. Someone mentioned the creation of the buffer zone. The creation of the buffer zone would protect our citizens and spore-based facilities but does not offer any protection to our troops in the field. An achilies heel in the deployment of MLRS would perharsp be battlefield target aquisition. What you cannot find you cannot hit. Air superiority over the battlefield would most probably deny an opponent the oppurtunity for air reconnaissance to aquire target information and allowing us to do the same. Tightening ground security will hopefully allow us to reduce the threat posed by the ground recce teams.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body"> How do we counter the ASTROs? Good question. There're a number of ways.<br><br>- Get even longer ranged MLRs or arty systems. The American ATACM is an example of this. IIRC it boasts a 300 klick range, unless I got that wrong. Since we will not be the first country to get a MLRS, export restrictions *might* not matter. Upshot is we have a system that restores our advantage in range. Downside is the difficulty in accurately placing counterbattery fire. Advances in arty radar might help, but its not an exact science, and targets might pack up and move before counterbattery fire.<br><br>- The UAV idea is pretty intersting. As the LALEE is a pretty new system obviously no one knows the full specs of its performance. But with its capacity for large payloads(at this moment just restricted to camera packs) I don't see why a Spike, Hellfire, CBU or Mk.82 JDAM(if the Americans allow export here) cannot be fitted. It'll act like the Predators over Afghanistan, effectively being the eyes, ears and teeth of the war effort. Let it loiter over posible launch areas, out of reach of MANPADS, and watch for launch signiatures. Once detected the missiles will be returned, with interest.<br><br></div></blockquote>well..... our only UAV project is call FIREFLY... supposedly with supersonic speed...<br><br>Tha LALEE as far as i know... is merely an engine at this stage... Engine for wat?? well.... maybe for the FIREFLY or maybe for something else more sinister....<br><br>But... i felt that somehow... LALEE may not be for the FIREFLY.... while the long endurance engine would imply long range or long loitering time.... but the first two letter LA of LALEE..... stands for LOW ALTITUDE.... UAVs are supposed to be high altitude.... i am not saying that this engine cant be use in high altitude (probably even better endurance)... but why they designate it with the key word Low altitude?<br><br>I would surmise that this engine.... could be the protype of future SS missile of singapore.... make 2 dozen of this SSM equipped with NAPALM... and KL would be immolated in a matter of minutes!<br><br>But the idea of using missile armed UAV is indeed a rather reasonable idea.... imagine if we have hundreds of these UAVs patrolling enemy sky using computer AI. in fact... i hope the RSAF RPV A4 skyhawk turns out to be a reality... considering we probably got 100+ skyhawks around... and not to mention the fact that ST has bought over the skyhawk manufacturing plant in the states afew years back, lots of spare parts to go around..</div>

Malaysian 155mm artillery<br><br>Sometime ago, field trials for the GIAT CESAR 155mm self propelled artillery was conducted and I believe a certain quantity was purchased. The South African 155mm - when was this announced?<br><br>2. The RMN submarines<br>I believed the winner of the submarine bid was DCN with their Scorpene submarine. I think RMN aquisition plan call for 3. The Scorpene posses a grave maritime menace. However I believe Tony Tan once made a public annoucement that the Challenger class subs are ~training subs~....<br><br>Regarding their funding, I think it is apparent to many of you that the RMAF grows in spurts - a massive modernisation once every few years. Therefore in the next 4 - 5 years you should see defence spending return to normal level. I think the SAF practises creep/low profile modernisation - a gradual upgrade and replacement program with new aquisition being announced in a staggered manner. Therefore I think what you are seeing is 2 different approach to arms modernisation. Another factor we should consider is the tendency of the Malaysians to do barter trade. I believe this was done with the MIG 29 purchase and could be one of the funding strategy for the Russian/CIS purchases though I don't think the western nations will be particularly enamored by it.<br>The Malaysian economy reported a growth of 4 - 5 % in 2001 with optimistic assesement by external agencies. Their credit rating should be substantially improve base on this. Loan from external institutions would probably be on favorable terms.<br><br>Upgarde for the Army<br><br>1. I am speculating that the light/medium tank will be an indigenous design based on Bionix technology with prominent Israeli influence(fire control and gunnery stabilisation etc). The gun will probably be a 105mm.<br><br>2. As mentioned earlier, MLRS should be a technology that the SAF investigate. The introduction of true SP variants of the FH2000 is also a possibility.<br><br>3. Improvement in the army air lift capability. With the completion of the Chinook program, a replacement for the UHIH should be evaluated.<br><br>4. It is unlikely that with the introduction of Igla and Mistral some years back and the fulfillment of our SHORAD requirements, a new SHORAD system will be introduced. The mounting of Igla/Mistral on IFV chassis is a possibility however? A more immediate task is the replacement of the I Hawk and Rapier 2 perharps. I am not sure of their system specifications and performance though. Should the upgrade be extensive enough then replacement might not be neccessary.<br><br>5. A low profile area - C4I. Battlefield information system and communications should be improved. By improving information transfer and dessimination, our forces will be able to outmaneurve larger enemy units. No information on this and I don't think anyone will comment on this. However with the SAF emphasis on manoeuvre warfare, there will most probably be interesting developments in this area.<br><br>6. Upgrade of AT capability. I do not think the SAF would introduce a new ATGW system currently. The Spike offers us many interesting possibilities though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>what you cannot defend does not belong to you...</div>

I shall use an AR-15 as an illustration.<br><br>The AR-15's 5.56mm bullets  tumble upon impact, causing a bigger and more difficult to heal wound than the AK-47's round. Later developments of AK-74 was designed to rectify this with its own 5.56mm hollowpoint bullets.<br><br>The AK line is  good for it's reliability, price, and power in a bigger cartridge, the 7.62mm (that's the standard, anyways).

            <div class='col-md body'>Its futile to change to the 7.62 rounds... first and foremost, logistics: It would entail a whole series of re-tooling by ST kinetics, you need to re-create whole new stockpiles and re-train troops to use it properly. Its heavier and if we complain about lugging around 5.56 mags, i dont wanna think about lugging around 7.62 rounds... Its an absolute waste of resources.<br><br>Also, in jungle terrain, u usually can't see beyond more than 50-100m... thats why even with an extended range, its useless. U can't kill what u can't see. Penetrate foliage? what for???  It really makes more sense to watch and shoot than to flood the whole jungle with metal to to kill a guy hiding behind a tree! Besides, thats what the 1.5x scope on the SAR21 is for... I'm never convinced by the argument that in actual ops, soldiers would never aim their weapons... thats what training is for!<br><br>Another thing is compatibility. 5.56 is the NATO and American standard. That means it would be possible for them to supply us, or us to supply them during ops if necessary.  Don't have to worry about having weird, incompatible calibres... (the U.S had this problem with the Afghans recently...)<br><br>By and large, I think its dumb to just change the calibre of the service rifle just for some myopic and questionable benefits.<br><br>------------------<br>I never saw a wild thing<br>sorry for itself.<br>A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough<br>without ever having felt sorry for itself.<br><br>D.
