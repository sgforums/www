            <div class='col-md body'>Just went to Malaysia(KL). It re-enforced our discussion about the terrain suitability for tank warefare. For most part of Johor and the rest towards KL, it seems to be quite hilly and lots of coconut and palm tree plantations. No much flat land unless using the highways,  freeways and motorways. Heavy tanks (30-40+ tons) are only best used for initial push towards enemy's front line, I think the rest will be done by lighter vehicles, most likely wheel vehicles considering that most travelling will probably be on well established roads rather than the ruggered terrain.  I wonder what the Japanese forces did in WWII? I know most of their infantry eventually settled on bikes. Well can't see SAF doing that though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

However, we have to look at a greater schema of things. Where the battles would be fought, what terrain would the tanks be fought on, what battle doctrine, etc.<br><br>Most MBTs today are designed during the cold war period suitable for European terrain and environment. They are pretty well suited for flatter terrain, eg. plain and desert environment than jungle, hilly terrain like that of tropical environment.<br><br>In terms of tropical region like ours, we probably be encounter lots of jungle type warfare or FIBUA.<br><br>Protection in terms of thickness of armour can never be absolutely replaced by electronic defensive aids. This is evidence in the Israeli Merkava design. However, there is NO tanks in the world that are not penetratable. If the theater of battle usually involves close tank vs tank battles, then the level of armour becomes the primary protection for the tank crews (such as the middle east warfare in 60s, 70s and the 80s between Israeli and Eygptians, Syrians and Jordanians).<br><br>Sweden and Russians however came up the idea of active defensive system to defend themselves. The Swedish CV90 and the Russian tanks are usually more lightly armoured than the NATO ones. The design attempt to use those defensive aids and general mobility and agility to survive. This is evidence in their speed compared to say the British Challenger tank.<br><br>In Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia terrain, tanks that are too heavy will often find themselves too difficult to move around. There are too many hills, creeks, ruggered terrain to cross. They also place too much reliance on Combat engineers to have sufficient resources to built bridges or clear obstacles for them to advance. Not to say they also consume more gas, more transport of fuel are necessary to refuel these heavy MBTs. Lighter tanks (especially ambipbous ones) are much more easier to support. Wheeled ones are even better. Of course all these mean that they better not get hit in the first place. The defensive aids also help them to get hit easily.<br><br>Of course, here we are assuming that these light tanks are sufficiently armed to counter heavier tanks. They should be armed with at least 105mm gun (preferrably 120mm smoothbore). Alternatively, they could also be armed with ATGM on their turret, something like that of M2 Bradley.<br><br>Just my 2 cents...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We're not advocating a tank that cannot take hits. As Joe Black has pointed out, using factors such as the local terrain, potential nature of warfare as a guide, a armoured platform that sacrifices part of its armour(not necessarily firepower) in favour of mobility is more suited for our needs than a all-armour all-firepower platform that cannot traverse all but the most well-laid roads.<br><br>Don't worry about asking questions or making comments, thats what we're here for<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>But if we are to think of mobility and speed by compromising on the armour protection, does that mean a greater threat persist from the ATGMs? They are a more profound threat in modern warfare compare to tank to tank battles, especially in FIBUA and Hilly terrain we find in our region, isn't it?<br><br>That is why the investment in the LSVs in SAF. How does that influence the war doctrines then?<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with trying to defeat ATGMs is that sooner or later one is going to get you, thick armour of not. With the advent of smart ATGMs with new attack profiles(hitting from the top etc), there are limits to what ever-increasing armour can do. The trend today is to go with electronic means to defeat ATGMs. I'm not a armour expert(metal birds are more my thing), so my knowledge on this is limted. Maybe one of the other guys can give you more info on this.<br><br>What I do know is in jungle fighting, the smart way to go about it is through stealth and mobility, not brute force and static lines. The Japanese, and to a certain extent the NVA/VC, demonstrated this in the Malayan and Vietnamese jungles. The Japanese plan focused on speed and mobility, to the extent that they were told to ignore logistics in part and take what they need from the British(who were extremely helpful on this point). They bypassed the fixed British lines of defence and hit them hard from the sides or the rear. Since they are no LSVs in 1941, the Japanese used the next best thing for traversing the terrain: every bicycle they could lay their hands on. Their tactics got them so far that they defeated a force 3 TIMES their number in 3 months. Admittedly training and other factors played a part as well, but tactics and mobility was important too. It still applies today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bolts:</div><div class="quote_body">Did anyone here read SM's From Third World to First? You'll realise that he started off the first chapter on National Service. The emphasis that he and the rest of the SG government place on national defence is very clear - We must have a capable defence strategy. Our forefathers have gone through the 2nd world war, the Confrontation with Indonesia and political posturing from across the causeway in 1965. My father is already 62. He tells me that he totally believe that we should have our own defence force. I think if I'm in my father's shoes and have experienced what he went thru' in the 40s and 60s, I totally believe that we should have a credible defence force.<br><br>Regarding the statement that since Singapore has no natural resources, there is no incentive for anyone to invade Singapore, history has a BIG lesson to teach us. If we follow the logic of that argument, there is no reason why the Japs invaded us in 1945 (But, they did) There is no reason why Iraq will want to invade a small country like Kuwait, after all, Iraq has got lots of oil as well and they have a sea lane open. What Kuwait did NOT have, however, was a defence force. In fact, it would be correct to say that if we were ever invaded, the US has little incentive to send a force to help us. We have nothing to offer in kind. They did not for Kosovo, either. But, they did for Kuwait in exchange for oil from Kuwait.<br><br>In the past, a certain prominent BG realised that there was something wrong with our SAF doctrine. Previously, the SAF build a defence force for self-defence and a deterence only. It meant that in a war, we put up a resistance but will still lose a war. That meant Singapore have to surrender or fight and still lose. Either way, it was sucide. This BG decided to change our doctrine. Yes, we have limited resources and manpower, but, technology and well-trained soldiers can be used as a force multiplier. That's why we have all these superior weapons and we have regular In Camp Training (My 8th In Camp Training is coming in October, and, Believe it or not, I'm actually looking forward to it because I will see all my old friends. We sweat thru' it together, but I won't trade the male-bonding experience for anything else.)<br><br>One day, if you are free, go down to URA office and look at the land plan they did for Singapore. You'll marvel at the amount of thinking that went into the land planning exercise. Obstacles were purpose-built to contain enemies landing on our shores. Special structures that were built to serve dual purposes. Amazing. Can't tell you what they are, sorry. Although some in this forum has already divulge too much info.<br><br>Why did the government go to such lengths?<br><br>If there is war, we have to defend our home, because no one else will.</div></blockquote>%%%%%%%%%% Regarding these sturctures, I believe it is adopted from the Swiss. I went Switzerland last year and I was impressed by they construction and concealment of an underground airbase and the various obstacles build to slow invaders down. And the pride of the Swiss in their National Service is commentable too.<br><br>Many European countries haev adopted the NS concept too. Example, Germany, Norway, Finland, Austria, Czech Republic, Swiss, Spain. I spoke to some of then and they are certainly proud of their NS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fire for effect!<br><br>Whether the T-90, or T-91 (didn really hear about this one), depends on the type of round fired.  If its a HEAT round, or Sabot. Whether a Sabot round can punch through the armor depends on the distance it has to travel.  Heat rounds can travel further than Sabot rounds, but packs a bigger punch at longer ranges.  At shorter ranges, under 2km, Sabot rounds usually maintain enough velocity to hit harder than HEAT rounds.  However, most Russian Tanks are equiped with Explosive reactive armor, which can nullify the force of most Shaped charged warheads.  Sabot rounds are not as badly affected by ERA.</div>
