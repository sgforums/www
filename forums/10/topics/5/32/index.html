(ORDed : ages ago) Our trainning has always enabled men to think independently w/o the need for much leadership. In HR terms, this is a great achievement. Most sane people in this region desire peace. However, if crazed war-mongers desire war, I would not hesitate to use the skills acquired in my 2 1/2 year stint with the SAF against them.<br><br>To the mongels like FuckSpore4ever...please think of something constructive before writing your piece of shit here.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Malaysian army is worth our respect in some sense. True, there is no doubt that qualitatively, especially in terms of technology, we win. But in terms of experience, man-to-man, the fact that they are regulars will mean they have an edge in this area. Their experience in operational conditions(UN ops, fighting the commies) also give them the edge in this area.<br><br>Which is why our technological edge must be maintained. And the money spent on the air force to take part in exercises like Red Flag, Maple Flag and ODAX is worth it, these exercises are as close as we can get to real ops without having actually to get there.<br><br>FWIW, I've spoken to many members of foreign air forces from other forums who've had the opportunity to work with or against our guys in these exercises. The general consensus among them is that the RSAF is highly regarded; professional and "know their stuff" are comments which I've heard often.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 21 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed, Mustn't get too complacent.<br><br>About the PT91, one has to agree that in a duel, the PT91 is definitely an overmatch for our SM1s and errr "da ge's."  Where as "da ge da's" would be more than adequate to handle them.  Perhaps the MAF should read up battles likt Wadi Al Batin and 73 Easting before getting too proud of the "upgraded" T-72s.<br><br>As for the American's reluctance in transfer of arms, well all I can say is........ ITS ABOUT BLOODY TIME THEY FOUND OUT!<br><br>Mig-29Ns, Su-30s, F/A-18Es, F/A-18Ds.  Looks like they're gonna get themselves into another logistic mess.  And if the US ain't gonna sell the weapons for those bugs, then they can have a good time figuring out how to rig russian weapons on them.<br><br>I'd still show a degree of respect for the Su-27/30 designs though.  A retired US NAVY Admiral once wrote a full article debating the Su-30s.  He conceptualised having Su's taking off US Carriers until the JSF was ready.  Of course, the engines, avionics and weapons would be made in USA.  Unfortunately, it has quite a large RCS and itself a bigger target.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When making a comparison between military hardwares of 2 countries(I will exclude the impact of intangibles such as system integration, doctrines, C4I etc) in this, we should take note of the asymmetery of the balance. Instead of comparing the quantity and quality of the same class of equipment in the 2 armed forces, we should note the impact oen class on another class. For example, the impact of A SAM systems on the superiority of B air force. The impact of A MRLS on B artillery deployment. For example, the impact of the syrian and egyptian SAM systmes on IAF operations were underestimated and this leads to them incurring unneccessary losses in 1973. The effect of infantry ATGW were similarly discounted and the IDF persist with mass armoured assaults with no supporting infantry early in the 73 war resulted in their tanks suffering extensive losses. Another point is that we should not get too rigid in our concept of operations. For example, is it really true that MBT have no place in a South Est Asian battlefield or that the ground too soft and the jungles too thick for effective MBT operations? Is the sunburn missile really an overkill in dealing with frigates in SEA....think of the impact on future naval operation of country A if country B manage to knock out 1 of counrty A frigates? We may yet be surprised. Doctrinal inflexibility has dismal consequences. Ask the French in June 1940......</div>

Read other newspapers(almost every major newspaper has their own FREE website), watch CNN, BBC even PR of China News(available through SCV). Don't have to read and watch everything, a couple of alternate viewpoints is good enough. Your find your perspective of the world changes and maybe we'll learn to appreciate what we have even more.<br><br>Don't waste time on programs like Survivor.

Instead of comparing the quantity and quality of the same class of equipment in the 2 armed forces, we should note the impact oen class on another class. For example, the impact of A SAM systems on the superiority of B air force. The impact of A MRLS on B artillery deployment. For example, the impact of the syrian and egyptian SAM systmes on IAF operations were underestimated and this leads to them incurring unneccessary losses in 1973. The effect of infantry ATGW were similarly discounted and the IDF persist with mass armoured assaults with no supporting infantry early in the 73 war resulted in their tanks suffering extensive losses. Another point is that we should not get too rigid in our concept of operations. For example, is it really true that MBT have no place in a South Est Asian battlefield or that the ground too soft and the jungles too thick for effective MBT operations? Is the sunburn missile really an overkill in dealing with frigates in SEA....think of the impact on future naval operation of country A if country B manage to knock out 1 of counrty A frigates? We may yet be surprised. Doctrinal inflexibility has dismal consequences. Ask the French in June 1940......</div></blockquote>True, but we also have to look at issues of purchasing, maintaining, deployment of such weapons, not to mention the eventual effectiveness.  Singapore does need some sort of MBTs, but it also needs to consider what weight of the MBT is suitable for the regional terrain, support issues, and how to deploy them. The purchase of any equipment must also be fully integrated into the the battle doctrine. If SAF's doctrine is based on speed and mobility, a good 60 ton Mekarva will not be suitable. A 30+ tons medium weight MBT seems to be the best solution. We will also have to look at the size of the gun, 105mmm or 120mm, tactical employment of the tank, eg. Tank vs Tank, or fire support, etc. Transportability of the tank, current trucks can transport the tanks??? Folding/amphibious??? logistic problem such as does the tank drinks gas like an Abram does?<br><br>There are too many aspect to consider when decising what next gen light tank/MBT to replace the SM1. I personally thank that Mindef/SAF would consider all these aspect and come up with a good solution to counter the Northerners' Tanks without going overkill into getting a similarly heavy tank (unless their studies warrant such a purchase).  Secondly, anti-tank platforms are also excellent way to eliminate tanks without going into purchasing of heavy MBTs ourselves. Reports came out that Eurocopter attempts to promotes EuroTigers to RSAF dispite the fact that RSAF have already purchased Apaches. Perhaps enlarging the attach helos numbers is Singapore's rational answer to the increase of MBT in the region.<br><br>Singapore still needs to replace the SM1 though....<br><br></div>

If I'm not mistaken, the US rather deploy tanks than the Apaches in during the conflict.<br><br>Seems like our northern neighbor's forces are always used as a benchmark when comparing our force. But I was quite suprise than M-sia's buying yesterday's technology. Although the PT-91's fully upgraded to current generation tank technology, it's still a T-72 right? It's not like as if the M-sians already have T-72s are were upgrading to the PT-91s. But it terms of the size of the T-72, it's actually not that big. I would say it's still able to manuver pretty well even in some of the larger paths of SG's "kampong terrian".<br><br>SM1 operator were often simulated to fight the smaller brother of the T-72s so I guess that's it for the SM1s....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ho hum... they did it again... another venomous letter by the famous retired General Zaini Mohamed Said in the malaysian press warning against "small nation with powerful army" and comparing the israeli-palestinian conflict; that israel is able to conduct vilent actions against palestinian "civillians" with impunity 'cos its a "friend of a superpower" ...<br><br>sigh... I'm not being anti-semitic here, but I'm no big fan of the current israeli military actions. Nor do i pity the palestinians. I believe that both sides are mirror-images of each other at this time: not willing to listen, not willing to back down and terribly eager to just give each other "a bloody nose" and until both sides get it, they are not going to stop.<br><br>Besides, hasn't anyone realised by now that many media reports and foreign reactions are NOT swayed in Israel's favour?<br><br>The nobel peace prize committee is considering revoking Shimon Peres'... but guess what... nothing being said about Arafat.<br><br>When will our dear malaysian general stop to think, and realise that countries do not wake up in the morning and suddenly decide to fight a war with their neighbours! He apparently knows what's at stake here: politics, economics and water. They are the ones raising hell over water, not us. What is the point of Singapore paying 6 times the current rate for malaysian water if de-salinated water is gonna cost the same or a bit more?!<br><br>And why is it OUR fault if malaysian politicians are simply engaging in Sg-bashing to further their political position? And why is Sg "sore" at losing maersk and evergreen to tanjong pelapas when there are more than 320 major shipping lines still operating here, as opposed to the 2 that shifted over there???? the lighthouse arrangement has been uneventful for centuries... why bring it up now? Its pretty obvious that they are inventing problems where none exists at all. and they feel that the recent arms purchases gives them additional leverage to do that. what can i say? I hope they have fun but people here seriously have better things to do than sit around all day trying to identify spies by their hair-cut...</div>
