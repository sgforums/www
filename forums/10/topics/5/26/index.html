            <div class='col-md body'>[QUOTE]Originally posted by psyop:<br>Hi all,<br><br><strong>"In Singapore only the commando,scout, BRC, LSV team are taught this jungle survival skill what the American term SERE, Survival Evacuation Rescue Escape. Living of the land."</strong><br><br>Same goes for them. Are all of their regular foot grunts trained to the same standards as their SpecOps personnel? No. All armies will have highly trained specops, theres no doubt.  But do not look down on our own troops while giving theirs the respect they deserve.<br><br><strong>"If this people are no good, why do we have to deploy sensor that is able to detect divers in the water manned by American soldiers. They(Paskal) are supplied with the same rebreather units used by the Navy seal."</strong><br><br>Again, if they can have it, so can our troops. And then much much more than that.<br><br><strong>"In world war two the German army lost the russian front because althought their tank was superior to the russian, they were not able to make up the number which were damaged. The russian has a simple tank which it is able to manufacture quickly, quantity."</strong><br><br>The qualitative and quantative argument is less relevant today(although not totally irrelevant). The coalition defeated Iraq while numerically inferior. Israel took the Arabs to the cleaners in 1967 with less numbers of troops and outnumbered in almost every department against Egypt Syria Lebanon Jordan Iraq Libya and Algeria among others.<br><br>Germany lost the war due to a number of reasons, and quantity was just one of them. Logistics and poor planning were among them, no thanks in small part to Adolfs interfering and megalomania.<br><br><strong>"What I am asking is if we go to war who will evacuate my family to safety and to where ?</strong><br><br>Precisely, we have no option but to stand and fight if push comes to shove because there is nowhere to run. No one will evacuate our families because there is nowhere to run to.<br><br><strong>The new artillery range for the MAF is 1000km and the quantity stated in jane defence is 22. </strong><br><br>Excuse me, the name to the Brazilian MRL (multiple rocket laucher) system acquired by our neighbours escapes me for the moment, but as far as I recall the max range for the rocket system is 90km, not 1000km. Even the Russian battlefield missiles of the FROG and SCUD series do not have a 1000km range. We may not take every one out in any first strike, but I do believe that with the small number in their possession and the multitude of countersystems we have, it will negate the effectiveness of this MRL.<br><br><strong>Will our fighter have time to destroy them ?<br>When I am in a superpuma flanked by fennec helicopter to heli insert to fight the enemy. And you hear the artillery shell wheezing by knowing that your block of flat is going to be destroyed. I know that I will be demoralised.<br><br>What is the plan to save my family, evacuate them to where and how ?? </strong><br><br>Well...lets just say thats been figured out long ago.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

In the 60s, they were full of passion for defending their young state. Years of peace and the complacency which followed resulted in the drop in standard. The younger generation now question the value of national security and defence.<br><br>The same thing is happening to S'pore.

Maybe we should have some form of screening or terminate contracts of those non-performing regulars that screwed up SAF n waste tax-payers money.

Special forces snipers could romp in a jungle for a really long period of time, creating havoc to the enemy's physchology. Just imagine that if you know there is a sniper out there in your backyard and you spent lots of time trying to hunt him down but failed. And the sniper keep taking your men down 1 at a time.... that's really demoralising.</div>

The SA-18 was released 3 years before the SA-16, and the SA-16 has better features like a 2-colour seeker that is less likely to be fooled by decoy flares.
