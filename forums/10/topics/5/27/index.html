Perhaps buying SA-16 would limit Singapore to just getting the missiles but no production licenses. I wonder if ST/DSO can acquire such IR/IIR seeker and rocket motor technologies from the Russians, and perhaps reverse engineer some retired AIM-9Js, perhpas with some perseverance and some kind assistance from the Israelis and Taiwanese, Singapore can build a local version of Python 3, AIM-9P4, MANPAD SAMs such as Mistral, etc.<br><br>Just a thought...</div>

It would also depend on the TO speed of the aircraft, if you have a ramp but ar too slow when you leave the ramp, you will still sink and pancake into the ground.<br><br>AoA is only a small factor of the takeoff process, it helps a little but not much. Same reason why the mainwheel of the A-4 and F-5 can be raised, and the F-8 Cyusaders wing is variable incidence, this increases the AoA and shortens the TO run a little(which is crucial for carrier ops for the A-4 and F-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, but not much. As for Vipers taking off from 400m, I need to question the source of this info. I believe it can do it, but in what kind of loading condition? Half empty tanks, no external stores?

            <div class='col-md body'>While I'm not as well read in Tank technology as compared to aircraft (so please forgive me if I say something stupid), I do believe that a laser warner is very useful. Firstly, it gives a tank advanced warning of any unwelcome interest on it by enemies, through detection of laser guidance beams and laser measuring systems. It's almost the direct tank equivalent of the plane's RWR. The tank, should it have advanced warnng of any incoming missiles, will have the oppurtunity to take evasive action. Most of the time, a tank is killed by a missile which is undetected by the crew.<br>Ok, I know you're going to say what you said, the smoke won't come up in time, rite? Actually, no. The Hellfire missile would usually be on a LOBL mode, and the laser would be on for the whole duration of the flight, from beginning to the end. The smoke grenades are specially designed to disperse very quickly and envelope the whole tank.<br>I dunno whether the PT-91s are equipped with any of the Russian tank reactive countermeasures systems. While I'm not too clear on their capabilities, some of them like the Shtora, Arena systems have no direct western equivalent, if I'm not wrong, and they should be treated with respect.</div>

I would presume that its possible to use this option and fire the missile BEFORE lock on and only lock onto target when its too late for countermeasures. same deal with todays PGMs, toss them b4 lock on an switch on lasers only when the bomb is in terminal phase.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, there is a LOAL mode for the Hellfire as well, I agree that could reduce the time for the tank to take evasive action. Perhaps the Spike, with its Imaging IR sensor, would be better in the sense that since its totally passive, the tank will probably have less warning of its arrival. I dont think the PT-91 has a missile approach warning system like the Shtora(or izzit Arena sys? I remember one of them has it), so we are still ok. However, the Spike is not totally invincible, as its IIR sensor which allows fire and forget operations can be spoofed by a tank using special infra-red emitting smoke which blurs the outline of the tank, thus confusing the IIR sensor of the Spike, and causing it to lose track. Thankfully, the Spike has a back-up optical guided mode, which allows for manual guidance to target by the operator, inlike the American Javelin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've said it before and I'll say it again. The region is unsuitable for tank warfare. Assuming numerous reports are correct in assuming SAF will fight its battles(not necessarily against Malaysia) in the peninsula.

Anything beyond light tanks is not suitable(The Japanese were spot-on in this respect during 1941-42).

The Vietname war is a good example of the use of extensive use of tanks in dense forest by both the US Army and the North Vietnamese Army.  As for using of tanks in built up area, we do see on a daily basis that Israeli do use their MBTs in both the Gaza strip and West Bank towns. They are not just good roadblocks but one that can easily put down some building harbouring snipers.  To send troopers to go into each building to flush out snipers will be costly.<br><br>Remember in saving private ryan, the snipers on top of the church bell tower were effectively taken out by the German tank round (1 single round do the trick). Tanks have their place in built up area... just need to know how to use them and wen to use them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I almost fully agree with Viper. Even the Malaysians required a tank not more than 50 tons, which was why they didn't go with the ~70 ton T-80 and T-84s, which were affordable for them, and much more capable than the PT-91s. Their highways weren't built to handle the weight, so deployability would be troublesome.<br>For Singapore, more light, extremely mobile platforms with long-range (min 4 to 5km) anti-tank striking power would be better. Thus the LSVs equipped with Spikes are a good choice for Singapore. However, tanks would still be needed, as there may come a time when the fight will 'merge', and you dont really want the LSVs to be anywhere within 2 to 3 km of the tanks, do ya? (oh ya, do the PT-91s have the capability to fire the AT-11 Sniper? THese things have a range of 5 km. Quite worrying, IMO. Luckily they have to be laser-guided all the way, and are not fire-and-forget like our Spikes, which allow us to shoot and hide.)<br>So I guess we have to get a 35~45 ton tank. One of you guys have said that Singapore is developing a tank based on the Bionix, armed with a 105mm cannon. Is that enuff, considering the ERA equipped armour of the PT-91? Also, with the PT-91's 125mm cannon and good fire-control system, our tank HAS to be able to take a reasonable amount of damage and continue functioning, otherwise they would just be target practice for the PT-91s.<br>So, could anyone give some good choices of tanks available on the market to suit Singapore's needs? The K1A1 was offered to the Malaysians, but it wasn't shortlisted. At 50 tons, based on M1A1 tech and specially designed to be able to cross even soft soil like those in paddy-fields (which are like those in S.Korea), its an Abrams-lite. It seems like a good idea, what say you guys?</div>

SAF will probably look at a 20+ to 30 tons tank with common chassis to the IFV or similar engines, automotive and parts.  My feeling say that they will build a 105mm light/medium tank.<br><br>As for if SAF should get a heavier tank to counter the M'sa MBT, the answer is maybe. It depends yet again on the battle doctrine and if SAF can fight alternative to counter the MBT (ie. ATGM, Helos, etc).  Personally I am in for a 1 to 1 replacement of the Centurions with a decent enough MBT in the less than 50 tons category. That rules out Abrams, Leo2, Leclerc, Challenger2, and Merkava. I think upgrade Leo1 or Stingray-type chassis are probably more suitable.<br><br>As for the armour, SAF can always go for the add-on reactive armour. As for the gun, using 105mm Amour Piercing Sabot rounds rather than HEAT will probably do the trick.<br>As for defensive aids, we can look at Israel for good tank defensive suite. They are usually pretty good at those stuff. SAF could get an Israeli equivalent of Shtora, Arena or Drozd if they do exist.<br><br>Just my 2 cents,<br>Joe Black<br><br></div>
