Bismark is one such individual who might be considered to have succeeded in this during his tenure as chancellor.<br><br>Of course, his humiliating defeat of France led to a legacy of Franco-German animosities which persisted until WW 2... Such is a lesson of history: that a victory today might sow the seeds of mutual destruction tomorrow.<br><br>And Tripwire,<br>I frankly find your perception of me as "lacking confidence" amusing. Being moderate is not the same as being a mouse. I do not want to go out of my way to ferment a confrontation. The point here is to swap views so what's the point of being bigoted?<br><br>As you put it, what Sg needs is based on the situation, not on a fixed formula, which is true. But wouldn't u be basing your judgement on a narrow formula by crying the W word every time patience gets tried?<br><br>There is much to gain from exploiting opportunities which others open for you, which is the true essence of Realpolitik.<br><br>Contrary to your definition of Realpolitik where the unbelievable is happening every minutes, Realpolitik in the Bismarkian context is about recognising tangible benefits through a consistent policy of balancing power in your favour.<br><br>The unbelievable doean't happen suddenly among State players for no reason. It is the job of the intelligence services to be 100% on top of it so that opportunities can be exploited or preperations can be made.<br><br>Our northern friend did not start hating us suddenly. They always have and they are having an election soon. Why do u think the reclaimation works were started years ago and not now? Because it is well known that they raise hell every time they have an election. I don't think its a coincidence.<br><br>We fight IF it ever comes to that. Otherwise, I prefer to lead them on wild geese chases and red herrings while we enagage in more meaningful pursuits and leave them high and dry. This is Realpolitik.</div>

We have no nukes, no strategic bombers, no WMD to ensure something like that, even if we wanted to. And thus to send in waves after waves of our soldiers to fight a politically blind war with no definite purpose is a horrible and unproductive solution.<br>Our economy will fall to ruin while we attempt to put down a possiblly hostile population, with no intention of submitting. Moreover, we'd lose all the moral high ground of acting in self defence if we over stay our assault. The Vietnamese were seen as 'peaceful intervenors' in 1979 in Cambodia, but then they, er, sort of like overstayed for 10 years! and they lost whatever moral mandate they started with (though i think that too was a glib lie) Further Vietnam became tied down in attritional guerilla warfare which drained their economy dry.<br><br>So i guess the only possible solution is a limited offensive aimed at carving out a huge hole in their country; then to fight a holding battle or in the worst case, a retrograde operation over a few weeks, to give time for the UN to act.<br><br>I do wistfully wish that yes, perhaps that we still lived in the lands of yore, where we as conquering hordes can sweep over the enemy's land and destroy evernthing that displeases us in our path, subjugate their populace and crush all resistance.

(The big stick frighten both Stalin and the Japanese Emperor into peace.) We should not appease but neither should we provoke. Hitler gain power because of the festering anger the German people have over their unfair treatment by the other major powers. Have we taken a good look at ourselves? We have people feeling unfairly treated by our northern neighbor. We produced a rapidly deployable army and air force  that a mobilized Germany in 1939 would have been proud. How do you think Malaysian feel?<br><br>&gt;As history has shown, we need a strong arm to deter them.

We are at the limit where we either hold current spending, raise taxes or go into deficit. What I do not want is Singapore being tricked like the USSR and spend itself to ruins due to its perpetual paranoid insecurity. There is never enough money you can spend to make you feel totally safe. However, there are a lot of things you can to make war less likely. Educate some of the less enlighten posters we have here whom has slam all Malaysian over the views of a very selected minority who wants to poison our water. Most Malaysian and Singaporean are honest friendly people. If we can get this message through , there will be less anger. With less anger, our South East Asian version of Hitler is far less likely to emerge. The road to the gas chambers for the Jews started with people saying hateful lies about them.FIGHT the lies by shining light on who said what and make them responsible. Rather then condemning all Malaysian. (it just works the opposite) . We need smart rebuke, just as much as we need smart bombs.<br><br>&gt;If you want an analogy, all these purchase of weapons can be viewed as a form of "Cold War" between these two nations. Each side would at least respect the capabilities of the other and would think twice before attempting to attack.

First by trying to be less cocky ourselves. Secondly, find out who said what and make them come to light.<br></div>

I tend to agree with you that some of the posting that you read here tends to reek of fire and gunpowder. I too is disappointed by the tone of such posting and worry about their impact. However the majority of us here do not want war with our neighbour. It will be a catastrophe and destroy our hope of peace and stability in the region. The dicussion we are having now is a hypothetical scenario building of how Singapore can defend itself. Central to our discussion is the assumption by many of us that we will never strike unless our survival is threatend.<br><br>Regarding the defense budget - there is a reason why we spend that much money on defence. There can be no discussion on social security when the sovereignity of your country is threatened. We do not live in a geopolitical neighbourhood that do not have any forseeable threat and instability. It makes you envy the New Zealanders - perharps they are just being naive.<br>I admire the nobleness of your call for mutual peace and understanding but sadly reality is harsh and cruel. The chinese have a saying ~ To maintain an army for a thousand days and use it as an instant ~ The future is uncertain and unsure. You might call upon us to look at Europe as an example where peaceful cooperation can reap prosperity but bear in mind that it took over 500 years since the rise of the nation states in Europe to reach the level at which they are now.<br>I am certain you are aware that Singapore cannot tolerate a defeat in war - zero sum game for us. The purpose of such huge investment is to reduce the chance of such happening.</div>

If most  Malaysian hate us so much (like poisoning our water) ?I here by announce that all Singaporean should start to  worry about eating in Johor, you might just be slowly being poison by hateful Malaysian without you knowing.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oh..... newspaper in malaysia only want sales... politicians only want votes... so... lets not take them seriously.... geez... how naive the malaysians must be... to be played up by their papers and politician.. maybe you should go over there and preach them the 'truth'!! tell the malaysian that the leaders are nothing more then liers and their country is being decieved!!<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Truth for your information is perceptive and relative... one man's truth is another man's lie... so wat if you knew the truth?? those malaysians will still clamour , fight and even die for their so call 'truth'!! in this world... everyone is fighting for truth... soldier on both opposing side believe that each is fight for a just cause.....<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And if malaysia starts to poison out water.... pray tell me... how are you gonna stop them?? preach?? for your information... there are many types of poison.. the slow acting ones...acts through cummulative effect that takes years to show effect... and the fast acting one... which kills instantly.... tell...me... are you sure your water dont contain any slow poison??<br><br>*** Totally agree on that point. Why do you think the USA nuked Japan? (The big stick frighten both Stalin and the Japanese Emperor into peace.) We should not appease but neither should we provoke. Hitler gain power because of the festering anger the German people have over their unfair treatment by the other major powers. Have we taken a good look at ourselves? We have people feeling unfairly treated by our northern neighbor. We produced a rapidly deployable army and air force  that a mobilized Germany in 1939 would have been proud. How do you think Malaysian feel?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hitler gains power not because of the unfair treatment of germans after WW1.... hitler gains power through mass media!! presenting himself as a saviour.... the key to galvanating your nation to war is by presenting asymmetrical information!!...  which is wat malaysia officials are currently doing.... !!! they present their views... but not singapore's view....<br><br>*** I am comfortable with the current spending we have. We are at the limit where we either hold current spending, raise taxes or go into deficit. What I do not want is Singapore being tricked like the USSR and spend itself to ruins due to its perpetual paranoid insecurity. There is never enough money you can spend to make you feel totally safe. However, there are a lot of things you can to make war less likely. Educate some of the less enlighten posters we have here whom has slam all Malaysian over the views of a very selected minority who wants to poison our water. Most Malaysian and Singaporean are honest friendly people. If we can get this message through , there will be less anger. With less anger, our South East Asian version of Hitler is far less likely to emerge. The road to the gas chambers for the Jews started with people saying hateful lies about them.FIGHT the lies by shining light on who said what and make them responsible. Rather then condemning all Malaysian. (it just works the opposite) . We need smart rebuke, just as much as we need smart bombs.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fight the lies with shining light!!... wwuuu..... you got the ears of all the malaysian har??  waaah,,,, talk so big.... you remind me of a pino who once said to me that phillipine is the light of democracy and freedom of SEA!! *puke*<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is said... that truth is a 3 edge sword.... it cuts both sides and itself...<br><br>*** Only works if you do not have a mad man  on the button. Anger generated by stupid flames only encourages more mad men to come out and support even  'madder' man.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is one tiny problem... the term MAD is relative as well... when hitler annex czechoslovakia... the word ... MAD never came into the mind of the germans or europeans... everyone think hitler outmanoveur chambalain brilliantly through brinkmanship!!! on the other man... many brits think that chambalain is MAD to cave in to hitler's demand!! but after the war... chambalain is considered WEAK for giving into hitler... who after the war is deemed MAD!! hahahaaaa.........<br><br>*** Yes....and we all should work towards that by not encourage these people. First by trying to be less cocky ourselves. Secondly, find out who said what and make them come to light.</div></blockquote>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you dream too much.... by your idealism... the whole fucking world can live in total peace without war.... but history has shown a different reality... one written in blood.... is it not said... beware of romans... bearing gifts??<br><br>[This message has been edited by tripwire (edited 01 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hitler WAS nuts... that has been proven. Congenital insanity due to both his parents being closely related and posthumous diagnosis of manic depression. He won when he let his generals do the fighting and when they bit off more than they could chew, he insisted on running the show himself and the matter steadily got worse.<br><br>Mahathir is one of the most moderate person Sg has to work with. He's opportunistic, Yes, but who isn't? So he plays the Sg card everytime he needs to win the elections... not a bad idea 'cos if he doesn't and PAS wins, its much worse for Sg.<br><br>Don't think in terms of definite enemies when assessing the region. Its a lot more ambiguous. Mahathir is the lesser of 2 evils now.<br><br>I wouldn't blame him for being opportunistic... I just won't like it when it translates to more expensive water. Lets not kid ourselves... its not about goodwill and neighbourliness, but business. Thats all it is.<br><br>All that crap about Sg going by the book and not being "sensitive"... its crap. They don't want flexibility. They want more attractive terms for their water. DuH... Its not a diplomatic crisis. Its business.<br><br>Mahathir's got a planned visit to the white house too... Bush wants to "cultivate" moderate Islamic leaders.<br><br>That tells us both about Mahathir's opportunism and his commitment to a moderate form of government 'cos it suits the best interest of his party and their perceived best interest of the country.<br><br>I wouldn't worry about a war just yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Some thoughts on reservist (operationally ready national service if you like) training, the SAF, war and peace.<br><br>I don't like the SAF as an organisation (in fact, i quite detest it) because i have had some very bad experiences whilst under its power, and so I don't like having to go for my annual ICT. But after thinking about it, i have come to the conclusion that although i don't like the SAF, i should take my training seriously. If it has to be done, then i should do it properly and not go into reservist boh-chap mode.<br><br>I am not a propaganda writer for the SAF or the PAP, this is just my honest opinion.<br><br>Singapore's defence policy rests on a number of basic strategies: total defence, diplomacy, and deterrance. The deterrance bit is the part that the SAF is responsible for. In order to deter potential adversaries from going to war against Singapore, we need to show that have a credible war machine. We sometimes think that we can bo-chap during reservist time, and that in the event of war breaking out we will then be on the ball because Singapore's defence will then be at stake. However, what we should be trying to defend against is not so much some potential outside enemy, but war itself. And what we should be defending should not be limited to Singapore, but rather peace for all mankind, including other countries. And so it is actually the peace-time training that is more crucial for defence. When we are doing our reservist training, we are actively defending Singapore and keeping the peace at that point in time. If a war ever starts, then in a sense we have failed in our defence of Singapore and in our defence of peace.<br><br>If war is the enemy, then we also have to take precautions that we do not contribute towards starting one ourselves. Armed forces can be used as a deterrant, but they can also be used for aggression. They can also be used as political tools, to put pressure on others by acting as an implied threat. And although they can act as a deterrant, they can also be perceived as a threat which needs to be attacked and eliminated. If we want to defend against war, then we need to find some kind of balance. Armed forces should not be used as a tool for applying political pressure. They should not adopt an aggressive or threatening stance towards others. Buying too many offensive weapons will only encourage an arms race. If the SAF becomes too powerful relative to the armed forces of other countries, Singapore's politicians may find it more easy to start a war in a moment of folly, or to start a war under lesser provocation than would otherwise be necessary to induce them to start one. Thereofre i view the recent announcements that the Malaysian are buying more modern arms with mixed feelings. Those arms can be seen as a potential threat to Singapore, but on the other hand, they may help maintain the regional balance of threats and help make it less likely that Singapore will start a war.</div>

(I suspect RSN will not be that "crazy" to go for it anyway).  Having 2 means that when 1 is in the dock (naval base) for resupply or change crews, the other is out there on active duties.  When the things get a little hot and we can always have 1 in the Malacca Straits and 1 in the South China Sea or just at the North East tip of SIngapore Straits..<br><br>Putting things into perspective... there is no chance that RSN will purchase the DD51 destroyer.  However, RSN can purchase a less ambitious ship like the German Meko 200 or Spanish F100 AAW frigates carrying AEGIS like 3D phased array radar and Standard 2 SAM. But then again, it is also quite unlikely</div>

We cannot kill our economy by making sudden military call ups everytime someone up north says something threatening.  Our men must be able to focus on the economy, work in peace, but able to heed the call to arms at lightning pace.  Every false alarm that we call them up for, hurts them, and hurts Singapore.<br><br>In anycase, if both Singapore and Malaysia can see "War" as the mutual enemy, instead of each other, we wouldn't have to be here discussing this.</div>

First of all, hitler's remains were never totally ascertain to be him.  Which means, whoever who did the posthumous diagnosis of him, (quite remarkably.) may not be diagnosing the right man.<br></div></blockquote>How the F did you expect anyone to diagnose a mental disorder through physical remains!<br><br>Of course that was not how it was done! It was done through a systematic investigation of his geneology and the medical records of his relatives (his mother suffered from similar symptoms), interview of people who knew him (and survived the Nuremburg war trials) and recordings of his speeches (he wrote his own speeches and often spoke impromptu) as well as through surviving medical records of Hitler himself. His private physician prescribed Hitler some really funky stuff during his lifetime...<br><br>Now  I know that such findings are not always 100% accurate considering that he was dead by the time people got around to doing this and the testimonies of others might not always be objective but despite all this, they were remarkably consistent so these findings were generally well accepted in academic circles.<br></div>
