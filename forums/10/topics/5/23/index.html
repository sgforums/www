By the way, what is the SPS3000? seemed to heard it somewhere though......<br><br>New info: From channel newsasia, Iraqi may be the next target in U.S's scope but from u.S sources, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia may also become their next target.<br><br>if his is true, U.S is sure to use Singapore as a strategic command base to deploy its forces. Their ships anchored here before and their airplanes often come to paya lebar Air Base. The terrorist may try to bomb the U.S facilities in our land. In return, Singapore may kana for no reason. This is bad man, coz i hate terrorists. they are simply cunning, sly and Ham Ji(no balls) people who can attack anytime, anywhere. I sure won't want to see things explode in the midle of the night when i'm dreaming of my girl.<br>I sure hope that Singapore would get involved in the fight against terrorism militarily but sure don't want any fight within our country.<br></div>

In the newspaper, it is written that Singapore purchased 200 AIM120C AMRAAM missile from the United States but it is to be stored in the U.S. In the open house, when i asked one of the technicians if Singapore had start training with the AMRAAM, he said that Singapore don't possess the AMRAAM.

Singapore very strong economically, but not really so military to sustain a long war. We r only like a poison sting. Pple attack us, can win, but will lose much much more things.<br><br>But terrorists may still attack us, cuz we r a staunch ally of the US. We offer them a lot of support, including our facilities.

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia is indeed evaluating the T-90s, but from what's reported, no decision was made yet. However, they are known to have ordered the " Metis-2 anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW)systems from Russia.<br><br>There are few articles which describe Malaysia's interest in T-90s &amp; other weapons. The first 2 articles below are from the New Straits Times (Malaysia's English newspaper). The 3rd one is from an August edition of Jane's Defence Weekly. Not sure if u all like to read articles, but it's a best way to clarified rumours.<br><br>=======================<br>The New Straits Times - "Latest Russian military marvels on parade" (Dated 9th October 2001):<br><br>RUSSIA, which has already supplied some modern hardware to the Malaysian armed forces, is confident of securing additional contracts and increasing co-operation in maintenance and spare parts production through joint ventures.<br><br>Andrey Beliyaninov, the director-general of Rosoboronexport State Corporation - the corporation representing Russian defence companies, said 30 Russian companies that produce over 300 prodcuts are participating in Lima '01.<br><br>"We view participation in Lima as an important step in strengthening the Russian-Malaysian co-operation in the defence and technology sphere."<br><br>Co-operation between the two countries began in 1994 when Malaysia signed a contract to purchase the MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter aircraft and related equipment.<br><br>"Today, all provisions of the contract have been successfully implemented and Malaysian pilots have appreciated the high performance and quality of the Russian MiG fighters," he said. The purchase also resulted in the setting up of a joint venture company here in 1995 to maintain and upgrade the Malaysian MiG-29N.<br><br>The initial collaboration also resulted in the signing of an Inter- governmental Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation in defence, defence technologies and defence industry in April 1999. "The MoU, which resulted in the setting up of an inter- governmental joint commission, is a milestone for military-technical co-operation between two countries.<br><br>"This year, Malaysia also signed a contract to purchase the Metis ATGM (anti-tank guided missile) systems, which is superior by far to many similar foreign systems."<br><br>Beliyaninov said Russia is ready to not only to supply the system to the Malaysian armed forces, but also to organise its joint or licensed production. "We would like the successful experience of our co-operation to become the basis for selection of the main battle tank for the Malaysian armed forces."<br>The T-90S tank passed technical test and trials in Malaysia last year.<br><br>Beliyaninov said one promising area of co-operation was in upgrading of air force equipment. He said a Malaysian team gave high evaluation of the Russian Su- 30MK Flanker fighter aircraft during a demonstration flight at the MAKS2001 International Aerospace Salon last August near Moscow. "We hope that such high evaluation of the Russian multi-purpose fighter will be another point in its favour. It should be pointed out that the supply of aircraft can be made under the same terms as those of MiG-29 ... the sales may be accompanied by partial counter purchases and we are offering a wide range of offset programmes."<br><br>He said Rosoboronexport was also ready to upgrade Malaysia's MiG-29N into multi-mode fighters that will enable them to use a whole range of the weapon systems, including precision weaponry, around the clock.<br>"This will allow the fighters to carry out the whole spectrum of missions to destroy the air and ground targets irrespective of the time of the day and weather conditions.<br>"We have a lot to offer our partners for the navy - our Mangust, Mirage, Merkury and Yastreb Russian patrol boats, Svetlyak guard boat, Molniya missile boat, Chilim, Rys, Irbis, Murena and Zubr hovercraft, Projects 636, Amur 950 and Amur 1650 submarines are known worldwide."<br><br>He said Rosoboronexport exports policy was not just to sell state- of- the-art and reliable weapons, but also ensuring their long-term and effective operation.<br>"To this end, we are ready to perform complex deliveries of the weapon systems, warranty and post-warranty servicing, extension of the service life and enhancing their combat capabilities by upgrade programs."<br><br>"I am quite confident that the Russian-Malaysian co-operation, including co-operation in the military-technical field, has promising future," he concluded.<br>Caption: Much sought after fighter ...

One of Russia's patrol boats which Malaysia will find useful in patroling its exclusive economic zone.<br><br>========================================<br>The New Straits Times - "Defence chief: No decision on anti-tank missiles yet" (Dated 7th October 2001):<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The Malaysian Armed Forces is still studying a number of offers to supply it with anti-tank missile systems, its chief Jen Tan Sri Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin said today. He said no decision has been made.<br><br>"We have not signed any agreement ... we are still looking into offers received including from the United States, France, United Kingdom and Germany," he said after hosting breakfast for armed forces widows and children at his official residence today.<br>Zahidi was commenting on a foreign report yesterday quoting a spokesman for Russia's arms trader Rosoboronexport as saying that Russia will export its anti-tank missile systems to Malaysia under the terms of a recent deal.<br><br>The report also said Russia was expected to launch a joint or licensed production in the country. It also said that last year, Malaysia held field tests for Russia's state-of-the-art T-90S battle tank.<br><br>Zahidi said the purchase of anti-tank missile systems was in the Eighth Malaysia Plan as part of the process of modernising the armed forces.<br><br>On another development, he said the Armed Forces would be installing more effective security equipment to guard Wisma Pertahanan which houses the Defence Ministry. He said the Army did not want to take any chances.<br>==========================================<br><br>Jane's Defence Weekly - "Malaysia orders Russian anti-tank missiles" (from one of the August 2001 edition):<br><br>Malaysia has placed an order for an undisclosed quantity of Metis-2 anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW) systems following a regular meeting of the joint Russian-Malaysian inter-governmental commission on economic co-operation, according to Jane's Defence Weekly sources in Moscow.<br><br>The Metis-2 is the latest version of the system that was originally developed to meet the requirements of the Soviet Army by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. The first version, which entered service in 1979, was the 9K115 Metis (NATO: AT-7 'Saxhorn') with the 9M115 missile which had a maximum range of 1,000m and was fitted with a single high -explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead.<br><br>This was followed by the 9K115-2 Metis-2, which has the 9M131 missile with an increased range of 1,500m and an option to fit two different types of warhead. The first option is for a tandem HEAT warhead to defeat targets fitted with explosive reactive armour; the second option enables the missile to be fitted with a thermobaric (or fuel air explosive) type warhead. A clip-on thermal sight is also available.<br><br>The lightweight Metis system, which can be launched from a tripod or from within a confined area, seems well-suited to the Malaysian Army. One person can carry the launcher and one missile with another person carrying additional missiles. A number of Western contractors are also understood to have been bidding for this contract, which is the latest in a growing number of defence deals between Malaysia and Russia. The largest contract to date is the 1996 purchase of 18 MiG-29 ('Fulcrum') fighter aircraft and their associated air-to-air missiles. Russian sources also said Malaysia is interested in acquiring manportable surface-to-air missiles, T-90S main battle tanks, BMP series infantry combat vehicles and BTR-70 series 8 x 8 armoured personnel carriers.<br><br>Malaysia does not operate MBTs and has a longstanding initial requirement for 78 systems for which the T-90 is one of several contenders. The T-90S was shown in Malaysia last year but the 125mm smoothbore gun was not fired because of range limitations. It is expected that a Malaysian delegation will now attend demonstrations in Russia.<br><br></div>

Which means that the HUD is replaced by a screen. In Israelli and USAF F16D, they don't have that screen there. That may be the GPS system. 70% possiblity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia really on buying spree lately.... 1 anti-tank system, considering replacements for jets, considering attack heli's, just made purchase of Fennecs, considering T-90S, considering Naval boats.... wah, where they get so much money....<br>I kind of agree with what Trip said about the missile on the T-90S. Even with a range of 4km, it would not be possible to be utilised at that range. Furthermore, US gave up installing missiles on its tanks because they were not as fast as their Main guns. Taking 11.3 secs to reach its max range is kinda long.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not only is it kinda long, it requires the tank to focus on 1 target until its destroyed.<br><br>About the T-90S, it has really one of the most advanced Defensive suite compensating its poor armor.<br><br>Individual tank defense is multilayered.<br>1st Layer, Radar warning recievers and Laser Warning recievers.<br>2nd Layer, Laser reflectors, and Chaff.<br>3rd Layer, Reactiver armor package.<br>4th Layer, The actual hull of the tank.<br><br>As you can see, the bulk of the tank's defense is concentrated against missiles.  Looks like the Malaysians really appreciate our Apache Ds.<br><br>However, I still doubt the T-90S's armor itself.  Unless the Russians have designed their own version of the Chobham Armor Package.  The lack of this armor, makes a tank very vulnerable against APFSDS rounds.<br><br>I guess the T-90S is as it comes to being the best tank in the region.  Unless the US decides to sell us some M1A2, (NOT THE EXPORT ARMOR PACKAGE VERSION), or the Challenger 2 from the UK. Both tanks employ the same proven chobham armor, that almost renders the tank invulnerable from the frontal arc.<br><br>If both are not an option, then I guess we have to turn to the Israelis for Merkavas or Sabras.</div>
