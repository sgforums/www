            <div class='col-md body'>Just saw an article I thought those of us interested in the recent MBT development will be interested to know:<br>------------------------------------------<br>United Defense, with subcontractors BAE Systems and TRW, has demonstrated the first simultaneous defeat of two live threats by the Integrated Army Active Protection System (IAAPS) on a US combat vehicle, under a US Army Survivability Technology Integration Programme contract.<br><br>The integrated suite has successfully conducted multiple demonstrations of end-to-end system performance, including: detection, classification, and selection of the appropriate countermeasure; tracking and computation of the fire control solution; and defeat by electronic warfare soft kill or active protection hard kill.<br><br>The suite has successfully demonstrated defeat of two live threats fired at a single vehicle at the same time without the use of armour as the primary means of defeat. The next phase in demonstrating IAAPS capabilities involves defeating incoming threats while on the move.<br><br>"The successful intercept of two incoming, simultaneous threats has never been achieved previously on a US ground combat vehicle," said Val Horvatich, General Manager of United Defense's Advanced Development Centre. "The ability to actively protect ground combat systems from hostile threats using systems other than armour is key enabling technology for the Army's Future Combat Systems."<br><br>The Integrated Army Active Protection System (IAAPS) is currently integrated on a ground combat vehicle and is undergoing testing. The suite includes two types of passive sensors, electronic warfare soft kill countermeasures, and an active protection hard kill system composed of launcher, radar and a deployed countermeasure.<br><br>The IAAPS program, which is an Army Science and Technology Objective, has successfully demonstrated an integrated survivability system on a ground combat vehicle, which is designed to increase vehicle survivability while allowing for a decrease in armour and, therefore, vehicle weight.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://defence-data.com/current/page14669.htm" rel="nofollow">http://defence-data.com/current/page14669.htm</a><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>It seems like the Americans are trying to do the catching up in terms of active self defense system for MBTs. Like the Russians and Swedish, if their systems work as specified, SAF could perhaps buy into such technology for locally made or modified light weight MBTs to counter Malaysian's T91 MBTs.<br></div>

It'll take extensive changes to change a Viper engine from the PW to GE and vice versa, as engine configuration(GE or PW) is decided in the manufacturing stage. For one thing, the inlet will have to be replaced, along with the exhaust nozzles. Wiriing and fittings would also have to be changed. The engine bay is common, but there will be extensive refitting(not to mention downtime) to re-engine the bird. However, to upgrade the engine, say from a Block 30s GE to a Block 50 GE engine would be simpler<br><br>I've had a friend pose a question to his contact, under the Peace Carvin contract, the US will not be liable for the loss of any RSAF Vipers in the US or Singapore, be it through pilot error(USAF or RSAF), maintenance error or mechanical problem.<br><br>The USAF pilot was a Major. Under the Peace Carvin agreement, USAF pilots are allowed to use our aircraft for training purposes. The RSAF squadrons there are mixed USAF/RSAF crewed, the last time I checked the CO of one of the squadrons was a Yank and his deputy from the RSAF. So its not unusual to have one of theirs on our bird.</div>

We get CAVU flying weather practically all year round. We train with combat proven pilots on combat proven platforms using combat proven tactics from various air forces all the time over there. We train with systems that the USAF loans to us long before the systems we ordered are due to be delivered to us so we'll be at least profiecient in their use when we take delivery of them. Sounds like a good enough deal to me no matter how I look at it    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Not getting a free replacement is a standard deal. RSAF lost Hunters while training in UK in 70s, 2 of our SF.260s were written off in Italy prior to delivery. While I do not know the cause of these crashes, I think its quite certain we did not receive free replacements.<br><br>Hang on, I never said the USAF Major is getting off the hook. I just repeated what I've been told, the Peace Carvin agreement states there will be no replacement aircraft given to the RSAF regardless of whether the faults was RSAF or USAF crew, maintenance fault or LM's f***up. Sounds reasonable enough to me.<br><br>As the report posted above clearly states, a full investigation is underway, and if the USAF Major is indeed found out to have fouled up big time, good luck to him. In the meantime, lets not hang him or anybody else shall we?<br><br>Anyway, do remember that there have been turbine blade problems with quite a few series of the F100, including the -220 model used by our Block 52s. S Korea has lost a few already, and while it would be unfair to say that its only a matter of time for ours, its not exactly an unprecedented incident.<br><br>Like Tripwire said, hopefully we'll get a replacement, and maybe 12 more to make the contract worthwhile through economies of scale. Heck, any replacement would probably be a Block 52+, losing a 52 and getting a 52+ for replacement, along with 12 more is not such a bad thing is it?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>USAF news report on the crash <a href="http://www.af.mil/news/May2002/n20020530_0872.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.af.mil/news/May2002/n20020530_0872.shtml</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 01 June 2002).]</div>

(though I find the simulated scenarios provided by the author highly simplified) It might provide an interesting read for you guys. Heres the link : <a href="http://www.ic.ucsc.edu/~poli163/CHANG.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ic.ucsc.edu/~poli163/CHANG.html</a><br><br>There is also an interesting part which caught my eye in the article, a paragraph which said:"The most serious aircraft maintenance problem is often the engine. Engine wear is caused by prolonged exposure to the high temperatures created by flying at high velocities or for extended periods of time. Of no minor concern to Chinese air forces, "the PLAAF's fighter engines [such as the Chengdu WP7B (BM), Liyang WP13A II, and Klimov RD-93! require a major overhaul after 300 to 350 hours [of flying time], a second overhaul after an additional 200 to 250 hours, and a third after an additional 150 hours. After that, the engines are scrapped."(20) (Not surprisingly, these overhaul rates are comparable to those for other Soviet-designed engines in Warsaw Pact air forces during the cold war.) These rates are far greater than even those of the complex F100-PW-220 and F100-PW-229 engines that power Singapore's F-16s, which have been criticized for requiring substantial overhaul every 1300 hours.(21)"<br>Does anybody know why didn't we choose GE engines? If I remember, the -129s provided as much thrust as the -PW-229.<br><br></div>

Its absolute hogwash. Firstly, Singapore will never fight for someone elses interest, look at the Singaporean whiners on this and other forums and you'll know why. They refuse to even fight for their own country's interests, how will they fight for others? Besides, if the Spratlys dispute are to degenerate into military action, it will involve a lot more countries than Malaysia vs China, most of which have pretty close ties to Singapore.
