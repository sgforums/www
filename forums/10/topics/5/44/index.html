            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Viking1:<br>Hello there,<br><br>I think Singapore should select the Rafale Mk2 from Dassault.<br></blockquote>Well, Viking1, there are a few of us who reckon RSAF is better of getting Rafale F2/F3 too.  RKoAF recently had the fighter competition and Rafale came in top, the only real sad thing is that due to political issues, RKoAF chose the F-15K instead.<br><br><blockquote><br>- F-18E/F has very good avionics and radar, but it is beaten by Rafale and Typhoon in raw aerodynamic performance. You may like to know that F-18C/D did ACM dogfight with CDG Rafales during Afghanistan operations and the Hornet was apparently dominated.<br></blockquote>In terms of avionics - purely on the radar performance, I think the Superbugs kick asses. Not only the AESA radar APG-79 have greater Air-to-Air modes and range compared to the current Rafale radar and the ECR-90, but also it has greater number of Air-to-surface modes, notably the Syntactic Aperture and Terrain Following modes.  However, as you have pointed out, in terms of raw aerodynamics performance, the superbugs lose out to the euro-canards (with the exception of Gripen) by quite a fair bit.<br><br>However, if RSAF want a air supermacy fighter and BVR engagement is the prime mission, then getting Typhoons and Superbugs make senses (once again provided US is willing to release the AMRAAMs) or RSAF will have to wait for the Meteors. I am impressed by how many AMRAAMs the superbugs can carry. I have seen a AAM config with 10 to 12 AAMs.  The Super bugs does lose out in stealth though because they lack an IRST like that of Rafale and Typhoon. The radar signature will betray the Superbugs' positions albeit they out range most fighters' radars range.<br><br><blockquote><br>No BVR engagements have been performed because the US and the French do not want to reveal the firing parameters of the latest C-5 AMRAAM and MICA.<br></blockquote>I won't be surprised. I suspect the current C-5 version may outrange the Micas, but Micas are almost certain to outrange the As and Bs version, maybe the pre-C5 versions too. The only thingy that is different from the C and B versions as I understand is that C version has the folding fins so that 6 can be installed inside the Raptors weapon bay instead of 4 in the As and Bs.<br><br><blockquote><br>And of course the very fact that Malaysia is getting F-18E should de facto rule out this option for Singapore IMHO.<br></blockquote>Why? It is ok to have the Super bugs even if RMAF have a few of them. Afterall, the worst case scenarios is the RSAF superbug face an RMAF superbug. In terms of performance, they will be equivalent, then it really comes down to the pilot skills and overall C3I over the sky. Given RSAF's investment in AEW platforms and various datalink technologies, I favour RSAF's survivbility.  Of course, RMAF may only be able to fund an E version with the same APG-72(?)/75(? forgot which number) radar whereas RSAF version may get the AESA version.<br><br><blockquote><br>- Typhoon is great and yes it does reach IOC at the same time as Rafale for the French Air Force but there is a big difference in a sense that 2005 Rafale for the French Air Force are F2 variant with considerable a2g capability (all kinds of PGM, including GPS-guided AASM, SCALP cruise missile...). 2005 Typhoon is strictly air-to-air... Rafale will also have the nice OSF and I believe Typhoon will feature the PIRATE IRST.<br></blockquote>I think Rafale has already reach IOC with the French AF, and the French Navy is not far behind.  Typhoon... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> hee hee... we all know that they have a few more years to go.<br><br>Rafales have been, from the onset, to be a multirole. Typhoon on the other hand has always been designed first as an air superiorty fighter (to replace the German F-4F, GB's F2 Tornadoes, Italian's StarFighters/F2, Spainish's F-4s). The French wanted a true multirole and that was partly the reason why they left the EFA project.<br><br>I see the only real hinderance for greater French sales is that Rafales are currently only integrated with French weapons but not standard NATO ones even when they are cleared to carry them. I think if Dassault Aviation makes some effect in integrating NATO weapons as a standard export version, then I'm confident the sales will come. Furthermore, I think its time the French get their HMS integrated ASAP.  Furthermore, the French can also do the naughty trick of getting in bed with the Israeli Rafael and integrate their Python 4s and Derbys with the Rafales.<br><br><blockquote><br>IMHO Singapore should get some Rafale Mk2 with the RBE2+active antenna (very comparable to APG-79) and the uprated M88-3C. The increased thrust does not very much increase the dogfighting performances according to simulations but it will definitely increase the climb rate and for a country which does not have a E-3 it may be of some use to be able to scramble its fighters in case of a late detected intrusion in the Singapore airspace.<br><br>For the missiles, Singapore should get a mix of MICA EM and MICA IR. Forget about Magic 2, use the MICA IR for short range (mounted on the wing tips). When Meteor becomes available, get them if your neighbour gets AMRAAM or R-77 in good qty.<br><br></blockquote>I am confident that RSAF would probably ask for the F3 variant with the nice RBE2+ active phased array radar and the uprated M88-3 engines; and most probably Micas.  If the French can't deliever this in the 2005 to 2007 timeframe, I am pretty sure a "free" upgrade clause will be in somewhere in the contract.  If we are "lucky" we might even see the Rafales carrying Python 4 with an Israeli made HMS (DASH-3 or JHMS).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Joe Black,<br><br>A few comments on your input...<br><br>- The Rafale that is proposed to Singapore is called the Mk2, and it does include the AESA variant of the RBE2. So "Active RBE2" and APG-79 share the same technology and both have been built as multirole radars, i.e not necessary with a huge range in a2a (but still quite respectable) but with a lot of modes. I don't think APG-79 has more modes than the active RBE2, and if you look at the size of the two system (very compact), they probably have the same power output. Both use the same first generation of T/R modules. "Active RBE2" will have 1,000 modules, not sure about APG-79.<br><br>- Warload for a2a: Rafale can also carry 12 MICA (this configuration was proposed during the Korean tender).<br><br>- AMRAAM outranges the MICA by a little bit (confirmed to me by a MBDA guy during the Singapore Aerospace show).<br><br>- I still think it is a problem for Singapore to get the SH if Malaysia also gets that aircraft. Even if you count on Singapore alledged superiority in training, you will still be flying an aircraft that has no secret to your adversary. For example, Malaysia could easily learn how to fine-tune its SAM to maximise kill probability against a SH.<br><br>- Rafale has not reached IOC within the French Air Force, only in the Navy and only 8 planes in F1 variant (strictly air-to-air) onboard CDG. The Air Force will get its first squadron operational by late 2005. And again, these will be F2 Rafales, with a2g modes. By the way, just to illustrate this, the first quadron to get the Rafale will be the 11th squadron which currently flies... the Jaguar. So you can see that ground strike will be a primary mission for the first Rafale in the French Air Force.<br><br>- You are right that Typhoon was designed as an interceptor first, and was then assigned a2g mission during its development. The consequence of this... the Typhoon put on weigh... 1 ton extra ! Don't trust websites that talk about an empty weigh of 10t for the Typhoon, this is only for the first prototypes. Production aircrafts will be in the 11t range. The main reason is that the Engineers had to strenghten the airframe, especially the wing which is very thin. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to badmouth the Typhoon, I think it's a great performer actually.<br><br>- About NATO ordinance for the Rafale...yes you are right that it's a problem for some potential customers, even thought the French have or are developping a pretty complete range of PGM/missiles (SCALP, Apache, AASM, LGB...). Rafale still lacks a SEAD missile though. As for the HMS, it will be ready at the same time as the Typhoon's. (around 200<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. The issue is not so much on the capability side than on the cost side: French missiles are expensive.<br><br>- Lastly, there is no problem for the timeframe, by 2006 the French can deliver RBE2 active, M88-3 and MICA IR. RBE2 active already exists and is in test (not flying though). M88-3 has actually been running for more than a year, but again not integrated into the airframe. As for MICA IR, they just entered service in the French AF this year on their Mirage2000-5, 3 years after getting their first MICA EM. OSF will be ready for the first French squadron aircrafts, and it's a very nice kit.<br><br>Take care,<br><br>Viking1<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi viking1,<br><br>firstly, welcome to the discussion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Firstly, regarding to AMRAAM vs MICA range. I have already posted something in regards to this a couple of pages back i think. Raytheon has quoted the maximum range for the AMRAAM(the range when its motor stops burning), but at that range(in fact beyond 30km) its hit rate is very poor, esp against hard manoeuvring targets, the Dutch took 3 AMRAAMs to down the Serbian MiG-29 in 1999. The quoted range for the MICA however is the range whereby it can hit an agile target with high accuracy. Therein lies the difference...<br><br>As for weapons integration, US Mk.80 series Paveway series LGBs have already been sucessfully carried and dropped on targets by the Rafale. Obviouslly things like Apache/SCALP are also integrated. Ditto for MICA. Most European weapons systems are handled under the EADS umbrella, and France has a big say in EADS, and of course owns MBDA which builds lots of stores. So export/integration will unlikely be an issue. As for american weapons, yes its true that Rafale has not been integrated for stuff like JSOW, JDAM and the like, but then we'll also have to consider if the Americans will sell us those weapons even if Rafale is integrated. My case has always been: Go for the equipment thats at least the equal of, if not better than American ones.<br></div>

The "quoted" range for a C-5 version could be around 70km. But as you have said, at these extreme range, the Amraams might not have the energy to hit anything other than a straight flying large target, just like a Phoenix flying to 200 Km to hit a target.

            <div class='col-md body'>So far, Singapore govt. doesn't seem to have the habit of buying brand new products, such as the Typhoon.  The F-16 for example, was already a proven and widely acknowledged fighter when Singapore decided to order them.  So far, among the shortlisted fighters, only the F-15E, F-16 Block60, Rafale, F/A-18E/Fs have been flown in combat sorties.  The New F-16 of course, has not actually been flown in any sorties, but its predecessors has, so I am quite reluctant to include it into the "more likely" list.  And only 3 of the above 4, are in active service.<br><br>The F-15E is a proven mudhen.  No contest over that fact.<br><br>The Superhornets are not so proven yet.  Moreover,  I doubt that Singapore would buy Superbugs cos Malaysia's already gettin them.  Its not a matter of pride, technological secrets or anything.  Just that, if action gets close, pilots will have to look out for the Markings on the wing before he pumps lead into the target.<br><br>Rafale, same as Superhornet, hasn't really won its spurs yet though.  But still a likely candidate.<br><br>Su-30s are in active service with the Indian Air force if I'm not wrong.  We'll probably get feedback from them.  Perhaps our President might have some relatives there.  Note, the Su-30MK is an EXPORT model.<br><br>The only problem with the Typhoon, i feel, is that its too new.</div>

It still has not won the respect the F-16 and F-15 already has.

            <div class='col-md body'>Orcishwarrior, I think you've misunderstood the point of our argument against the Typhoon.<br><br>The Typhoon is  very capable aircraft. No doubts about that. On paper, everything in its specs would make it almost Rafales equal, or even surpass it slightly. However here's where the problems start stacking up against Typhoon for Singapore.<br><br>1)<br>Everythings on paper. The program has faced numerous delays and problems, brought about in part by having to sort out the kinks in the working relationships between the partners. Almost every aspect of the scheduling so far has been pushed back, again and again. The latest high profile delay is German delays over the Typhoons main armament, the Meteor BVRAAM. The CFT program only exists on paper(pretty much like everything else). The multirole version is still a few years off. Compare this to the Rafale development. It is in squadron service, has already undertaken combat missions over Afghanistan, the CFT program is on track with aircraft having already flown with CFTs, the multirole versions are ready for production once the French frees up the funding<br><br>2) Weapons<br>Both Rafale and Typhoon are scheduled to receive the Meteor BVRAAM. But its only scheduled to arrive in the later part of this decade(even before the Germans started their old tricks again). So whats in the interim? The American AMRAAM for Typhoon and the French MICA for Rafale. Both radar versions of the missiles are rough equivalents of each other, little to choose between each other. Which is fine and good if you're an EU/NATO operator of the Typhoon. But, as has already been demonstrated in the Korean F-X program, the US will not allow integration of AMRAAM to countries which buy non-US products, effectively relegating non-NATO/EU users of Typhoon to Skyflash and Sparrows until Meteor is ready, which are only semi-active radar homing, and at least a full generation behind AMRAAM/MICA. Of course MICA will have no such export restrictions to the Rafale.<br><br>3) Timetable.<br>Eurofighters order book is 600+ machines. Rafales is 200+/300. While some have taken this to mean that the Rafale is an export failure, things must be put into perspective. All except 12 Typhoons for Austria will go the the development countries. And export order of 12 units hardly makes Typhoon a roaring export success. Where the advantage of Rafale is that if Singapore does order it, we will be assured of receiving our aircraft according to OUR timetable, and not having to wait till other countries who've ordered earlier receive theirs before we get ours.<br><br>4) Training<br>Singapore has a training detachment set up already in France. A training detachment for Rafales in France will also make things simpler in terms to logistics, and theres no need to set up a new detachment in another country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Totally agree with Viper here. Rafale currently presents the best choice in terms of capabilities and value for money. If the French can assist DSTA/DSO to integrate some current NATO weapons with the Rafales, then it is hard to see any other options beating Rafales.<br><br>The Americans can always do the naughty thing to entice RSAF to getting either the Super Bugs or Strike Eagles by clearing delievery of AMRAAM straight away and perhaps throw some sweeteners like SLAM and AGM-142,  JDAM etc. Who knows, perhaps they even allow Singapore to be the first Asia pacific country to purchase AIM-9X with the JHMCS?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I think the F-16 Block 60 will be the dark horse. Still, my preference goes as follow:<br>1. Rafale F3<br>2. Typhoon Trenche 2/3<br>3. F-18 E/F Super Hornets<br>4. F-15 Variant<br>6. F-16 Block 60<br>7. Su-30 MK? variant with Western avionics and integrated with NATO weapons including AMRAAM. Getting AMRAAMski won't be that bad though.<br><br>I personally don't think RSAF should be too much distracted from the top 3 selection. If they are to get the Super bugs, then I think they will have to demand the AESA radar as a precondition, as well as the JHMCS and Amraam, integration with AGM-142/Popeye or Slammer for stand-off strikes, and perhaps ARM-88 Harm as well.<br></div>

Politically and militarily, China is not compatible with Sg. There is no direct threat to Sg from China but neither any political benefits. If Sg is under foreign attack, guess who would come to our rescue? China or the US? It most likely be US, Australia and Britan.<br><br>Yes, most of us are yellow in color and we do have a closer enthic and blood relationship with the Chinese, but do remember this, the Chinese govt did not blink an eye when they rolled their tank in Tian an meng square, why would one think they care about Singapore at all.<br><br>A domocratic chinese govt might be different, but for the time being, we know that the communist govt doesn't care less if it has to sacrifices 100 million or more population (on its side alone, btw, statistically, it doesn't even mean much to its 1.5 billion population) just to take over Taiwan. For now, I will say, less make friends with them but never be close. I would rather have US as my friend.</div>
