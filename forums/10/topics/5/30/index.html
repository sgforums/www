However, the junke vegetation in SEA would reduce the NVG effectiveness. From all the camera shots take with the NVG shown on TV shows in a South American jungle, it seems to be so, and they have to add a bit of extra light to allow the person to be seen.

Helicopter pilots are mostly train with night flying using NVG all over the world but fighters are few.

While a direct hit from a normal arty round would surely take out ANY tank, its hitting the tank's thats the problem. While modern ballistics computers have reduced the CEP of an arty barrage quite significantly, its still a inefficent and risky way of taking out tanks. I think there are guided arty rounds in development or in service somewhere, but I've not seen it.<br><br>// The technique of calling arty fire to destroy a tank is an obselete one. Its is relavent during the days when the tanks are slower during the days of 1980s.(Combat and Survival)<br><br>In this age of faster tanks, missiles that home-in the laser beam emitted is used now.  The SAS and Delta Forces used this system to destroy stationary targets(Scuds launchers and depots) in Iraq during the Gulf War at ranges up to 1000m. I believe that this technique is applicable to tanks too as the missiles adjusts is path as it flies or glides to the target.<br><br>Or with GPS and laser range finder, arty can be called to saturate the area with bomblets. This is used by mainly US and Western cointries.<br><br>About reactive armour.<br>I went to a lecture on explosive and poyrotechnics, the lecturer said that the reactive armour are able to dull the explosive power of a shaped charge but is not very effective against the SABOT rounds. Also there is a development to make the most power explosive. Its nitrogen-** composite. And he said there was a scientist successful with it and he blow the whole lab up with 5g of that stuff. And according to him, this new stuff its so powerful, not armour in the world at present is able to stop it.</div></blockquote>I think you need to know about some latest development in anti-tank arty....<br><br>the latest developement of anti-tank arty is a SP arty known as panzerfaust 2000.<br><br>it fires a shell that is known as the ICM... or improved conventional munition. inside thise shell.... contains numerous bomblets... each carries a millimeter wave sensor.... which will home the bomblets onto the enemy tanks....<br><br>The new ICM and SP arty combined was rated so powerful by janes... it literray could spell the end of tanks in the future... as it was reported that a column of tanks numbering 25 to 50 could be wipe out by a few ICM rounds in under 15 seconds..<br><br>The SAF already have SP arty.... the Singapore technologies is also one of the few companies in the world that has the ability to produce ICM...<br><br>Unfortunately,, the local ICM carrys HEDP bomblets which though effective against certain armor vehicles... dont possess a millimeter wave radar to home the bomblet onto the tanks.....<br><br>But... obviously... i would say that the developement of such a bomblet isnt really that far off for ST.<br><br>for more information of ST ICM bomblet visit its web page <a href="http://www.stengg.com/land/downloads/la_155CR.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stengg.com/land/downloads/la_155CR.pdf</a><br></div>

I reckon they are trying to fit every feature they can into a TV box! *exaggerating*<br><br>Anyway, i heard the bergen used by the Royal Marines could stop the thermal signature of an individual, but no sure abt that.

Under the Army21 doctrine, all combat personel are to be  equipment with a mini NVG. It only takes time to equipment of SAF.<br><br>The mini NVG (called the "Mini-N.See" in SAF), currently being used by most Infantry/guards and Recon troopers is so small nd light it fits your pocket. it's size's  like 2 3310 HP sitck together. It has a IR "torch" and has optional detachable 3x bino. It uses 1 AA size battery and can last as long as your CD-Player. Pretty good I would say. The only thing is that it's single scope so it's more dificult to judge depth compared with twin lens/scope NVGs.

Perhaps you can enlighten us Singaporeans how you dealt with terrorists?<br>I believe your security forces once wiped out all inhabitants on a Filipino island used as a base for their terrorists/Pirates?<br>That's why there were no more problems from the Sulu terrorists for more than 10 years till the Sipadan incident? Can tell us more?<br>thanks...</div></blockquote>Y don't i say you are a M'sian and you tell me more? I believe Nationality has nothing to do with the discussions that were raised throughout in this forum.<br><br>Since you have some knowledgement on the Sulu terrorists and Sipadan incidents, maybe you could enlighten us on that?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the incident I wanted Eye to comment on:<br><br>In 1985, a group of armed Filippino pirates/terrorists raided the town of Lahad Datu or Sempona in Sabah. The Malaysian security forces manage to respond by pursuing them back into an island in Philippine waters. Rumour has it that the Malaysians shot everyone one that island, pirates, wives, children. The bodies were dumped into the sea. Only bits of skulls which were shot off were recovered. The Phippine govt lodged a protest but no evidence of a massacre were found....<br>Piracy in that place stopped for more than 10 years after this massive response.<br><br>I have tried to obtain more details of this incident but to no avail. I was wandering if EYE could fill me in, considering that he is au fait with the history of the Malaysian security forces....</div>

It's confirmed this time, no longer rumours.<br><br>Singapore shouldn't worry too much about the tanks &amp; MIG 29's but it's the subs that we should worry about.
