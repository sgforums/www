            <div class='col-md body'>"A lot of people are mistaken than F-18E/F are just another upgrade of the old bugs. The Super bugs are in fact nothing like the old bugs except for the front fuselage. The wings are new, the leading edge extension are new, the intake are new, the avionics (with the AESA radar) will be new. The size of the Superbug is almost identifcal with the F15. The F404 engines will be an uprated version. The RCS will be much smaller than the bugs. US Navy even consider to expand the Super bugs to take over many roles current filled by different types such as the Tomcats, S-2s, EA-6Bs, etc. "<br><br>One of the very few things going for the F-18E/F is its avionics. The APG-79 is a probably the best radar among all the contenders, and the IDECM suite will most likely be as good as the DASS and Spectra suite. However, the fighter's aerodynamic performance sucks. It's the worst among all the contenders, and I'm sure you won't argue with me on that.  eg. The wing-drop problem has, till today, only been ameliorated, but not totally solved. Its acceleration is worse than the F-18C, and that plane's acceleration is already crappy enuff. The F414 pumps out more thrust than the F404, but the increase in thrust wont be able to compensate for the increase in the plane's weight. And stealth for the SuperHornet is a non-issue. Carry any meaningful war-load, and say bye bye to any low-orbservable attempts in that plane's design.<br>One thing I like about the Superbug, however, is the F-18F twin-seater's decoupled cockpit concept. Enabled by the AESA radar, this feature allows maximum utilisation of the radar's ability to interleave A2A and A2G radar modes. Thus the pilot can use the radar's A2A modes for situational awareness, while the WSO can simultaneously use the radar's A2G modes for the fighter's attack mission, allowing both to concentrate on their tasks. With a two seater cockpit, which has always proven to be essential for the attack role, this feature would make the F-18F Superhornet a very potent attack fighter, making it surpass the Rafale, Typhoon, and perhaps even the F-16 Block 60 in the A2G role.<br><br>"Given a good package inclusive of AIM-9X, Amaraac AIM120C, IR guided munitions, SLAM, air-launched Harpoons, AGM-142, etc, I can't see why Super bugs won't be a good fit till RSAF get F-35s. "<br><br>If you are talking of a good package, look at the Typhoon. No plane has as many weapons integrated on it than that plane. Virtually the whole A2A and A2G arsenal would be integrated on it!<br><br>"Superbugs will beat the old bugs and given right condition (BVR) will be able to down SU30s too."<br><br>Yes, it'll beat the old bugs (otherwise why get a new bug?) but by a very small margin, as reported by GAO on May 2000. That it'll be able to down SU-30s is not in doubt, due to its more advanced avionics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the R-77s have a range advantage over the AIM120s.  A good 40km advantage.  Only thing is, R-77s sold are export versions, which may be less capable.  Another thing, AIM-9X has yet to be put into active service, and so far not much is known about it and its real capabilities. (Not publicly)  SU-30s are good, esp if you enjoy HUGE fuel slurping mofos, that require lots of service and maintenance on the ground as parts may not be available when needed.  Personally, I will rule out the F-18E/F cos I doubt we will recieve the full weapons package from the US.  Block 60 Vipers are probably out too, as the USAF is not gonna buy any of them at all.  Thus the block 60 Vipers will be another one of those Export Upgrade Versions.<br><br>The Typhoon and the Rafale are what I feel the most likely.  They are relatively new and advanced multi-role/dual-role/ F/As or whatever u want to call them.  They have a huge array of A2A and A2G arsenal at their disposal.  Their manufacturers won't have any qualms selling its weaponry to us.  And at the same time, they are much easier to integrate than the Russian competitors.<br><br>The Superbugs can still be an option, IF the US is willing to sell us a relatively good package.<br><br>Thats my 2 cts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a side note on the Typhoon:<br>"Wind tunnel tests indicate that adding two 1500-litre conformal fuel tanks to the top of the Eurofighter Typhoon would extend the range by 25 percent without seriously hampering aerodynamic performance. This is seen as critical to reaching some markets (e.g., Australia) and to fully utilizing the Tranche-3 deep strike capability as it would free up two of the weapons stations (which are now used for external fuel tanks)"<br><br>If tunnel tests are true, Tranche-3 should solve the range problem faced by the Typhoon in the current config.<br><br>Back to the R-77. Range is not everything, and furthermore, the range provided is the 'claimed' range of the missile. We do not know the parameters under which that range specification was derived, and it doesn't really matter. What's more important is the missile's effective range, of which the Amraam, with its more advanced software, has. The basic R-77 solid-burn profile limited the missile's engagement performance by bleeding off too much energy too fast. (software enhancements can do much to conserve energy. The Python 4 reportedly has excellent software which allows it to retain much of its energy by calculating the most energy efficient woute to the target)  It also didn't have a lofted flight engagement trajectory like the Amraam.  Its also good to know that the C5 version of the Amraam has a larger motor, and with the clipped wings of the C versions, drag will probably decrease, leading to even larger 'no-escape' zones for the missile.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once again, the problem with the Typhoon is not even whether Tranche 3 will solve the problems of the Typhoon(too geared towards A2A, insufficient range/combat radius). It is as Joe Black has pointed out, whether it will reach that stage or not. Looking at previous multinational designs, its unlikely, everyone will get the Typhoons ordered, the countries involved will hail it as a fantastic example of multinational cooperation, then promptly each go their own way as to customising the aircraft for their own need, each heaving a sigh of relief at the sight of each others backs.<br><br>Also, development time comes into play, as I've often said before, I am impressed(very much so) by the Typhoons specs, but I've also said we must put things into perspective and realise that much of the claimed specs are just that, claims, very little exists beyond the papers and the harddrives of the consortiums offices. The basic fact is that the program is lagging, and severely so, compared to equivalent fighters of the same generation. 4 Typhoons, 3 from UK and 1 German, flew together for the 1st time recently at Farnborough. Some see it as an achievement. I say, "about damn time"<br><br>Back to integration. US has already told RoK no AMRAAM integration if it chooses non-US equipment. No doubt, they will use the same arm-twisting tactics on other nations, us included when it comes to picking our fighters. As I've asked before, what then for the non-US contenders? Skyflash/Sparrow for Typhoon until Meteor is available at the end of the decade(and that if and only if the damn Krauts stop trying to screw around with the program). Hardly cutting edge is it?<br><br>I've said this before and I'll say it again. While the Typhoon is a very impressive aircraft with a very impressive set of specs, there are too many what-ifs concerned with the state and schedule to the program for us to gamble our new fighter program on.<br><br>AAM ranges<br><br>The common mistake is to look at range of AAMs. What range. AMRAAM can fly what, 60 km? Sure, but does Raytheon tell you at that admittedly impressive number, what is the hit probability for AMRAAM against a hard manoevring target. Almost zero. Yes thats right. Almost zero. Whats the point of flying that far if you're not going to do what you're designed for? Ditto for the R-73/R-77. Impressive stats, but again, what hit probability at the extreme ranges?<br><br>Compare this, for stats of hit probability of AMRAAM vs MICA:<br><br>the AMraam AIM120 C is rated at Max range "till the propulser is off", Mica is rated at 100% 9G agile detroyed target range. AIM120 C can't destroy a agile target after 30kms,"look that the dutch who destroyed a Mig to kosovo launched 3 AIM120 for only one touchdown" near Meteor will keep final extreme agility to more than 100kms that will be the first ever deadly BVR missile "on the paper", Rafale will get Mica for Short/medium and Meteor for BVR.<br><br>I know which combi I'd rather have....<br><br>If we buy non US and they don't integrate AMRAAM, then fine by all means. Screw them, we can always integrate Derby/Python onto any Rafale until we get Meteors. We can do without US made second rate souped up 1970s airframes and capable but overrated missiles one generation behind cutting edge anyway...<br><br>I think its about time buyers of Western weapons had a paradigm shift and realise that other Western options are just as capable if not even more than American equivalents, and sans the crippling export restrictions the Americans ALWAYS place on their exports to boot.

I'll believe it when I see it.

Integrated means the stores electronics gizmos work with the aircrafts gizmos, the FCS, the radar etc etc. A big world of difference.<br><br>Same deal with our F-16s and F-5s, they've been cleared to carry AMRAAM, but the software has not been installed in the aircraft computers yet. Word from a US contact of mine down at Luke says that the RSAF Vipers there have only recently had the AMRAAM software uploaded and the pilots have begun the AMRAAM software training. See the difference? It simply means that our Vipers have all this while been cleared to carry the AMRAAM, but only reently have they been integrated with it.<br><br>The Americans allow integration of AMRAAM for the Germans and the Brits and the Spaniards. Why not? They're all NATO members. Like it or not, Singapore is a 2nd rate ally compared to the countries mentioned above.

Heck, Boeing's X-32 design was CAD/CAM, and its flying characteristics were simulated on computer. The results were so similar to its real flying qualities that their engineers were stunned. So why the skeptism over computers?"<br><br>Because I have worked with several different FEM programs as well as CATIA, the CAD/CAM program used by Dassault to design the Rafale, albeit in a learning, as opposed to a working, environment. And always, without fail, our instructors for each of the different programs cannot stress often enough that the results obtained through the program do not ALWAYS mirror the real thing, and if the real results are similar to the computer simulation, it is more of a fluke than anything else(why do you think the X-32 engineers you mentioned were stunned? Cos it ain't supposed to happen, not often anyway...). Experimentations we did in real world environments gave us results that vindicated what our FEM + CAD/CAM instructors said.<br><br>I attended a lecture last year on aircraft fatigue, taught by a big shot from IAI and attended by people throughout the Aussie aviation industry. One thing that stood out in my mind from the course is this little snippet.<br><br>When LM designed the C-130J using the CAD/CAM and FEM programs, out on a whim, they put through the designs of the basic C-130A to H models through the same programs. Did you know what the result was? The computer simulations concluded that the C-130A,B,E and H are not flyable, as in, the damn designs were not supposed to take off and sustain flight.<br><br>Now, who/what do you believe? 40+ years of sterling service from the polar caps to the hottest deserts in all loadouts and missions, or a computer that tells you the design will not be able to fly?<br><br>And finally, no, I'm not denouncing computers in anyway or saying they're totally useless. My point is that we should always take things in perspective and realise that computers are not the be all and end all of things, they are not necessarily always right. That is a fact thats been proven time and time again.</div>

There are too many variables in real life world to be able to accurately put them into simulations.  Too many times US armed forces people have discovered that their weapons do not work as well as they have expected and that practices in simulations did not equate to realities.  Of course, then again, I have to say that computer simulations have gone a long distance and being refined all the time. They do have their place in manufactoring and design. They speed things up by and large. The refinement will have to be done during real life prototyping stage to refine what the computer does not "see" or "predict".<br><br>Wind-tunnel tests and all different sorts of computer simulations are at best 80 to 90% accurate.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello there,<br><br>I think Singapore should select the Rafale Mk2 from Dassault.<br><br>- F-18E/F has very good avionics and radar, but it is beaten by Rafale and Typhoon in raw aerodynamic performance. You may like to know that F-18C/D did ACM dogfight with CDG Rafales during Afghanistan operations and the Hornet was apparently dominated. Just for the info, the F-14 was slaughtered, but it's kind of normal as it was never meant to be a dogfighter. No BVR engagements have been performed because the US and the French do not want to reveal the firing parameters of the latest C-5 AMRAAM and MICA.<br><br>And of course the very fact that Malaysia is getting F-18E should de facto rule out this option for Singapore IMHO.<br><br>- Typhoon is great and yes it does reach IOC at the same time as Rafale for the French Air Force but there is a big difference in a sense that 2005 Rafale for the French Air Force are F2 variant with considerable a2g capability (all kinds of PGM, including GPS-guided AASM, SCALP cruise missile...). 2005 Typhoon is strictly air-to-air... Rafale will also have the nice OSF and I believe Typhoon will feature the PIRATE IRST.<br><br>However it should be said that by 2008 the Typhoon should get all its a2g modes and by that time the Rafale will get upgraded to F3 which is basically a F2 with a new software for the RBE2 TFR mode for very low level nuclear strike using the new ASMP-A missile. In a2a both planes are getting their new targeting helmets with off-boresight short-range missiles (ASRAAM for Typhoon, probably IRIS-T for Rafale).<br><br>IMHO Singapore should get some Rafale Mk2 with the RBE2+active antenna (very comparable to APG-79) and the uprated M88-3C. The increased thrust does not very much increase the dogfighting performances according to simulations but it will definitely increase the climb rate and for a country which does not have a E-3 it may be of some use to be able to scramble its fighters in case of a late detected intrusion in the Singapore airspace.<br><br>For the missiles, Singapore should get a mix of MICA EM and MICA IR. Forget about Magic 2, use the MICA IR for short range (mounted on the wing tips). When Meteor becomes available, get them if your neighbour gets AMRAAM or R-77 in good qty.<br><br></div>
