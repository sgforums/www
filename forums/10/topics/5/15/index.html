With more than half our economy in manufacturing, a decrease in demand of our produces spells disaster. A downturn in merely 1 sector of an industry becomes a general downturn for Singapore.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>as for the govt putting most of its egg in one basket... i think it is probably out of consideration of the circumstances we are in and the events around us</strong></blockquote>Quoting Jake Lloyd-Smith of SCMP again, "last year Singapore still had 26.5 per cent of its gross domestic product tied up in manufacturing, more than it had 15 years earlier, while Hong Kong has let natural forces slim down its reliance on manufacturing and build a service economy of many baskets, each holding only a few of many eggs."<br><br>The recent merger of banks shows an attempt to build a service economy alike to Hong Kong. Good move, albiet a little late. Today, Singapore is 20 years behind Hong Kong in Finance..<br><br><blockquote><strong>True that the current situation is partially the responsibility of the govt.... but isnt also true that prior to the downturn... everyone is showering praises on the govt on going high tech and IT savy???</strong></blockquote>I remember how dotcoms were once embraced back in 2000.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I'm new to this. So pardon/correct me if i make any factual mistakes. I've seen these pages for a while now...and one of the topics mentioned was RSAF intention of purchasing EF2000s...(or even F-15E)-were they from well informed sources?<br><br>I'm actually quite sceptical of that. Spore new fighter req is to have a range exceeding our present F-16s....and to fly that far indicates missions might most prob be offensive-ground attack. To this end  our new order of 20a/c will be f-16D blk 52+ equipped with conformal tanks--all fully missionised 2 seaters(not really publicised this far, but u can see for urselves in 2003)...so i guess that rules  f-15E purchases out as these f-16s can fly that far too. I would also like to point out that EF2000 is not as good in ground attack and as stealthy as the Rafale B....the former has 13 hardponts compared to the latter's 14.<br>Rafale already outstanding range, radius of action, will be even furthered by fitting conformal tanks..which is already been done with a view of offering it to a potential customer, presumably S'pore. They free up more hardpoints so as to carry more munitions. Speaking of buying weapons secretly, then announcing later, our Skyhawk detachment in France might already be flying "u know what". What for they go all the way there to learn a foreign language?<br><br>Personally i'm actually in favour of Rafale B over EF2000....although its more expensive...<br><br>Any comments, guys? Pls shoot...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is actually very difficult to determine which aircraft is better, unless the different aircrafts fight each other in a war &amp; the better one will be determine from the kill ratio. For example, the Israeli's F-15 proved itself superior to  Syrian's Mig-24 because the former are able to shot down 83 Syrian's fighter, &amp; yet the Israeli had zero F-15 losses from that particular war.<br><br>However, there are some modern research done to determine, or at least, to predict, the ability of different aircrafts without having to see them fighting in an actual war. The following are 2 examples:<br><br>1) This is what I see from the following website:  <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-15.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-15.htm</a>    : "Simulations conducted by British Aerospace and the British Defense Research Agency compared the effectiveness of the F-15C, Rafale, EF-2000, and F-22 against the Russian Su-35 armed with active radar missiles similar to the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The Rafale achieved a 1:1 kill ratio (1 Su-35 destroyed for each Rafale lost). The EF-2000 kill ratio was 4.5:1 while the F-22 achieved a ratio of 10:1. In stark contrast was the F-15C, losing 1.3 Eagles for each Su-35 destroyed."<br><br>2) Here are some info obtained from Pioneer Magazine, Apr. 1999 issue : "Studies show that the Eurofighter's only real competitor is the F-22. These studies also indicate that the F-22 can defeat the latest Russian Su-27 Flanker in 91% of beyond-visual-range engagements. The Eurofighter would succeed in 82% while the Rafale would survive in only 50% of such encounters. What is significant, however, is that the Eurofighter is 50% less costly to produce than the F-22."<br><br>The above examples may use different methods &amp; opponent aircraft, however, if those research are accurate, it can be predict that EF2000 are overall more superior than Rafale.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure you all know about the procurement of EF2000 by RSAF in the news paper today. 200+??!!!!!! thats more than the total amount of jets we have in our inventory now! rafale is good, real good. I think there is no need to spend more money on an aircraft that has an additional more hardpoint than the Typhoon, about the same performance. Thats what i think and if you got see the cockpit of the Typhoon before, you will give RSAF a thumbsup for purchasing it and the Newspaper article stated that the BAe (i think so) may allow us to purchase the highly capable Meteor BVRAAM. In this way, we don't have to purchase AMRAAm from U.S, which we don't get to keep in Singapore. The Meteor would be allowed to be kept in Singapore. TTs the good thing. And i read from Asian defense and Deplomacy that Russia is ready to provide Malaysia with a Squadron of 20 Su30MK long-range multi-role fighter. Hahahaha. Now the Malaysians had to keep their profile low as the EF2000 is tracking them. hahahaha.<br><br>JUst kiddin <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>something to clarify here...actually the Israeli's F-15s destroyed mainly the Syrian's Mig-21 &amp; Mig-23, instead of Mig-24.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So guys, can we have a poll here?....pls state ur preference for RSAF's next fighter....EF2000, Rafale...etc....<br><br>Also, does EF2000 have a 2-seat missionised attack variant? The trend is towards 2 seaters for ground attack...Rafale B is already out....<br><br>Also, Mirage 2000D/N in Red Flag ex surprised observers/participants with their ECM capability and it was not even used at their full potential for fear of divulging too much....wonder what they'll install in Rafale...<br><br>Sorry but i'm going against the grain of thought....i would vote for the Rafale B...whether by capability or looks....i think  it does have an edge over the Typhoon...despite what was posted a few messages ago....btw how do they obtain those figures/odds when pitted against the SU-35/37?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It should be highlighted that environment factors/threats should also be taken into consideration when anyone were to chose their preference. No point talking about sophistication or product design if the weapon does not suit our requirement. Equally important is that the weapon should be able to effectively counter the best equipments from possible opponents.<br><br>I'll vote for EF2000. That should be the most advance fighter that we can possibly purchased. In fact, the EF2000 should actually be more powerful than it is now, because Germany had wanted to save cost &amp; therefore some features were modified. However, the BAE had recently stated that opportunities for upgrading the EF2000 are available if they get the order from S'pore. Can anyone imagine the superiority RSAF would have if it operates upgraded EF2000s which are more powerful than those in Europe?<br><br>The missile system is important as well. Rafale is using the Mica, but i don't think it's as good as the Meteor BVRAAM in EF2000.<br><br>Another factor to consider is the new aircraft that are likely to threaten us. I think SU-30 is a possibility (if someone really come to the decision in purchasing such offensive weapon). If the studies &amp; simulations done by the western countries are accurate, then the Rafale will not have much advantage over SU-30. In contrast, the EF2000 should be a better choice then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, in reply to a previous poster.  Even if the upgraded F-16C/D could fly as far the F-15E, does it have what it takes to get in and get out?  Does it have the capability to withstand battle damage?  I have seen reports of F-15Es landing with 1 wing left due to training accidents.  The TEWS systems of the F-15E exceeds those of an F-16C/D by far, with the capability to track missile launches 360 degrees, while showing distance and altitude. Imagine that!<br><br>I feel that the EF2000 is a great buy.  The rafale is after all, older than the EF2000, and I really didn't think the RSAF would purchase planes and then phase them out.  The EF2000 is new, and is still developing technologies to further enhanced the aircraft.<br><br>Screw the SU-30MK, Russians would prolly sell them dumb malaysians analogue systems again and they would end up paying to upgrade them to digital standards.  Even their MiG-29A(upgraded) is no where close to the MiG-29SMT standard.  Germany had to upgrade their fleet of MiG-29s after they merged, and fortunately for them, they had the industry and technology to do so.<br><br>The Su-30MK is also a large airframe, I'm sure our AWACS would be able to pick them up as the lift off.  I'm just wondering if the RSAF would purchase the E-3.  The E-2C is like sooooo cramped... crap.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LoLz.  True, we are in a crucial location to for shipping movements.  And if we are not friendly to the superpower, we will be wiped off.<br><br>The EF2000 is supposed to be faster in terms of combat turns.  Not to sure about combat radius, though it can carry 2 1500lb and 1 1000lb fuel tanks to extend its range.  However, I do suspect the sukhois being superior in this aspect.<br><br>Did Singapore make purchase of Meteors? If so, the Malaysians can kiss their Adder range advantage goodbye. The EF2000 has also the ability to launch cruise missiles, that is the Storm Shadow.  Which means while Malaysian Su-30s have to penetrate our airspace to launch, we can simply take off, match bearings and shoot! LOLZ.  However, I don't think we will recieve such capabilities as it will seriously upset the already tense situation in SEA.<br><br>If the Americans refuse the sell the E-3s to us, then too bad i guess.  E-3s would drastically increase early warning capabilities.  And if Singapore falls, the waters around here would be one helluva place to park diesels subs, most dangerous of all naval weapons for this kinda enviroment.<br><br>Speaking of sea lanes, has the malaysians totally abandoned the idea to cut a canal thru along the Thai Border?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>according to the straits times, the BAE company offer to sell the BVRAAM missile 2 us without any restriction and transfer of other technology if we buy their EF2000. If this is really true, den the chances of EF2000 being choose is almost 100 i tink as through this way, singapore can gain alot of advanced weapons instead of a useless airframe like the F-16</div>
