            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's best defence policy is peace. There is no value add in offensice or defensive military engagement. Win, lose or draw we would be strategically defeated in economic, social and political terms. The premise of our success as an economy has been and continues to be our stability. Therefore any military adventure, even one forced upon us, is by this fundamental measure a defeat.<br>Then why do we invest so much in defense? There are 2 reasons. The first as a deterrence and a particular kind of deterrence - offensive deterrent. That is to say, that we strive for the capability not only to defeat attacks but to counter with our own.<br>The second, is for social cohesion. The SAF has morphed over time to be a socio-political force in its own right. Every male learns the hard lesson of conformity, heirarchy and discipline when he hits 18. The SAF has also become development engine for "ideal" leaders. So military leaders transform into political ones. The men lead when in uniform become the people who follow, when in their whites.<br>Ultimately, one may abide my the first rationale but should correctly, be concerned with the second. We risk cultivating a junta of the generals, whose perspective, attitudes, training, values and comprehension of society cannot but fail to display a uniformity.</div>

Or at least the cat can survive some physical impacts (eg a heavy fall from a high location) quite impressively.<br><br>Also, do people know that there are more than one way to skin &amp; slaughter a hog? eg. high electric current; hang it upside down &amp; sliced the body apart; tied the legs together &amp; put it into a well of boiling water, etc etc.<br><br>But why do people want to skin a cat? Only those weird or mentally ill people will do that. eg a bomoh or a psychopath. On the other hand, slaughtering a hog or boar is nothing unusual.

Any thoughts?</div></blockquote>dont bet on it... the americans got themselves pretty burnt up when they tried to cultivate muslim partners... for example... the shah of iran... then saddam of iraq... and many other so call pro-american moslems leaders.... it is doubtful that the americans would dare to continue to give uncontidictional support for any future moslem govt.... just as it did for the shah of iran....<br><br>The reason is rather simplistic... the problem of the moslem world is that... IT has already identified americans as the SATAN... and such perception isnt gonna change overnight... having a few moderate moslem leaders at its beck and call... would not for one minute change the overall perception of america in the eyes of the likes of Osama... and might even re-enforce the perception of the american SATAN trying to subvert islam.... through islamic head of state....<br><br>One only need to look at saudi arabia and egyt and we see very clearly ... that moslem leaders who dance with americans.... are always wary of the potential backlash of the more radical moslems in their country.... and has from time to time... rebuke american govt or given financial support to local radical moslems in order to gain acceptance in their own respective moslem community....<br><br>On the other hand... .moslem leaders who shake uncle sam's hand too often and fail to address the potential anti-american backlash in their country... easily found themselve on the wrong side of the gun ... as such, many such leaders, though moderate, are unable or unwilling to sway public opinion towards american favour... furthermore... such moslem leaders would also find themselves easily offending other moslem leaders that have a home crowd of blood thirsty anti-american audience to address...<br><br>Take for example... the latest meeting in malaysia by moslem state leader on terrorism... mahatir's stand on terrorism... though moderate was equally offensive to the isrealis and the arabs....<br><br>to the isrealis... mahatir's position is a subtle acceptace of terrorism... while arab nations think mahatir is MAD to even consider their fellow palestinians brothers as terrorist ... instead of the freedom fighter that they deserve......<br><br>Poor maharaja... got hit by rotten eggs on both sides to his face... worst.... his countrymen... the moslems... kept very very silent..... thus... one can see the futility of cultivating moderate moslem leaders... except for local USA media consumption....<br><br>In any case... able to shake hand with uncle sam is a 2 edge sword... maharaja will risk a backlash in his upcoming election if he stick too close to Bushy man and give the PAS an advantage.... sticking too close to uncle sam... has a price to pay... it aint free.. and it aint gonna be a walk in the park.... bushy man could just as quickly dump maharaja on the fence as he has invited him to his office for a cup of tea....<br><br>Lastly... maharaja.... is a fickle man himself... a man who in the past... constantly express anti-west, anti-capitalism.. anti-soros publicly in forums and in international conferences... even snubbed uncle sam during APEC... and getting into hot temper with australia....<br><br>Thus... if i am bushy man.... i would think twice before considering maharaja a dependable ally or even friend....<br><br>But... the war against terrorism is heating up ... and bushy man... needs some friends on the muslim ground for the time, this is to divide the enemy and take them out one by one... a simple strategy ... in dealing with the muslim threat....<br><br>as to wat will happen to maharaja or malaysia once Uncle sam has finished its buissness... its anyones' guess. but i doubt... uncle sam is gonna kiss maharaja... that is... if maharaja has not been 'replaced' by PAS.....<br><br>The... reason for my belief is actually quite simplistic... as long as Moslems and jews cannot sit down and talk in peace... how can malaysia and america gonna even think of shaking hands honestly???<br><br>Is malaysia gonna accept isreal and close down palestinian embassy in malaysia?? or will uncle sam stop supporting isreal.... just to make friends with malaysia??<br><br>There is an unbridgeable gap between malaysia and america... but for the moment... at least... both has something to gain from each other.... a marriage of convenice....</div>

It is severely dependent on the position of the USA....<br><br>even though maharaja's press and defence minister has been trying to imply otherwise... ( they must think we pretty dumb...) i dont buy one bit of it.... do they really think that if singapore and malaysia should come to blows... americans are gonna side them?? i seriously doubt it...<br><br>The key point here is to understand the USA's mind of thought.... true... right now.. they wanna play with maharaja... but that does not in any way... imply or suggest that maharaja is gonna get anything in return... although... that's the impression that maharaja wants to project to singapore....<br><br>The basic reason is once again.... a matter of national interest...<br><br>In my opinion.. the USA would probably prefer singapore and malaysia to remain status quo... there are many reason for that...<br><br>1.. it ensure a certain level of stability... along a key global straits... the economy is already in shit... this is hardly the time to entertain another war over a critical international straits...<br><br>2... as long as SG nor MAL is in any overwhelming advantages position... both side will need to dance to US tunes... or risk loosing out... in a way... as long as malaysia and singapore continue to exist... USA can play singapore card to threaten malaysia and vice versa to wrangle the biggest gains possible for america....<br><br>Maharaja obviously dealt himself a pretty bad move... now maharaja must continuously suck bushy's cock or risk getting into big trouble with SAF.... in fact.. the only winner in this case... is UNCLE SAM... maharaja lost... so did singapore... all becos a moron up north.. though opportunistic... got a vision shorter then his nose....<br><br>3.. USA cant afford to loose singapore to malaysia.. since that will be one less card to play against malaysia in times of crisis... and malaysia would then effectively control the world most important straits... Going by normal logic of divide and rule... permitting either singapore or malaysia to dominate the strategic straits where US projects its influence and millitary power... is a big NO NO for any superpower....<br><br>lastly... americans are no fools... they know damn well that malaysia is a mulsim nation... their trustworthyness is as thin as paper.... but as long as america got singapore in the region... USA are pretty much confident that they can make maharaja bend over... whenever... wherever required...<br><br>Furthermore... singapore's relationship with USA is built through a multi-tier system such as through australia..EU.. Japan and many other gobal players... through diplomatic... economic and millitary linkages..<br><br>last but not least... Singapore has good ties with isreal.. both countries has mutual common interest in seeing that american's position against muslims... are .... in place.... so to speak...<br><br>As to the recent spate of claims by maharaja's goon about good relationship with USA... i think they are just trying to comfort themselves and to reassure its people that singapore would not resort to force to settle mutual disputes becos malaysia is on 'good terms with america' and it is doubtful that SAF would dare to march up the peninsula as long as malaysia continue to pay tribute to Uncle sam... kowtow to the american flags once in a while... curse the radical muslims now and then... and who knows... ??? maharaja might do a good blow job on bushy's dick... that might even see malaysia getting some sort of 'reward'!!<br><br>Watever the case.. the only way that malaysia is gonna really really become a US ally... is actually quite simple... all they have to do is to denounce allah.... burn all the koran and tear down all the mosque in malaysia and all muslims become christians.... simple isnt it?<br><br>well... obviously not... wat i am saying is... the chances of malaysia and USA becoming allies is as good as the chances that malaysian muslims will denouce their religion... becos... its the malaysian religion... that is unbridgeable chasm to establishing long term partnership between US and MAL...<br><br>Even turkey has found that... despite being a secular state... its largely moslem faith has make turkey a rather .... unwelcomed member in NATO.. EU and in its relations with USA....<br><br>malaysia.... is no where even near..... BUT having said all that... i must therefore see the situation as one of global politic... as long as you know the limitation of the game... it doesnt hurt to wait a while for a more favourable wind......</div>

US position against muslims.. and other regional states including thailand and singapore.... plus the potential aftereffects.. and backlash.. which might appear in the shadows....<br><br>americans are no fools... they knew maharaja is opportunistic... but at this point of time... it will be useful to have a mouthpiece in the muslim world... so as to divide the muslim fratenity towards american advantage....  while at the same time... useful for domestic consumption to garner continual effort against 'terrorist'.<br><br>a divided enemy is always preferrable against a united foe... and america got 2 nice big stick to use against maharaja if he want to be naughty... the 2 stick are SAF and thai millitary...<br><br>As to providing arms to malaysia... i seriously doubt it... but it wont be totally bad for us... if malaysia can get AMRAAM.. then it automatically implied that SAF and RTAF will also have access to AMRAAM or US would risk loosing 2 good friend... in a region dominated by muslims... america dont need another middle east....<br><br>Watever it is... maharaja is gonna come out saying that he defended the palestinian cause.. and uncle sam is gonna come out saying that malaysia is with USA in against terrorism (which include palestinians)...<br><br>In short... the upcoming meeting will give a vomiting useless position... with regard to anti-terrorism or anything... maharaja will just simply try to claim good relationship... with his visit to america...which holds no water.... a wayang show....<br><br>finally.... there is questionable doubt in my mind.... if USA really wanna cultivate moderate islamic leaders... in malaysia... why talk to a dying old man who is fast heading for his final resting place in the ground.... when the designated future PM of malaysia badawi... seems rather silent... Badawi's silence during the conference on terrorist and the recent mahatir visit to USA is truely... deafening!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by tripwire (edited 06 May 2002).]</div>

Furthermore, it will be big trouble for Australia, New Zealand and America alike if Singapore falls under Muslim (esp fanatical) control. RAAF at most would not be involved in anything, if they are going to be dragged into a war, I am 101% sure they will be on Singapore's side.</div>

Haven't they learnt a thing from the USSR? Hmm... but we're not that much better off anyway... Tony Tan and SM Lee are both not that young...</div>

Simple maths will tell you that it is not pausible...the army here is for self defense....and the best history to support the usage of a strong self defense force will be the of Switzerland which repluse the invasion of the mighty German machine in the WW2.

Well, its the eternal chicken and egg question: Threats are moderated precisely 'cos we're able to protect our vital interests with a credible deterrent.
