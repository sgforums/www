TVN WILL NOT add 30% to aircraft weight. The F-16 with thrust vectoring nozzles is just a flying test bed for Lockheed, its not even in full scale production for goodness's sake not even the Russians know how to use it properly, and they're the leader in thrust vectoring.<br><br>Spine is Lockheed MArtin mod for Singapore. Israeli D-Vipers have same spine for Wild Weasel equipment. No idea what Singapores spine contain, and wouldn't say it here even if I do...</div>

RSAF also get to fly the hornet and see its strength and weakness... when singapore buys the chinook... RMAF also gets to fly the chinook for evaluation purposes.<br><br>BUT... with local production... MAF will not be able to know the full capability of the singapore weapons since MAF cant buy it on the market....<br><br>so... while MAF military weakness can be seen relatively easily.... SAF military power is becoming more and more hidden.....<br><br>With local production... it is possible for SAF to get replacement weapons in war... malaysia on the other hand will need to bend over and offer their ass to their weapon supplier... and upon approval... it will still take some times to get the weapon to malaysia... assuming the RSAF and RSN decided to 'close one eye' and let the ships through.. ahahahaa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia may stand some chance if they try to haf some R&amp;D rather than keep getting foreign supplies. Singapore got things like DSTA, NSTB, ST, etc. All help contribute to our defence. Our bionix are somewat more navigable too. The advantage of local production is oso that we can suit them to our own needs, and we can do backward engineering of the foreign parts to enhance our know-how. Whereas in Malaysia, they really need to buck up and haf more R&amp;D. Anything they buy wil of cuz be known to us, like how many planes they haf. And the weapons they buy, like F-16, etc, they juz use it as they bought wif some maintenance. I think in Singapore, the SAF at least not only maintain, but do upgrades according to local engineers' recommendations, so we haf a slightly different plane that is more efficient in the tropical region.<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The model @ the open house was D. They did a sidewinder static arming display.  Quite fast, not bad.<br><br>As for the book. There are a few editions i would like to make.  "The MAF platoon was eventually caught by a Singapore custom's officer who actually mistook them for illegal immigrants.  Upon clarification, the MAF platoon surrendered and defected to the nearest construction site."<br><br>What the SAF noes, we will never know for sure unless we start digging.  RSAF has test flown F/A-18s before, as well as MIRAGE 2000s and various other platforms.  Already identified as Singapore's major strength, is our SIGINT and early warning capabilities.  Sure enough, Singapore CAN be infiltrated, but why infiltrate when they can simply come through the customs?<br><br>RMN-Best, Whatever information we get, is not only within Singapore.  Information regarding Singapore and her neighbours.  The government releases factual information as we do not believe it will be helpful to cover anything unimportant up.  As these information can easily be obtained from the internet.  Your kampong don have internet?  Information about Malaysia, lol, mostly came from external sources.  Eg. Janes, stratfor and etc.<br><br>Its easy to pinpoint mistakes made due to carelessness in both militaries.  But mistakes due to foolishness is often examplified by the MAF.  Eg.  1. Stolen rifles by a Colonel POSER, 2. Loss of a British Aviator because you get fussy about your airspace refusing any rescue flights while refusing to launch any rescue attempts of your own. 3. Upgrading a newly purchased fighter. 4. Attempt a dare devil stunt under a 747 which could have cost the lives of   hundreds.  I find it hard to understand how the platoon of soldiers can successfully infiltrate without getting themselves killed first.  Then again, fiction is after all fiction.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This post is getting more and more interesting....<br><br>erm... RSAF F16D does have TVN. I saw it at the PLAB open house. I even took pictures of the ass of RSAF F16, F5 and A4SU from different angles and the people are looking at me. Haha. coming to think of it, its very funny. but weather all F16C/D have TVN or only some have, i dob' know and i think we all will never know the truth, right?<br><br>The RSAF F16D is heavier than the USAF F16D is because of its extra 'box like' spine. What is inside, i think ... all of us will never know too! hee... from what i read from janes, Israelli spine contains EW suite and systems for wild weasel<br><br>My thoughts: I think that a country would never let the pblic know all about their armed forces. Secrets will DEFINITELY be kept. (Make sense to you guys rite?)<br>If, Singapore already appears to the world and public to be so strong, the 'secret' that is kept would definitely make the SAF more powerful. Same goes to Malaysia... They appears to be sooo weak, but if you guys think harder, they definitely posesses weapons not known to us and their people! I don't believe that Singapore would win a ghlorious victory if we fight with Malaysia. We will win, but casualties is going to be high on both sides, veru much higher than you guys expected. ( Never forget that not all Singaporean soldiers are sincere about performing in NS and too many of them, don't love their country) i'm very happy to see that we have ppl who love our country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>This message is to rmn-best:<br>We did not beg you into letting us enter your airspace. I'm repeating what my fellow comnrades is saying. Think about this, by allowing our fighters to enter your air space, we are helping you guys defend your airspace too. Your small squadrons of MIG29N may not be as capable than our F16C/D, F5S, A4SU + your MIG29N, Hawk200, 100, F/A18 defending the Malaysian airspace rite. Think before you talk. We are helping your country in a way and also helping ourself coz we can counter threats coming up north before the threat comes down. Agree anot?<br><br>about the book on Malaysia invading Singapore... brothers, don't take it too seroiously lor. this type of book are for visual plessure, just read for fun lor. I will get the book soon.<br><br>From a french source, i got info that the RSAF have 70 F16C/D. To me, that is believable but the bad thing is that, there are more RSAF falcons abroad than at home.<br><br>Some experience to ahre with those who missed the PLAB open house  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>aircrafts are lines up at the second line and the SADA's SAms and guns are at the front row. people get to line up to get a seat in the aircrafts and i noticed that the E2C is locked. too bad... and i also realised that there rae many young girls and women queing up! you know what they want? they did not sit into the aircraft but asked the technician and pilot to step forward to take picture! Wa lau! because of these crazy fellows i got sunburned at my neck and arms!<br><br>I also learned that the cluster bomb that Singapore is using is called the Mk20 cluster bomb which can dispense 247 mk12 anti-tank bomblets! it would terrorize the enemy like hell.<br><br>The AGM-65G air-to-ground missile that the RSAF uses is not the Maverick that other countries used for anti-tank purposes. The type used by RSAF us the G-model, used for anti-shipping mission, anti-bridges and anti-bunkers mission. It is enormous.<br><br>Something stupid is when i walk to the end and see the CH47D, i was surprised to see a long line of people queing to go in! To me, its just an empty giant. I took a picture of its squadron badge and itself and walked away. those poeple must loved to get sunburned!<br><br>when i went there, i saw a squadron of about 16 Royal New Zealand Air Force A4C Skyhawks parked far away, outside an aircraft maintenence shelter. Why are they there? no one noes.<br><br>The best part of the open house is the aerial display. It feaures 2 F16C, 2 F16D, 4 F5S and 2 A4SU showing their scrambling. Before that, they did a taxi circuit past the crowds and for the first time, i hear the powerful engines of the F16C/D and saw them in action. They then took off at tremendous speed and the F16C/D flew in a line then broke off one by one. The F16 also did a high speed vertical climb towards the sky after it did a touch-and-takeoff (i think so). the A4SU did a low-level attack formation and i can see that the A4Su is much slower and less agile but the noise from its engine is as loud as the F16's.<br><br>by the way... any one of you do modelling here?</div>
