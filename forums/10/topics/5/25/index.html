Carry any bombload and it wont have stealth worth shit. I've heard about them claiming something about 'active-cancellation', but dont believe that BS. No such thing, not yet anyway. If the Americans with their HUGE resources feel that it is super-hard to do it, forget about the Frenchies succeeding.<br><br>'its superior radar' gained notorierity as being a pretty sad case of a passive-array radar. I cant remember clearly off-hand what's the exact problem, but its something<br>about the radar range being limited by one of its radar components... cant recall whats it.... had a debate with RSAFPAGE(i think) over the relative merits of each of these planes some time back, and I did bring this up......<br><br>As for its front sector optronics system....

            <div class='col-md body'>The F-15Es were supposedly running the APG-70 radar, or was it -73.  Anyway, the Eagle is an old bird, yes but stuffed with new technology constantly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Horizons right, the RSAF RFI specifically mentions a *unrefueled* radius of action to southern Thailand, as well as looking for a multirole fighter than can perform swing role, not a out and out interceptor. The Typhoon is particularly lagging in this aspect, and whatever BAe claims about its A/G capability can't hide the fact that its A/G capability was "bolted on" to the design, when it became apparent that most customers outside the EU were looking for an aircraft with both A/A and A/G capability.<br><br>AMRAAM? By the time deliveries of the Typhoon/Rafale start, I believe how many AMRAAMs can be fired is already no longer a moot point. Even the Americans themselves are acknowledging that the Russians, Europeans, Israelis are ahead of them in AAM development. Rafale can carry 6 MICA IIRC, and judging from range and performance specs, I'd rather have MICAs than even AIM-120C-5s. The question is more like how many Meteors vs how many MICAs to be carried.<br><br>2 AMRAAMs for 1 kill? I have to check my sources again, but I believe that almost all the AMRAAM kills made so far were 1 shot 1 kills. True, the targets so far were mostly tailchases or targets which were not manoeuvring, but I believe only 1 of the kills(in Kosovo) required a 2nd AMRAAM...<br><br>The list so far (off the top of my head- pls feel free to correct any mistakes/omissions)<br><br>1992: F-16D vs Iraqi MiG-25. Operation Southern Watch: 1 AMRAAM 1 kill<br>1995(?): 2 F-16C vs 6 Serb SOKO Galebs. Op Deliberate Force. 4 Galebs shot down, 2 with AMRAAMs: 2 AMRAAMs 2 kills<br>1999: F-15C vs MiG-29: Allied Force. 1 AMRAAM 1 kill<br>1999: 2 F-15C vs 2 MiG-29. Allied Force. 3 AMRAAM 2 kills<br>1999: 1 Dutch F-16AM vs MiG-21(?). Allied Force. 1 AMRAAM 1 kill<br>1999: 1 F-16CJ vs MiG-29. Allied Force. 1 AMRAAM 1 kill.<br><br>I vote for the Rafale/MICA/SCALP/APACHE/CFT combi. Better, stealthier and sexier. Might cost more per aircraft, but considering the logistics for training our crew in France are already in place, it might turn out cheaper in the long run.<br><br>Plus of course, RFI is met better by the Rafale.<br></div>

Maybe it has a lower RCS than the Typhoon, but its like 'Typhoon's big, and Rafale only slightly smaller'. Difference?

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm...147 vs 150 miles? any hard data on that? The differences would not be so small, but with todays advances in missile technology even a 3-mile diff would make a lot of diff in BVR combat. It could mean the difference between who fires first. I don't know about size, but I think Rafale vs Typhoon MTOW was different by only a couple thousand lbs, so size difference would not be that much different there I would presume. Its in shape that Typhoon loses big time in RCS.<br><br>Singapores fighter RFI has been discussed at length in a number of journals, one that springs to mind is Flight Int'l, but as the mag is published weekly I really have no idea which issue I saw it in....sorry 'bout that...<br><br>A likely theory: The RSAF/Tony Tan was waxing lyrical about the Rafale when the RFI was first issued, then they started talking up the Typhoon. Before we selected the Apache it was the same thing, a lot of talk about the Apache, then they started talking about the Tiger, but got the AH-64 eventually. It was revealed in Flight Int'l that for a while the Apache deal hung in the blance over US refusal to clear Longbow radar to Singapore, thats when we started talking about the Tiger, and suggested it was a ploy to get Boeing to put pressure on the US government to clear the Longbow export. We might be seeing the same thing with the fighters here....<br><br>Its just a theory though...nothing concrete...</div>

However, here are a few points to consider too:<br><br>1. Rafales can indeed armed with Amraams. Rafales can carry all NATO weapons including GBU-12 and other Paveway LGB which RSAF use today.<br><br>2. Rafales can carry up to 6 Amraams and 2 WVR missiles. 2 semi recessed, 4 under the wings on 4 individual pylons.   2 missiles on each wing.  2 on the wing tips.<br><br>3. Rafales can carry up to 8 MICAs. Mica comes in 2 variants... Active radar and IIR range. Which means that potentially one can fire the IIR version at a BVR radar without betraying its position in a stealth condition. The IRST would be used to cue the seeker of the IIR Mica to the target.<br><br>Again, as I have previously commented, if RSAF is to get a strike aircraft, Rafale will come up on top of Typhoon.

Here are some of the data I dug out:<br><br>RBE2 electronic scanning radar<br>Developed by Thomson-CSF/DETEXIS, the RBE2 combines a brandnew concept with the expertise built up by this company on previous radars.

Functions include :<br>------------<br>Air-to-air : long-range detection and tracking of multiple air targets, in look-down or look-up mode, and in all-weather and EM environments.

And it has promised integration with any customer specified weapon.

However, when the all-up superbug, meaning when it gets its AESA radar and its IDECM suite, it will definitely not lose to the Rafale or the Typhoon in the avionics department...still I'd rather we not get the superbug<br><br></div>

It was revealed in Flight Int'l that for a while the Apache deal hung in the blance over US refusal to clear Longbow radar to Singapore, thats when we started talking about the Tiger, and suggested it was a ploy to get Boeing to put pressure on the US government to clear the Longbow export.

Given the fair engagement condition and rules of engagement, Flanker/Adder/Amraamski will produce some amazing feat but will not have the kill ratio. Russians equipment are not known for their reliability. Rafale-Mica, Typhoon-AMRAAM-Derby will probably achieve close to a 1 shot 1 kill, whereas the Flanker/Adder will probably achieve more like a 3 shot 1 kill.<br><br>Thus, RSAF will still have to maintain quantity again as well as quality edge against potential opponents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing to do with the Adder, but I read a report from AFM on the Eritrea-Eithiopia conflict where MiG-29s mixed it up with Su-27s, and a commonly recurring theme was the abysmal performance of the MiG against the Sukhoi and even worse, the rock bottom performance of the R-27/AA-10 Alamo. The summary was that the R-27s score fof 0 kills for around 10 fired is worse than the AIM-7E2s in Vietnam. And no the planes were not flown by native pilots, they were flown by Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries.<br><br>Back to the Adder, has anyone seen a report confirming RMAF has the Adder? AFAIK the original upgrade for the RMAF was Adder capability, but nothings firmed up on the Adder. I just have a nagging feeling its like their Skyhawks in the 80s, wired for Mavericks, but they never got them...if thats the case with the Adders then all they;ve got for MiG BVR are the rubbish short burn R-27s<br></div>
