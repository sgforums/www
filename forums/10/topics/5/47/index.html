            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>This Â“little rock islandÂ” was controlled and administered by Singapore for over 130 years, and Malaysia has always accepted this arrangement up until 1979 Â– when someone from the Malaysian side woke up from their sleep and decided to add this unfounded claim to their list of claims against Singapore in the tit-for-tat exchange of issues to be resolved.<br><br>In a similar dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia over their cross claims for the rights of ownership over two islands in East Malaysia - Pulau Sipadan and Pulau Ligitan Â– the International Court of Justice had ruled in favor of the Malaysian Claim.<br><br>The decision was ruled over the fact that Malaysia had the effective administrative control of these islands for the last 100 over years, and was not based on the Continental Shelf geographical demarcation, nor was the decision based on historical treatises dating from the Colonial Days with the native Sultanates of that area, nor the treatise between the Dutch and English Colonial Rulers to mark their lines of controls in South-east Asia.<br><br>Based on this background, it is little wonder that Singapore has stood firm in insisting that Malaysia bring this matter to the International Court of Justice.<br><br>It is also not too difficult to understand the reluctance of the Malaysian Government to quickly put their signature to an Agreement to bring this matter to the International Court of Justice Â– when they had agreed with the Singapore Government to do so since 1998.<br><br>It is also not too surprising that the Malaysian PM in his brilliance prefer to resort to rhetoric and make statements to the media to whip up the emotions of Malaysians over this matter, and to distort reality in their own favor.<br><br>This matter is not just about a little rock island that is more then 4 hours travel by boat from the Singapore shore line, as its significance is the strategic location of the island that allow us a toe hold access to the South China Sea; and from which we can monitor traffic that traverse this strategic sea way (see the photo in www.thestar.com.my December 25 edition in which you can see the new constructions of microwave relay stations, and some Â‘sigcom antennasÂ’).<br><br>The mistake in selling away the Christmas Island (located in the Indian Ocean Â– just off the west coast of Indonesian Sumatra) back in the early 1950Â’s will not be repeated.<br><br>The Christmas Island was similarly administered by Singapore then, and was sold by the Lim Yew Hock Government to the Australian for a sum of S$2.00(??? I stand to be corrected); and the Australian Government then leased the island to a mining company that mined the phosphate rich island for over 30 years and generating revenue of over a billion times the amount that Singapore was paid.<br><br>When Â“push comes to shoveÂ”, we should be prepared to shove when the other side do not wish to be reasonable and logical but decide to play tough.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>national soverignity cannot be compromise. if today they take that piece of rock, then tomorrow they will demand something else.  by giving in to their demands, they will ask for more. on one hand we must stand firm on the other hand we must allow the diplomats to do their job. it is pretty clear that they are using this issue to further their own political mileage. so let us just sit back and watch this wayang. no point getting all worked up, this wayang is not worthy of  our energy and attention. their outburst is nothing new. i think singaporeans are used to their rheotic by now...... sometimes i just wondered why those people up north are not tired of repeating the same issue again and again.......... more long-winded than an auntie....</div>

Im sorry to say it is not worth it ( compare to an attack on homeland ), as the UN court have not official deem anything yet. However if the crisis is needed , i did not say i will not fight for Singapore.<br><br>War isnt the best choice in crisis . On ur statement in the past threads , it seems that almost every crisis u like it to be solve with violence . Malaysia isnt stupid to sent her troops in now, to be deem as the bad guy and face with Singapore , a stronger opponent. If malaysia will to sent her troops , there are other measures to use.<br><br>The best measure , is to complain to the UN and force malaysia out of the island , without casualties on our side. If she dun give a damm , then we will wack with all means. Wining conflicts dun always need force , u can use other ways to win it without force and casuaties. By complaining to the UN , they could be seen as a bad guy , thus maybe we are in a more fravourable site.<br><br>If she will to sent her troops now , then by all means fight  if the govt calculated it to be worth. But b4 the UN official says anything , i susgest both country relax.<br><br>Whelther i want to fight for Singapore or not , is up to mi , non of ur business. Try putting mi to the LGB and try stop all those senseless statement.</div>
