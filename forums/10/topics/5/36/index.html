I am sick and tired of listening to this garbage. Yes, you have a rapid deployment force, so tell Mahathir to use it... if he dares... Let us all burn in hell together after that.<br><br>The MLRS are still in Brazil for your info... and it takes awhile before new weapons are integrated and acquire OP status... Think!

If anything, its the MAF thats more for show and on paper than the SAF.<br><br>Yes, MAF has sent UN observers, peacekeepers and cannon fodder to Somalia and lotsa other places. So?? Does it make them bullet-proof? I for one thing, am not fussy about the small arms I use... M16, SAW, MG or even the SAR21... If it pumps lead, I can  use it.

If you don't agree, state your objection in a matured manner or don't come! No need to get personal or abusive here.<br><br>Nobody here wants war. Singapore is not the Israel of Asia.

            <div class='col-md body'>To all the fellow Singaporean, I think it is time Mindef/SAF should look at getting a handful of offensive weapons like MLRS. I think some neighbour(s) think that by getting some offensive weapons, they have grown in confidence in bullying Singapore. They think that they now can easy crush Singapore and SAF.  Sometimes the best defense is offense. And the best defense is psychological offense.  If Mindef/SAF will get stuffs like MLRS, RSAF get long range guided munitions like Israeli made Popeyes, RSN equipped with Block 2 Harpoons which are capable of destroying land targets, I think potential enemies will then realise that everytime they try their scare Singapore or think that they can bully Singapore both militarily or politically, they are wrong. Dead wrong. Singaporean will shown them that   Singaporean are a bunch of survivors. They will not be defeated before the enemies themselves are being stung so badly that they would be totally disfigured.<br><br>However, I do think that SAF can really be a real power if we do have a small division of entirely professional soldiers. Don't know what is the sign-on rate but I'm sure that given good vocation in the armed forces with a decent pay, there will be some people in who would be professional soldiers. Afterall, all the pilots are professionals. Most of the Navy personnels are professionals. Its time the army should form professional soldiers. Yes, get at least a few gurkhas or form some foreign legion where SAF could send for combat peacekeeping roles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, we have always been buying American stuff, but have you ever thought of the day when we may be selling American equipment to..... America?!!!? Dont believe, then hear me out! It seems that their SOCOM is considering acquiring the 6 CH-47D Chinooks that we have as interim replacements for the MH-47E helis lost or damaged during the operations in Afghanistan or Philippines. Our Ch-47s are very attractive to them as ours are already structurally configured for the same enlarged 7,827 litre fuel tanks on the MH-47Es, which they would convert the CH-47s into, should they acquire them. With Singapore intending to standardise on the CH-47SD version, such a sale may actually have a good chance of coming true.<br>On other news, Malaysia seems to want to address their shortfall in MPA capability. It seems like they are considering upgrades on theirBeech Kings among other options.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Joe Black<br><br>I agree with you that many of casual military enthusiasts lack an appreciation of the military balance between Singapore and Malayisa. That is the reason why we have to defend the defensibility of our country to our singaporean friends and to retort the superficial dismissal of the SAF capabilities by our neighbours. This is not confine to civilians only and even within the 2 country services, the junior officers and men lack such an appreciation. This is dangerous as it leads to an inflated sense of self confidence and an underestimation of the opponent capabilities. However I believe that the higher commands on both side of the Causeway do have an understanding of each other's capability and in times of tensions,it should be their duty to brief the poltical leaders on such before the leadership decides on an provocative actions. Deterrence is lost when your enemy is incompetent and fail to see your strengths and signals. Offensive weapons?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I never believe in the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> All of you know MINDEF/SAF aquisition policies - low profile and staggered - we do not want to be seen as triggering off an arm race especially now. Any immediate announcement of arms purchase would lead immediate to charges of sparking an arms race by our neighbours and escalate the tensions. Let the SAF continue with its current policy. The whole world do not need to be aware of our capabilities but only the right people in the opposition. We are a peaceful country  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the idea of a regular fighting force, a division is perharps a bit too big. 2 brigades would be ideal - These brigades could be our developemental forces. As for mercenary, don't mean to put you down Joe Black but the idea of recruiting mercenaries to fight for us is abhorring  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Much more land means more places to develop and more spacing for the population, no water issues, bigger place for armed forces to train, no more complaint about RSAF incursion, no more long waits at the causeways just to get to the other side. Man, Sir Stanfort Raffles should have have bought Johor rather than just the Singapore island. Man, PAP should have pursuaded the Sultan of Johor to join Singapore when during the 1965 break off from the federation.<br><br>I'm sure the next time we have the opportunity to do so, we would definitely do it RIGHT !!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If Indonesia wants any confrontation with Singapore, then they will have to be prepared to lose the Riau islands.<br><br>Anyway, with all these war talks putting aside, I hope we all can learn to live in peace and not being so overly sensitive or insensitive. Malaysia has got to learn to not bully Singapore whenever they are about to go for election. That's not very neighbourly. B4 they complaint about Singapore anything, perhaps they should take a mirror and look at themselves first.<br><br>Why are they constantly trying to pull out the mote in one's eye but not a beam in their own?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is such an interesting topic you guys are discussing. i've been reading your posts everyday. i'm getting hooked on S'pore &amp; it's military now.<br><br>Joe Black: about your comment "PAP SHOULD HAVE PERSUADED THE SULTAN OF JOHOR TO JOIN S'PORE DURING THE BREAK OFF FROM THE FEDERATION" i think that those were such dangerous times back in 1965 S'pore is really lucky to have gotten it's independance! S'pore had virtually no military of any kind &amp; was in total mercy of malaysia. LKY &amp; the entire 1st generation leaders could have been arrested &amp; executed for treason if someone had more radical views were in charge of malaysia back then. if mahathir mohammad were PM, he would have killed LKY &amp; his team &amp; S'pore would have never been born. not to mention alot of ethnic chinese malaysians would have been purged too. if they had tried to persuade the sultan of johor to leave malaysia &amp; join S'pore, it would have been unacceptable to kuala lumpur. it's hard to imagine today becasue S'pore is armed to the teeth but in the beginning of it's independance it was very scary.<br><br>tripwire: your views about indonesia &amp; thailand taking large chunks of malaysia if it is at war with S'pore is very interesting. thailand i would have no doubt will make a move on malaysia but as for indonesia i have second thoughts. you forgot the "muslim" factor. if S'pore is at war with malaysia then won't the population of indonesia rise up to side with their islamic brothers of malaysia?? in fact i'm afraid that much of the entire muslim world would be bent on supporting malaysia! they would be sending funds &amp; arms to help them fight S'pore. &amp; god know's what the savages in both indonesia &amp; malaysia do to the ethnic chinese in those 2 countries. we would see violence directed towards them worse than the anti chinese riots of the 60's &amp; the one's in indonesia in 1997.<br><br>------------------<br>"Is it me or the sword you want?"~Jen Yu<br>CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON</div>
