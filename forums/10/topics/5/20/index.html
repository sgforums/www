            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia Cinas can be real pain in the asses too.  Many of the ignorant but loud mouthed. What a combination.<br><br>What i find the most disturbing in this kinda arguement is that most ppl like to bring up nuclear bombs/missiles.  "One nuclear bomb and singapore drown liao." or "One nuclear bomb and What singapore?"  Yes, 1 nuclear bomb, Singapore will be more or less gone, but, its the same for any of the countries around us.  One 120Megaton yield will blow up malaysia too.  1 120 megaton warhead in jarkata would probably see the end of Indonesia as we know it.  No country can be nuclear proof, which is why the United States is pursuing its anti-ballistic missile defense. COs even a country as big and advanced as the US is vulnerable to Nuclear weapons.<br><br>Speaking of which, even IF indonesia plans on offensive operations against singapore, it won't do anything fancy like paratroops or seaborne platforms carrying troops and tanks.  Paratroopers drop from planes, PLANES can be shot down.  And I believe RSAF has the ability to attain total air-superiority.<br><br>What would be the most interesting though, would be the Indonesian Special forces.  Many of them could be in Singapore already, posing as workers in many construction sites. Now imagine that!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is quite true. But I dun think rite now Indonesia wil do such a thing. They wun haf enuff $$ to maintain an army here. Nor do they haf the capability to ship weapons of destruction here to Singapore. So even if they manage to get some undercover here, wat's the use if they cannot fire back?<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>

FREE MARKET... under the WTO and FTA with other nation... the key is to make the world our market and source of production.<br><br>The indonesians and malaysians too will have to become integrated into the global market OR forever be playing catching up with singapore and the rest of the world.<br><br>With globalization of trade... countries will be less inclined towards resolving conflicts through war due to the chain effects and perpetrators would be dealt with most harshly first by the military and then the piranas conglomerates out to exploit a wounded nation sucking it dried.<br><br>to benefit fully from free and open trade.. information must be permitted to flow freely. govt controls on censorship and trade protection must be lifted. such move are easier for nations which are smaller and have no specific racial preferential treatment.( aka singapore vs malaysia and indonesia)<br><br>Through free transfer of information... religions like islam would be open to challenges from the world opinion and would see its influence curtailed or significantly challenged.<br><br>with trade barriers removed... and free flow of goods and manpower... the world becomes borderless and the function of govt will be downgraded to simply regulatory functions. war would be fought between corporations using money and talents.<br><br>In time... singapore with its much advance economy, manpower and infrastructure will continue to rise above malaysia and indonesia in certain areas... this is only normal since no countries can be best in everything.<br><br>To give an example.... singapore is a small nation in a global economy that is dominated since 1819 by much bigger nations, rich and powerful countries like america, europe and japan... yet it survived and prospered. how much more economically powerful is america , europe and japan compare to indonesia and malaysia in the future??<br><br>But it is true that we are beginning to loose some advantage in some areas with regards to geographical location. But with advance telecommunication and transportation.. other opportunities have opened up.<br><br>Our survival is not dependent on the failure of our neighbour, we dont parasitize them... our survival depends on us... our link with the world, to be frank... i support the govt drive to move more of our investments further away then just malaysia and indonesia... its never wise to put too many eggs in one or 2 basket.<br><br>the threat of globilization is most profound against govt and religion... both instituition aimed to control people through threats of isolation or retribution and force of arms or laws.</div>

Japan testimony that the bomb which ruin Hiroshima/Nagasaki just like a "SUN" which suddenly appear so near and so hot. Everything was burn to ashes in 0.1 - 5 sec, as fast as the speed of sound.<br>So even though, ANTI AIR Missle can shoot the bomb, will it prevent to explode ?<br>ASIAN : China, Korea, and India have those Nuclear heads.<br><br>4. Bomb always create earthquake. Earthquake will quake more heavily on small island than in big island. More thin guitar string, the sound it produce will be "higher" (in frequency), it shakes more. Although, maybe, Singapore's HDB is earthquake proof, but what human can do against nature disaster.<br><br>If SG want to survive at war, SG should see how Israel survive. Israel is *always* supported by US, simply because US's major religion is Christian and they beleive if they war against Israel, God will curse them.<br>US also *always* support British since they know their origin is from that country.<br>Let's hope British support SG, then US will support SG as well, then US's Cruiser will be major key.<br><br>No offence    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>well say my son,... to all singapore fucker... read this and u will know how small ur stupid country is... 3.5 million!!!! hahahahhah even those DOGS population in Malaysian also more then this man!!! hahahahahha so how can u guys have war with us??? think think think... use ur stupid brain and think....[/B][/QUOTE]<br><br>war is no longer emphasize on numbers.... its technology that counts now.... one nuke singapore gone.... one nuke... malaysia also gone.... hahaahaaaa.......<br><br>4 nukes... and even indonesia goes up in smoke.... hahahaaaa........<br><br>one stupid flu virus kills 20 million people in spain in 1918. big fuck about 22 million people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm.....RMN-BEST<br><br>so resort to such a insult in the post clearly display the level of your intelligence. Do you think that by saying these empty word will have so much impact on us? It's all empty words...say only no action...<br><br>And if you have so much courage as to insult other's  why have to resort it in your language? Such a coward. if you wanna insult, say IT OUT, dun dilly dally like a person with no balls.<br><br>Sure, you are proud that you can speak malay while some of us don't understand? But so what? what does it prove? We can use whatever language that you dun understand to insult you but I choose not to cos by doing that will bring me to the same level as you.<br><br>Sure...Malaysia has tanks, we didn't deny it....if you follow our previous post, you'll find that we even list out the tanks of Malaysia.....unless you are jumping into conclusion that attacking us solely for your pleasure. You are only making a fool of yourself, a jester in this post.<br><br>And for your info, do you know what tank(in the malaysian army website)is that? If you do, good for you but if you dunno, let me tell you, it's a 90mm scorpion tank. Wow! 90mm is bigger than Singapore's 75mm tank BUT every scorpion tank your have, we have ten 75mm tanks against it....DUH! Yup! That's the ratio for a SMALL ISLAND compared wif a BIG COUNTRY like yours.<br><br>And besides swearing around, why don't you do something contructive, like give SOLID facts of what the Malaysian army has and what the Singapore army should be afriad of instead of blabbing nonsense like a barbaric kid with no education.<br><br>If you look at the previous post on a person called "eye"...he's malaysian and he dun go blabbing and insulting like you...and I respect him for that. And you just came by and damage the image of your country.....<br><br>Do you understand? why you do just study hard to improve on your language so you can do a proper debate instead of juz swearing empty words like a hooligan....and stop surfing the net and embarass yourself.<br><br>As usual, when every malaysian loses a debate, they'll insult more and bring out the "water" issue.....how typical and coward. Threaten us with water? cut it off ....you cut off water to us and your Johor gets no clean water too. Who purifys the water for Johor for the past 30 year? Make a guess. And in 15 years, who needs malaysia water...we produce our own water. So threaten us while you can.<br><br>PS: did I swear?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Silenthunter (edited 02 September 2001).]</div>
