Singapore as the israel of SEA. ..  note that Israel defeated all the arab nations which went against her in the Arab-Israeli war. . ., strange eh? all of them together can't whack the israelis dead. . .</div></blockquote>please lah... that comparison is NOT valid. it is only partly true geographically in the sense that we are surrounded by Indonesia and Malaysia...<br><br>these two countries can hardly be considered overtly hostile and ideologically irreconciliable to the fact of Sg's existence... in the early days of the 6-Day War and Yom Kippur War, the Arabs fully wanted to push the Jews into the sea... the existence of a Jewish state was totally unacceptable to them.<br><br>since when did <strong>official</strong> circles in Malaysia and Indonesia ever articulate such violent rhetorics about Sg? well DuH they don't always agree with us or like us very much, but wiping us off the map is never an option to them... Konfrontasi doesn't count... Sukarno wanted to wipe BOTH Sg AND Malaysia off the map if he could... and it was hardly comparable to anything that took place in the Middle East... Israel really faced an overt existential threat in those days.<br><br>so this "israel of asia" parallel is really shallow, alarmist and crude and only the most superficial and unread individual would actually be tempted to use it to make a shallow and invalid point.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what i think is, it is unlikely for any ONE incident to trigger a war all of a sudden.<br><br>it would almost certainly be the result of a series of gradual escalation. face it: both sides have too much to lose and there will be doves trying to resolve the problem before the problem gets out of hand.<br><br>but of late, the sudden resurgence of one issue after another in rapid succession and sometimes, concurrently is dangerous indeed... if linkages are ever drawn between unresolved issues, it could easily get out of hand since both sides might decide that it has more to lose by compromising on several issues it perceives as its vital interests or sovereignty all at once.<br><br>IF for instance, the island affair, the water dispute and the air-space issues ALL flare up at once, it would indeed be a dangerous situation since all three issues touches upon both country's vital interests and inviolable sovereignty...<br><br>at at this rate, with M'sia in a reckless hurry to resolve a range of issues which have defeated the best efforts of both foreign ministries and prime ministers for decades, it might actually push tension between the two countries over the edge.<br><br></div>

Its your herds whose making such wild accussation where its doubtful to believe with. Your herds seems to be more uncivalised than me whom intentionaly provoke others, espesially from M'sia. I do speak like a civilised men. It is your narrow minds that provoke me to do so. If you wanted a simple discussion, start at your ownself and tell that to others. I'll stop this kind of wild accusation if you initiate it first. Although the forum is meant for S'poreans, it didn't stop us to voice our own concern about your own attitude of insulting others. You'll said that we started first. Based on what??!! Just because we speak the truth, doesn't mean that we're the bad person. We do that because we know that we're right. Its ok that you'll wanted to ignore me, but its not gonna be an excuse for me to encounter you'll statements and opinion. All the reply from my statements shows that none of you seem to comfortable to the truth that simply spilling over in this forum. Bontot sama telinga sudah panas ke???!! Ayo, so PITY.
