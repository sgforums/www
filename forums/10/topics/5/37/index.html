            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Viper and all.<br>On whether sanctions are inevitable or not, is not so certain. For one thing, if the World construes our pre-emptive strike into Malaysia as a component of self defence as mandated in the UN charter (Israel argued this sucessfully as well) then snactions will not follow from the global community.<br>Of course we can expect the muslim states to go rabid and stop trade altogether or in degrees less.<br>But I think here is that our pre-emptive strike must put us on moral high ground. i.e. it has to be take only in the face of impending malaysian military action..and/or in the face of disproportionately aggressive exercises, like the move of substantial land assets to launch points in johor and the increased activity of air patrols and aggressive to-ing and fro-ing on our international borders.<br>Anyway, i think i can assume quite safely that S'pore's action will always be a strike first mentality, cos by the time we wait till they strike, we'd be in the shits.<br><br>Now assuming that the muslim world embargos us, the questio is, will the rest of the western world follow? I sincerely doubt it. The US will once again try to play peacemaker and urge restraint on both sides, while quickly transferring all manner of equipment to us and they will send their pacific fleet near striking distance. I'm sure we will have Israel's vote in any action, as we will have the votes and undoubted sympathies of most of the western world.<br><br>I guess it all really depends on how the conflict is painted to be - whether it is one painted as national survival? or one painted as a secular state vs muslims, or a conflict borne out of ensuring our water routes; and depending on how the conflict is played out, the world will react accordingly.<br>It also depends on how long we are willing to coil the SAF up before unleashing it on malaysia; releasing it too early will not earn us sympathy. Releasing it too late will do us no good.<br>Ah well.<br>Pity the footsloggers like myself then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

For one thing, if the World construes our pre-emptive strike into Malaysia as a component of self defence as mandated in the UN charter (Israel argued this sucessfully as well) then snactions will not follow from the global community.<br>Of course we can expect the muslim states to go rabid and stop trade altogether or in degrees less.<br>But I think here is that our pre-emptive strike must put us on moral high ground. i.e. it has to be take only in the face of impending malaysian military action..and/or in the face of disproportionately aggressive exercises, like the move of substantial land assets to launch points in johor and the increased activity of air patrols and aggressive to-ing and fro-ing on our international borders.<br>Anyway, i think i can assume quite safely that S'pore's action will always be a strike first mentality, cos by the time we wait till they strike, we'd be in the shits.<br><br>Now assuming that the muslim world embargos us, the questio is, will the rest of the western world follow? I sincerely doubt it. The US will once again try to play peacemaker and urge restraint on both sides, while quickly transferring all manner of equipment to us and they will send their pacific fleet near striking distance. I'm sure we will have Israel's vote in any action, as we will have the votes and undoubted sympathies of most of the western world.<br><br>I guess it all really depends on how the conflict is painted to be - whether it is one painted as national survival? or one painted as a secular state vs muslims, or a conflict borne out of ensuring our water routes; and depending on how the conflict is played out, the world will react accordingly.<br>It also depends on how long we are willing to coil the SAF up before unleashing it on malaysia; releasing it too early will not earn us sympathy. Releasing it too late will do us no good.<br>Ah well.<br>Pity the footsloggers like myself then     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Hi No Frill, I agree with you on that call. However theres a limit to what construes self-defence in the event of a pre-emptive strike. If the strike were to make limited inroads into opposing territory (the often mentioned "Mersing Line" or a little beyond), and stop there, and make it clear to the world our reasons for the move and pledging not to advance any more, it would make sense. However to follow the previously mentioned plan of going to the extent of occupying the current Peninsular Malaysian states would take the concept of "active self defense" a little far. While we could garner world sympathy for the first course of action(if, and only if we sell it to the world in the right way), even the world's best PR agency would have a lot of difficulty selling the 2nd option.<br><br>Of course, theres the question of where do we go from there? Do we have the stomach to hold even land up to Mersing, together with the inevitable casualties from an active underground resistance?<br><br>The road to war must always be the absolute last resort. There will be no winners and losers in a war between Singapore and Malaysia, just 2 big losers. Which is the very reason why I condemn in no uncertain terms the two-bit politicians and journalists from those rag-sheets who always use the "W" whenever theres a point of dispute, and the uneducated mobs who lap up their every word.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 29 April 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 29 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alas Viper, logic and restraint doth come in small quantites in an any political dispute and even if present, logic must bow down to the whim of the maddening crowd.<br>Experience has shown that govts soldom have no choice to but to initiate war in the face of a determined populace to have one. Sadly or otherwise, it is then the demons who whip up the winds of war that best hold sway and reign in a volatile country and not the more restrained politicians.<br>Which is why, when push comes to shove, it is not the logic of mutual and utter destruction that will hold us back from the brink of war, but a well armed and oiled SAF that stands as a fierce deterrant.<br>And if all else fails, then to be a 'thick-green line' between the marauding hordes and our civilisation.<br>If it does come down to it, ours indeed, will be a fight to the finish, with our national survival and our very way of life hanging on the trigger fingers of our young men and women on the front lines.<br><br>And such is the weight of responsibility on our shoulders as NS men and NSFs; something which some posters on this forum tend to quickly forget.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At a seminar last year with DJOPD, someone brought up a question which is at the heart of the current discussion : ~ The SAF mission is to ~ secure a swift and decisive victory over any aggressor~ what lies after the victory? What constitute a victory? Does it means the total annexation of the enemy territory like what someone mentioned or just partial occupation of a buffer zone?I agree that a total occupation would be a gross overstretch of the SAF capability....would any sane politician want to bear the burden of administering a hostile Malaysia. Then again if it was not a complete defeat, we run the risk of having a sanctuary for resistance and mischief in the North. Example the US policy of non - invasion of North Vietnam was valid from a geopolitical point of view but it led to an impossible war in the south. A continual stream of men and materiel flowed into the South and the North knew that it could wait and outlast the US in a war of attrition. What about the occupation of a buffer zone? Should it come to such, the resumption of peace and normalacy could never be contemplated for a long time. It will remain a festering sore just as the Golan Heights is in Israeli - Syrian relationship? Any occupation would inevitably lead to a certain insurgency campaign. Hence as known by all, the demographics, terrain, defensibility, strategic assets and such of a occupation zone should be carefully consider to minimise the effectiveness of such a campaign, a political engineering campaign set in motion in the occupied territories and troops must be trained in such duties. What if we fall back after teaching the Malaysians a lesson like what the Chinese did in 79 to Vietnam? Who can gurantee that a Malaysian Government reasonable to Singapore will come to power? Will we have a Country having learnt its lesson and willing to seek an accommodation with us or a country bent on revenge? The chinese saying ~ to cut the weed, remove the roots~ ...... All 3 options are fraught with their own dangers and political solutions to<br>the causes of a war must be found and implemented in the aftermath whoever is the victor<br>....perharps the best way would be the establishment of a buffer zone policed by ASEAN .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> the thought of a ASEAN taking a path to a NATO like organisation is amusing enough  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>The Israelis faced the same conundrum as us in event of war back in 82. Should the Invade and occupy a buffer zone in Lebanon in clear out the Hizbollah? They made the decision and paid the price. Perharps we should learn from there and draw our conclusions<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is a victory in our context? I guess that can only mean that we have established a buffer zone of sorts, to be eventually turned into a DMZ, where the malaysians will be unable to effectively threaten us again.<br>As to what happens, I fear that the evil W word will only lead to a much larger conflict in the far future even if we are 'victorious'. The Germans seethed with resentment for years after WW1 and all it took was a charasmatic leaderlike Hilter to whip them up again to reclaim their lost glory...and launch WW2<br>Alas, was is never a solution in the long term, but as in all things, a mere short term solution which will be empty if political factors do not come into play.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all, I believe we do have good discussion about the hypothetical scenarios of what if Singapore is attacked and how Singapore should response.  I believe we all have thought about this hypothetical scenarios and would draw different conclusions.<br><br>I personally feel that we should hope that none of our discussion will ever come to fruition, but if so, SAF will be ready to do its job. Personally, I don't see that crushing our neighbours would be achievable or a viable solution. Singapore, being such a small nation, can't possibly take over the most of Malaysia penisula just as Japan could never take control of the whole of China in WW2. Singapore does not have the size in population to do so.<br><br>If it really comes down to having to fight, I think at most creating a buffer zone and plead the US to come to our aid is the only real solution. Just like Australia can never truly defend itself. It could only try to hold out its enemies till the aid comes across the big pond. Hopefully the whole of Australia would not have overrun.<br><br>I tend to agree with Solaris with his??her?? analysis. Either Singapore attempts to overrun Malaysia or simply create a buffer zone, Singapore loses. Singapore only wins if it doesn't need to fight at all.<br><br>Thus, arming itself sufficiently such that it will never have to fight is perhaps the best policy.<br><br>Perhaps we can also learn from the China vs Taiwan situation. If war breaks out everyone stand to lose everything. Everyone only wins when there wars are only fought on papers and through dialogues.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> my 2 cents<br></div>

We have no nukes, no strategic bombers, no WMD to ensure something like that, even if we wanted to. And thus to send in waves after waves of our soldiers to fight a politically blind war with no definite purpose is a horrible and unproductive solution.<br>Our economy will fall to ruin while we attempt to put down a possiblly hostile population, with no intention of submitting. Moreover, we'd lose all the moral high ground of acting in self defence if we over stay our assault. The Vietnamese were seen as 'peaceful intervenors' in 1979 in Cambodia, but then they, er, sort of like overstayed for 10 years! and they lost whatever moral mandate they started with (though i think that too was a glib lie) Further Vietnam became tied down in attritional guerilla warfare which drained their economy dry.<br><br>So i guess the only possible solution is a limited offensive aimed at carving out a huge hole in their country; then to fight a holding battle or in the worst case, a retrograde operation over a few weeks, to give time for the UN to act.<br><br>I do wistfully wish that yes, perhaps that we still lived in the lands of yore, where we as conquering hordes can sweep over the enemy's land and destroy evernthing that displeases us in our path, subjugate their populace and crush all resistance. But sigh, this unfortunate little blimp called international law has put a dent in such ambitions  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

AND if we dont take out the entire malaysia fast enough... i would fear the day when muslim war materials and troops starts to land on penang or kedah... the consequences would be extremely severe....<br><br>Furthermore... as long as MAF still controls ports to the west of peninsula malaysia... indonesian reinforcement could land with impunity... that will be double bad news for us....<br><br>SAF is a NS force... much of its men are NSmen... we have no resources in singapore and we cannot go on a war footing indefinitely...<br><br>Malaysia knew that too damn well.. they know that time is on their side... and for everyday they drag singapore into a war... they draw closer to victory....<br><br>thus we cannot allow a drawn out war.... we need to move in fast... end it fast... dissect malaysia up and make sure the malaysian national anthem stays in the museum permanently... its a fight of survival... only one flag will continue to face the wind...the other one will be six feet underground.<br><br>[This message has been edited by tripwire (edited 29 April 2002).]</div></blockquote>Hello Tripwire<br><br>Your points are valids. It is a hopeless situation isnt it the aftermath of a war for the SAF..... full occupation and be damned...partial occupation and be damned. My question would be: what lies after full annexation of Malaysia?</div>
