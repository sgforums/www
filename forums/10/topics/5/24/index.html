            <div class='col-md body'>In the source, how many missiles the T90S can carry and weather it have a radar anot is mentioned. I saw the T90S in a series of VCD called Firepower2000. Its shows the T90S demonstrating its capabilities in the United Arab Emirates. It is being exposed to a desert battlefield. Maybe the T90S is most effectively used in this kind of warfare? Russian tanks has an advantage in open plains because of their fashion of making tanks low and flat. e.g T72.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Btw, the Malaysians are probably gonna get their Su-30MKs.  The Russians aren't just starting the line for Malaysia's purchases, but rather together with India's order for the initial 40.  India's order may rise up to 100 Su-30MKIs.  Either the Malaysians will recieve the same configurations the Indian air force or a default export version.  The Indian Su-30s are very err, "customized."<br><br>Their Su-30MKIs include AL-37F with thrust vectoring nozzels as well as several french avionics.  Maybe Malaysia might recieve the same configuration... or maybe they will just get the old AL-31s.  I mean, all we have to do is have President Nathan fly over to India to have a little tea-time chat right?<br><br>In anycase, RSAF Typhoons are still gonna come up tops.  Most already believe the Typhoon to be 2nd only to the F-22, yet at only fraction of the price.  In fact, there is a vicious rumor that Typhoons were specifically designed to counter Su-27 and its family.  Nah, I don't think so... I doubt the RSAF will do something so bad as to counter Malaysia's future purchase.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, actually what you heard was NOT a rumour. It is true. One of the program goals was to be able to defeat the next generation Soviet fighter, which happens to be the SU-37 and SU-30MKIs... It seems the Malaysians will have the SU-30MKE, which is based on the MKI with a few modifications...meaning they will be getting a very good fighter... do you really think they will do something stupid like buying 2 fighter designs again? (Flankers and SuperHornets). I'd rather they buy Russian, as Russian aircraft can be handled from long range due to less capable avionics...If they get the SuperHornet along with the IDECM... it might be bad for us...</div>

I dont think they will be that drastic. Also, recently, their current Hornets just got the ASPJ jammer pod from USA. For their Flankers, yah, I forgot that the MKE version will have foreign avionics, though I dont think France and Germany will give a hoot about our relations with them when it comes to business.<br>You think they will get the Flanker, or the SuperHornet, or both?<br></div>

The fighter will be put up jointly by the Rosoboronexport state-owned arms trader, Sukhoi aircraft corporation and Irkutsk Aircraft Production Association (IAPO), Dupond told Interfax-Military News Agency.<br><br>Tales has a huge experience in co-operation with Russian developers and producers of avionics, the representative said. The company's experts took part in development of on-board equipment for the MIG-AT trainer, as well as for the SU-30MKI Flanker fighter, which Rosoboronexport and IAPO are exporting to India.<br><br>The Malaysian variant of SU-30MK will have the cabin's information and control field designed on fifth-generation plane technologies, Dupond said. The minimum of liquid crystal displays will provide the maximum of data for the pilot, which will allow the crew to keep its attention on the main task - piloting and conducting combat operations. The second peculiarity of the SU-30MK avionics is application of laser gyroscopes that, unlike regular gyroscopes, guarantee high accuracy of aerial navigation.<br><br>Dupond did not specify the volume of works that Tales would be responsible for in the course of the SU-30MK design, saying only that his company's participation in the project would be very broad.<br><br></div>

I hope they dont go for the SuperHornet. Other than its performance deficiencies, if Malaysia gets them too, it could be troublesome... to say the least...However, its avionics will be pretty good (referring to its APG-79 radar and its IDECM suite as well as its ATFLIR pod, not the avionics for the first batch of SuperHornets which have F-18C/D avionics for the moment).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm backing the Typhoon fully.  The rafale is a very capable multirole fighter.  But, the typhoon is a primary built for air to air combat, with a secondary strike role.  Also, the typhoon was built to counter future Su-27 variants such as Su-30s which malaysia is purchasing.</div>
