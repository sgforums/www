Since Singapore does not really have much stealth technology and cannot hope to acquire US UCAV in the near term, perhaps Singapore can build a supersonic UCAV to compensate for the lack of stealth.<br><br>As for shooting down the ASTOR rockets, it is definitely possible given a 90KM rocket signature is so much bigger than the Russian made Katyusha rockets.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by solaris:<br>Here is some modification I would like to add<br><br>1. Malaysian 155mm artillery<br><br>Sometime ago, field trials for the GIAT CESAR 155mm self propelled artillery was conducted and I believe a certain quantity was purchased. The South African 155mm - when was this announced?<br></blockquote>it was announced some months ago (not too long). I remebered reading the news from<br>Defense System Daily. It was a small quantity.<br><br><blockquote><br>2. The RMN submarines<br>I believed the winner of the submarine bid was DCN with their Scorpene submarine. I think RMN aquisition plan call for 3. The Scorpene posses a grave maritime menace. However I believe Tony Tan once made a public annoucement that the Challenger class subs are ~training subs~....<br></blockquote>Yes, RMN sub aquisition is from the French. However, the Scorpene is an Italian design. I believe the design was taken from the Italian as French no longer build SSK. Like the Americans and the British, they only build SSN. I think the RMN boats will be equipped with French sonars and fire control computer, etc.<br><br>As for RSN subs, the Sjoormen class is a precurosr to most like the HDW/Kockum build ships, probably a sister ship of A19 boats or even a totally new boat. I believe RSN favour Swedish/German built boats because the baltic sea is very much like the Singapore Straits, Malacca Straits or to that extend the South China sea, being shallow - pretty much green water. The subs built by HDW and Kockums are good at operating at such shallow water, being rather quiet and stealth, but at the same time very agile.  I also think that RSN will probably go with the Sterling AIP or even the German fuel cell.<br><br><blockquote><br>Upgarde for the Army<br><br>1. I am speculating that the light/medium tank will be an indigenous design based on Bionix technology with prominent Israeli influence(fire control and gunnery stabilisation etc). The gun will probably be a 105mm.<br></blockquote>Reasonable assumption. In fact Janes Defence and some other reputated defence journals have already said the same thing. A new like tank is in the pipeline, wholly built and design by ST Engg. It probably uses the same Bionix Chassis (make sense to have common parts to reduce logistic), and an 105mm gun. It is highly likely to have an Israeli made fire control computer and sights (presumedly the Thermal sight and scopes).<br><br>My personal wish is that the new light tank should include a commander Independent Thermal imager with the hunter-killer mode installed. The Tank commander will spot the targets and pass it to the gunner with the press of the button. While the gunner engage the target, the tank command CITV will search for another target. The gun should be fully stablized for firing while on the move. The smoke grenade launcher should also be able to launch a fragmentation grenade tto act like "claymore mines". The tank have add on armour capability and active defensive suite such as the one use on CV90-120mm.<br><br>I also wish that SAF will complement the new tank with some 60+ CV90-120mm tanks or Leo 1A5.<br><br><blockquote><br>2. As mentioned earlier, MLRS should be a technology that the SAF investigate. The introduction of true SP variants of the FH2000 is also a possibility.<br></blockquote>FH2000 itself is self-propelled. I presume you are talking about a true SP like M106 Paladin, AS90 Braveheart, G6, and PzH2000 where the gun is married into a mechanised chassis. Israel has done many of these kind of work. Perhaps SAF could use the Centurion chassis and design a turret that can carry the old M68 gun, M71 gun, the FH88 and FH2000 guns. Perhaps SAF would have true SP guns  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><br>3. Improvement in the army air lift capability. With the completion of the Chinook program, a replacement for the UHIH should be evaluated.<br></blockquote>This is underway. I think it might even be tied to the naval helo program. At this stage NH90 seems to be the leader for the naval helo bid. Alternatively, RSAF can also upgrade UH-1H to UH-1Z like the USN version with the new T700 engines, upgrade cockpit and 4 blades rotors.<br><br><blockquote><br>4. It is unlikely that with the introduction of Igla and Mistral some years back and the fulfillment of our SHORAD requirements, a new SHORAD system will be introduced. The mounting of Igla/Mistral on IFV chassis is a possibility however? A more immediate task is the replacement of the I Hawk and Rapier 2 perharps. I am not sure of their system specifications and performance though. Should the upgrade be extensive enough then replacement might not be neccessary.<br></blockquote>Well, not talking about replacing Igla or Mistral. The Linebacker Bradley and the LAV-AD ait defense system simply adopt a turret that can both launch MANPAD SAMs including Igla, Mistral and Stingers as well as firing the gatling 25mm guns. The turrets also carry integrated target acqusition radars as well as electro-optical sights for target acquistion.<br><br><blockquote><br>5. A low profile area - C4I. Battlefield information system and communications should be improved. By improving information transfer and dessimination, our forces will be able to outmaneurve larger enemy units. No information on this and I don't think anyone will comment on this. However with the SAF emphasis on manoeuvre warfare, there will most probably be interesting developments in this area.<br></blockquote>This has been an onging improvment in the SAF. I didn't mention it as we know that Mindef is at the stage of building up the armed forces ELINT, SIGINT and COMINT capabilities.<br><br><blockquote><br>6. Upgrade of AT capability. I do not think the SAF would introduce a new ATGW system currently. The Spike offers us many interesting possibilities though   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></blockquote>Do not have to. TOW 1A is already in the RSAF inventory in the form of the missiles carried by Fennecs. However, instead of using TOW 1A, SAF could choose to integrate Spike with the Bionix 25mm turret somewhat like the M2/M3 Bradley and the latest LAV 25 turret.<br><br>Just my 2 cents</div>

They should have the Stirling AIP installed, really good flank sonars and also tow-array sonars. A integrated fire control computer and possibly also the Kockums torpedos/weapon handling system not to mention include submerged launched Harpoons as part of the weapon suites. Alternatively, RSN could get the German made Israeli Navy's Dolphin class SSK. They are superb boats.<br><br><blockquote><br>A myth I hope to dispel is the effectiveness of SSN in south china sea waters given the current state of ASW developement in the region.

RSN sub hunting skills need to improve in great steps. The APV are insufficiently armed to deal with SSKs or SSNs. They lack passive sonars. Active sonars are good for chasing subs once you have gotten a general location and range of the sub but it gives away the emmitters location especially the APVs have the hull mounted sonar rather than the tow sonars like the MCVs.<br><br>I believe the new La Fayettes will address these shortfalls.  Effective ASW platforms need to be of usual size to accomodate different types of sonars, plus an ASW helos.  It took the Americans and West Europeans years (during the cold war) to figure out best way to hunt silent predators like the SSNs and SSKs.<br><br>They practiced mock engagement aways the Eastern Block countries and Soviets for many years.<br><br>Furthermore, Australian Collins are known to have "sunk" the USN CVNs during naval exercises of the Hawaiian coasts.<br><br>The OZs and the British are thus much more skillful submariners than RSN sub hunters and submariners. Thus being shot at during war games are not that bad. Can learn heaps of tactics from them. Afterall the Brits did sink Argentians during the Falkland wars and both the Brits and OZz have sunk tons of ships and U-boats during WW2. RSN just started learning anti-surface warfare.<br><br><blockquote><br>3. Air Defence. Is there an overlap between the role of short range missile systems and a flak system?

            <div class='col-md body'>Joe Black:<br><br>I share similar sentiments regarding your views on current RSN ASW developement. The inadequacy is not with the weapon - A224 is a competent enough light ASW torpedo - but rather the sensors. The active MF sonar used by the APV and MCV are useful when the general location of targets are known but suffer from a range handicaps. Having no real submarines to train with also impair ASW system and doctrine training. The Sjoormen aquisition besides developing submarine warfare capabilities in the RSN also has the dual effect of enabling us to conduct proper ASW training. Having real submarines to train with is a rare oppurtunity and one of the principal purpose of having the Lion King excercises with the Indian Navy is to have an oppurtunity to train with their submarines.If anyone has the chance to be in a public visit to RSS Valiant (P91 - MCV) and you are walking through the passageway on the main deck - keep a look out for the wall on your left, there is a plot presented to Valiant by an Indian submarine commander  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> - It shows a plot of Valiant's track togather with that of the submarine and the generation of a firing solution on Valiant - basically telling Valiant that they are KO in war  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Anyway the RSN do have passive sonar system  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and it is in the public domain (no security leak here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) - If you look carefully at the stern of APV 95 RSS Brave, you will notice a coil of cable which can only be a passive towed array system. It yield excellent range and, if deployed skillfully, bearing information - the trade off being that in crowded waters such as the Singapore Straits, ambient noise is too high for effective deployment. I am wondering whether the MPA has an ASW capability? Any information on this in the public domain?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The first part of the contract is the maritime helo contract.

Eliminated were the Super Lynx, Super Seasprite and EH101<br><br>From the French contacts I've spoke to in charge of their weapons sales and procurement side during the recent AA, the naval and army contracts are not linked as some have suggested, though with the 3 contenders having land-based versions, the inference is quite obvious. Notice 2 of the eliminations do not have a land based utility version. In short, not linked *for now*<br><br>As for tactical AD, an SP gun/missile combo like the Tunguska 2S6 seems like a nice idea.
