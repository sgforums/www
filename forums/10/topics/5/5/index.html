If you are looking down on your enemy, I will be very sad for you.<br><br>*actually i am sad for you, i estimate your military knowledge is severely lacking.<br><br>As for USA sitting on Malaysia .. hah hah hah. Why should they? I will bet that our govt will definately beg them to intervene. When Kuwait was invaded by Saddam, half the cost was borne by Saudi Arabia. If we are invaded, be prepared to PAY for USA to send in their troops.<br><br>*no problem, as long as for every dollar i spent, the US makes a few hundred dollars in damages.<br><br>If you are a working person, you will know what value Singapore is to the region. We exists as a springboard into the SEA region. If peace does not exist, we are finished (even govt claims that our growth depends on Indonesian stability) as there will be huge drop in FDI. That means less jobs, less growth, more unress.<br><br>*tell that to those morons around singapore.<br><br>If the day ever comes, I feel sad that the sacrifice that I have put to make this country great will be demolished . Sure we will rebuild ... but what for ... we could have prevented it in the first place by being less arrogant.</div></blockquote>*scared?? no problem, spend more on defence and make sure that no body dares even look at us straight in the eyes lor.</div>

Where you only consider military strength, numbers, techonologies, strategies,etc. But you must consider other implications for the nation, morale, social political and importantly for Singpaore, Economic reprecussions must be analysed.<br><br>*indeed, war is not so simply a matter of throwing men and machine to the front. war in present terms encompose areas far beyond the front line including logistic, technology, economic power, industrial might and geopolitic. the issue is complex and myriad, but it is an issue that has been recieving significant attention locally as can be exemplified by the total defence concept. or as the malaysians see it, total attack.<br><br>* as sun tzu said, the best victory is through without firing a single shot or sending forth a single soldier.<br><br>THe thing is this, what is the nature of singapore, what is it trying to build it self to be ? the answer is an economic centre for the reigon, act as a junction point for buisnesses, and trade.<br><br>* this serves multiple purpose, using the total defence concept.<br><br>*economically it makes singapore stronger and makes all nations that invested in singapore to have a stake in singapore's security, making any aggressor having to factor in the potential of external intervention if they so wish to challenge singapore's sovereign status.<br><br>*socially, trade promotes communication, understanding and cooperation. good jobs and salary makes people contented and more dispose towards peoples of other diverse race and religion. riots and extremism becomes 'expensive' for whoever so wish to break their own ricebowl. with trade and money, even your enemy will smile at you, money can even make your former enemy becomes your strongest allies as both nation joint hands to defend their mutual interest $$$$ ;&gt;<br><br>* military wise, strong economy leads to higher govt revenue. when the govt got more money, govt are able to spend more on defence and since there are more then enough money to go around. it makes high defence spending easily acceptable. in war, the high expenditure can be sustained by a war chest accumulated over the years as national reserves.<br><br>*in peace, the presence of a mighty SAF acts as a strong deterrent against any potential aggressor, whether SAF can fight or not is another matter, but in view of SAF's high competence and high techy weapons, the risk of going to war against singapore simply based on the wishful hope that SAF would simply disintegrate as some claimed here, is kind of a fat hope for any practical leaders, becos if SAF really prove otherwise and fought back with all those impressive weapons, the aggressor face certain national destruction and disintegration, even though singapore may not hold their territory forever, singapore can definitely grind their country's society, economy and military to dirt level which could take the aggressor decades if not centuries to recover.<br><br>*psychologically, it makes us proud to be a nation of success.<br><br>Once War is declared. in a sense Singaproe has already lost. An economix centre is uselesss in war. and many international companies will just pull out and move to a more stable reigon if Singaproe is plunged into war. Investor confidence would vanish. And all the ard work and effort of several generations would vanish with the decleration of war.<br><br>*remember that what you cannot defend dont belong to you or it can be taken away from you easily through force of arms, if you so cherish singapore and what our generations of forefathers have sacrificed for this nation and build what we have now. than you must be ready and stand ready to defend all those that your fathers and you yourself have built up over the years. else you can simply hand it over to the enemies on your knees.<br><br>*indeed, singapore's position is deterence, not actively engaged in a war. to go to war would be an unfortunate event, an event that singapore does not wish to make, but if forced to do so, singapore than must go to war and see that our enemy pays dearly for destroying all that we singaporeans have took generations to build and cherished. therefore, if singapore do ever goes to war, it must go to war with all gloves off and fought to the bitter end, because failure means losing everything we have. we must show our enemy that we cherish our freedom and our peace and prosperity, and as long as singaporeans stand firm and declared their willingness to die for their country, the aggressor would not dare challenge us lightly. your attitude here simply invites the enemy to wack us by declaring yourself incompetent or unwilling or unable to defend what is rightfully yours, so kindly hand over all your stuff including your undies at the custom at malaysia next time you go JB.<br><br>The SAF is just acting as a big flashy stick. Very good for show. Just hope never have to use it attitude. It just keeps the people within the reigon from acting to rashly and to a ceartain extent enforce peace. Its just not worth the trouble for the neihbouring countries to fight against singapore. What would they gain ? The bottom line is NOTHING. Peace is still the most prosperous path for everyone to follow for now, and it should be the attitude of the Singapreo government to ensure that peace will continue.<br><br>*The SAF is not just a big flashy card, a flashy card is worthless in geopolitic, it doesnt adds to deterence, it only invites aggression, everyone can flash card here and there, the SAF must show that it is more than just a mere flashy card, it must show that it is actually a trump card with the ability to tear all the enemies 'cards' to shreds if used.<br><br>Among other things, if the SAF is ever totally mobilised, whose left to tend to the infrastructure of the country ehh ? things don't work on their own people. Since the army compremises a bulk of the work population in singapore. This leaves things wihtin the country in abit of a mess no ? Your power systems, water, sewage, etc.<br><br>* singapore even under total all out mobilisation of all its 500,000 men still leaves behind as many as 1.5million plus civilian working. that is equivalent to 1 in 4 singapore citizen will be pulled from the economy.<br>* economic output will undoubtedly be affected by the lost in manpower and also with the gearing of resources and industrial powers towards supporting the war effort. during the crisis period, national survival and winning the war is the main concern, not growth rate or CPF contribution.<br><br>The government is not stupid. They realise that peace is the only way Singapore to go, for now, things may change in the future.<br><br>* peace has always been the prefered way to go. but sometimes aggressor can come without warning and having a poor military is an invitation to otherwise non aggressive neighbour to invade.<br><br>So my conclusion is that SIngapore does not stand a chance in war as it will die an economic death as soon as war is declared. Since it has no real local industry which manufacture hardware it can sell for ready cash to maintain the economy.<br><br>*your conclusion is worthless as you failed to see the bigger picture of the real world. by your definition, countries like kuwait, taiwan, isreal and hundreds of small nations should have disappeared from the world map. true that some of the above country survived because of external power inteference, but even so, it is victory nontheless, as their flags and not those of their enemies are flying above their land, while pass aggressors with their big land and big populations can only sit back and sulk.<br><br>But i could be wrong and this is just one way to look at the situation. However, being about 10,000 km away from the place may grant me a rather odd way of looking at the situation</div></blockquote>at least you are humble.</div>

SIngapore has no sizable physical industry that can support it financially .<br><br>*what you say is true, if the region is destabilised, singapore will be hit badly by the pullout of foreign buissness. BUT such pullout will not be limited to singapore alone but could affect the whole region as well. as such, the cost of going to war can become very costly and makes any nation around singapore going to war to think thrice. not simply against singapore, but among themselves as well.<br><br>*secondly, economy can be rebuild, BUT a nation lost could be lost forever. in times of war, economic growth is secondary to national war survival. after the war, if we win, we can rebuild, it wouldnt be easy, but at least we will be around to rebuild it. if we loose because we lack the will to defend singapore, then that is the end of singapore history as well as our lives, just think which stupid enemy around us would let hundreds of thoudsands of enemy 'civilians' with years of military training to walk freely around even in occupied territory hopeing that they will all be peaceful as sheep? just ask malaysia if malaysia would accept singapore as part of malaysia knowning that there are 500,000 trained singaporean in military skills, of which 80% are chinese.<br><br>*thirdly, your question on singapore's physical industries ability to sustain singapore economy is probably based on the assumption that the war is going to be protracted and last many years like WW2. lets just say, SAF didnt buy so many stuff just to slug it out over a long period. if ever there was a war, it will be short, brutal and decisive.<br><br>Having said all that, I fully believe that in terms of physical combat, that the Singaporean army has superior tactics, morale and technologies.

Think about it this way: If the Indonesian nation were to disntigrate now and some of the new states are militaristic in nature, will Singaproe survive economically ?<br><br>*first, if ever there is a war, it will not be a protracted war. SAF will see to that, so that is why SAF always gets all the high techy stuff.<br><br>*secondly, what makes you so sure we will leave the enemy economy and industry unmolested?? with superior air power and AAR, RSAF can bomb all the way to hongkong!!<br><br>*indonesia is now weak and poor. divided, each will become even weaker and poorer. weak and poor nation have no bargaining chip to even try to be militaristic. every bullet cost money. no money throw stone lor. if not, why indonesia bother to kowtow to IMF, an organization that has less people then a singapore company!<br><br>Also, while i am convinced that Singapore can win physical combat with the neighbouring armies, to survive after war has been declared, you would probably need to actually conquer part of the neighbouring terretories to become completely self sufficient and to ensure that Singapore survives as a nation state. This may not be possible to do.<br><br>*so soon jump to conclusion what is possible and what is not. lets just say, history sometimes showed the fallibility of man in prediction of what is possible or otherwise. many a great man have made predictions in the past that sounds like an idiots comment in the future. so i wont blame you over this.<br><br>Oh, and about the flshystick thing which i was talking about, i don't understnad what tripwire meat by rephrasing it to a flshy card.

            <div class='col-md body'>Could anybody enlighten me on the following issues?<br><br>AIM-120C will be stored outside Singapore unless there is a war threat.

What is the point of having 100 AIM-120C and we can't use them in the first line of defend.<br><br>*first malaysia dont have AMRAAMski yet, although that is their final intention. including the AA-73 archer WVR AAM. the reasons are many but it boils down to pure incompetence of RMAF (actually its not entirely their fault, the russians and maharaja is actually responsible as well).<br><br>*reason 1. they got the Mig-29A and not the Mig-29M, wrong aircraft type. Mig-29A no can carry AMRAAMski. airframe will break as it is not strong enough.<br><br>*reason 2. RMAF thinks russian avionics as sub-standard and opt to install western avionics. AMRAAMski cant work with western electronics. so have to reinstall russian radar, hybrid the plane, lots of problem.<br><br>*while AMRAAMski has a range of 100km, it still require guidance from its firing platform a.k.a. the plane up to 75km before assuming self control. while this is not much of a problem against other regional air force with no electronic warfare and AEW capability.<br><br>*against RSAF with vector thrusting wild weasel F-16C/Ds armed with AMRAAM and Python 4 WVR plus helmet mounted sight with 60 degree angle of fire for the Python 4 in dogfighting, its a different story altogether. currently, RSAF F-16s outnumber RMAF Mig-29   4 to 1.<br><br>*but since singapore's RSAF F-16 is almost an entirely new customised build and differ significantly from other F-16s around the world, its full capability is unkown, suffice to say, based on glimps of info, its capability definitely exceeds those of IAF and USAF.(my opinion) in fact, RSAF F-16 is the only vector thrust falcon operational around the world. its electronic warfare suit is no less impressive than those of USAF and IAF too as it merge both the IAF and USAF electronic warfare suit into one.<br><br>*but i still believe RSAF still have rooms for improvement.<br><br>RSAF had been looking for replacement for the F-5s. Does anyone have a more detailed comparison for these fighters. EF-2000, Rafale, JSF, JAS39 Gripen and SU-37.<br><br>*i dont have. but i think EF-2000 seems a better bet becos JSF is still a long wait to go. JAS39 lacks impressive BVR weapon and the SU-37 though impressive looking have difficulty in production and maintainance due to lack of spareparts. Rafale have a chance too. maybe to replace the role of RF-5?<br><br>Recenlty there is a Un-comfirmed report of Singpaore buying Exocet MM-39s for the frigates amount to US 700m. I'm not sure if there is MM-39 or should it be MM-40. If MM-39 is a new product, any idea of it's performance compared to Harpoon.<br><br>*MM38 is the old type anti-ship missiles, currently in use in RMN, TNI-AL and RTN in this region. range 40km<br><br>*MM40 is the latter version currently serving with RBN. range 70km<br><br>*MM39?? nebber heard of. AM39 yes, but since AM 39 is air launch missile, dont think it is meant for the lafayette ship singapore is buying. if it is for the ship, maybe it should me MM40. but if AM39, it could be meant for the navy fokker 50 maritime enforcer. MM39??? anyone got any idea??<br><br>Malaysia recently bought several G-5 155mm from Denel. G-5 is rated one of the best in the world and have a indirect fire range of 39kms. How many piece are they buying? Where are they located?<br><br>*they got 22 on order plus MRLS from brazil. while both are impressive weapons with the capability to hit any part of singapore from johor state, they are still outclassed by SAF's FH-2000 with 42km range.<br><br>*what is more worrying is the ASTRO2 MRLS they got from brazil, this bastard weapon depending on which version is used, the 4 tube version has a range of 90 km. the other 2 version has a range of 30 and 35km. it is not clear which version did malaysia opt for at this moment. the different version uses different rocket.<br><br>*but assuming the worst and that malaysia opted for the 4 tube 90km range astros2 MRLS. this should spur SAF to think of a solution, SAF dont think MRLS is economical sound as it is expensive and its capability can be easily emulated by SAF FH-2000 using ICM munitions which is already in service.<br><br>*furthermore, MRLS can only be useful if the rockets are produced locally as they chew up rocket stockpile like nothing. without a huge industrial capability to produce such rockets locally, the MRLS would run out of rocket and become just another truck.<br><br>*i heard the americans got a system that can defeat MRLS and has supplied it to the israeli army which have constantly been bombarded by muslim extremist from lebanon. if true, maybe we can get a simlar weapon from US?? or participate in the US ABM or european THAAD? afterall, malaysia's ASTRO2 isnt the only SSM that can hit singapore, indias privthi 2 can hit singapore too from india.<br><br>Malaysians are also buying anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles fm Pakistan.

Malaysia DM was highly confident when Singapore bought AMRAAMs and had also proclaimed that Malaysia have such weapon too.<br><br>*nope, the RMAF Mig-29 is the 'A' version, it was reported that the russians 'cheated' the RMAF by giving them the Mig-29A from the CFE treaty which would otherwise have been sent for disassembly and turn into scraps. the Malaysian govt realising the facts too late and finally came up with the solution  by call it the 'N' version,the so called 'tropicalised version'. i wonder if the indian Mig and chinese Flanker also have to go through 'indianise' or 'chinanise' like malaysian mig ;&gt;<br><br>* the malaysian govt dont have the adder missile yet, this i am very confident. under the singapore treaty with USA on the supply of AMRAAM to singapore, one of the terms is that, as long as no SEA nation possess AMRAAM capable missile in their inventory, singapore AMRAAM will be stored in US facility (US facility can be located in singapore ;&gt; ). BUT in the event that any SEA nation recieved any form of AMRAAM missile from any nation. USA is bounded by agreedment to release the AMRAAM to singapore immediately. so as long as we dont see singapore F-16s carrying AMRAAM, we can be sure the malaysian RMAF likewise also dont have AMRAAMski. so far, i only know singapore F-16 carry the sparrow BVR.<br><br>What is the outcome of Malaysia's intention to buy Kilo sub. and mbt tanks? They had been evaluating T-72 monderna, PT-91, T-80UD, Vickers Mark 3 and K1 tanks.<br><br>*the malaysians really wanted the MBT, but after several trials, they realised that the soft ground of malaysia really makes the heavy monster stuck everywhere from padi field to swampy or muddy land. but i believe that malaysian politicians might again override the military in deciding what to buy irreguardless of the trial outcome.<br><br>*as for the malaysian sub, its going nowhere, now they are thinking of renting a few of the subs.i wonder which nation got subs for rent. maybe hire-purchase??<br><br>We must look for replacements for AMX-13s, these machines are simply too old and a 75mm gun's effective range is 100m shorter than the malaysian spiders.<br><br>regards.</div></blockquote>* think the solution will be local. by merging the FH-2000 arty gun technology with the Bionix AIFV techonology. of course we are not gonna get a SP arty, since we have the ability to design arty guns. it shouldnt be difficult for us to design a tank gun.<br><br>*but if we are gonna buy off the shelve, i think it could be the AMX-10 family, which SAF currently operates a few dozen. there was rumored that the SAF is also looking at some MBTs.<br><br>*but with APACHE carrying HELLFIRE and longbow system, plus SPIKE, MILAN, ICM and AGM 65, even if MAF buys afew hundred MBTs, we still can handle. in fact, currently all these anti-tank weapons have no use against MAF which does not posses large tank force. to me, its an indication that SAF isnt geared towards attacking malaysia, it might even be geared towards defending malaysia from another nation with huge armour and tank force which MAF isnt capable of handleing.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh, my last sentence reminds me of something, while we goondoos are here debating whether MAF is better or SAF is better, the actions by both MAF and SAF indicates that neither is considering either as the enemy. though they still keep an eye on each other, they also keep likewise an eye out for each other. kind of a love hate relationship. hehehe<br><br>in fact, RMAF Mig-29 isnt based near singapore, while afew was based in kuantan, the majority was based in the northern part of malaysia, possibly in response to RTAF deploying its coveted F-16s in southern thailand to deter malaysian support for its muslim seperatist.<br><br>while malaysia has only 50 light tank, thailand (i am not saying thailand is the enemy hor, dont misquote me, i love thai food ok) has 600+ tanks including MBTs. thailand also have MRLS and has a standing army of 250,000 men which can raise to 750,000 men in times of war, 7 times larger then MAF.<br><br>RTAF is also as strong as RSAF though not technologically as advanced. but pitting RTAF against RMAF would be bullying RMAF.<br><br>in view of the thai's might, it is understandable, no malaysian politician even dare look at thais straight in the eyes, much less make negative comments against them like they did with Singapore.<br><br>understandably, malaysian govt dont think singapore will attack malaysia, that is why they dared point fingers at us. thais on the other hand have shown the malaysian that they would not hesitate to use their military force if provoked, especially against a weak malaysia.<br><br>so in fact, as long as singapore and malaysia keeps bickering with each other, and keep both army from each other, its kind of fun poking at the politicians across the straits.</div>

ICBM?? cruise missile?? PGM?? nukes?? arty fire?? for what?? BASES dont win war. remember that.<br><br>*fighter planes like F-16s dont need a real runway to fly, all F-16s need is an unobstructed straight road of 300 meter, and it will be on its way. do you know how many roads are there in singapore that is 300 meter and straight?? its definitely more then your toes and fingers together. heehee<br><br>oh well, who are we to say? </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, question time again...<br><br>Any info on 'U2' Self-propelled howitzer? Couldn't find data on this model. Please advise.<br><br>I had heard this rumour of Singapore's Centurion Mbt b4 i went into army. Most people said these tanks are stored in Taiwan. But there are no actual sighting of the Mbts till now. Btw Australian army  purchase these tanks since 1951. could it be mistaken as Singapore's when Australian join in the live firing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tripwire...from you previous post, I'm beginning to understand why so many pple wanna flame you........simple becoz your post are somewhat too arrogant and rather senseless at times(though not all   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). I would suggest you try to tone down you post. I don't know if you realize but your post also sounded rather hostile towards our neighbours. It's like your dying to conquer them or something.<br><br>Regarding to you last post, you said it takes 300m for an F-16 to take off. It definately take more. If you're in NS, 300m is like the distance of our range. That's too short. The shortest airstrip is about 1.5 klicks and F16 is not F14/F18 or harrier.<br><br>This is not classified, it's in pioneer mag 1995, so I'll say, we have a public road cum runway. It's a big straight road that stretches 4 klick...size of an expressway. It also has a control tower at the side of the road. It's also an underultilized road. If you want to know where it is...check out our street dirctory and find the one and only 4 klick straight road.<br><br>About the satellite thingy, I don't know how you know, hopefully it's from Jane or something. If not please don't say out anything that's not known to public. I don't think it a good idea to expose classified stuff in the internet.<br><br>You also said "soon one day our flag will be flying over malaysia in the sky"......please don't say something so arrogant as it'll will hurt fellow malaysian reading this and further deepen the wound of our relations. It's like Malaysian saying that they will cut our water supply and stuff.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Before you flame me, I a true-blue S'porean and I'll fight whoever threatens our country and livelihood......but to fight for war caused by our "cockiness" and arrogance.....do you think it's worth it. And I do believe Singaporean is not arrogant like what others say. Foreigners working here in S'pore would agree what I said.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Hardware.....the rumour of the centurions are confirmed true by Jane in 1993 (or is it 1994   :p ). I won't say much but If you got friend from armor SOA as instructor, you can casually ask them. If you want to know more....search for the "unoffical s'pore armor homepage" in the internet.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Silenthunter (edited 11 March 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thks anyway, i'd come across that 'janes' acticle. It seem 'Janes' wasn't sure if we have these tanks. I knew a few 42SA guys but they know '0' too.<br><br>How long must we put up with Malaysia's nonsense? Is Singapore the little bro.? must listen and obey the M.Fs of Malaysia? maintain silence when Malaysia bully us? thk them for nearly causing racial tension recently?<br><br>It is good to have someone speaking up for Singapore when some of the so-called Singaporean are afraid of those lowlife, good for nothing, mother f***ing, son of b****s.</div>

F-16 is a light figher with a powerful engine, 300 meter is all it needs to take off.<br><br>* the long runways that you see are made for large aircraft like C-130, Fokker 50 and E2C which does not have a higher power to weight ratio.<br><br>*a 4 km runway is meant for boeing 747. how much heavier is a 747 compare to a F-16?</div>
