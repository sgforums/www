However, going low to a target in Malaysia is pointless with their lack of medium to high altitude SAMs, and even their latest SAM purchase, the Rapier, doesn't give them this capability. I guess this is the same reason for them not getting the Popeye. There's no need for a stand-off missile system yet.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, something strange seems to have happened up north...<br><br>"Southeast Asia<br><br>A Royal Malaysian Air Force MiG shoots down an unidentified fixed wing aircraft<br>By Anil Netto<br><br>PENANG, Malaysia - Symbolizing a  recent unrest in the village south of Ipoh, the local natives have claimed to see an aircraft going down and plunging into the sea after being hit by a missile, at around 4:25 pm. As the local eyewitnesses describe, a single tailed aircraft was seen pursued by another twin tailed aircraft. The single tailed aircraft wasn't making any hard maneuvers but the second aircraft was constantly trying to keep up with the first one, on certain occassions, it did fly close enough. After a few minutes, the first one took a sharp turn and headed north, when finally the second aircraft pulled back and launched a missile, which gave a direct hit and set the first aircraft's engine ablaze. Then it seemed to lose control and head for the sea for a direct plunge. By the grace of God local citizens aren't hurt. But what is amazing is that some of the local eyewitnesses claim that the twin tailed aircraft was the RMAF MiG-29 armed with four R-73 AAMs, and the aircraft that was shot was an Indonesian F-16 Fighter, since it came from that direction. But the government officials are more tight lipped on the topic. One of the RMAF spokesperson has told our correspondent that the fact an aircraft was shot was though true, but it was certainly not an Indonesian F-16. What the government official add in is that it was an UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) drone  undergoing tests. The UAV went out of control and since it was headed for the more populated area of Imoh, it was shot down by a MiG-29. Further details still remain classified."<br><br>This is from the Asia Times. http://asiatimes.ionichost.com/malaysia/current/Hcc432HSDyHyXCkU23.htm<br><br>Interesting....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Central Asia<br><br>Russia shoots to rule Asian skies<br>By John Helmer<br><br>MOSCOW - Singapore defense officials have told Russia's arms export agency Rosoboronexport that they expect the Sukhoi Su-30 fighter-bomber will make it to the short list of three aircraft to be considered in the current tender to replace the Singapore Air Force's aging fleet of US-made A-4 Skyhawks.<br><br>A military agency official told Asia Times Online that the multi-purpose Sukhoi combat aircraft impressed the Singapore officers who observed the aircraft in demonstrations at the Moscow air show last August, and at the Asian Aerospace-2002 show in Singapore this year. The official added that in the current competition between the European Typhoon, France's Rafale and three US models, the F-15 Eagle, F-16 Falcon and F-18 Super-Hornet, the Su-30 should reach the second round of the selection process.<br><br>The confidence of Rosoboronexport has been enhanced in recent weeks by signals of interest from other countries in Russian arms, particularly Sukhoi aircraft.<br><br>The Malaysian government remains close to a decision, but is still uncommitted on whether to buy the Su-30. The aircraft was flown in demonstrations at Malaysia's Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) exhibition last October.<br><br>After several years of negotiations in the early 1990s, which saw intense rivalry from Washington for Malaysia to buy the F-18 Hornet, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad split his air force acquisition into two, buying 18 Mikoyan MiG-29s and an equal number of Hornets. The Malaysian Air Force has been considering a follow-on order, and the Boeing-built F-18, in a modified form, is again competing against the Russians.<br><br>China's Air Force has already contracted to buy the Su-30MKK, which is equipped with Russian avionics. The Su-30MKM model to be offered to Malaysia is equipped with Russian and European avionics, and is more suited to English-speaking pilots. The first two Su30MKI aircraft were delivered to India on June 21, and another eight are being transported over the next few weeks.<br><br>Starting in 2004, licensed production of the aircraft will begin in India, and local production lines are expected to roll out a total of 140 aircraft, according to the terms of a deal signed in 2000. According to Rosoboronexport, the radar and engines of the Su-30MKI have not been exported anywhere else in the world. The agency claims that the radar allows the aircraft to fight effectively with several enemy aircraft at the same time.<br><br>And Brazil, too, is close to preferring Sukhoi over intense competition from the US and France. In the Brazilian tender, Rosoboronexport has offered licensed production by Brazilian aerospace companies of the Su-35. The bidding for replacement of Brazil's old Mirage-III fighters has been sharpened by the Brazilian government's decision to exclude the US F-16 and F-18 from the final round, leaving Sukhoi running against Mirage-2000.<br><br>The general director of Rosoboronexport, Andrei Belyaninov, said last week that in the first half of this year revenues from arms sales topped US$2 billion. "We expect the results for the second half of the year to be at least equal to the first half." However, he said that the recent estimate placing Russia as the leading arms exporter in the world - in a publication last month by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) - is inaccurate.<br><br>"In our opinion," Belyaninov said, "Russia is currently in the third or fourth place among the world's leading arms exporters, while the US is the leader."<br><br>(Â©2002 Asia Times Online Co, Ltd.

Although an RFI was issued to Sukhoi, I doubt there is serious interest on the part of RSAF to actually order the aircraft. While on paper the aircraft and systems are considered modern, and much cheaper than Western counterparts, should Singapore decide to order the aircraft, integration of the systems to keep them in line with the rest of our equipment would increase the price. Not to mention the notoriety for Russian equipment to be high maintenance, it would be a case of penny-wise, pound foolish. The startup costs might be cheaper, but in the long run, the total costs to buy, operate and maintain a buch of Su-30s might outstrip that for the other systems on offer.<br><br>IMO when 3 are eliminated from the RSAF's list for the RFP, the contenders should look like this:<br><br>- Rafale<br>- Typhoon<br>- F-15</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey are u guy out there convinced with this report that Su-30 is expected to make it into the top 3 contenders by DSTA.<br>For me i doubt it.Singapore just dun really favour russian made planes.Well it doesnt have a history of using Russian planes.Rather more to the Nato ones,U cant expect singapore fighter pliots or technical personnel to get use to russian aeronautical system.It just dun make sense......we dun have any attachment there compare to Nato.Beside the russian has a bad reputation for it lack of spare part,inefficient logistic.....etc.Many third world countries favour russian planes cause they are cheap and virtually no restriction resulting in corruption in the bureau itself<br>Eurofighter 2000 is still the better choice to consider<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

ST Aero is not big enuff to start making license copy SU-30. Unlike the South Korean, Japanese and Taiwanese who have pretty decent size aerospace companies to license build fighter aircraft, Singapore cannot risk buying into an fighter type with questionable and inconsistent spare parts supply as shown by the Russians till now. Just look at the air forces of the Indian and the Malaysians, I think we need to learn from their experience and not get entice by the seemingly cheap fighters and end up with big headaches.<br><br>Personally, I think the Super bugs will be the most cost effective, but Rafales represent the best value for money in terms of the technology edge they will provide to their user. The only down side of Rafales are that RSAF may have to yet purchase another French missile (ie. Mica). If only Dassault will integrate AMRAAMs and AIM-9X onto the Rafales....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NATO munitions are NOT compatible with Su-30s, Period.<br>We should be getting aircraft that are relatively small, yet advanced.  Long legs, room for potential development as well as compatibility.  And of course, potential to use (PROVEN) PGMs, and in future Stand off munitions.  So far, I've yet to see a single NATO weapon that can be armed on a Russian fighter, and vice versa.  And no PGM is as proven as the US-GBUs.  The SU-30 is a HUGE plane, in terms of RCS as well as total size.  Would take up a bit too much space.<br><br>My Guess,<br>1. EF2000<br>2. Rafale<br>3. F-18/E</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe F-18 might not make it to the top 3 finalist.Surely the mindef simply dun wish to acquire the some machine which is the same as the Malaysian government,since the malaysian got the planes earlier they know the systems specification and technical aspect clearer than us.It can be a disadvantage to us besides F-18E/F is not a new planes by boeing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Can the US provide a better package compare to the europe counterpart.<br>Even the russian give us a better package to the US<br></div>
