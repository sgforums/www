Therefore again defeat the purpose of a replacement for AMX-13 and to counter Malaysia's future purchase of T-80s. T-80 has a combat weight of 42,500kg. It's 125mm main gun outranges any 105mm. As it is to our pathetic 75mm was outranged by 100m compared tp Malaysia's scorpian 90mm. A 120mm main gun with a effective range of 3000m, we could blast any malaysian tanks while they are still in Johor.<br><br>Centurions are too old and too heavy to match T-80s speed, armour and armament.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOLZ! They still don't believe that Armored Vehicles should not engage tanks unless they got missiles.  They pay dearly if they ever send their units for operations with a coalition task force.<br><br>We still do not know what the composites of the M1's Armor.  Its known as the Chobham or Burlington Armor package, designed in Burlington England.  The British army uses similar armor for their Challengers.   The composite material of the Chobham armor is really very interesting.  The armor is made in layers, each layer with its molecular strength faced in a different direction.  Thus when a round tries to penetrate, it cannot find a simple strength layer to slip through, and will end up trying stuck.  However, the exact composites of the armor is still unknown.<br><br>As for the merkava, it's armor is basically steel.  But it has a very low slope gradient and together with its Blazer reactive armor package, its very hard to kill on the first hit.  Its low slope gradient makes it hard to kill even after its reactive armor is blown away.</div>

If the LMFs manage to kill even one tank of ours (touch wood!) they win by percentage. Therefore we must make sure 1 SAF MBT SLIGHTLY DAMAGED 2 20 MAF MBTS TOTALLY DESTROYED (With MAF's MBTs crew burned to death and blown to pieces by their own rounds in their steel coffins).<br><br>BUY ONLY THE BEST MAIN BATTLE TANKS!!!<br><br>GUARDS's LIGHT STRIKE VEHICAL seems pretty exposed to bullets and fragments.

Instead of fighting wif firepower, the tanks are more suited 4 hit n run tactics.fire-n4get....bo chee style but very useful..in short,we can't possibly cover the LSV with sum kind of armour as it defeats the purpose of a rapid deployment force. its the speed of the LSV tt is crucial.we cant possibly haf snipers hitting a soldier in a vechicle travelling at 60km/h....</div>

If they LSV was using some wire guided or laser guided missile, it would be a sitting Duck.<br><br>I feel that a wheeled armored force has it's credits.  Its highly mobile and can move to reinforce fast.  However, it functions like a calvary unit, either used in a light rapid assault or a quick defense.  It cannot hold or sustain itself in a brawl.  That is where MBT's come in.   Main battle tanks are able to sustain heavy hits and walk away with it.  A wheeled armored force cannot do so simply because it cannot pack the amount of armor on wheels!  Unless a there is a break thru in armor technology, that is light enuff and strong enuff.</div>

Hamilton at his office in Wisma Pertahanan.<br><br>Hamilton, on his first visit to the ministry, also called on air force chief Jen Tan Sri Ahmad Saruji Che Rose.<br><br>Capable of achieving a maximum range of 90km, the four-tube truck- mounted Astros II MLRS is currently in operation in Brazil, Croatia, Iraq, Libya, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>The system, to be used by the air artillery unit, has three types of warheads - high explosive incendiary, anti-personnel and anti- material mine deployment, and airfield denial munitions capable of penetrating up to 400mm of reinforced concrete.<br><br>With the purchase, Malaysia becomes only the second Southeast Asian country to operate an MLRS system, the other being Thailand, which operates the system produced by Norinco of China.<br><br>The G5 155mm medium-range artillery guns are capable of hitting a target up to 39km away.<br><br>Emphasising that the procurement was not aimed at creating an arms race or to intimidate other countries, Shafie said it was to modernise the army.<br><br>"Other countries should not be unduly worried as this exercise is part of an ongoing process to establish a credible force with sufficient deterrent power, not for aggression.<br><br>"We feel that the time has come for us to modernise our force, and this is what we are doing."<br><br>On his meeting with Hamilton, Shafie said both parties touched on various matters pertaining to bilateral military issues, including joint training and exercises.<br><br>"I am happy to say that our relations with New Zealand have been good, by virtue of us being a member of the Five-Power Defence Arrangement pact."<br><br>Besides New Zealand and Malaysia, the other FPDA member countries are Singapore, Australia and the United Kingdom.<br><br>Caption: Field artillery ... The army is expected to take delivery of its first South African made G5 155mm guns within the next 12 months.; More fire power ... Malaysia will be the second country in Southeast Asia, after Thailand, to operate an MLRS system with the purchase of the Brazilian made Astros II MLRS.; Renewing friendship ... Hamilton exchanges mementos with Shafie at Wisma Pertahanan.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i hope that singapore would purchase F-15E coz singapore lack an aircraft which could give a massive offensive capilities. N the F-15E is the best. Besides tat, with F-15E, dunsae T-90, an M1 could b taken out easily</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL! An M1 with the chobham armor package cannot be taken out easily.  Trust me.  Truth is, Singapore has a lot of secrets.  Hell, if people open their eyes a bit, they'll see the secrets.  They tested the F-15E and the Tornado Gr.Mk3 in Australia already.  Which was why Jane's F-15E featured RSAF Tornados.  Believe me, sources from Jane's is VERY believeable.  In 1997, SSI featured people's General.  In the array of Singapore units, was the Centurion Mk4.  Most people thought that was bullshit and Singapore Didn't operate MBTs, well well... look now?<br><br>Technically, Singapore would most probably acquire its own MLRS.  I would definitely hope its would be the American system.  Fully computerised, with guidance from GPS Satellites.  Also, Singapore more or less anticipated the MLRS purchase by Malaysia, which lead to the urgent purchase of more Apache Ds.  Attack Helicopters functions as artillery killers, while being able to penetrate airspace without detection.<br><br>However, what I fear is not an all out attack against Singapore.  Rather a light infantry insertion.  One can imagine what a team of highly trained commmandos can do to the infrastructure of Singapore.  If anyone has read about the kopassus, they will realise that no matter how poor or weak a country is, NEVER doubt their special forces.  Kopassus is Indonesia's special force.  They do not wear a crew cut, but rather long hair and beard.  Now, how many of those have you seen wondering around Singapore already?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yap. i agree that Singapore's way of doing things is to test and purchase secretly, train and then announce very much later or don't announce at all. Anyway, an F15E is not needed for Singapore. Take a look at our neighbours( no need to say lor), take a look at China, their T85II and T90II is good on the ground but is totally helpless in the eyes of our F16D pilots targetting them. I think that it is impossible for Singapore to purchase F15E after its large procurement of F16C/D and it is possible that the F16C/Ds would remain well in service for another 8-10 years. If a replacement for the F16C/D is being looked into, JSF is a better option don't you guys agree? Together with our EF2000, the RSAF would be formiddable.<br><br>By the way, does Malaysian G5 SPH has an equal range as the FH2000 or further than it? Does the Barak AMM comes in a land-based version? If there are really Tempests, where are they. tell me if you can, Thanx.</div>
