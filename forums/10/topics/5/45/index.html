Don't forget that SM Lee with Jiang jinguo (the late Taiwan president) was on a real friendship level. The Chinese Communist govt are warm to SM Lee for his connection to Taiwan.  Anything that can sway anyone from Taiwan, the mainland govt would use. Look at how they snatched Naru's govt to recognised them from Taiwan recently. Had SM Lee not had so much influence (in terms of his opinions) over Taiwan, and his personal friendship with Jiang, China would not even entertain Singapore unless Singapore has direct diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.<br><br>Secondly, didn't you hear, read or understand that Singapore govt's participation in Suzhou Industrial park was a major failure. Sing govt lost billions over there... In fact, the suzhou provincial govt set up another Industrial park and was promoting their own overseas. Singapore's industrial park was left out in the cold. Many of the so called joint-venture did not produce the goods we all were hoping for.<br><br>Thirdly, as for the mainlander trying to lure SAF to use Hainan instead of Taiwan, its another political ploy to isolate Taiwan's international standing... get real about how China really view Singapore as friends.... If SAF does not use Taiwan for training, I can almost assure you that China wouldn't have made the same gesture.<br><br>China treated us as brothers? Are you sure? other than the same colour skin, we have nothing in common with them. In fact, we are closer (unofficially) with Taiwan (militarily, socially, economically) than to China. The relationship between Singapore and China is based on mutual benefits. Singapore need China's market. China needs Singapore influence in the region, that is all. Singapore and Taiwan's relationship are not based on any of the above.<br><br>Look, what is Singapore with a population of 3 million with 70+% chinese. Taiwan has a much larger population and yet the mainland govt would not even blink if the whole population plus their 100 over million in the south China region annihilated in a "civil war".<br><br>Finally, the US has over and over again proved to be a better friend eventhough it doesn't come for free (at times). Sometimes the US can be rather unreasonable and act as a bully, but at least, they are more predictable and history has tell us that they are so much more reliable as a big brother.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I want to reply first to whether Singapore can win a war.<br><br>I say YES to a large extent.<br><br>There are several advantages in Singapore's favour.<br><br>Singapore is able to field a 300,000 strong defence force within six hours, supposing our NSman turn up.  Its technology, which includes many force multipliers such as air-to-air refueling aircraft and early airborne warning aircraft, will enable to have an edge over its potential aggressor.  Singapore currently has the most effective force in South-east Asia.  However, there are certain points to be considered, especially in the event of war with Malaysia, our closest and not-so-very-friendly neighbour.  They have 18 Atos II MLRS while Singapore does not have any MLRS.  They also have 8 F/A-18 fighter/attack planes.  These may severly damage, if not cripple the army later if not taken out by the airforce fast.  Also, Malaysia is able to turn what is usually a tactical weapon, artillery, into a tactical weapon simply by placing it at the southern most tip of Johore, where it will be able to strike at virtually the whole of Singapore.<br><br>By missile attack, I assume ICBMs, SLBMs and other ballistic missiles.  While it is true that Singapore does not have the ability to defend against such weapons, it is improbable and highly unlikely that such an attack will be made against Singapore in the forseeable future.  This is for the simple fact that no country in the region possess any ballistic missiles.  The closest owners of such weapons would most likely be India and China.<br><br>Another important point is the morale of the people of Singapore.  Many posts on this forum think or even 'know' that SIngapore will not survive any attack.  This only goes to show the fragility of many Singaporeans' state of mind.  Not having the confidence of the people in the SAF, rather than the effectiveness of its force, should be Singapore's biggest fear in the event of an attack.  This is bause there is a physical cure to improve the effectiveness or 'potency' of SAF, but none for the psychological state of mind of its people.  To attempt to build up the confidence of the people in the SAF, the SIngapore government in 2000 paraded many pieces of military hardware.  However, the comments of many people in this post have clearly shown that the government has failed.  How many of the 350,000 NSmen will turn up to defend SIngapore, none of us will know.  Hopefully, the negative posts here will not reflect the number of NSmen who turn up.<br><br>Singapore would certainly have to launch an attack and not solely defend in any war.  This is because Singapore does not have any hinterland to fall back on and give up some land to the enemy hoping it can regroup and later launch an attack to take its land back.  Proof that this is included in planning for defence includes the large number of A-4SU aircraft which, like the 'A' in their name suggests, are generally for attacking of land targets.  In the event SIngapore faces off with with Malaysia, it will most certainly capture up to a certain part of Johore.  This is because Singapore has to ensure its supply of water first (until NEwater comes out).  Also, Johore's large population of Chinese in comparison with the numbers of its Malays mean that there will be less change in its racial balance.<br><br>A point in relative to war with Malaysia and Indonesia would be the loyalty of the Malays in the SAF.  Would Singapore's Malays be willing to fight against Malays of other countries to defend their own homeland?  This has become less of an issue lately as seen by the number of Malays who stood on the side of SIngapore when facing critisicms from Malaysia and Indonesia.  Some Malays have also become pilots and others have been trusted with many high-tech and often vital hardware of the SAF.  This clearly shows a very positive change of attitude toward Malays in Singapore.<br><br>SIngapore also has many defence links with other countries.  For example, Singapore enjoys a close defence relationship with Brunei, which also shares its borders with Malaysia.  Thus, Malaysia also faces the possibility of having to wage war on 2 fronts if it invades other Singapore or Brunei and the other comes to the aid of the ocuntry being attack.  Malaysia is certainly not capable of having such a war given its current capabilities.<br><br>While many may argue, correctly,  that Indonesia's large population may prove decisive in any war it wages with SIngapore, Indonesia's armed forces do not enjoy the same standards of training and technology as the SAF.  It was also crippled by civil and political unrest which has only began to subside recently.<br><br>This is not a complete list of Singapore's advantages and disadvantages but it should be sufficient for us to believe that Singapore capable of defending itself against any aggressor, but only if we are willing to do it and have the confidence in the SAF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To those who are still uncertain, read Defending the Lion City, a very well written book on the capabilities of the SAF. One of the things I learned from that book was that the RSAF has more combat aircraft than our neighbours up north and south COMBINED.<br><br>And in this day and age, having air superiority is half the war won.<br><br>So the answer is YES, we can survive an attack from anyone in the vicinity.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, Defending the Lion City (by Tim Huxley) is a very good book.  Though it probably projects an overly optimistic view of the SAF.  Also, some of its information may be outdated because it was published some time ago.  However, it is still VERY informative.  About the most comprehensive book on the SAF ever... especially its appendixes which contain the assets of SAF, the organisation, etc.<br><br>Also can download the 'The Asian Conventional Military Balance in 2002: South-east Asia'.  Its a pdf file and not that hard to find.  Basically its some graphs and charts on armed forces of the region, including New Zealand and Australia.<br><br>Can also Singapore in the New Millennium: Challenges facing the city-state.  Edited by Derek De Chunha.  There is a pretty informative article inside by the editor about Singapore's defence and threats.  It also mentions the fragility of Singapore's morale.</div>

The recall of our overseas forces will send an extremely strong signal. The heavier equipment may take longer to arrive, but the planes will arrive in few days.<br><br>Sneak attack against SG is unlikely, given our AWAS coverage. Even if somehow a sneak attack somehow succeeded, those planes based overseas will render us the ability to strike back. Sort of not putting all your eggs in the same basket.<br><br>I am sure this scenerio is played out countless times by Mindef planners, and plans drawn up to counter it. So no worries. One thing about SAF is we never reveal our aces easily. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

We currently have countermeasures against even the most hard shell iron clad. We do have assembly plant to manufacture these tandam warhead AT weapon locally.

We do have assembly plant to manufacture such weapon locally, not to mention the technical know-how to improve the system.

Where did you get the info about Sg locally assemble the Barak. Must have gotten a real good deal with IAI then. I thought ST Aero and IAI relationship were sour not too long ago. Furthermore, Sg also has the license to locally assemble SA-19 Igla. I think the military planners are getting really smart huh! I would really like to see the following license built:<br>1. Spike<br>2. Next gen man-portable light weight AT to supplement the armbrust. Armbrust is still good at destroying bunkers and in close quarter combat (FIBUA).<br>3. Gabriel 2/3 - and possibly the air-launch version which can be carried by the Vipers.<br></div>
