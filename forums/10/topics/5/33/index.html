Perharps you would be klind enough to substantiate your opinion with examples to allow us to have an intelligent debate.<br>If you are not a Singaporean, I wish and i pray that hope that we never have to find out the answer in the crucible of war. You might be surprise and not me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No offence too and nothing personal<br>I have read abt the comments by the Malaysian general. Correct me if I am wrong but he seems to imply that National Servicemen, being non-professional, do not have a concept of ethics and morality in war. I would think that on the contrary, an NS army with its exposure to a civilian society would be more imbused with the notion of morality in war. That was a blatant case of making an enemy out of nowhere. What is the lesson to be learnt out of that conflict he might say - how about when a state threatened with extinction will go to great length and be capable of applying overwhelming force to ensure its survival?<br><br>------------------<br>what you cannot defend does not belong to you...</div>

I never cease to be amazed at the ignorance shown by some Singaporeans about this issue. What do they think? If an invader attacks Singapore, they think that once they completed their occuaption they will let everyone who did not fight go about their merry ways and continuing to live their own private lives? Get real...these people are so obsessed with themselves they never look around the world and see what happens to the populations of conquered nations, what happens to the men, and especially the women.<br><br>ipowersia, a recommendation to you.

AC-300 are pretty much like heavily modified M113s with additional road wheel for increased size. It seems to have applique armor and a 25/30mm chaingun. I think the number is not 30 but more like 300 on order.<br><br>Currently they do have 90MM Scorpion Tanks, stormer APCs, Condor 6x6 APCs, BV206s, Simbas APC, Saracens, Saladin and Ferret cars. Actually numbers I dunno and I think I left out a few armor too. Basically, they do have a few variety of "cold war era" armor vehicles.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Silenthunter (edited 23 April 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Silenthunter (edited 23 April 2002).]</div>

There're a number of ways.<br><br>- Get even longer ranged MLRs or arty systems. The American ATACM is an example of this. IIRC it boasts a 300 klick range, unless I got that wrong. Since we will not be the first country to get a MLRS, export restrictions *might* not matter. Upshot is we have a system that restores our advantage in range. Downside is the difficulty in accurately placing counterbattery fire. Advances in arty radar might help, but its not an exact science, and targets might pack up and move before counterbattery fire.<br><br>- The UAV idea is pretty intersting. As the LALEE is a pretty new system obviously no one knows the full specs of its performance. But with its capacity for large payloads(at this moment just restricted to camera packs) I don't see why a Spike, Hellfire, CBU or Mk.82 JDAM(if the Americans allow export here) cannot be fitted. It'll act like the Predators over Afghanistan, effectively being the eyes, ears and teeth of the war effort. Let it loiter over posible launch areas, out of reach of MANPADS, and watch for launch signiatures. Once detected the missiles will be returned, with interest.<br><br></div>

Alternate use is to first fire ATACM with cluster munition warheads that will rain down on possible launch sites to pre-empt an attack by the MLRS.<br><br>Using LALEE with ATGM makes senses as it has proven to be effective by both Americans and the Israeli. In fact IDF armed their UAVs with miniture warheads for a dive in attack if they spot any valuable assets (eg. SAM radar, etc) while on recon. Using UAV for attack may not be as easy given US army had lots of problem with Predators in Afganistan, but still I think this is definitely something SAF can explore.<br><br>On the notes of SAF should get a similar capability, I think I agree that SAF should renew the interest to obtain at least a battery to two of MLRS with a possiblity of getting some ATACMs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best way to take out a highly mobile long range weapon is to "plink" it... just like they did the mobile scud batteries during the Gulf war; with men on the ground directing laser guided bombs. but then, they were dealing with scuds... i wonder if its viable to do that with mlrs 'cos the bottom line is, its just an artilerry system.<br><br>But its high risk and the people involved would certainly not wanna get caught... As for fitting a UAV with a spike... well... lets hope the engineers in ST are quick to catch on...<br><br>Actually, the achilles heels of the Astros is not in the rockets; its the Command and Control Vehicle / Fire Control Unit (AV-VCC) which directs and co-ordinates the fire for up to 3  batteries(typically 6 launchers each). u take that out, its effectiveness is greatly reduced 'cos mlrs depends on the massive saturation they can deliver for its greatest effect.<br><br>Of course, its cold comfort to know that they can't all fire at the same time anymore, but its a step towards realizing a more effective way to counter it.<br><br>The danger to the mlrs in my opinion, is that (a) it outranges our most effective artillery so we lack an effective means of retaliation and (b) its potential application... don't wanna give em any ideas but u can imagine what it could do in an anti-artillery role... it could also rain bomblets on armour and defence positions and the damage could be total... both the Iraqis and the Allies used it during the gulf war and they both know its a very good system...<br><br>I've often felt more spooked by the Astros than the PT90s... Maybe its time to make an appointment with lockheed-martin and good 'ol uncle sam for their HIMAR system and then, good 'ol brother israel for their enhanced range rockets =) well, when push comes to shove, it might even be advisable to negotiate for the purchase of the ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) guided missiles for use with it...<br><br>Problem is, these are very expensive systems... i would hate for my GST to rise to 10% (even though its still lower than some European countries' but thats not the point!)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with tasking aircraft to take out  individual vehicles is efficiency. At Desert Storm and Allied Force, coalition and NATO airraft had a difficult time taking out individual mobile Scuds and Yugoslav AFVs and arty pieces due to their mobility, camouflage and extensive use of decoys. However, in both  cases, the air forces were compelled by political considerations to do so(halt Scud attacks against Saudi Arabia and Israel in DS, and to try and impede Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo). As it was, the USAF found the job to be inefficient, taxing on resources, and marginally successful at best. If the USAF had its resources taxed, I cannot imagine how the RSAF would cope with such a scenario. We'd be practically pulling aircraft from other roles to hunt the damn rockets.<br><br>I actually have an alternative solution to taking out these rockets, but I would not go into it here. I'm sure the MINDEF planners would have thought into this since it would fit into overall strategy.

Israel has the help from the US in developing lasers that can shoot down the Russian Katyusha rockets fired by the Hezbollah. Perhaps SAF should also acquire this technology as part of the arty defence system.  Secondly, destroying mobile launchers and command stations are probably better to defend against arty strikes than to down rockets. So, I still think that UAV carrying Hellfire/Spike is a great idea ST Engg engineers should come up with. DSTA should help add some really cool IIR seeker, laser designator to the UAVs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for hunting the mobile launchers and command posts, perhaps the best is to send attack helos and SFs. 2 Apaches with 4 TOW and rocket armed Fennecs plus 4-6 UH-1H with SFs are perhaps a workable solution. Apaches with their longbow will be able to defeat SAM protection and pick up real targets from decoys, the TOW armed Fennecs will go in for the kill wile the UH will drop the SFs for any additional killings, or put a laser on any targets for a LGB drop from RSAF aircraft. Of course all these will come after the UAVs have done some recon around the area first and perhaps drop a few Hellfire/Spikes on priority target first, such as mobile SAMs launchers/radars, MANPADs, etc.<br></div>

I am not sure if it could handle against such numbers. It also does not solve the root of the problem.<br><br>It will be more effective, if they could not come into range of any high value targerts. That will require us to achieve errr..... some empty space.<br><br>For any long range system to work, one will require spotters.
