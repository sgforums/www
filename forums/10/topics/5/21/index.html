Too many Malaysians had thrown away the 'MAKE IN MALAYSIA' engine and install a EVO III turbo charged '280 hp' engine. To be frank, don't race with them in a straight road. Challenge 'em in cornerings and wet surface. These protons are not 4WD thus handling sucks. Proton waja is Malaysia's design and built with the help from Lotus. But it's still a joke... and bloody incredible ugly too. Given any chance, pls do not even think of buying this scrap metal. Or you could have nightmares throughout your ownership. And to those who thought it's cheaper to service or repair your Protons in Malaysia. Reliablity of such workshops is zero, and the Singapore Plate is a signal for them to cut you and your wallet into thousands of pieces. Moreover, those parts you are getting might be OEM's OEM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RMN-Best,just a word with you here.Please stop making yourself a laughing stock here.In the end,everybody is going to leave this forum with anti malysian thoughts in our hearts.i know some post on what we have stated might have offended you.But please don't take it to heart.Most of them are lies, propagganda etc.what i believe is that we should coexist together peacefully instead of flaming each other. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>as for my fellow singaporeans,don't just retaliate his post without thinking.i know you do it for the sake of patriotism.But please, don't overdo it.calling him a mongrel<br>is really degrading for him.It also shows the ugly side of us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>well,one more thing i would like to state.If malaysia and singapore have war,both our countries will suffer both economically and socially.so,lets start living peacefully together and stop this flaming around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Lee did not beg for use of Air Space, juz an exchange of terms. We can well go over and use Indonesia's air space, y muz use Malaysians? Becuz we want to show our sincerity. (and at the same time show off the prowess of RSAF?)<br><br>Well, quite true that we shud not retaliate RMN-BEST. It's a fact that he doesn't think when he posts, so there is no point retaliating against him. Some pple are juz dumb, wanting to destroy the image of their country. For all u noe, he might not be a Malaysian after all from his attitude, might be from some other countries trying to generate anti-Malaysian thoughts in Singapore. And he might be in some Malaysian forums trying to bring about anti-Singapore thoughts to the Malaysians too. Let us ignore him totally.<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>

Also, how many Falcons do we reall have? I mean, the number seems to keep inflating all the time, all of a sudden it has gone up to 70! Is that true? I dont really think we have THAT many Falcons... Also, anybody got any good sites to get military info? (other than FAS.org, whose info is often not totally accurate)</div>
