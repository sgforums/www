            <div class='col-md body'>The IVIS is an inter-vehicular interface system.  Basically, inside the M1A2, the TC cockpit has a computer, displaying a minimap.  On it, it shows where all his friendly units are.  Designated using Symbols.  When encounters the enemy, he punches in the grid coordinate of the enemy, and it is updated throughout the system.  The system is also linked to the Company FIST, so when fire support is needed, the FIST would have already have the coordinates locked in and sent to their MLRS and guns.  Because it displays all the friendlies, it prevents fatricide as the commanders would know where their friendlies are.<br><br>Basically, every tank is equipped with GPS to facilitate automatic update of friendly unit positions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why would we wanna buy a T-72. It's been has a bad name! We are always trained to engaged T72s during exercise..(or is it T-54?).  Movies have been potraiting T-72 been blown up and there's a scrapped T-72 chassis located at the AETC carpark of the armor camp.<br><br>Basically, The T-72 is big and bulk and not suitable for SEA terrain.<br><br>Correction to the "inter-section battle awareness system" thingy....it's not as complex as you guys think. It's just a simple pager gadget where the section commander can communicate and locate his sctionmate during a firefight.<br><br>I think the Bionix ICV do have a IVIS system but not our local Bionix. But if the ICV can have it, so can our's!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Currently none of the armor vehicle has a GPS system. But it'll be implement in the near future so the highest command can monitor the whole army's location. Thus improving battle awareness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The M1A1 is indeed unkillable but during the Gulf War, a few M1A1 was suddenly paraylysed during Operation desert Storm du to engine problems and suspension problems. The M1A1 is so highly armoured that the engine had problem. One of my teacher, who was once a airborne trooper in United States service was engaged in a mission to destroy a M1 in Bosnia. With many LAW launched at it, the missile simply flew off when it hit the ABRAM's well designed slopes at teh turret fron, sides. and finally, after more than 10 LAW, the mission commander asked the attack to stop and he simply threw grenades into the turret, destroying all the equipments and systems inside.</div>

They had plans of purchasing scorpene SSK submarines from France and these Submarines are the latest and highly capable. (surely beats the refurbished Challenger class). China is no longer a threat to me. They are so obssesed with BeiJing2008 that they may even forget about the Taiwan matter for the time being, cause a war may eventually take BeiJing 2008 away from them. Whats so great to host an Olympic????? i really don't understand. BTW, all Apaches in Singapore Service will not be equipped with the LongBow technology, unless U.S wants to start an armrace in the region. When Singapore requested for LONGBOW technology to be incorporated into the first batch of 8 AH64D, U.S already turned down the request and Singapore MAY purchase 12 more, not definitely purchase 12 more. BTW, i thnk that Apaches is highly capable but too expensive. only 16 Hellfire missiles can be armed. Look at the UH60 Black hawk, it can be armed with 16 Hellfire too and auto-cannons just like the Apaches and also can transport troops, carry Anti-Shipping missiles and alot more cheaper. I think a Eurocopter Tiger is good enough. Any comments?</div>

(let me count..) 20 YEARs!! ago!!... well.. even if they do purchase the subs, it would be both limited in number (bo lui) and a trained crew (bo lan). so.... i wonder if the RSN ASW ships and planes might also have to end up bidding for a 'certificate of entitilement' to sink that malaysian subs... since obviously... there arent enough malaysian subs to go around for the RSN ships.<br><br>And... singapore APache (the first <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> does come with longbow. the 12 additional apache no need longbow... they are just the firing platform.

Though 10 tonnes heavier than T-80 and T-94. It weights only 54,500 tons (combat weight). Operated only by 3 crews with auto loader. A 120 mm smooth bore with effective range of more than 3kms. That could have very great effectiveness in the duel against any MBT day and night. Capable of firing when the tank is moving with a rate of fire at 6 shots/min. The long-range fire control stablized the sight and the gun remains permanenlty pointed at the target selected. A very balanced general protection is obtained not only by modular shielding but also by compactness and thus low visibility, which combined with the very great agility which makes it a very difficult target to hit.<br><br>It is something a Amx-13 crew could only dream to have. Much more impressive than what ST could produce. I'm not saying that ST could not produce MBTs at this level but they really needs time and experiences. They did well in the Bionix but MBTs are the spearhead and target of any assualt. Not 'a everything also can, but say and do is a different thing' Singapore Technologies can build.<br><br>I hope whoever going to evaluate and test that MBT ST build must have a clear mind, most importantly stay neutral and scrutinize every aspect of the tank. Making sure that this baby must equally to a M1A2 if not better. If the ST engineers have a f-king hard time from you, they will spend their time working instead of lim teh every 2hrs.</div>

BUt there were storys about disabled M1s that had to be taken out to ensure no loss of crucial technologies.  I find it quite believable.<br><br>I'm quite surprised about the way u rate the Centurion to be the M1's equal.  I had the opportunity to visit NTC North Carolina once, and the briefing and footage shown was totally out of the world.<br><br>The Singapore Centurions or Tempest will not be anywhere close to the equal of the M1A2 no matter how you upgrade it.   The armor alone is incredible.  Test have shown that the frontal arc of the Abrams is invulnerable to shaped charge warheads, LAWs, Anti-Tank Missiles.  Even Long rod penetrators have difficulty Trying to pierce thru the frontal armor.  Believe it or not, a footage was once released, showing a long rod penetrator stuck sticking out in the Abram's Armor.<br><br>Given a Singaporean Tempest, which is equipped with a version of reactive armor, it will not survive a) An APFSDS round.  b) A follow up missile shot.  According to several doctrines, it is common to double or triple fire on Main Battle Tanks.  Multiple Missiles will be launched @ a single tank, and if the tank takes a hit, BYE BYE centurion.<br><br>Even in terms of survivability, the Centurion is crapsh.t. Yes Even the Local Tempest.  Compared to the M1A2, the ammo compartment is stored in the rear of the turret, which in the event of an ammo explosion, blast doors will seal the ammo compartment from the crew while the blast is directed upwards through blow out panels.  A short video clip was released which cameras planted in the turret.  Ammunition was detonated in the ammo compartment, the blast door sealed automatically and the footage show no damage watsoever in the crew compartment.  Can a Tempest survive an ammo explosion?<br><br>I am not saying that the Tempests are worthless, they are infact useful.  But comparing it with an M1, the tempest is like a target for live firing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About that disabled M1 tank.....I dunno where you guy heard from but I remember reading that from one of Tom Clancy's books about Armor warfare.<br><br>There actually more before that. If I din remember wrong, that tank was disabled cause it's stuck in some kindda sandpit. It was later contacted by two T72 MBTs. One Fired the M1 but missed. The other fired it and got a direct hit...but the M1 is still not down. The M1 fired and downed one of the T-72.<br><br>The other tried to escape but was also shot down by other M1s that came for the disabled MBT's distress call.<br><br>Two M1s tried to pull out the disable M1 but was unable to do so. So the platoon Commander received a green light to destroy their own tank, so that the enemy will not be able to get it.<br><br>then the rest of the story is connected to what shotgun had said earlier.<br><br>Even Tom Clancy himself laughed at it and could not believe it. So it still remain as a legend in from gulf war cos nobody could confirm it.</div>

The engine is in the front to provide protection to it's crew. Special 'space armour' is in use along with protected ammo and fuel compartments. Merkava's rear entrance and exit allow its crew to mount and dismount tactically. Since the Merkava can carry a small infantry squad, they could make use for the 60mm motar when no arti. is available.<br><br>At 62 tonnes, Merkava might have been too heavy for our land. This babe is not small in size too, bigger (Length: 8.78M Width: 3.7M) body means easier target.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heh heh,i think you misunderstood my post lah shotgun.in no way did i mean that the centurion was better tha the M1.the first centurions came out in the early 50s,and by the time we got them in the late 70's and early 80s from israel and india,they were second hand already.the reason that they were bought was cos most probably they were cheap,the gun could be still used and there  was potential to be upgraded(which i suppose applies to all types of SAF weapon systems)<br><br>of course i would love to see a coy of M1 tanks on parade,but thats very unlikely..<br>as mentioned,the weight,the cost, etc would turm against it.also ,the development of the new light tank would mean that mindef would not be interested in buying off the shelf.if they would buy, i guess they would most likely buy the m60A3 version to replace the centurion.(keke...buying old tank to replace older tank!)<br><br>as for ST producing our new tank to M1 standards...well we have to be realistic lah....the amercians have been producing tanks for so long already,their learning curve,their experience etc etc.what we can hope for the new tank is,be suitable for our environment,at least a 105mm stablised gun,reasonably armoured etc etc..<br><br>judging from the bionix,i guess the new tank would not be too bad and i hope maybe by my next reservist,i can see some new tank going past me in Sungei Gedong.....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but personally, i believe that it is difficult to use MBTs in Singapore.The reason?MBTs are far too heavy.infact, i don;t really believe there are centurions aka tempest in singapore.It would properbly sink into the soil the moment they get off road.thats why,a light tank which is 18-25 tons will suit our needs.however, following so many reports that s'pore have centurions, maybe they really do exist in Singapore.but if malaysia did purchase their MBTs, maybe you will see the next day's headlines:MINDEF ANNOUNCED THAT MBTS HAVE BEEN UISED BY SAF SINCE 1970. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
