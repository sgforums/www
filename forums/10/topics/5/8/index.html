            <div class='col-md body'>Let me start off with an Intro about myself.<br><br>I'm 26, Singaporean, NSman, Arty Office, a Banker based in London, my FiancÃ©e is a lovely Malaysian beauty, and this is my first time reading through this forum... with much amusement.<br><br>Singapore at warÂ… will tension in our region ever amount to the shedding of blood between sister nations?<br><br>Will Singapore fallÂ… are we as strong as we arrogantly insist we are in our military endeavour?<br><br>These two issues have been recycled in this forum again and againÂ…. and I feel that my two pence .. eerm.. two cents worth could shed light on whatÂ’s going on behind the scenes.<br><br>Let me start off with the question of Singapore being 100% defensible. There have been a lot of speculation about the technology we have in our armed forces. I have been fortunate enough to be given a tour of the facilities which are at our disposal, and I can give you first hand assurance that we are technologically no less superior in our defence system than the USA. Published figures of our defence spending are very much way off the hoof, for political reasons of course, and unless our neighbours decides to drop one on us without a prior 48hrs warning, or should we be caught napping in our regional surveillance, my bet is that we can hold any advances from both ends of the compass simultaneously without breaking so much of a 2.4km sweat. Speaking of surveillance, did I mention that unlike the USA, we have the advantage of proximity which allows us to get the same job done effectively, WITHOUT the need for a Lockheed EP3.<br><br>MinDefÂ’s policy on our assets procurement, as most high level military men would know, is very simple. Singapore will invest in aspiring technology rendered from across the pacific, and hence as stakeholders, we will always have a share of the yummiest creampuffs. Take our Apaches for instant. While our Straits Times dutifully announces that we are testing a few contractors in our decision to make our purchase of the latest in anti-tank defence, the RSAF have been flying the longbows, test firing hellfire missiles, for half a decade earlier. Why? Because a certain GLC has strategic interest in Boeing corp. Same can be said for our Submarines and the rest of those stuffs in our underground bunker network (or is there such a network??). Singapore is so damn rich it can buy itself into everything and anything it deems worth the while. The MBTs in Taiwan, Australia, the Longbows, Singaporean pilots stepping out of F14s and F15s sporting American insignias (makes you wonder why Singapore needs offensive fighters for), Â“hunterÂ”, Â“boxerÂ” and our links with country X and Y have long been Â“open secretsÂ”. Dummies like us get on online discussion forums divulging all these information to the worldÂ… but hey, this is also the reason why our neighbours Â“appreciate the situationÂ” better in the sense that they know better than to stick their fingers into this skunkÂ’s arse.<br><br>But just for argumentÂ’s sake, Singapore IS ALWAYS ahead of its neighbours. For every threat, there IS a counter measureÂ… and the skilled personnel to operate itÂ….. and unlike our neighbours, we have the financial resources to back ourselves up. Cut our water and food supply, yar right .. Singapore has had 100% 180 days self containment capabilities for the last 10 years running. It sure is going to cost us hell of a lot of cash to get it going, but in times of war, who gives a shit. The regional players have recently decided to dabble into SRSSM and while we donÂ’t have any of our own (or do we??), we do have a fully functional missile defence shield up and running (which the USA would be proud of)since the day I ORD. The regional players can keep chalking up the bill on their arsenal but they would be financially drained even before weÂ’ll feel the pinch. Whatever we laymen can conjure up, the top brasses in the MinDef are some 5 steps ahead of us. Just to make you think a little, our defence system does not only comprise of our military hardware. Singapore has adopted a Â“Total DefenceÂ” approach. Everything, from the directional layout and design of our HDB estates and highways, to our MRT lines have been all planned as part of our Â“keep them outÂ” strategy. Keep a look out for these minor details and to any trained military man, it would simply appear all too clear.<br><br>My conclusion, with the arrogant spirit of a patriot, Singapore is 100% defendableÂ….. trice over.<br><br>However, the greatest asset in our defence system is NOT the multi-billion dollars worth of armoured tanks like the Centurions, M60s, AMX 10p, yada yada yada Â…. but the cream of the crop in our government think tank, that which is much more formidable. The Singaporean government has made a brilliant effort in playing the neutral diplomatic peacemaker with our immediate neighbours. By allowing families to mushroom both sides of the causeway, and shooting off PR status to the brightest and most brilliant of Malaysian, Singapore has inevitable made the Malaysian government think twice about ruffling its own feathers before lifting its hands to strike. Singapore has also invested heavily into the Malaysian domestic economy so much so that itÂ’s their national interest to maintain a cordial working relationship with us. It is in MalaysiaÂ’s interest to take us in the hands and work as partners, not rivals. We read about scuffles in the national tabloids now and then, but are these issues really important? SingaporeÂ’s policy on issues raised by the Malaysian Media has been very simpleÂ…. either ignore them, or word in whatÂ’s seemingly an apology and let the Malaysian politicians have a field day with their electorate. Singapore has subtly supported the ruling coalition party because it knows that the present government, albeit a little noisy (Dr. MÂ’s my heroÂ… bless that old fox), is essential the balance of power within the nations in the region, and within the multiracial community on both sides.<br><br>As for our friends to the South, Singapore has time and again extended economical and humanitarian help to the extent that they, as a Muslim community, would know better than to bite back at the hand that feeds them. Political leaders have always been known to say things in front of their people to incite support, but behind the scenes, it is the unwritten rule amongst world leaders that these snippets should just be ignored and taken with a pinch of salt.<br><br>Thus concludes my thesis that no one has a reason to attack Singapore, hence, there exist no threat of war. So why invest so damn much money in a defence system? Well, for all itÂ’s worth, SingaporeÂ’s wealth is built on the fact that our foreign partners know that we have the capabilities of protecting their investments and in a cyclical manner, we turn part of their profit into the systems which maintains the peace on our land.<br><br>End of the day, I would like to see this forum being turned into something more productive, with aggression and anger channelled into gentlemanly patriotism. Singapore at PEACE.<br><br>Peace, Love<br>The Rainmaker<br></div>

NO.<br><br>BUT we understand that being human, you probably wouldnt understand that each man is measured by his own character and worth. rather then the worth of all those measured together around him.<br><br>IT is not possible for me to ask you to rise above perception, stereotype and sweeping remarks. but we forgive u.<br><br>AND if being snobbish is the only sin that you can say about us, then i think we should be quite happy. at least we dont go around hacking people's head off like in certain part of indonesia OR see people's worth according to the color of their skin like malaysia rather than their ability.<br><br>WE are not perfect, but thankfully and hopefully we will not be as ..... as our neighbours.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like a deviation on the topic of war. Well, maybe we should start a forum on Singaporean snobbery. To be totally honest with you, Singaporean do think that they are a cut above the rest, and rightly so. IÂ’ve lived in many countries, in Europe, the USA, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and IÂ’ve been up and down Malaysia many a times as my future in-laws reside there. One thing I must say, is that Singapore is by far, the cleanest, safest, most efficient, highest standards of living, highest quality of life (other than the months where we have to tolerate the smog from across the straits), compared to the rest of these places IÂ’ve resided in. Even my expatriate friends and  those who have travelled to Singapore mentions without hesitation that Singapore is a gem in its own class. We are a proud people and thatÂ’s whatÂ’s driven us ahead of our counterparts. Pride to excel, pride to be the best, pride to reclaim the honour of being the no.1 airport, no.1 seaport, no.1 workforce, no.1 highest Asian literacy, no.1 choice in foreign investment. But Singaporeans snobbish? ItÂ’s the upbringing of the kid which decides if he is snobbish or not. If the child is snobbish, itÂ’s not the nationÂ’s success that determined it.<br><br>Having pride in what we have, what we do, what we have achieved, what we can achieve, is not snobbishness. I donÂ’t tear down my FiancÃ©eÂ’s home country and say that Malaysia is lousy, filthy and smelly. Neither do I criticise Indonesia on their inability to control a rouge community. Nor do I spit on the British government on their indecisiveness to take control of their public transport, banking regulation and Euro policies. I donÂ’t tell the Americans that they are on the edge of becoming Global Enemy No.1 with their stupid foreign policies. Nor do I tell the Japanese to get their economy into shape, or the Australians to stop being lazy asses and get their act together. Instead, I learn, and I encourage others to learn from their mistakes and I appreciate what Singapore has become and what Singapore is. You canÂ’t accuse anyone of being brained washed into thinking the Singapore is the best by slogans and PAP campaigns. We are a free nation. The people of Singapore have the right to travel, to live abroad, to study foreign culture. We are an elite nation in our own ways, just like the Americans, the British, and the French are, and we can hold our head high and say that we are special in our own way. The rest of our neighbours have yet to achieve our status as a Â“developed nationÂ”, but believe me, they are also proud of what they have achieved. Snobbery only comes when we fail to accept that we can be beaten at our own game. Snobbery only comes when we shut our senses to the world, being myopic to our mistakes and those of the mighty and power before us. The choice of wanting to be snobbish is your own. We are not a nation of snobs. We are a nation of Proud People.<br><br>The Rainmaker<br></div>

If the child is snobbish, itÂ’s not the nationÂ’s success that determined it.<br><br>Having pride in what we have, what we do, what we have achieved, what we can achieve, is not snobbishness. I donÂ’t tear down my FiancÃ©eÂ’s home country and say that Malaysia is lousy, filthy and smelly. Neither do I criticise Indonesia on their inability to control a rouge community. Nor do I spit on the British government on their indecisiveness to take control of their public transport, banking regulation and Euro policies. I donÂ’t tell the Americans that they are on the edge of becoming Global Enemy No.1 with their stupid foreign policies. Nor do I tell the Japanese to get their economy into shape, or the Australians to stop being lazy asses and get their act together. Instead, I learn, and I encourage others to learn from their mistakes and I appreciate what Singapore has become and what Singapore is. You canÂ’t accuse anyone of being brained washed into thinking the Singapore is the best by slogans and PAP campaigns. We are a free nation. The people of Singapore have the right to travel, to live abroad, to study foreign culture. We are an elite nation in our own ways, just like the Americans, the British, and the French are, and we can hold our head high and say that we are special in our own way. The rest of our neighbours have yet to achieve our status as a Â“developed nationÂ”, but believe me, they are also proud of what they have achieved. Snobbery only comes when we fail to accept that we can be beaten at our own game. Snobbery only comes when we shut our senses to the world, being myopic to our mistakes and those of the mighty and power before us. The choice of wanting to be snobbish is your own. We are not a nation of snobs. We are a nation of Proud People.<br><br>The Rainmaker<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Did anyone here read SM's From Third World to First? You'll realise that he started off the first chapter on National Service. The emphasis that he and the rest of the SG government place on national defence is very clear - We must have a capable defence strategy. Our forefathers have gone through the 2nd world war, the Confrontation with Indonesia and political posturing from across the causeway in 1965. My father is already 62. He tells me that he totally believe that we should have our own defence force. I think if I'm in my father's shoes and have experienced what he went thru' in the 40s and 60s, I totally believe that we should have a credible defence force.<br><br>Regarding the statement that since Singapore has no natural resources, there is no incentive for anyone to invade Singapore, history has a BIG lesson to teach us. If we follow the logic of that argument, there is no reason why the Japs invaded us in 1945 (But, they did) There is no reason why Iraq will want to invade a small country like Kuwait, after all, Iraq has got lots of oil as well and they have a sea lane open. What Kuwait did NOT have, however, was a defence force. In fact, it would be correct to say that if we were ever invaded, the US has little incentive to send a force to help us. We have nothing to offer in kind. They did not for Kosovo, either. But, they did for Kuwait in exchange for oil from Kuwait.<br><br>In the past, a certain prominent BG realised that there was something wrong with our SAF doctrine. Previously, the SAF build a defence force for self-defence and a deterence only. It meant that in a war, we put up a resistance but will still lose a war. That meant Singapore have to surrender or fight and still lose. Either way, it was sucide. This BG decided to change our doctrine. Yes, we have limited resources and manpower, but, technology and well-trained soldiers can be used as a force multiplier. That's why we have all these superior weapons and we have regular In Camp Training (My 8th In Camp Training is coming in October, and, Believe it or not, I'm actually looking forward to it because I will see all my old friends. We sweat thru' it together, but I won't trade the male-bonding experience for anything else.)<br><br>One day, if you are free, go down to URA office and look at the land plan they did for Singapore. You'll marvel at the amount of thinking that went into the land planning exercise. Obstacles were purpose-built to contain enemies landing on our shores. Special structures that were built to serve dual purposes. Amazing. Can't tell you what they are, sorry. Although some in this forum has already divulge too much info.<br><br>Why did the government go to such lengths?<br><br>If there is war, we have to defend our home, because no one else will.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you are very right Bolts!Thing is that lots of people in this forum are more interested in whether spore is defendable,whether we would turn up for activation.There will always be different views and opinions on this matter.But it is interesting the amount of people who say negative stuff about spore's defense.i just wonder exactly how patroitic or ignorant they are.i mean if you are like still schooling and have not entered the army,thats understandable,but if the person writing the stuff is an old soldier,working adult,then its so sad.every guy who has ever done NS,reservist will know that no matter how siong or screwed up it seems,we are a part of the wheel that is spinning.i believe that our army,like everything else in spore ,will work when needed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many don't see the big picture because when they go back for In Camp Training, they form only a small part of a defence capability. The Sum of the Parts is greater than the parts themselves, taken as a whole. If they doubt that Singapore will lose a war, that's okay, National Education lectures which is on-going right now will change that perception over time.<br><br></div>

Yo sure we can capture the water plant? even if we can seize it, will we be able to hold it? our soldiers are in Malaysian grounds, Malaysian troops everywhere. Singapore troops may get embushed or surely outnumbered.Well, i think seizing the water plant is the right thing to do. I'm sure Singapore won't go and declare war with Malaysia. Since they started it, we will do whatever we can to bring them down. Em.... yo work in SAF?<br><br>2.I agree that both sides would lose out and MAYBE we will lose out more. But we are going to recover thrice as fast as them.<br><br>3. Oh, yo in the RSN rite? that cool. All i noe is that RSN operates small fleet with firepower of a large fleet of frigates and vessels. Well, i went to the Changi open house and got a spectacular view of our vessels. The most impressive of all is the Missile Corvettes and Endurance class LST. The inside tour is undescrible. I trully hope that the frigates would be fully operational as soon as possible. I think tha the 6 frigates incorporates stealth features. rite?<br><br>4.High5! RSAF 4eva best. I'm sooooo proud of our Air Force. More fighters than neighbouring countries with high-technology. Even if RMAF operates MIG29 and F/A18D, that little amount of them won't be even enough to defend the vast air space of Malaysia. I'm sure they will become strong one day, but the RSAF will always be on-top of them by at least 1 level. BTW, Singapore shown keen interest in the Eurofighter2000, thats cool! With the big fleet of BVR capability, WOW!<br><br>4.</div>

Malaysia however have AA-12ADDER/R-77 (it is similar to AIM-120C but have a range of 90-100km. 50km more than the AIM-120C. It have speed of mach 4) stored in their airbase. RSAF should be lookin into or buying other AMRAAMs (eg. BVRAAM, MICA, SKYFLASH, METEOR, IRIS-T, Alto/Derby) to store here. I'm sure these missiles are as capable as the AIM-120C. What is the point of having 100 AIM-120C and we can't use them in the first line of defend.<br><br>*Dun worry, our python4 and AIM7 Sparrow is enough. The RMAF MIG29 mainly have to depend on close air combat to get a victory. Before they can lock RSAF F16C with IR homing missiles, our F16C had already been locking on it.<br><br>RSAF had been looking for replacement for the F-5s. Does anyone have a more detailed comparison for these fighters. EF-2000, Rafale, JSF, JAS39 Gripen and SU-37.<br><br>*To me, the best option is the EF2000 Typhoon. Why? Cos its cost effective, being able to replace both the A4SU and F5S at the same time. Its attack capability and air-to-air capability is good. Its easy and cheap to maintain, does not need constant maintanence. Another BVR capable fighter.<br><br>Recenlty there is a Un-comfirmed report of Singpaore buying Exocet MM-39s for the frigates amount to US 700m. I'm not sure if there is MM-39 or should it be MM-40. If MM-39 is a new product, any idea of it's performance compared to Harpoon.<br><br>* Where did you hear this from, i certainly hope this is not true...... You mean on the new stealth frigates? Exocets are medium range missiles, not better than the Harpoon with a range of 90 km.<br><br>Malaysia recently bought several G-5 155mm from Denel. G-5 is rated one of the best in the world and have a indirect fire range of 39kms. How many piece are they buying? Where are they located?<br>*Little idea of this. Can't answer your question.<br><br>Malaysians are also buying anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles fm Pakistan. Any info. on this?<br>*Nope. sorry......<br><br></div>

So the actual number I dunno (maybe magazines got put liao)<br><br>These tanks in Taiwan. It is not known if there are any in SG but the probability is very low.<br><br>I think M60s are confused to be ours but they are actually taiwan's. I got some friend pose pictures with the M60 in Taiwan training.<br><br>Or maybe their talking about the M60 CEV that our armoured engineers used. These M60 are modified to do combat engineer work like mine-ploughing, obstacle removal and etc....or the M60 AVLS that lays the engineer's bridge. These M60s are not for combat.<br><br>Been to Wallaby 99 and 2K, see no centurions or M60......only some dead boars and alot of kangaroos. All local tanks/APC. So that's probably a lie.<br><br>SAF did evaluate a number of light tanks a few years back..including the scorpion and the US Stingray light tank. But the results are unknown.
