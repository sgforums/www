            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rsafpage:</div><div class="quote_body"> Yup! I'm wrong, meant to say AMSAR instead of CAPTOR for Rafale radar. If, by your reasoning, then there must be something lacking in the CAPTOR too, since the Eurofighter consprtium aren't even bothering to upgrade the CAPTOR and choosing AMSAR instead. Personally, I feel that replacing CAPTOR of RBE2 doesn't mean theres something wrong, just that AMSAR represents an improvement over current radar technology.<br><br>M88-3 is available for export Rafales now, while EJ230 is only available for Typhoon at 2010 *at the earliest*. Singapores new fighter is expected to be chosen by next     year to 2004, with deliveries 2-3 years from order date...</div></blockquote>Heh heh, kinda guessed that u wont be confused with that fact, just wanted to cash in on your mistake, that's all :-&gt; ... still, i place my vote for the Typhoon!! Well, we have a LOOONG wait to 2004 to see who's choice fits Singapore's needs more...<br>As for your statement on Russian SAMs, i agree, their experience with SAMs is humongous, considering the number of SAM systems they have produced, and how varied they are... As for the Stinger BlockII, issit really THAT bad?? I do not believe that in practice, the Stinger is lousier. While it may have the lousier warhead, it is coupled with the Avenger system, which has inputs from a combination of sources(AEGIS and AWACS etc) which will allow it to be aware of enemy fighter positions, thus it can be ustilised to its full potential.<br>Anyway, to go off-topic, which JSF candidate do you hope to see win? I go for the X-35. Looks HELL OF A LOT BETTER than the X-32. Also, it will have cool IR detection system to boot. Will have a multipurpose IR system which will multi-function as a 360 degree MAW detector as well as an FLIR and IRST system. I sure do hope that the JSF program survives, so that Singapore gets the JSF as an F-16 replacement in the long term.<br>BTW, how old are you, RSAF? just wonderin' if you have finished your NS already....mine's next year....*groan*<br></div>

Juz jealous that S'pore has better talent even though we are that much younger, better than those who cling on to power even when they are like 70. This page was mentioned to me by my friend, so I thought I would just come on and see. And to see this, humph.<br><br>Singapore has the arms capability to fight off those bloody Malaysians, in fact, more than enough. Not to say about sending pigs through LSTs or anything, each of our land soldiers is capable of handling more than 1 equipment, which greatly increase the mobility of our soldiers.<br><br>Our foreign reserves are also like 4 times more than that of Malaysia. If we want to start an arms race, we can buy 2 times of what they buy, and still have more reserves than they originally have.<br><br>------------------<br>Why is it that life is so unfair?

Its their equivalent of the        J-STARS, with slightly better tech and most importantly, less operating costs( when compared to the J-STARS system mounted on the 707).

            <div class='col-md body'>I am newbie, but if I am a president of one country, let's say : Indonesia. And I want to invade SG (let's hope not)... you know ... what is the weakness of SG ? It is only one island. SG can defend their island from air, but :<br><br>1. From ground, imagine if 5% of indonesian people or 1% of Mainland (China) cross the ocean and surround you at once. Even though SG will win at early time, but eventually it will loose. Btw 5% of Indonesian people is about 10,000,000, and 1% of mainland (China) is about 10,000,000 (if we assume China has 1,000,000,000 but I think, now is bigger)<br><br>Maybe not crossing the ocean, but using paratroopers also may endangered SG.<br><br>Singapore's troop number is very limited, Singapore will depend on other country like Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunai, etc.<br><br>2. All vital/military/public facility in SG is grouped in one island, that is the worst condition. Not like Malaysia or Indonesia which has so many powerplant, Airport, etc. So wisely, SG should protect the Power Plan for all cost, because, without it, doom day ...<br><br>3. In nuclear war, an atom bomb (which destroy Hiroshima/Nagasaki-Japan) will sink one Singapore. Now nuclear technology is 10x more advance than year '42. And, nuclear bomb is designed not to explode when touching the ground, but to explode +/- 1-2km over the ground, why ? The power lies in the radiation not in "power of explosion". Japan testimony that the bomb which ruin Hiroshima/Nagasaki just like a "SUN" which suddenly appear so near and so hot. Everything was burn to ashes in 0.1 - 5 sec, as fast as the speed of sound.<br>So even though, ANTI AIR Missle can shoot the bomb, will it prevent to explode ?<br>ASIAN : China, Korea, and India have those Nuclear heads.<br><br>4. Bomb always create earthquake. Earthquake will quake more heavily on small island than in big island. More thin guitar string, the sound it produce will be "higher" (in frequency), it shakes more. Although, maybe, Singapore's HDB is earthquake proof, but what human can do against nature disaster.<br><br>If SG want to survive at war, SG should see how Israel survive. Israel is *always* supported by US, simply because US's major religion is Christian and they beleive if they war against Israel, God will curse them.<br>US also *always* support British since they know their origin is from that country.<br>Let's hope British support SG, then US will support SG as well, then US's Cruiser will be major key.<br><br>No offence  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

From ground, imagine if 5% of indonesian people or 1% of Mainland (China) cross the ocean and surround you at once. Even though SG will win at early time, but eventually it will loose. Btw 5% of Indonesian people is about 10,000,000, and 1% of mainland (China) is about 10,000,000 (if we assume China has 1,000,000,000 but I think, now is bigger)<br><br>Maybe not crossing the ocean, but using paratroopers also may endangered SG.<br><br>Singapore's troop number is very limited, Singapore will depend on other country like Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunai, etc.<br><br>2.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not so. The SU-30MKK sold to China is the downgraded version, whereas the SU-30MKI sold to India is actually MORE capable than the original SU-30 version as it actually has avionics from different origins- France, blah blah blah, as was required by India. They faced integration problems which took almost a year(?) to fix, but now the problems are solved, so i heard. That is one capable plane, and unfortunately, I heard the SU-30MKM offered to Malaysia is based on the SU-30MKI version.<br>As for the Super Hornet, I am aware they do not have it yet. Heck, even the USN has only 1 squadron of those in operation. However, it has been approved for export to Malaysia. This I'm sure of, and Malaysia has expressed plans to purchase them, with a trade in for their old Hornets. The Super Hornet is not a good close-in fighter, that I agree(less maneuverability than  the Hornet C/D), but I am concerned that they will get those SuperHornets with the AESA radar in development for later-production SuperHornets.(initial SuperHornets have the APG-73, same radar as the one in F-18Ds, the version Malaysia has) Also, I believe those SuperHornets Malaysia's buying will come with the ALE-50(or is it ALE-53?) decoy, both of which are pretty good.<br>Malaysia is as usual, interested in both, and i believe, has plans to acquire both. Both are capable aircraft, and will pose problems for RSAF. Hopefully, this economic crisis will suck their funds dry.<br><br>Very often, people without any inkling of military knowledge will quote what LexZeus said, the infamous "look at how many people they have!! They got enuff people to flood us!! cross the ocean and surround us at once! we got absolutely no chance!"concept. No offense, but its all BS. Why?<br>Simple. How are they going to 'cross the ocean and surround us at once'? Hmmm? swim over? teleport over? fly over? take boat over? Lemme tell you this. They have little to none amphibuous capability. That means that at best, they might just be able to send over a militarily insignificant amount of military assets to invade us. Forget about flying over. They do not have enuff aircraft to send many people over, and even if they tried to paradrop commandos here, they can't, not with our RSAF keeping a constant lookout. We do not buy Hawkeyes for nothing.(If you don't know what that is, please do find out, before saying we cannot defend Singapore)<br>As for troop number? Surprise! We are actually able to field EVEN MORE soldiers than Malaysia. Our armed forces has 350 000 personnel, compared to Malaysia's 145 000. Granted most of our soldiers are NSmen, but remember: their personnel are made up mostly of people who are, to put it nicely, "got brawn less brain" type, whereas ours include graduates in the ranks.<br>Next, nuclear bomb? DO YOU KNOW WHAT A NUCLEAR BOMB IS??? To illustrate, lemme give tou a very good quote, "Every bomb is a political bomb, with political motives and political consequences". POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. If a Nuclear bomb could be used as easily as you said it could be used, then World War 3 would have started with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Why do you think both sides carried so much self-restraint in dealing with each other, Hmmm? Even though Singapore does not have any Nukes to fulfil a MAD(Mutually Assured Destruction) equation, the political consequences of usage of a nuke BY ANY COUNTRY ON ANY COUNTRY WOULD BE TOO SEVERE!!! USA used the nuke on Japan to stop a horrendous war. That is probably the last time it will ever be used. Besides, which of the Nuclear powers have Singapore EVER pissed off??<br>As for that 'bomb create earthquake'<br>thing, i will just save my breath(or my hands)<br>Oei Eagle, Singapore got Foreign investments, but not that much lah! If Singapore were 2B attacked, at most diplomatic pressure will be applied on the attacking party to back off, that's all.<br><br>"He who is able to deny the Enemy info, lives.

            <div class='col-md body'>Blah blah blah.<br><br>SAF is constantly on the watch and recruiting the top talent. I remember that time my dad was saying during one of our NDP that Indonesia and Malaysia were having military operations somewhere that is quite near. We were put on Red Alert. This shows the responsiveness of the SAF. Even if they try to launch a surprise attack, they will be found out before they even reached, and we would have the appropriate counters for it already.<br><br>And I think Malaysia has too wide a range of aircraft. I mean, what is the use of having so many different aircraft if she does not have that much funds, knowledge and IQ to train? And there is immobility when the needed pilot is not there, why? Because they cannot operate the other planes.<br><br>And the thing is that Malaysia needs a lot of money to train for different types of planes. I think she will be better off if she have the same type of planes. Easier to train and coordinate.<br><br>But maybe the money needed was spent on building some useless thing like Port Klang or was embezzled.<br><br>And I think their future soldiers may be too lazy to even fight, provided they haf a credible enuff force to whack others by that time. Even Mathair himself said that Malays are too lazy. Lazy pigs.<br><br>------------------<br>Why is it that life is so unfair? Sob Sob.</div>
