            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Friedguest,<br><br>I am happy that you could now see and understand the real problems facing our society.<br><br>The leaders or talents we have attracted with monies have not really been serving the ordinary people, Ah Too, Ahmad and Samy for many years now.<br><br>They were divorced from the aspirations and causes of the ordinary people who are now still struggling from many years of top-down "I know best" narrow-minded governance which is aimed at justifying whatever they are doing including protecting their own jobs and pays.<br><br>It is high time our leaders get the message from the people especially after NKF and all the protests over the hard-hearted GST hikes (despite many years of budget surpluses and hidden profiteering by many government agencies not reported in the regular budget) that the people do not really regard them as talents or agree with their claims about their talents.<br><br>By over-estimating themselves and helping themselves to get more and more monies they are actually corrupting the new generation of MPs and producing the wrong type of leaders.<br><br>If they indeed have what it takes to serve the country, they should quickly abandon all the self-centred policies and non-stop self-promotion and self-boast and start really serving the people with compassion and heart.</div>

By shrouding themselves in power and filling their coffers with money, the people they largely attracted are syncoplants, morons, idiots, whatever. Money is the buzzword. Service is a joke. Our nation is filled to the brim with morons. I miss the old guard and sometimes, it's a pity that people have to retire. THough I wouldn't miss LKY one bit.</div>
