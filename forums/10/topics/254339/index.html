            <div class='col-md body'>It is good to see that our citizens are mature and courageous enough to exercise their duty fearlessly by asking this sort of question which none of the elected MPs and grassroot leaders have never asked but should be asking.<br><br>Government leaders are elected to look after our needs and aspirations and not for their own personal glories or claims of talents.<br><br>If they have overseas trips to make for trade and commerce or signing of FTAs or exploring business investments etc, let these be properly approved at the cabinet with budgets put up and duly certified by an audit panel.<br><br>The objective should always be clear that trips are officially approved and sanctioned with budgets without any extravagance as there are still many citizens suffering from unemployments or low wages and until these citizens' lives can be improved the leaders must spend their monies wisely.<br><br>Do not copy from royalties which can do as they like as Singapore is not a royalty but owned collectively by all citizens and leaders are elected as people's servants to fulfill certain agendas and purposes and not be given the unlimited power to spend citizens' moneis liberally for their own glory.<br><br>They should not engage in self-centred arguments like pointing to the size of GDP and start spending according to a percentage. All departments should return monies budgeted if conserved and not spend the budgeted amounts so as to be granted more excess monies to be spent every year.<br><br>We do not want our leaders to treat the citizens' monies like a big pot of gold on the ground that the leaders created the pot and let them spend as they like while all the owners and stakeholders let them spend away the monies without check or audit.<br><br>Least of all want them to receive gifts for their own personal keepsake while buying gifts or luxuries or accord guests or themselves five-star hotel or royal trappings.</div>
