            <div class='col-md body'>Our parliament has finally ammended the Parliamentry Act to legalise overseas voting - something that should have been done A LONG TIME AGO. Talk about efficient government? LOL..<br><br>Although the election department is quick to point out that:<br><blockquote> <strong>(a)	you must have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two years during the period of five years of being away as of the cut-off date of the Registers of Electors; </strong> OR<br><br>(b)	you are -<br>(i)	on full-time training or full-time service abroad as a member of the Singapore Armed Forces, or as a public officer or an employee of a Singapore public authority;<br>(ii)	on full-time training which is sponsored by the Singapore Government or any Singapore public authority;<br>(iii)	employed outside Singapore by an international organisation of which Singapore is a member, or any other organisation designated by the President under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore; or<br>(iv)	the spouse, or a parent, child or dependent of a person referred to in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) above.<br><br>Reference: http://www.elections.gov.sg/overseasreg_faqs.htm</blockquote>They did not publicise the criteria for inelligbility states that:<br><blockquote> <strong>(f) your name has not been entered on a register of electors in any other country of territory </strong><br>Reference: http://www.elections.gov.sg/forms/ovrform.pdf</blockquote>Although the revised Parliamentry Act has been highly publicised as the government's intention to attract Singaporeans abroad to come back, there is a problematic clause in the revised Parliamentry Act. The clause excludes Singaporeans residing in a foreign country that impose foreign residents to register as a voter.<br><br>One such country is the United Kingdom. Singaporeans (student or non-student) <strong> do not have a choice</strong> to exclude our names on the British Register.<br><br><strong>Commonwealth (former British Colonies) residents in the UK are entitled to vote for British election</strong>, and thus our (Singaporeans in UK) names will be entered in the British Register by default. <strong>Registration as a Voter for British Election is compulsory in the UK.</strong><br><br>The consequence of the conflict between the Singapore Parliamentry Act and British Electoral System is that <strong>Singaporeans residing in the UK will loose our voting rights as a citizen of Singapore, irregardless if we had resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two years during the period of five years of being away as of the cut-off date</strong> OR on public-funded training program outside Singapore OR being a spouse of such a person.<br><br>Firstly, having our names in the British Register does not necessary mean that a Singaporean whose name has been entered on a register of elector in a foreign country has lost his allegience to Singapore.<br><br>Secondly, it happened not by our choice. It was imposed on us. We did not choose to have our name in the British Register, so why should we (Singaporeans in UK) loose our voting rights?<br><br>There is no sense in the revised Parliamentry Act!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On a second note, even if Singaporeans abroad chooses to have his name in voting register of a foreign country, why should he still loose his voting rights?<br><br>Wikipedia defines Citizenship as "the membership in a political community (originally a city but now usually a state) and carries with it rights to political participation; a person having such membership is a citizen."  It is largely coterminous with nationality, although it is possible to have a nationality without being a citizen (i.e., be legally subject to a state and entitled to its protection without having rights of political participation in it); it is also possible to have political rights without being a national of a state; for example, a citizen of a Commonwealth country resident in the United Kingdom is entitled to full political rights.<br><br>The Singaporean abroad did not choose to let go of his citizenship and therefore still elligible to vote. The Parliamentry Act makes a point in which an individual must be qualified in order to be a citizen. This, in principle, is absurd because modern democracy preaches for universal suffrage. Any citizen, in prison, abroad or not, is entitled to vote regardless. To even make up a list of criteria to qualify a person to vote in Singapore is step backward - an indication of our political backwardness.<br><br>Why should not a Singaporean abroad be part of the voting register of a foreign country? Let use UK as an example. John is a Singaporean who has been working in the UK for past 1yr. In the coming election, the Tories intend to reduce council tax and increase state funding for universities, while the labour party intends to increase the council tax and reduces the national insurance tax. This issues will affect every working person in the United Kingdom irregardless of his nationality. Tell me why John should not vote..<br><br>Anybody who has long term resisdence in a particular democratic country should be entitled to vote for the democractic elections of that particular country. Anybody who is a citizen of that country is also entitled to vote.</div>
