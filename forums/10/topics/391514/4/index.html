Unless you dont want your life cuz im pretty sure the next thing you would know would be countries attacking our land if there's no NS and reservist. So.. time or life. Which you gonna sacrifice ? The world is always unfair.. and consider we Singaporeans having the luxury to live in one of the most up to date country,its already a plus point. Firstly ask yourself this question, would you rather live in a country that's natural disaster prone,conflict prone,poverty and those factors that will lead to war or civil war or would you rather live in a peaceful country like singapore? And last of all,im pretty much sure that the only thing we are worrying now is how to sustain our financial? Instead of whinning why not we do our best in everything and not let foreigners look down on us? Its all in the head,guys. If people say something negative about us, why not we make it positive?Since the day we became independent,we have proven critics wrong making vast improvements year by year. So why not continue this trend ? That's what the government had given us over this yrs.Unless you can do better than the government,then why not? go ahead prove yourself and lead us. If not, just suck it up and do what you need to do. Do more and dont ask for more. Naturally you will see more results =]</p></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a surprise that for one who claims that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">we are born here and its our duty to protect the country</span></em>" - with "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">NS and reservist is just a sacrifice of our time</span></em>" - and that one should "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do more and dont ask for more</span></em>" - it will fall back on the hollow argument and false reasoning by comparing our present situation with "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">countries that's natural disaster prone, conflict prone, pverty and those factors that will lead to war or civil war or would you rather live in a peaceful country like singapore</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>With the intelligence that it has, why was it not able to compare the living standards of a peaceful country like Singapore - with the living standards of a peaceful country like Switzerland, or Sweden, or Finland, or Japan, or South Korea ?</p>
              <p>Despite the supposedly high taxes, and high cost of living in these countries - the quality of life is remarkably high that encourages population growth without the need to open the floodgates to allow an influx of new migrants that upset the social fibre of the community.</p>
              <p>In these peaceful countries, policies that affect the population in major ways will lead the governments to consult the population before being implemented - in Switzerland, the process of referendum is a common tool for the Citizens to take responsibility for the decisions that affect their lives.</p>
              <p>In all these peaceful countries, the governments do not assume that they know what is best for the citizens, and the governments (ministers and civil servants) consider themselves as Public Servants first and not Political Leaders.</p>
              <p>Singapore is what it is today - due to the quality of those who were born here since before World War 1 and also their descendant, living here through the years and continue to be here - and had given their support to government policies despite deep disagreement.</p>
              <p>Is the world is looking down on Singapore, or is it the PAP government that is looking down on Singaporeans - as so proudly performed by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/12/mm-lees-interview-with-natgeo-transcript/"><strong>’MM LKY in his interview with NatGeo’</strong> ? </a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>“Well, we’ve got ethnic Chinese and ethnic Indians here. The settled ones have become less hard-driving and hard-striving and we’ve got recent migrants, they are hungry, they’re determined to succeed having uprooted themselves and they’re doing better.”</em></p>
              <p><em> “No, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I think the spurs are not stuck on your hinds</span></strong>. They are part of the herd, why-go-faster?"</em></p>
              <p><em> “Well, I think it’s an inevitable evolution of any society and therefore, a regular inflow of migrants without too huge a deluge will keep that society on its toes.”</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If competition helps to improve ourselves, and keep society on its toes - then in the next election, Singaporeans should vote as many candidates from the Opposition Parties into Parliament - so as to keep the Government on its toes.</p>
              <p>For more then 53 years now - since 1957 - the PAP Government has become assumed too much power that allow itself to pass legislations to benefit itself more then it benefit Singapore or Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans will need to take back Singapore for ourselves.</p>

              <p>Hmmm.. agreeable to a certain extend. But still, talks are just talks. i suggest you rally those who are determine enough to change Singapore into a better place or rights for us, to talk the ones on top of us out. Wouldn't that be a good idea ? If you can do so, i will too join you to fight for the rights we Singaporeans should have over the foreigners. And judging from your post. i believe you're a person of a better calibre than me cuz im only 21 and serving the nation with 6 more months to go. I still have much more to learn from you adults who might be a role model for us, the young ones. You said " Singaporeans will need to take back Singapore for ourselves. " What kind of Singapore do you actually mean or want ? Do we have a majority supporting it ? Can we really convince the government to follow the steps of those other peaceful countries you mentioned ? Do you think it will be successful for Singapore to reach a better heights if the government were to have the same thinking as those government in those peaceful countries ? Will there be any side effects if this were to happen? for eg. if benefits were taken away from those foreigners,does it mean that there will be fewer foreigners in our country?and if that happens,will we be force into taking jobs that are previously done by those foreigners like construction works ? Cuz from what i know,most of the foreigners are doing what we Singaporeans do not like to do most.</p>
              <p>hmmm.. pardon me if i say anything offensive.. as you can see, im still young and has a lot more to learn. point out my mistakes if any. Thank you =]</p>

              <p>No need to rally those "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">who are determine enough to change Singapore into a better place or rights for us to talk the ones on top of us out</span></em>" - as to do so will be to have another competing pivot point that dilute or soften the other pivot points that presently exist in the present number of Opposition Parties.</p>
              <p>It is good to start the thinking process of anyone willing to think and not to accept the status quo - and the decision to join any one of the existing pivot points remain with the individual.</p>
              <p>We learn from each other - and learn to be discerning and circumspect with the facts in the opinions printed.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">" What kind of Singapore do you actually mean or want ? Do we have a majority supporting it ?"</span></em></p>
              <p>As one who is educated, made the sacrifice for National Service, worked hard for a future that you hope to be able to control - what do you think Singapore should be in this 21st Century ?</p>
              <p>Do we need a government that believe "<em>the sum total of the intelligence of the population</em>" is less than those in the Cabinet or in the Political Party that holds the seat of Government ?</p>
              <p>Unless if you beleive that all Singaporeans have no mind, or no intelligence, or no initiative of their own - to strive for a better environment for their individual future - then you can correctly assume that the majority of Singaporeans are sheep to be herded by the PAP Government.</p>
              <p>Why will you have any doubt that there will be any negative side effects - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">for Singapore to reach a better heights if the government were to have the same thinking as those government in those peaceful countries</span></em>" ? </p>
              <p>If there are any side effects - it can only be more positive as clearly seen in the South Korean experience, which saw the country being liberated after the assassination of its strong man - Park Chung Hee - who ruled with an iron fist for almost 18 years.</p>
              <p>Following the disposal of the autocrat, South Korea saw its political process being liberalised, government becoming more accountable and transparent, which led to South Korean civil enterprise and entrepreneurship blossoming and leading South Korea to its position as a leading global manufacturing powerhouse.</p>
              <p>The same was repeated in Taiwan following the natural demise of the autocrat Chiang Kai Shek and his Kuomintang - and after his son Chiang Ching Kuo rule, it saw the treachorous Lee Teng-Hui leading the Kuomintang into political defeat in favor of his quiet support for Chen Shui-bian's DPP.</p>
              <p>It has always been the political process that hamper the economic development - as the politicians are the ones that control the self-serving agendas and manipulate the political processes to have all the powers to legitimize their own acts.</p>
              <p>Without securing our own ability to have some controls over our political future and leaving it all in the hands of the few in government - as citizens, we will always end up as nothing more then economic digits to be manipulated by those in power.</p>

              <p>It's only natural to have doubt as there's no doubt that Singapore is a small nation and population have been kind of a problem. And comparing Singapore to Switzerland,Finland,taiwan or South Korea,isn't it a little way too much ? And to think of that,aren't we fortunate enough that we can be compared to them as how you compared our system to theirs. It shows that we are somewhere there. Of cuz i hope that we can one day reach their standards too if its what's best for our citizens.And as of that Question " what do you think Singapore should be in this 21st century ? " i should say, i have not much complains and am contended as of how things are going nowadays,with the opening of IR and the universal studios,there should be an increase in Singapores' wealth ? But maybe i'll have much to complain when i get older ? Who knows. Just feel that, one should be concentrating on how to provide for their family as it is ones' priority cum responsibility. Only then,can i, have a say in the nations affair. But i'll hope for the same peace we have now in Singapore both present and the future. Couldn't ask for more yeah ?</p>

              <p>It's only natural to have doubt as there's no doubt that Singapore is a small nation and population have been kind of a problem. And comparing Singapore to Switzerland,Finland,taiwan or South Korea,isn't it a little way too much ? And to think of that,aren't we fortunate enough that we can be compared to them as how you compared our system to theirs. It shows that we are somewhere there. Of cuz i hope that we can one day reach their standards too if its what's best for our citizens.And as of that Question " what do you think Singapore should be in this 21st century ? " i should say, i have not much complains and am contended as of how things are going nowadays,with the opening of IR and the universal studios,there should be an increase in Singapores' wealth ? But maybe i'll have much to complain when i get older ? Who knows. Just feel that, one should be concentrating on how to provide for their family as it is ones' priority cum responsibility. Only then,can i, have a say in the nations affair. But i'll hope for the same peace we have now in Singapore both present and the future. Couldn't ask for more yeah ?</p>
              <p>Nice talking to you Atobe. Gained some knowledge here =]</p>

              <p><br>Why should we doubt in our own ability ?</p>
              <p>The generations before us that were migrants did not doubt themselves in picking this place, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had doubted the feasibility</span> of Singapore being merged into a larger country called Malaysia - based on the unequal terms that were hurriedly rushed through a false referendum, which ended in the failure of merger two painful years later.</p>
              <p>Small nation was never a problem, and has been an advantage in certain situation - like allowing a tin-pot Autocrat to believe itself to have supreme ability to run a small nation and engineering from a Third World into his own vision of a false First World.</p>
              <p>Population size has always been a problem for big and small nation - either too big, or too small; either too fast expanding, or too slow in replacing the aging population.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, when Autocrat believe that controlling population is like playing God or like playing a game - it will turn out disastrous when the Autocrat believe itself more then social planners and those more knowledgeable than itself.</p>
              <p>Population Control is not like flipping a switch to turn off and control population growth rates to suit its own political and economic development plans; and then twenty years later - flipping it back ON when it is felt that the population growth is urgently needed.</p>
              <p>Regrettably, LKY did not listen to those in the 1960s when Family Planning was first introduced , and it took him more then 40 years later to admit recently he was wrong.</p>
              <p>Why will you say that <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"comparing Singapore to Switzerland, Finland,taiwan or South Korea,isn't it a little way too much"</span></em> ?</p>
              <p>Singapore population or land size may not be the same as these countries - but are we comparing physical size, or are we comparing system of governments and policies that result in the quality in the standard of living for the population, the standards of creativitiy and productivity that help the country to gain wealth ?</p>
              <p>It certainly did not prevent SM Goh Chok Tong to announce his short-lived hope to lead Singaporeans to enjoy the Swiss Standards of Living - which unfortunately fell flat and forgotten after he stepped down as PM, and left Singaporeans with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Swiss Cost of Living</span> <strong>without </strong>the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Swiss Standard of Living</span>.</p>
              <p>Can Singapore be anywhere near to the standard of living, or even the quality of life as those countries that I had mentioned ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, after 53 years of PAP autocratic rule - with all the decisions made by them - Singaporeans today are struggling as hard as the generations that were supposed to be struggling during Colonial Rule.</p>
              <p>Even then - the Colonial Government had shown compassion towards Singaporeans that the PAP could not show to its own Singaporeans in a supposedly independent nation.</p>
              <p>The Colonial Government did not look and say so loudly and publicly that we are no better then animals that need training, disciplining, and worst - <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to have the spurs dug into our hind</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Only the arrogance of 53 years in political power has given MM LKY the ability to insult the generations who had supported him and rallied to the PAP - despite his poor judgment in merger with Malaysia, his dogmatic Family Planning Program, his stubborn refusal to modify the implementation of Learning Mandarin as a standard for entry into Tertiary education, and worst still the introduction of the Women's Charter - which he lamented prevented persons with strong genes to start second families.</p>
              <p>With regards to the starting of the Casino and the parallel introduction of the Universal Studio to combine both as an Integrated Resort - it is nothing more then exposing the bankrupt minds of the PAP after 53 years in power.</p>
              <p>It was LKY's insistence that the Motor Grand Prix races held in the 1960s was stopped - when he and his founding fathers could not appreciate the positive knock on effects to the Singapore economy, and resulted in a delay of almost 40 years before the Formul-1 returned to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore had resisted the introduction of a casino for over 40 years since our forced and sudden independence - and we saw Macau and the Genting Highlands brought wealth for their economies due to their unique economic circumstance.</p>
              <p>Singapore developed ourselves based on efforts entirely from Government Linked Companies controlling the economy and industrialisation while the private capital and entrepreneurship shrunk, and the population almost entirely working for the GLCs who are the biggest employer in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This was repeatedly single out in several economic reviews in 1987, 1997 and more recently after the 2003-2005 economic downturn that require the Government to devolve itself from stifling private capital and encourage entrepreneurship.</p>
              <p>It saw a charade acts of Government devolving its ownership of GLCs by privatising these companies - but with their corporate capital still tied to the government, as were the Board of Directors all being government appointees, and the staff were Civil Servants being "retrenched" and re-employed.</p>
              <p>The Integrated Resorts is a packaged proposal to make the introduction of Casino more palatable and to disguise the U-Turn in the 53 year old PAP policy not to have Singapore any casion on Singapore soil - and to safeguard the situation it came up with all the other supposed safeguards and safety nets to prevent Singaporeans from entering these local casinos.</p>
              <p>The effects of social engineering can only be seen over time, and the PAP or LKY's social engineering records have been disastrous - can we hope to see any positive outcome to the present directions taken ?</p>
              <p>Your idea that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">one should be concentrating on how to provide for their family as it is ones' priority cum responsibility" - in order to have a say in the nation's affair</span></em>" - is exactly the kind of mind set that LKY and his PAP has indoctrinated into the minds of ordinary Singaporeans, and have made these minds politically apathetic.</p>
              <p>Providing for one family is one priority and responsibility - as much as it is the social and political responsibility of every Singaporeans to provide for the Nation's future - whether in the areas of politics, economics or social matters.</p>
              <p>It has been LKY's efforts to prevent Singaporeans from getting involve in national policy matters - and prefer to have Singaporeans involve only in community matters that are at the local district or constituency levels.</p>
              <p>Sadly, this skewed political attitude has allowed LKY and the PAP to get away with paying themselves the million dollar wages paid from our National Reseves, while implementing policies that restrict the wage levels and cost of living for every level of Singaporean income groups - and all done without Singaporean having any say.</p>
              <p>When Citizens have no say at the national level, do we have any control of our own political future ?</p>
              <p>Politics is not merely about government and policies - it is about the fabric of our society that dictates how we live our lives, our economic survival, and our future.</p>
