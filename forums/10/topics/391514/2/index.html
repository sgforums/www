              <p>How could the PM ever been a good Platoon Commander ?</p>
              <p>From the moment he entered the SAF as an NS recruit - his career path was already to prepare him to be a General.</p>
              <p>Every step of his life in the SAF was that of a protected White Horse - when others were trained to be Section Leader or an Officer, his training was to observe how the training is being conducted and absorbed the characteristics of the Trainer and how the contents are delivered.</p>
              <p>Any exercise manoevres that tested the individual leadership potential will not involve his participation, as his presence was to view the overall conduct of the exercise being planned and executed.</p>
              <p>His level of training was far higher then the value of what he can possibly gain running around, to be shouted at, and to be tested on the limits of his mental and physical endurance in exercise scenarios.</p>
              <p>His presence was to observe the overall execution of the exercise as it unfold - much like a General observing how an army manoevre.</p>
              <p>Was he ever a Platoon Commander, or was he not assigned to Battalion HQ straight from OCS, then onwards to MINDEF HQ ?</p>
              <p>What possibly does he know about leading men as a Platoon Commander ?</p>

              <p><br>How could LHL have been an army leader of any kind ?</p>
              <p>His meteoric rise from 2nd LT to Major, then from Lt Col to BG was all planned and fixed as was his own place in politics to be the PM after his father had to have GCT be an interim seat warmer.</p>
              <p>Even when he was in the SAF - he was accustomed to all the issues being ironed out for him in advance, there will be no issues with vehicle cock-ups, no ration delays from the cook-house, no messed up during recall exercises, no firing range mess - everything is always in perfect state as a well oiled military should be.</p>
              <p>Has he ever had the opportunity to be a problem solver at the lower level ?</p>
              <p>Even his leadership in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Cable_Car_disaster">‘Singapore Cable Car Accident in 1983’ </a>- was a joke, when those who were trapped in the cable car was not rescued until some four to five hours after the incident began at 6.00pm.</p>
              <p>During that agonising period, the rescue effort under his leadership was dithering over the few suggested options - which included sending Commandos to pull themselves across the cable to reach the bubble cars, and lower the trapped person from each bubble car by rope to the waiting pontoon below; or with the use of fire engine snorkels with their long armed platform to reach the bubble cars while afloat on pontoon.</p>
              <p>Even when the decision to use helicopters to reach the occupants in the bubble cars - was the final option left, he insisted that Israeli 'dry run' with actual mock-up models be conducted to test the method before the move was put into operation.</p>
              <p>It did not dawn on the BG that winching rescue operation was part and parcel of air-sea rescue operation of the RSAF - and despite the fact that the helicopter pilot was a New Zealander that was on loan to train the RSAF pilots.</p>
              <p>Four to five hours of agonising wait, with some of the bubble cars hanging very precariously - having one of the two wheels dislodged from the cable, and already seven passengers had been earlier flung out of the bubble cars at the moment of the accident.</p>
              <p>In any war, four to five hours would have been more then enough time for an invading army to walk into Singapore, while the dithering continue over the best method to be decided.</p>
              <p>More then six months after the disaster, and with repeated public criticism continuing, an European reporter suddenly appeared to write an editorial contribution that it is normal for such rescue operations to take such long hours in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Was the reporter paid to brush up the otherwise burnished view of the Singapore operation ?</p>
              <p>Could Switzerland be so inexperienced when cable car operation has been in longer operation there and with experiences gained from earlier cable car incidents ?</p>
              <p>One has to revisit one of the famous speeches from LKY in the 1956 - said in the Legislative Assembly - to understand the true meaning of his words -</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>"Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they’re conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict."</em></p>

              <p>"If we stop NS now, our national security would be in danger and our old generation uncles would felt revengeful with unfairness as they had done their NS and now being stopped"</p>
              <p>Anyway, NS provide our handsome young men with the necessary tools that is better than other country young men.</p>
              <p>NS teaches our boys how to be discipline, preventing them becoming gay, planing and leadership and how to think of a way out.</p>
              <p>And also, it teaches them how to exercise well, eat well, take care of each other well and good bonding. It certainly tone our young boys up.</p>
              <p>if you compare with young men in indonesia, india or malaysia with no NS, they have</p>
              <p>poor discipline, gangsterism, immature, never exercise, poor in planing and leadership, sick and get ill as they grow older, not well dress up, end up with no direction in life...etc etc</p>
              <p>So, i as a singapore gal, SUPPORT NS for our boys. Take NS as something special out of life, enjoy it and stay fit</p>

              <p>Hello Like you ar,</p>
              <p>The diminishing of birth = to the diminishing of NS intake, previously per year i heard NS can take in 50,000 young men, today only 15,000 to 20,000 men per year. I think there is room to pay them higher, i shall propose to LHL in next year budget. However, the Minister of Defence Teo Chee Hean, the current aunties idol, said that, tho the intake is less, our defence budget had also reduced, as govt had transferred most of it budget into churning the economy and education. Nevertheless he added that most of the NS boys are now better equipped with better qualities of shoes, shirt, masterbed, good foods etc etc (me gal dun understand much), so it is also a cost.</p>
              <p>By reducing ns to 1 year, he added that a soldier just finished his training will not get a chance to put it on practice,..and more so, like my ex officer bf, who went training for a year may end up leaving the army for nothing to practice on. And becos 1 year training is also need to get them specialised, we separated due to time factor. He went Brunei and found a lover, and i found a richer guy.</p>
