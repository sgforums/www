Secondly, if they did serve NS at 30, 40 and 50 years old. I would not like to be their platoon commander.”<br><br>If I have not learned to be cool, calm and collected from my guru, Wisdom, the first words that should come from my mouth would be: "KNNMCCB" or, "Fcuk you, man!"<br><br><br>So why am I so bloody mad?<br><br>I was released from the bondage of NS and reservists' in-camp training almost 20 years ago at age 40! It hurts me to know that having been considered over the hill as a NSman at 30, I was still asked to waste my time to serve certain platoon commanders who did not appreciate my service.<br><br>I do not know the context at which such stupid statement came from a statesman but to belittle the contributions and sacrifices of thousands of NSmen who serves till 40 is appallingly sick! It is so sad to know that Singapore citizens who recite the Singapore Aspiration (Pledge?) are lesser mortals in Singapore than PRs who spice up the lives of elite Singaporeans!<br><br>Why such callous deed tears my guts out?<br><br>At this moment, my 18 month-old grand-daughter is yearning for her father. She is fatherless for 3 weeks because her 35 year-old dad (who is my son) is out of Singapore in some godforsaken jungle somewhere doing reservist training which his Platoon Commander (if he were PM Lee) does not appreciate because he's too old to be in NS.<br><br>It's all well and good when careless politician speaks of buying votes and fixing oppositions [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1WhJKsYb50&amp;feature=related"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #bb3300;">Link</span></span></a>] but to callously deride the sacrifices of so many true blue Singaporean NSmen is really asking for trouble.<br><br>NSmen and reservists are already disillusioned by ministers who make a mockery of nation serving by paying themselves millions; the 'white horse' classification of NSmen and the disadvantage they face in equal employment opportunity [<a href="http://singaporeanskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/09/singaporeans-are-not-welcomed-in-their.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #bb3300;">Link</span></span></a>].<br><br>Mr Prime Minister, why rock the boat further with such insensitivity?<br><br>Under the current economic and social condition in Singapore,<br><br>A grateful heart<br>A touch of kindness<br>A sense of solidarity<br>A caring demeanour<br><br>is what we expect from a leader.<br><br>A high falutin ingrate is furthest from our minds!<br><br>God bless Singapore.<br><br>feedmetothefish<br></div>

It is so sad to know that Singapore citizens who recite the Singapore Aspiration (Pledge?) are lesser mortals in Singapore than PRs who spice up the lives of elite Singaporeans!<br><br>Why such callous deed tears my guts out?<br><br>At this moment, my 18 month-old grand-daughter is yearning for her father.

              <p><br>such an old man liao, still dont know the meaning of deterrence strategy theory.......look at who is around us surrounding our island......and you know why we need to have NS, looking at why taiwan originally have NS and also into israel's case as peace is never something to be taken for granted.</p>
              <p>just have to look into recent history of how iraq just walked into kuwait without much hindrances as example, which they never thought will happen, but only waiting to happen.</p>
              <p>these PRs are not going to have it easy as everyone knows that their sons have to serve NS too if they stay here as PRs too....</p>
              <p>anyway, this is already old topic liao and still brought it up, time to retire in peace and enjoy playing with your grandchild while u can, old man....for u never know when peace will cease here without NS deterrence strategy....</p>

              <p>Many of our boys never asked for anything in return when doing NS.  However the PAP govt had cheapened the value of NS. I finished my NS, got into NUS only to find half the engineering faculty places are given to foreigners while many of my NS mates who meet the minimum qualifications got rejected.  I come out to work to find that half the executive positons are filled by "foreign talent" from third world countries.  I go for reservist only to return to find the work as I left it waiting for me to complete and had to work double time.  Then this PAP govt shirks its responsibility of taking care of its citizens by telling us to stay in old folk homes in foreign countries when we are old. Now, the PAP govt tells us to seek health care in foreign country because it is cheaper than Singapore.  If I go to the casino, I have to pay $100 while foreigners, domestic maids and foreign workers walk in for free.   This is what the govt mean my Singaporeans are special? - that we are ranked lower than maids and foreign labourers?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans can only conclude that NS is a bloody stupid waste of time.  It is time for change, use your vote wisely.</p>

              <p>Rovingswordsman,</p>
              <p>Did they really give priority for university place to foreigners? I cant believe this is happening in Sg. Not with the tax payer money we faithfully contribute to this country. No country will deprive its citizen of their right to proper eduction.</p>
              <p>I dont think LHL intend to cheapen NS. Reading from the comments, it seems that he was saying that if we conscript PR into natiional service, they will be too old. Isnt there a scheme whereby PR could voluntarily serve in the NS to quicken their citizenship approval?</p>
              <p>However, it cannot be denied that the present governement had lost their heart to serve. They are disconnected from the ppl. They failed to recongise the sentiment, especially the young Singaporean who are losing out even before they start. How can one government ever be supported when they failed to take care of its citizen. How can one government who continue to give priority to foreigners at the expense of its citizen be voted in again and again? If my children is deprived of a proper education, if they have to serve national service knowing that they will be disadvantage later, if they have to pay housing loan right from they start working to their retirement and if they have to enter the job market from university taking cheap wages equal to the Indian/Malaysian/Indonesian labourer, we really have a big big problem in sg.</p>

              <p>Singapore govt is cultivating a global economy, and this in turn created a global change in education and all things in our daily life , it is usual to see people get bewildered by sudden change of routine in Singaporean way of life. The message here is that we are no more a country that constrict things to ourselves anymore, it we do that, we cannot survive the next generation, as unpopular and as hard as we are criticised, we must ensure that when we meant we are going global, we mean it. And that is why you can see the liberation of education and jobs open wide to all kinds of peoples as long as they qualified.</p>
              <p>This is not something news, the Brits and US university are full of foreigners, they know that world cannot function by only them being educated well and get rich with it, it must operate in a way that all gain from it, as such the whole world move, and when that happen, they will be more richer. Example, if US will to keep their IT to themselves, how earth is microsoft or HP going to make money?? you need to educated the world, so that they buy your thing, adapt your culture and understand your way of life. This concepts apply here, if PRC, indian, mynmar, malaysia, thai, indon peoples get good education here, they will end up  working in a knowledge economy, reduce poverty, become more graceful, well mannered...and so on, aren't we singapore as part of this asia society going to gain from it.

The military if operated on the right direction is a neutral party. When all else fail its marshal law the last resort. This law shall be very basic. Ensure land that belongs to sg stays so at all costs. The people that drives this engine has to be one hearted single minded. I doubt any pee arse will achieve that. Of course people will flee fear and ponder, but having an army consisting of foreigners is like jumping up and down while keeping a side arm in your hoister with the safety off.</p></div>
