              <p>Senior Democrats say they will back a plan worth $780bn (£534bn), instead of the $900bn sought by the president, in order to gain vital Republican support.</p>
              <p>President Barack Obama has become angry with delays to the bill, which mixes big spending plans and tax cuts.</p>
              <p>The Senate is now due to hold a vote in the coming days. </p>
              <p>President Obama has spoken of "an urgent and growing crisis" and said further Senate delays would be "inexcusable and irresponsible" and lead to "a catastrophe".</p>
              <p>His comments came as the latest unemployment figures showed that the US had had its single worst month for <strong>job losses</strong> for <strong>35 years.</strong></p>
              <p>Almost <strong>600,000 </strong>people <strong>lost</strong> their <strong>jobs in January alone</strong> - figures Mr Obama described as devastating. <br><br>The new $780bn plan is composed of 42% tax cuts and 58% new government spending, Democratic Senator John Kerry said, according to Reuters news agency.</p>
              <p>Other details of the slimmed-down package are sketchy, but one Democrat told Reuters that the homebuyer tax credit and car tax credit were still in the bill.</p>
              <p>The Democrats need to persuade two Republicans to vote in favour of the bill for it to gain the necessary 60 Senate votes.</p>
              <p>Although Democrats hold a 58-41 majority, 60 votes are required to ensure the Republicans cannot block the bill with a filibuster.</p>
              <p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said that at least three or four Republicans would vote for the bill.</p>
              <p>"The American people want us to work together," said Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who will vote in favour.</p>
              <p>"They don't want to see us dividing along partisan lines on the most serious crisis confronting our country."</p>
              <p>However, the Senate minority leader, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, said that "most of us are deeply sceptical that this will work".</p>
              <p>And his Republican colleague, John McCain, defeated by Mr Obama in last year's presidential election said: "You can call it a lot of things but bipartisan isn't one of them."</p>
              <p>Mr Obama described as "devastating" the news that nearly 600,000 Americans lost their jobs in January.</p>
              <p>"The situation could not be more serious. These numbers demand action," he said. <br><br>Mr Obama's remarks came as he unveiled a new board of economic advisers, chaired by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p>
              <p>"I created this board to enlist voices that come from beyond the echo chamber of Washington DC," said Mr Obama, "and to ensure that no stone is unturned as we work to put people back to work and to get our economy moving."</p>
              <p>About one-third of the bill is currently composed of tax relief, with the rest devoted to spending on infrastructure projects, like roads and bridges, new schools and alternative energy programmes.</p>
