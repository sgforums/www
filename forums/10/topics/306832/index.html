              <p><strong>Harvey's Singapore at risk from "horrendous" rent rises <br>Chris Nicholls<br>Current.com<br>06 Feb 08</strong></p>
              <p><br><a href="http://www.current.com.au/2008/02/06/article/FZQCANDCBG.html">http://www.current.com.au/2008/02/06/article/FZQCANDCBG.html</a></p>
              <p>Gerry Harvey has warned high rents are putting its Singapore operation at risk, along with the operations of its two major competitors.</p>
              <p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with Current.com.au, the Harvey Norman co-founder and executive chairman rent rises of up to 50 per cent in one year, coupled with leases restricted to three years, meant all major electrical retailers there were under pressure.</p>
              <p>"The rents are just horrendous, and trying to figure out how you can do business is a really difficult thing, because you think 'Well, how do you do this?'"</p>
              <p>He said all three major players in the Singapore electrical retail market – Courts, Harvey Norman and Best Denki – had the same issues.</p>
              <p>"We all have the same problem, and probably sooner or later one of the three of us will disappear, and there'll be two of us. Then there's a good chance there'll be one of us."</p>
              <p>There may be a chance such attrition could have a positive effect, though, he said.</p>
              <p>"Maybe with two we can say to the landlords 'Well, you've really got to have us in your shopping centres' … but at the moment with three, they play the three of us off against each other. If they've only got two, maybe that might help. It's which one of us will crack first."</p>
              <p>Harvey said while they had no intention of being the first to crack, if landlords put rents up another 50 per cent, it would kill all three chains.</p>
              <p>"I don't think they can do that, but if someone else is prepared to take the space, maybe they can and they just say 'We don't want electrical/computer shops in our shopping centres', and where do we go? There's nowhere to go."</p>
              <p>He said even if Singapore had plenty of technology shoppers, if they themselves could not pay the rent, there was an issue.</p>
              <p>The shopping centre issue in Singapore highlighted the positives in his Australian property ownership model, Harvey said.</p>
              <p>"One of the great things we've done in Australia is we've bought so much property over the years … it protects your position long-term."</p>
              <p>He cited a problem he had with a Robina shopping centre when Harvey Norman owned Rebel Sports as an example, where a rent rise after three years pushed them out, despite what he said were a raft of incentives to move in at the start.</p>

              <p><br>It would indeed be a good question if thats is what the TS is suggestion..... But from the 2 post the TS had posted..... I can't seem to find a part where the TS was asking is the 'Extra' cost being <strong>''Channeled Back To The Locals"...... as you have said.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And by the way..... the report state that the landlord (Ower of the Shopping Centre) is the one who is rising the cost of rent..... Is there a part that said the Govt own the Shopping Centre and are the one who is rising the price <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because as a 4 room HDB flat owner myself..... I'm rather happy that my unit is now worth more and I could rent it out at a higher price to foreginer......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, as <strong>there is a now a space crunch for both Office and Retail store in S'pore</strong>, there is no way rental will goes down...... unless there is way too much space in S'pore. <strong>All these are decided by 'Market Force'</strong>..... Harvey Norman could built themselve a Mega Store like Courts or Ikea..... then they could rent extra space to others and make money..... instead of paying extra rental to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Capital Land</strong></span>, who OWN quite alot of S'pore Shopping Centre.</p>

              <p>Are they rising prices in lieu with rising costs of living or purely to increase revenue....</p>

              <p>If its to increase revenue..... well Harvey just stated its hard to carry on his business here .... so assuming Harvey leaves ... jobs lost</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets assume someone else decides he can make a business so he pays the higher rent..... he then oncharges the cost of higher rent to who? YOU lor <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Ok.... <strong>Genie99a let me put it this way..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shop 'A' made a bad business decision and rented a place beyond their limit..... Shop 'A' then decided to increase the price of their service inorder to make up the drop in profit..... therefore you would have to pay more for the same service, product.... etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>1) Is Shop 'A' the ONLY SHOP in S'pore that provide the service/product that you need <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>2) Is there no other place you could get the same service/product at a lower price <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>3) Is there no other alternate for you to get the same service/product</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me give you another example.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shop 'A' increase their price..... WE as consumer REFUSE to pay the extra..... Shop 'A' can't stay afloat, and close down...... the Shopping Centre that Shop 'A' opened in found that their high rental cost is forcing many outlet to close.... because WE, as consumer, is voting with our wallet and refusing to pay. Shopping Centre would have not choice but to lower their rental inorder to keep doing business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">That my friend.... is "Market Forces''.... supply &amp; demand....</span></strong> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem is S'porean will just pay the extra willing or unwillingly, therefore giving away their rights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's now CNY..... yet I have not brought any BBQ meat..... why <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> cause I refuse to be con in paying $50 for something I could have get for $42 just because it is CNY....... 1 week later, and price of BBQ meat will go back to normal, why is anyone silly enough to pay the extra just cause its CNY <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> Its not like 20-30 years ago where we really only got to eat BBQ meat once or twice a year <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> What the F**k..... I could eat BBQ meat till I'm sick every month of the year <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> Why oh why would S'poreans now wants to pay double for it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> If we refuse to buy..... the shops would have lower their price..... CNY or no CNY <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we keep giving in.... and support business that made bad decision.... we have only ourselves to blame.</p>

              <p><br>Outside of topic, i thought there is law that states you can't rent your HDB out (unless its a room i think).....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or has that been changed now? Cause if you own private prop, you can't rent it out you have to stay in the HDB then rent out the private. Or is that law now changed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And i think you can't own more than 1 HDB</span>.</p>

              <p>Correct friend.... you could only own 1 HDB unit.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I do have Bro &amp; Sis..... and could live with them if I wanted too. Or I could rent out my whole unit for X amount of money.... and just rent a small room somewhere else at a lower cost..... therefore still make money.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Put it this way..... a friend of mine had a Bro who was arrested by the CNB and is now servicing time.... 3 yrs I think. The Bro's 3 room HDB could have only bring in $700 - $800 plus just a few years back.... but now, it is being rented out at $1500..... Do you think my friend's Bro is complainting....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw..... Harvey might be one of the last 3 major player left..... but even if they close down.... U mean you are scare you can't find electrical goods anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> You mean you have not heard of Sim Lim Square or smaller retail outlet around HDB estate <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> Or even brought things from the Internet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Canon S'pore sells DSLR lense at a fix price..... but most of the shops sells much lower. And even that, quite alot of us buy from overseas and people who have even better lobang.... this keep our cost down and bring business to smaller retailers...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore as a Consumer, who is doing the paying..... it is very much up to you to look for a good deal. And not let the shops tell you how much you have to pay because they made the wrong decision when they setup shops.....</p>
