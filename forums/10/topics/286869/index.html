State news are limited by the state for its own political propagandas. So to that extent State News will not serve the mainstream population.<br><br>Those who are involved in any business will have to rely on their own analytical digests and reports to do well and stay up to date.<br><br>If our news media are to provide good information to serve all purposes and be accepted as mainstream news for business and government there has to be a big change in attitude on the part of the government.<br><br>Apart from such rare comment by MM Lee on need for informed decisions for businesses and government there is no clear thinking yet on information for the mainstream business and government as a topic.<br><br>It is about time there is such a thinking on this topic - establishing a mainstream source of news and informations for efficient decisions and strategic positioning of our economy. If we do not do so we will eventually lose out to many other countries which do pay attention to this topic.<br><br>It is also about time MM Lee loosens up on control of news and information for his limited propaganda or political survival.<br><br>It is a much larger issue and if he does not let go our news media will be stifled and cannot grow and will be taken over by blogs and internet which will then cause more loss of our vibrancy and growth.</div>
