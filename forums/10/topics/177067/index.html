            <div class='col-md body'>She probably has a reason why she's selling tissue paper, but what do you think? Couldn't she have taken a Cleaning Job?<br><br>Frm New Paper<br>========================================<br>Heeren mother<br>If I don't work, WHO'LL FEED MY SICK CHILD?<br>February 05, 2006<br><br>YOU would have seen them near The Heeren on Orchard Road.<br><br>Madam Rani has been there for about five years. Her routine: She'd be there with her daughter to sell packets of tissue from a big, red plastic bag.<br><br>The 50-year-old woman would hold three or four packets in one hand, raising her other hand to her mouth to show she needed money to eat.<br><br>Some people would shake their heads and walk away. Others would simply ignore her.<br><br>She would then go to her daughter, who would be standing in a telephone booth. 'Today no luck,' Madam Rani would say to her daughter, Miss Bawani, and return to her work.<br><br>Slipping her hand under her T-shirt and rubbing her stomach, Miss Bawani, 26, said to this reporter: 'No luck, we drink plain water. Got luck, we eat chicken rice.'<br><br>Miss Bawani looks healthy, but Madam Rani said she does not allow her daughter to work.<br><br>'My daughter is sick. She had a brain operation and she can't work. Don't talk to her too much or else she'll get a headache.'<br><br>Her sickness could not be independantly verified.<br><br>Raising her voice, Madam Rani added: 'Don't talk to us. So many people came to talk to us and said they wanted to help, but also never help. Some called the police to chase us away.<br><br>'We did not cause any inconvenience. I'm only selling tissue paper. When people tell me they don't want to buy, I never force them. I walk away.'<br><br>She recalled how a woman had once approached her.<br><br>'She talked to me for one hour. She asked me so many questions and said she wanted to help me. I waited and waited, there was no help.<br><br>'A few months later, I saw her again at Orchard Road so I stopped her and asked her 'How?' She told me, 'Sorry lah auntie, I can't help you. You go look for MP.'<br><br>'Never mind, I depend on myself. I help myself.'<br><br>So there they are every day, taking the bus or MRT from Yishun where Madam Rani claimed they live in a friend's rented one-room flat.<br><br>'We come in the morning and leave around 3pm to 4pm,' said Miss Bawani.<br><br>'Here is good. Nobody comes to disturb us although some people gave me nasty looks and showed me their middle fingers. But I ignored them because I don't want to offend anyone or else they'll call the police.'<br><br>A teenager distributing flyers at the junction claimed she had seen the two women leaving in a taxi.<br><br>On good days, Madam Rani said she can make up to $14 selling packets of tissue. Sometimes it's only $5.<br><br>'People are always rushing. Some people give me $1 and ask for 12 packets of tissue,' said Madam Rani.<br><br>Before her operation, Miss Bawani said, her mother used to work in the service industry and she worked at a fast-food restaurant.<br><br>She could not say when she had the operation, but said her father left the family about nine years ago.<br><br>'We lead a simple life and have enough to get by,' said Miss Bawani.<br>- Joyce Lim<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Will, or how many, of our older generation do you think would resort to or be reduced to, selling tissue paper?<br><br>I'm not expecting our government  to provide welfare for older workers, but at least provide avenues for those who can find no paths to make a living!<br><br>Since it's illegal to beg; Damn it! create more opportunities for hopeless aged to make a living!!!!<br><br>Don't tell me our multimillion dollar salaried ministers CAN'T think of something??? That's BULL.<br><br>Frm New Paper<br>============================<br>Orchard Road confidant<br>Tissues for tears &amp; ears for their fears<br>By Zubaidah Nazeer<br><br>February 05, 2006<br><br>YOU would have seen him in his dark glasses and baseball cap, which reads: Jesus Blesses You and Your Kindness.<br><br>You may have heard his voice singing hymns and serenading passers-by.<br><br>Mr Goh Siang Leng, or Coco as he is known to friends, is almost blind, and a jack-of-all-trades.<br><br>He's a gospel-singing evangelist, a kerbside tissue-seller, an entertainer to passers-by, a confidant of sorts - someone who is willing to provide a listening ear to anyone who needs one.<br><br>'People tell me all sorts of things, from marital problems to work woes,' the 65-year-old told us outside Meritus Mandarin hotel, where he usually sells tissues.<br><br>For example, a 40-something woman once approached him for advice because she suspected her husband was having an affair, he claimed.<br><br>'I could tell she was nearly in tears and didn't know what to do.<br><br>'I told her not to idolise one man, to be patient, to pray to the Lord. I also told her to communicate with her husband because men do not always know how to tell you that they want your love.<br><br>'Two months later, she looked for me near Novena Square and told me that she and her husband are doing all right. She sounded radiant.'<br><br>Another time, a young engineer was so stressed with life he wondered to Mr Goh whether he should quit to devote himself to church-work.<br><br>He told him he should continue to work and save money so that he can be stable and devote himself to church-work later.<br><br>Mr Goh said he left school at Secondary 4, was a clinical assistant in a hospital for four years and then worked as a clerk in various ministries for the next 14 years.<br><br>This was followed by a stint selling stationery for a printing company. He was also a passenger services officer at a cable-car station.<br><br>Then he became a tour guide and park assistant at the Jurong Crocodile Park.<br><br>He appeared in shows and handled the reptiles when visitors wanted snapshots.<br><br>But he hasn't had a regular job since 2000 when diabetes-induced glaucoma affected his eyes.<br><br>Now, he is about 95 per cent blind. He recently also had prostate surgery, but said his diabetes is under control.<br><br>The eldest of six siblings, Mr Goh separated from his wife 26 years ago and does not have children.<br><br>He lives on his own, renting a room for $120 in a friends's three-room HDB flat in Eunos. Can't he get a job?<br><br>His tired reply is that he has tried.<br><br>'I applied to work as an ice-cream seller, but my application was rejected because of poor eyesight,' said Mr Goh.<br><br>'I have also applied to do simple clerical or reception work, but the employers told me they don't employ someone older than 35 years old.'<br><br>Despite his old age and failing eyesight, Mr Goh is fiercely independent, travelling everywhere by MRT and bus, tapping his cane.<br><br>He is on his feet for four to five hours a day, five times a week.<br><br>He gets up to $70 on good days, selling tissues at $1 for four packets.<br><br>Said Mr Goh: 'I can't stay at home. I find such joy meeting and interacting with people.'<br><br>Singaporeans, he said, are a kind-hearted lot. 'A few times, a doctor and a company manager have driven me home.'<br><br>He even squirrels away some money to travel to Batam, Penang and parts of Thailand to visit churches and do missionary work.<br><br>'Selling tissues is not just about making a living for me. I see it as one way for me to pass my time and to reach out to people, and hopefully, to touch them in some way.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Are they begging &amp; breaking the law?<br><br>PEOPLE who solicit for money in return for packets of tissue paper can be fined for illegal hawking, said the National Environment Agency (NEA).<br><br>It can also be considered disguised begging, which is illegal.<br><br>Under the Environmental Public Health Act, those found peddling tissue paper can be fined up to $5,000 for illegal hawking.<br><br>Repeat offenders can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to three months, or both.<br><br>They can also be charged with begging under the Destitute Persons Act. Those convicted face a fine of up to $3,000 or up to two years in jail.<br><br>In recent times, there has been a call for the authorities to be more lenient with the elderly selling tissues.<br><br>The NEA declined to comment on whether laws will be relaxed, but said they are working with the relevant authorities to tackle the issue.<br><br>An NEA spokesman told The New Paper that they understand some people in financial difficulties want to hawk for a living.<br><br>But they advise people to apply for street hawking licences. That would allow them to sell ice cream, canned drinks and tidbits within their town council estates or parks.<br>- Maureen Koh<br><br></div>
