              <p>Do you even KNOW why SINGAPOREANS are angry at his lousy comments? Did you even bother to read before you typed your rubbish out?</p>
              <p>How about something easier, do you even know what's going on and the real issue being discussed here? Basically not only this new citizen singing the praises of the ruling party BUT also, the fact that he is a NEW CITIZEN, YET he attacked Singaporeans verbally.</p>
              <p>Not only that, his arguments aren't even't half correct.</p>

              <p>So be it, since we advocate to freedom of speech, but with responsibilites, he has the right to speech, but of course have to take the consequences of his speech, you can go on and condemn him, but if you are smart, you can learn from him, it is rare for  a new citizens to give his/her views/perspectives, and bear in mind, we will be hearing more of it. Coming Soon.</p>
              <p>New Citizen are like New bird, let them attack awhile, until they are long here, they will feel the pinch and stress too, got a neighbour family from North India living next to my cousin's condo, worked as a GM in some TATA company located here, he become a Citizen of Singapore 2 years ago, very proud and full of pride, keep attacking poor old singaporean verbally, loan and buy cars and other luxuries item, even condemned our school system, i dun give a damn whenever he talks to me during my Cousin pot luck club gathering. But during last financial crisis, he went into bad debts, sold his condos, cars and find life and cost of living here very difficult, drink alots and even now his career is at stake, and when i met him the last time, he was very quiet and asking me about the cheapest loan in town. So, dun worry about all these new bird, they will learn and grow to know the truth, and of course, as new bird, they will blar blar all the way, so it not worth getting angry or frustrated over it ya.</p>

              <p>Why does a Taiwanese 'hum' show so much concern with what others say about Singapore Leaders, when it remain silent in its 'cockle-shell' about its own Taiwanese ex-President as a jail bird ?</p>

              <p>It will need a lot of "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>DEMON</em></span>-stration' before the 'hum' will know how to stop its clitoris from flapping its ignorance to destroy the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>DEMOCRATIC</em></span> process in this Speaker's Corner with its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>DEMON</em></span>-cratic ways.</p>

              <p>If the Taiwanese 'hum' needs attention so badly, it should park its 'hum' in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sammyboyforum.com/faq.php?faq=vb3_board_faq#faq_vb3_board_usage">‘Sammyboy Forum’ </a>- and it will surely get all the attention it needs to satisfy its cravings as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>
