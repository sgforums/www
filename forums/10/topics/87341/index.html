NTUC is pro-govt and its policies which everybody know. But if you are union member and is treated unfairly,like boss owe you wages or CPF, the union can fight for you. Some employers will ask whether you are union member when you go for job interviews because they dun like union members.</div>

I can't say much for Dr Chee who only knows to dilute brain cells by mad ravings and insults, a suitable candidate he is not.

But a defamation suit seems to be an overkill. PM Goh's reputation is not demaged because not body believed in Chee.He is just making a laughing stock out of himself.
