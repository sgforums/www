            <div class='col-md body'>After reading all the dispute between Singapore and Malaysia regarding the water issue, I ask myself when is Singapore going to make our own water to drink? I mean from the beginning of the independent day, people of Singapore should know that under this precarious relationship of our two nation, things like the water issue will one day turn sour and eventually endanger our nation. More over is that we are one of the richest nation in Asia  and why instead of building water refinery facility we build the reservoir.<br>Isn't it a little too late until for a time like this? And till the recent news that I learn that the new facility will only supply 10% of the nation drinking water by 2005 if I'm not wrong.

But i think the reasons maybe many...<br><br>1... cost....<br>2... availability of alternative source...<br>3... technology....availability and accessibility...<br>4... the restrictions of the water agreedment...<br>5... demand for water...<br>6... competing funding needs from other govt department..<br>7... diplomatic considerations...<br><br>Thus ... its easier to always look back and say... things could have been done better... but then... back then... we wouldnt have the power to see the future...<br><br>As for future water supply... i think there is little need for worry... in view of the serious implication if there is insufficient water... the govt would certainly put 110% effort to ensure that our needs are met...<br><br>The current need of the govt would be to obtain sufficient water supply to replace the water agreedment that is expiring in 2011.. and perhaps a bit more to meet unforseen contingencies...<br><br>at present... about 50% of singapore water is from malaysia.. while the remaining is from local reservoir...<br><br>if the new project can produce an additional 10%.. that would push singapore's own domestic water supply to 60%... and if other projects slowly comes on line.. the percentage would probably be pushed higher...<br><br>Currently... there is no need for singapore to totally replace the water supply from malaysia as the final water agreedment would only expire in 2061...  it would be better if we make good use of this water resources until such a time in the future when the cost of water desalination or recycling becomes even cheaper....then today...<br><br>Finally... who knows wat will happen in the future?? 60 years could see malaysia change the PM at least 3 times over... mahatir may not sign... future malaysian PM might... and who knows... they may end up buying water from us...in 60 years... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
