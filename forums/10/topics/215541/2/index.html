            <div class='col-md body'>the only thing i would say from my own experience, NTUC services LOUSY...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">Court sets aside attempt to make him bankrupt<br>Stolen car, brought for $125,000, valued at $50,000. Insurer sues owner when he stops repaying loan Parties must now agree on market value of car<br><br>By Tan May Ping<br><br>October 17, 2006<br><br>FIRST, his car was stolen. That was just the start of his problems.<br><br>'I was stunned. I did not know where they got that amount from. If they were willing to loan me $118,000 for the car, it show the car was worth that much.' said, Mr Ng (above) with a Grandis brochure -- KELVIN CHNG<br>When he didn't pay the car loan instalments while his insurer investigated the case, he was served with a bankruptcy notice.<br><br>There was another shock in store.<br><br>The insurance company valued his 10-month-old car, which he had bought for $124,700 in 2004, at only $50,000.<br><br>This was a massive drop of $74,700 or a 60 per cent depreciation in the car's value in less than a year.<br><br>What it meant was that he had not only lost his car, but would still owe more than $68,000 after the insurance payout for his loss.<br><br>NTUC Income Insurance Cooperative is both his insurer and loan company. It said the value was decided with the help of 'independent market sources' and a panel of appraisers.<br><br>FOUGHT PETITION<br><br>Mr Anthony Ng, represented by lawyer Mahmood Gaznavi, fought the bankruptcy petition and the High Court set it aside on 28 Sep.<br><br>Mr Ng, 33, who runs an interior design and construction business, had bought the car, a Mitsubishi Grandis, on 31 Aug 2004.<br><br>He told The New Paper that he chose NTUC Income for both the insurance and financing as it was offering a package deal.<br><br>He made a down payment of $6,700, and took a loan for the remaining $118,000.<br><br>On 28 Jun last year, when he went to visit a cousin in Pasir Ris, the car was stolen.<br><br>He had parked it in a multi-storey carpark on Pasir Ris Street 53.<br><br>POLICE REPORT<br><br>The car had an alarm but Mr Ng did not know whether it went off.<br><br>'I don't know why I was so 'suay' (unlucky in Hokkien). There were other Grandis cars there too,' he said.<br><br>He made a police report the same day, and later informed his insurer on the phone.<br><br>Mr Ng claims that the insurance officer he spoke to told him he didn't have to pay the loan instalments while the case was being investigated.<br><br>He also claimed that the person said she would inform the loan department of his case. However, he does not remember the name of the person.<br><br>Said Mr Ng: 'I assumed she would do so since both are under the same company. Besides, at the beginning, they promoted themselves as offering a package.'<br><br>He was also hoping the car could be recovered.<br><br>But the police said it remained on the list of stolen cars.<br><br>Mr Ng lodged a formal report with NTUC Income on 2 Sep last year. On 9 Dec, he received a letter from its loan department demanding payment for the outstanding amount, as he had lapsed in paying his instalments.<br><br>After that, Mr Ng claims, he made repeated attempts to clarify the matter with NTUC Income over the phone.<br><br>Then on 3 Feb, NTUC Income started bankruptcy proceedings against him. It alleged that he owed $68,423.39.<br><br>OUTSTANDING LOAN<br><br>The sum was calculated by deducting $50,000 - the estimated value of the car as of 1 Dec 2005 - from his outstanding loan, which, with interest, was $118,423.39.<br><br>The value of the car was estimated by two surveyors appointed by NTUC Income: Pang's Motor Trading and ETS Auto Trading.<br><br>'I was stunned. I did not know where they got that amount from,' said Mr Ng.<br><br>'If they were willing to loan me $118,000 for the car, it shows the car was worth that much. How could it be that after just 10 months, my car was worth only $50,000?'<br><br>The New Paper checked with four motor trading companies.<br><br>While the companies, which declined to be named, could not say for sure how much a 10-month-old Mitsubishi Grandis would have cost in June 2005 (when Mr Ng's car went missing), all of them gave estimates of more than $70,000.<br><br>A search of classified advertisements in The Straits Times in June last year showed one for a 2004 Grandis with an asking price of $79,800.<br><br>When the matter could not be resolved, Mr Ng hired law firm Mahmood Gaznavi &amp; Partners to fight his case.<br><br>Mr Ng challenged the bankruptcy petition in the high court.<br><br>HE TAKES TAXIS, BUSES<br><br>His lawyer told The New Paper that the court allowed Mr Ng's application that the bankruptcy petition be set aside.<br><br>'It is now up to NTUC Income and my client to agree on the market value of the stolen vehicle,' said Mr Gaznavi.<br><br>Mr Ng has been getting around using another car which he shares with his parents. He has also been taking taxis, buses, and getting rides from friends.<br><br>And he can't wait to see the matter settled.<br><br>'I just want them to be fair to me,' he said. 'I didn't get some one to steal my car, and when it happened, it already didn't feel good.'<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
