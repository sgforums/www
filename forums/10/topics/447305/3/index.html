              <p>I have just watched the WP conference.</p>
              <p>It seemed that the guy is being sacked for not standing forward

              his sacking.</p>
              <p>Strange way of approach by WP to sack some one without
              confirming the allegations.</p>

              <p>He is innocent unless proven guilty of the allegations.</p>
              <p>So, he should be give more chance to stand forward to defend himself instead of sacking without getting into the root of the issue.</p>

              <p>there is a movie called sex, lies and politics.</p>
              <p>remember bill clinton, he lied about the oral sex with monica lewinsky in 1997, almost kena impeached by the congress, but didnt. his marriage with hilary clinton survives, hope his own marriage also survive. but take note, this is his own making, no one but himself. he has to be accountable to his own actions.</p>

              <p>WP will promote gerald giam. I see LTK quite dote on him. Yaw is disappointing. LTK wanted to groom to be successor of him. Now he also sad.<br>I feel WP had given him period of time to account and set a due date for him. Yaw choose not to reply.</p>
              <p>Full of compassion. I think WP did the right thing cos they feel cannot allow this kind of things to happen and do not want to set a predicesor case.</p>

              <p>The WP Council know more than us, and must have based their

              <p>I cannot think of a better way to handle this issue. They gave time to the guy to explain but that guy wasn't transparent nor accountable for his actions, and this simply means they had to get rid of a person lacking morals.</p>

              <p>Was listenin to 938 this morning, and was sizing what's the main pts of criticisms against this decision? too long? not proven until guilty? Mr Low knows Yau for so long? morality checks?</p>
              <p>Firstly, kudos to WP for taking this harsh but necessary move. For me, better late than never. I think WP has given enough time for this for this matter to settle, before making the decision. And to show, it was not done in the heat of things.</p>
              <p>For me as a public, I do believe Yau may have explained to the relevant people in the party. But we are not visible to that.</p>
              <p>As for morality checks, from the MOE scholar in UK, to the recent transgressions of high civil servants, apparently, this is not 100% fool proof, but how the system kicks in if there are any stepping out of the line. As I read in strait times, Mr Teo also shared why there is a delay in the announcements.</p>
              <p>lastly, WP has taken the moral high grounds and show they can X even their heir apparent to Mr Low if he steps out of line. It may have ripple effect on the rest, but I am still sure some will be resistant and continue to assure us they are doing their best despite the floodings, the crowdings, and etc etc.. Sigh..</p>

              <p>I don't mind GY.  I don't mind another WP candidate as long as he's good.  But I will mind if Desmond Choo becomes MP.  From the way he responded during last year saga of "the PA not allowing Opposition Party MP to some events", I don't have high opinion of this person's character although he may have itchy issues like Yaw.</p>
