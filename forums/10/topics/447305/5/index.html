Even fellow party members are unable to get in touch with former Workers' Party (WP) Hougang Member of Parliament Yaw Shin Leong.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">Has he gone missing? Did he flee the country? These are some questions on people's minds after news  broke out about his alleged affairs.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">The New Paper and Lianhe Wanbao reported that Mr Yaw was spotted alone with luggage on Wednesday night at Changi Airport Terminal 1.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">According to The New Paper, Mr Yaw was no longer in Singapore by the time WP announced his expulsion at a press conference held at 5pm.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">After the announcement, a Lianhe Wanbao reporter attempted to contact Mr Yaw via iPhone's WhatsApp app, and noticed that the last time he was online was 6.29pm.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">Mr Yaw was not at home when reporters visited him at 11.30pm and the next day at 6am.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">Lianhe Wanbao also reported that the married woman in question has not returned home for a few weeks.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">This is the first time an MP was expelled based on allegations of his private life.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">For the past month, Mr Yaw remained tight-lipped on allegations accusing him of having an extramarital affair with a married party colleague. He also answered all media queries with a "no comment".</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">His silence forced the party to act after he avoided several opportunites to explain himself.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">"We have invited Shin Leong to come to speak with the council, but he has not done so," said Ms Lim at the press conference.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">She said that party's central executive council (CEC) gave him one more shot at explaining himself but he chose not to come.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">Ms Lim also said the party could not contact Mr Yaw to inform him of the CEC's decision to expel him and had to speak to his wife instead.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">The recent incidents have prompted National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan to say that WP should come clean with the people and why it took so long to investigate the allegations.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also commented on WP's handling of Yaw's alleged affair, saying that the WP has let down Hougang voters.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">However, Mr Tay, a 32-year-old engineer said that he would continue to support WP.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">"As a public figure, Mr Yaw is supposed to be a role model and should not have done what he supposedly did. This whole issue, however, does not affect my support for WP," told Mr Tay to The New Paper.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px initial initial;">Some people Lianhe Wanbao spoke to said they will continue to support WP, while others said they believe that the People's Action Party will have an opportunity this time to win Hougang single-member constituency back. Hougang has been in the hands of WP since 1991.</p>

              <p>wah... u sound like you so sure about that... well.. if really there is an affair, where got so easily exposed one... Nicole seah is young and inexperienced, yes thats quite true but in terms of capability and maturity in comparison to tin, she way way much better. Wouldn't mind her being the MP becos the MP wont be working alone anyway, there will definitely be a team to guide her. Plus i do not actually believes that such affairs being exposed are only of the opposition, politics is dark, probably everywhere has such stuffs.</p>

              <p>Friend......I can confirm the Foo Mee Har rumour is false....because......that internet poster Scoober say, that the affair has been known for years already.........which means.....it doesnt make sense......</p>
              <p>Because Foo Mee Har only enter politics very recently......not "several years"</p>
              <p>So either this Scoober guy exaggerate it and add some spices on his own.....or......it's totally fake and made up.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, it's not accurate.</p>
              <p>Unless Foo Mee Har know Shanmugam before she enter politics, when shes in private life that time......and they were friends somehow......but I doubt it......and didnt she went overseas several times.....so when did she get to know Shanmugam and had an affair with him......the timing just didnt match.</p>
              <p>Besides....it means that at that time PAP has failed in screening Foo Mee Har personal background....missed that a married woman was having an affair.....and also missed the Shanmugam personal background check.</p>
              <p>I dont think it is likely.</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>I still think it is a random gossip made up by a 16 year old boy.</p>

              <p>It will be very colourful if there is a NSeah vs TPL election in Hougang during the upcoming by election.  Tin Pei Ling sure win one, cuz that's why Straits times reported some time ago, saying that these two ladies one:one figure without GCT nor GRC, Tin will still win.  So PAP, send Tin bah!  We have confidence in her.  Naymind if she too bz with Macpherson.  Within a short period, the residents were already warming up to her, so she said in one of the interviews after GE. So one more small little Hougang SMC is not problem to her.  She very good.  Very hardworking.  Very sincere.  She will sure make Hougang very erhmm... very erh...  I dunno what to say.</p>

              <p>The first thing is the willingness to serve the people.</p>
              <p>Although Yaw have done wrong in his personal life, I dun see any bad remarks about him in not performing his duty as a MP.</p>
              <p>So, he should still be given credit for his work.</p>
              <p>As for the press, please focus on OTHER NATIONAL AGENDA that PM Lee have mentioned on the FIRST PAGE, instead of hunting down Mr Yaw which have no value for general mass.</p>
              <p>As for Nicole Seah, she have to start somewhere to gain experience in serving the people.</p>
              <p>Under the leadership of WP, it is good chance for her to develop her experience instead of hiding under the wing of GRC like Tin Tin.</p>

              <p>LTK and team should by now work hard to at least resolve some real issues facing the Hougang....one of which is the cleanliness of the estate....</p>
              <p>sweeping the party clean should be extended to rolling up their sleeves and get their hands dirty as the first good move...</p>
