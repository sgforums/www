              <p>a team of people supporting her and a team of people guiding her are 2 different things.</p>
              <p>even if she were to use a group of consultants she will need to know what she wants, and ask the right questions.</p>
              <p>LTK transform WP, and develop it to what it is today. He has been leading and building the team to support him.YSL worked under him for many years to learn!!</p>
              <p>Chiam ST has not proven himself as capable of building a party. He got kicked out of his own party, or his leaders changed camp in groups. </p>
              <p>Ting still has the PAP and GCT to guide her and support her. Lets see how far Nicole can do.</p>

              <p>Friend......I can confirm the Foo Mee Har rumour is
              false....because......that internet poster Scoober say, that the
              affair has been known for years already.........which means.....it
              doesnt make sense......</p>
              <p>Because Foo Mee Har only enter politics very recently......not
              "several years"</p>
              <p>So either this Scoober guy exaggerate it and add some spices on
              his own.....or......it's totally fake and made up.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, it's not accurate.</p>
              <p>Unless Foo Mee Har know Shanmugam before she enter politics,
              when shes in private life that time......and they were friends
              somehow......but I doubt it......and didnt she went overseas
              several times.....so when did she get to know Shanmugam and had an
              affair with him......the timing just didnt match.</p>
              <p>Besides....it means that at that time PAP has failed in
              screening Foo Mee Har personal background....missed that a married
              woman was having an affair.....and also missed the Shanmugam
              personal background check.</p>
              <p>I dont think it is likely.</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>I still think it is a random gossip made up by a 16 year old
              boy.</p>

              <p>Maybe the person using Scroobal nick is Shanmugam's ex, for all we know. Hence he/she/it cannot be traced even by the best lawyers in town.</p>
