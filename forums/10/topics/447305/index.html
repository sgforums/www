            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Workers’ Party has expelled Yaw Shin Leong from the party with immediate effect.<br><br>WP believes strongly in transparency and accountability, and expects no less from our party members, especially our Members of Parliament.<br><br>Shin Leong has been accused of several indiscretions in his private life. By continuing not to account to the Party and the people, especially the residents of Hougang, he has broken the faith, trust and expectations of the Party and People. <br><br>This is a difficult and painful decision for us. Shin Leong has been a core member of the Party leadership for more than 10 years, and has made significant and unique contributions towards WP’s growth. He has also served the residents of Hougang diligently. However, the Council has decided that it is in the public interest to take this step.<br><br>We also believe it is only fair to the Hougang residents that they have another opportunity to elect their Member of Parliament.<br><br>We apologise for having to put them through a by-election. <br><br>We wish to assure Hougang residents that they will continue to be served by the Party until the by-election is called.<br><br>The Meet the People sessions in Hougang will continue, with the other MPs covering. Residents are free to contact any WP MP for assistance. In addition, town council services will continue to be provided under the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council.<br><br>Finally, we wish to thank the public for their concern towards the Party and for walking with us through this difficult period. <br><br><br>å·¥äººå…šå¯¹è®®å‘˜æœ‰ä¸€å®šçš„è¦�æ±‚ã€‚è®®å‘˜æ˜¯äººæ°‘çš„ä»£è®®å£«ï¼Œä¹Ÿæ˜¯ä¸ªå…¬ä¼—äººç‰©ï¼›å¿…é¡»å�šä¸ªå¥½æ¦œæ ·ï¼›æœ€é‡�è¦�çš„æ˜¯æœ‰æ‹…å½“ï¼Œè‚¯è´Ÿ è´£ã€‚<br><br>æœ€è¿‘å¤§ä¼—ä¼ åª’æŽ¥äºŒè¿žä¸‰å‡ºçŽ°å¯¹é¥¶æ¬£é¾™ç§�ç§�ä¸¥é‡�çš„æŒ‡æŽ§ï¼Œä»–é€‰æ‹©ä¸�å›žåº”ï¼Œä¹Ÿä¸�å‡ºæ�¥è§£é‡Šæ¸…æ¥šï¼Œæ˜¯ä¸�è´Ÿè´£ä»»çš„è¡Œä¸ºï¼Œä¹Ÿ é€ æˆ�äº†ä¿¡ä»»å�±æœºã€‚<br><br>å�Žæ¸¯æ˜¯æ��å�«æ–°åŠ å�¡æ°‘ä¸»æ”¿æ²»çš„å…ˆé”‹ï¼Œæ²¡æœ‰å�Žæ¸¯20å¹´æ�¥çš„æ”¯æŒ�ï¼Œå·¥äººå…šä¸�ä¼šæœ‰ä»Šå¤©çš„å�‘å±•ï¼Œæ–°åŠ å�¡ä¹Ÿä¸�ä¼šåœ¨æ°‘ä¸»çš„ è¿‡ç¨‹ä¸­è¿ˆæ­¥å‰�è¿›ã€‚<br><br>æˆ‘ä»¬ä¸�èƒ½è¾œè´Ÿå�Žæ¸¯é€‰æ°‘çš„æ”¯æŒ�å’ŒæœŸæœ›ï¼Œå› æ­¤å†³å®šå¼€é™¤é¥¶æ¬£é¾™ï¼Œè®©å�Žæ¸¯é€‰æ°‘å�¯ä»¥å†�æ¬¡å�šå‡ºå†³å®šã€‚<br><br>ç”±äºŽè¿™ä¸ªäº‹ä»¶ï¼Œä½¿åˆ°å�Žæ¸¯äººæ„Ÿåˆ°å›°æ‰°ï¼Œä¹Ÿé€ æˆ�å�Žæ¸¯åŒºéœ€è¦�è¡¥é€‰ï¼Œæˆ‘å�‘å�Žæ¸¯é€‰æ°‘é�“æ­‰ã€‚æˆ‘ä¹Ÿæ„Ÿè°¢åœ¨è¿™å›°éš¾æ—¶æœŸä¸�ç¦»ä¸� å¼ƒï¼Œä¸Žæˆ‘ä»¬å…±å�Œå¥‹æ–—çš„æ–°åŠ å�¡äººã€‚<br><br>ä»ŽçŽ°åœ¨å¼€å§‹åˆ°è¡¥é€‰ä¸¾è¡ŒæœŸé—´ï¼Œåœ¨å�Žæ¸¯æ¯�å‘¨çš„æŽ¥è§�é€‰æ°‘ä¾�æ—§è¿›è¡Œã€‚é˜¿è£•å°¼ï¼�å�Žæ¸¯å¸‚é•‡ç�†äº‹ä¼šä¹Ÿä¼šç…§å¸¸è¿� ä½œã€‚<br><br>WORKERS' PARTY<br>15 February 2012<br><br><a href="http://wp.sg/2012/02/expulsion-of-yaw-shin-leong-from-party-membership/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://wp.sg/2012/02/expulsion-of-ya...ty-membership/</span></span></a></p></div>

              <p>what double-edged sword?</p>
              <p>they have just shown what accountability means...</p>
              <p>and with that, they just made sure everyone in their party maintains discipline and maintain and improve on high standards...</p>
              <p>we don't want any more sub-standard MPs representing us... especially when there are so many in parliament already</p>

              <p>exactly...</p>
              <p>there are too many substandard MPs in there already...</p>
              <p>and risk losing Hougang?</p>
              <p>or risk losing EVERYTHING they have worked for by keeping it when the position is untenable?</p>
              <p>then they are no better than the MIW...</p>
              <p>now they have claimed the moral high ground.. and showed the MIW what accountability is.. and that no one, MP or whatever, is above the principles they set and above the standards for the people..</p>
              <p>they could have just issued a gag order and then sued the shit out of whoever let the news out.. just like that MIW are doing now with scroobal...</p>
              <p>with that, they also showed integrity and that they will not let someone in their party sully their reputation with their actions.. and they are willing and able to do the drastic thing, even if it means losing a constituency or a place to keep everything above board..</p>
              <p>unlike what is taught and held sacred by the MIW, they are showing by example that it is not what you have but how you got it which allows you to hold your head up high</p>
              <p>ball is now in the court of the MIW...</p>

              <p>WP is making a stand here.... they're saying '<em>This fella is scum, we're distancing ourselves from him even if it means risking a loss in the by-election'.</em></p>
