              <p>George Yeo may not be selected for the battle....he has lost Aljunied and all would subject to how favourable is he to LHL and his cabinet....</p>
              <p>moreover, LHL is bidding time to find a strong and fresh face to win the voters' hearts....after the recent historic election results, the government would have more or less understand the importance of someone with an impeccable character and track records to stand up to Hougang's firm and continuous strong belief in LTK's leadership....in other words, the Hougang seat is still tilted in favour of the opposition and fortunateky that WP has made that prompt decision to sack YSL...so the odds are still 80/20</p>
              <p>LHL may put up someone new but "likeable" or within the ranks someone experienced or would have been a back bencher for quite sometime....definitely someone who has an impeccable record given the current scandal of YSL....if to avoid speculation of scandals...putting forth a matured lady or as vocal as Nicole Seah may also be a good idea....at this time...</p>

              <p>The way LHL put it - he has the last say on Hougang election or no election!</p>
              <p>I interpret what he meant as - no election for Hougang, not least for the foreseeable future.   </p>

              <p>If scroobal has the evidence to back up his claims, he should come out into the open and present his case.</p>
              <p>But the lawyer said that he couldn't track down scroolbal. This is odd in my view. If the powers that be really wanted to hunt down scroobal, I'm sure it could be done.</p>
              <p>So in this case, they didn't want to push scroobal to the wall. This is not PAP's style.</p>
