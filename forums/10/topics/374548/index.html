              <p>Much has been written on the economic impact of the uncontrolled influx of foreigners into Singapore. Little is known about the underlying political implications.</p>
              <p>While no studies have been conducted on the voting patterns of immigrants, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>it is likely that a majority of them will be pro-government, given that it is the government which gives them the opportunity to succeed in Singapore.</strong></span></p>
              <p>To a Chinese or Indian immigrant family completely clueless about Singapore’s political baggage or history, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the PAP represents a sort of “savior” to them without which they will not be allowed to start life afresh here.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Furthermore, the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>PAP-controlled grassroots organizations have been actively reaching out to the new citizens through hosting a variety of activities to help them “integrate” into the community to the extent of giving them positions in the Residents Committees’.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With the number of new citizens arriving on Singapore’s shores increasing at a frentic rate, they will form an influential voting bloc in future elections and the PAP is well aware of it.</p>
              <p>Besides the vote in their hands, new citizens also help to styme the development of the citizenry’s political awareness indirectly.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>By keeping the median wages of the Singapore worker down and posing a constant threat to their livelihoods, it creates a siege mentality in Singaporeans that they will lose out in the rat race unless they continue working hard to earn a living.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>With their attention and energies focused completely on economic survival, they will be apathetic towards current affairs and local politics.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>There lies the ingenuity of the PAP</strong></span>. No matter how tough life is, it will ensure that nobody goes hungry in Singapore. Prices of foodstuff and living necessities are kept low to ensure that even the destitute and homeless get one basic meal a day.</p>
              <p>The middle class, with their endless fixation on the materialistic pursuits in life, will have little motivation to join politics to create “trouble” for the government which explains why most Singaporeans are generally averse to politics.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>A nonchalant and ignorant citizenry is a key to the continued hegemony of the PAP as recent events have shown. Despite widespread public disaffect towards the lossess suffered by Temasek and GIC, they are never really threatened.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Political dissatisfaction is limited chiefly to cyberspace where it exerts a negligible impact on the rest of the enslaved population which is still unaware of its inherent political rights.</p>
              <p>All kinds of repressive laws were put in place to prevent the public expression of political dissent as it will have serious ramifications on the popularity and legitimacy of the regime.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>A new aristocracy is emerging with the new citizens becoming increasingly part of the PAP’s core support base. In fact, some of them have already been co-opted into the regime and appointed as Members of Parliament.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With no foreseeable opposition in sight, the system which is specifically designed to perpetuate one-party rule, will continue to keep the PAP in power for a long time to come, elections being a 5 yearly necessary “nuisance” in order to keep its democratic pretensions alive.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Singaporeans can continue to complain for all they like. The power of their vote is being eroded gradually with each passing day as more and more foreigners take up Singapore citizenship.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Either they toe the official line or ship out altogether. As the feebled opposition continues its ignonimous journey into oblivion, the PAP is quietly rebuilding its power base, slowly but steadily.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>With the new citizens firmly integrated into the PAP’s system followed by years of indoctrination by the state propaganda machinery, we will see another generation of brainwashed citizens who are eternally “grateful” to the PAP.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Agreed. But for each foreigner that Singapore nurtured and fatten to be global citizen, there will always be the endless pool of third world people knocking on our door, to get in. <br><br>So long as they (this supply) get into the Singapore's machinery, they will be at the mercy of the PAP to milk them for political advantage - be whatever it may be. <br><br>And this inflow stream of people will continue in the foreseeable furture.</p>

              <p>Let's not generalize or insult the intelligence of the new immigrants.</p>
              <p>Most of them that made the grade to become citizens are not the lowly educated ah sengs or ah lians of our historical low education past . Majority of them are educated, most holding degrees and above or successful business people and artistes.</p>
              <p>These are not stupid people, that are moved more by emotions than reason and logic.</p>
              <p>If I am a despotic tyrannical ruler, it would be my policy to keep EVERYONE stupid, and accept only those whose brain power is lower than mine, or it would hell to maintain my throne.</p>
              <p>This was a fact, and oft practiced method of control. Our ex-colonnial cowardly brits were clear examples. They never invested in education. It was only meant for the rich or those whom were of use to the thieving empire.</p>
              <p>But eversince our self rule, no citizen child had been denied of education. A significant portion of our wealth had been used and are continuing to be use for further education of our young, regardless of white or black, rich or poor. Everyone had a chance to rise, based on meritocracy, from the daughter of a tycoon to a son of a roadsweeper.</p>
              <p>Education had been a coner stone of our state building policy. Unlike the commies, whom were hell bent on keeping its people stupid, even as recent as the 60s in China and 90s in Burma.</p>
              <p>The new immigrants should blend well with us all, being educated. And being educated, they would be able to analyse and rationalize which political party to be afliliated to, the one that would serve society - made up of their families, relatives friends and ours - best.</p>
              <p>The average 66% that voted for the ruling party are not made up of uneducated people, for very little is left of them since the 70s. We had been achieving close to 100% literacy rates with each O and A level cohorts.</p>
              <p>Not only are these 66% voters educated, they are humans too. Gratitude alone will not keep them fed. It takes positive political actions that can lift up lives, and so far, the only political party that are working seriously is the ruling party. Do admit it and give credit where it is due. There is no perfection anyway, and whom is next best then? Citizens do have a mind of their own to think, and we do have freedom of thought.</p>
              <p>And the opposition party? What had they actively done or change our lives? Heck! if there are any opposition party of calibre, it would be the unstoppable internet! Without such access, we would have to depend on state media for info, and the ruling party would not need to embrace it or open itself up more to give more space to citizens.</p>
              <p>But too bad, the internat CANNOT govern a nation, it can only give info, impersonal, and absolutely untrustworthy as a reliable source for it is filled with lies and half truths hidden among truths. Reminds me of some politician wannabe I know.</p>
