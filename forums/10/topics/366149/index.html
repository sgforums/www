              <p><strong>Malaysiakini, 26 Jun 2009, Olinda Brazil</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>'I curse the day I was born a Singaporean'</strong></span><br> <br> It is very amusing to see how Malaysians (probably of the minority
              races) have spasms of ecstasy when referring to Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) in
              Malaysian forums. From across the border in Malaysia, Singapore seems
              like Wonderland and LKY like a benevolent god.<br> <br> As a Chinese Singaporean, born of Malaysian parents who took up
              citizenship here in Singapore, I can understand why they feel this way.
              The grouses are familiar: NEP, corruption and ineptitude in governance.<br> <br> Let me provide an insight on how it is like to be a Singaporean.<span style="color: red;"><strong> I must first stress that new immigrants or Permanent Residents (PRs)
              from Malaysia (like my parents) will not experience any disadvantages.
              It is the children of these people (like me) or new PRs' children (who
              will be Singaporean) who will feel the disadvantages most sorely, and
              curse the fact they were born in Singapore:</strong></span><br> <br> On the relative development of both countries - Singpore developed well
              largely due to early good advice given to LKY, its strategic position,
              the lack of natural disasters and its easily-governable size. Malaysia
              lags behind in spite of its natural resources because of its larger
              size, poorer planning/ execution, more difficult decision-making and
              corruption.<br> <br> However, Singapore has problems at present because its development
              model is outdated. As LKY still insists on the methods recommended tens
              of years ago, trouble is looming. There is no impetus to change because
              there is no one who dares to disagree. The media prints only
              propaganda, the courts will always find the government blameless as the
              government runs 70% of the economy.<br> <br> The opposition has been persecuted to the point where only those with
              nothing to lose will dare to oppose, and the common people are scared
              to death of arbitrary arrest.<br> <br> Yes, corruption is more widespread in Malaysia. But in Singapore, it
              also exists - though restricted to the top political elite and in a
              legalised form. In Malaysia, many get a share of the cake but in
              Singapore, only a select few get a share of the cake.<br> <br> Many scoff at the position of the Malay rulers. But are they aware of
              the many dubious acts of LKY and his cronies - his ‘cooperation’ with
              the wartime Japanese, then the Communists and then the British (he
              betrayed the latter two in the end)? <br> <br> And the actions taken by him and his courts to destroy the opposition,
              moves which are reported in a twisted manner by his press? A shining
              example of good character?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Yes, up till recently, Singapore was performing
              excellently. But at the same time, the ordinary people had the fruits
              of their labour taken away.</strong></span><span style="font-size: large;"><strong> We seem rich but yet are in debt. </strong></span>The
              government apartments are now exorbitantly priced. Cars are a necessity
              (given the poor performance of the profit-oriented public transport
              companies) but are also exorbitantly priced. <br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Much of our money is locked in the Provident Fund and it is becoming impossible to get it back while we are still alive.</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yes, all races are treated equally - and they are sucked dry equally</span>.</strong></span>This
              is the pivotal point in times when things became bad. By the way, the
              money in the Provident Fund (as well as in the reserves) is used for
              investment - for which there is almost no transparency and
              accountability. <br> <br> Huge losses have been incurred in the current crisis yet the ruling
              party still baulks at spending a million or two on the poor. Oh, and we
              spend twice as much on defence as Malaysia despite being at least 400
              times smaller.<br> <br> Instead of addressing the root of the problems, LKY's son (yes, his son
              - by the way did Dr Mahathir install his son as prime minister?)
              decided to take action on only one aspect of the problem, in a negative
              manner. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Instead of lowering costs for citizens, and therefore maintaining wage levels, he decided to import foreigners to lower cost. </strong></span><br> <br> It is effective - foreigners earn much more per hour than they do back
              home. They are stuck with the same employer for the duration of their
              visa, hence they are obedient. If they are sacked, they have to go
              home. And home means facing unpaid debts which they incurred in getting
              to Singapore. So which foreign worker will dare to resist exploitation?
              <br> <br> This means the ‘choosy’ Singaporeans get to twiddle thumbs at home. And
              would the Singaporean ministers care? They are paid $S$2 million basic
              per year, a performance bonus of up to eight months, and get a pension
              when they reach retirement age. Good clean governance, huh? Oh yes, the
              judges are paid the same too so not surprisingly they always find for
              the government.<br> <br> Malaysians are LKY's top choice. It gratifies him to poach bright
              minority students which his old pal Dr Mahathir had educated. They get
              good jobs (there is supposedly a quota to be filled), will not get
              sacked (as it means they go back to Dr M) and are favoured by
              corporations, as they do not have national service obligations. <br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>None want to be citizens - at the end of the day,
              they will retire to the Malaysia (which they hate so much) to enjoy the
              Singapore dollar’s strength.</strong></span> God have mercy on the children they leave behind!  <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Currently one person in three is a
              foreigner in Singapore. The press chooses to obfuscate matters by
              lumping citizens and PRs together in their reporting (as 'resident
              population') so the huge number of foreigners in Singapore is
              understated.</strong></span><br> <br> To all Malaysians who love LKY, you have to be ruled by him, not as a
              PR turned citizen, but as a born and bred Singaporean, to understand
              that he is not what you think.You curse Dr Mahathir because you know
              LKY will treat you like lords. You are correct but very shortsighted
              and shallow. <br> <br> Dr Mahathir may be much less than perfect, but only ignorant fools will
              say LKY is better than him. Singapore residents receive two broadsheet
              pages daily on how bad things are in Malaysia, but no Singaporean
              commentator will blast LKY and compare him to Dr Mahathir. <br> <br> Why? Because it is stupid to compare - we have not been ruled by Dr
              Mahathir or Umno so how are we able to compare? Using anecdotal
              evidence supplied by privileged fellow countrymen is poor practice.</p>

              <p>This person appears to be a pretty smart chap.  Writes well.  I wonder why he is so bitter.  Obviously he has a good education and can articulate his thoughts.  With the ability that he has, he can easily leave Singapore and strike out else where.  No need to be beholden to LKY and his decendants.  The world is so big.  Why limit oneself to a small island?  Unless Singapore is still the best place to be.</p>

              <p><br>Racial harmony my foot!  How many people of another race do you know other than people you work with or go to school with?  Have you ever invited peolple of a different race to your house or visited the house of someone of a different race?  Racial harmony is just government propaganda.  Everyone has been warned not to create trouble even if he is unhappy.  Just grin an bear with it.  It's all good if you belong to the dominant race.  You just have to be upset about how ministers live a good life and you're not.  You don't care how the others are suffering.</p>

              <p>If I were a Malay Malaysian, I would be ashamed and never be able to hold my head high. Any pride that I display to others would be based on inflated ego of my true self worth, with is nothing and all hot air.</p>
              <p>Malay Malaysians are stupid, lazy and docile. This unfortunately is the perception held by those who passes by Malaysia. Malaysia's NEP only confirms this perception. for which human group would need to supress others, deny universal sufferage and elevate an ethnic group with huge opportunities denied to others unless they are a weak group of humans?</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we as a society had never adopted such racist policies, but had  sought to provide equality and dignity for all including our Malays whom we believe are no different from any of us, and if given the chance, they would excel just like any other ethnic group.</p>
              <p>It is with true pride as a chinese citizen I look at my malay compatriots owning their properties, made it to top Unis here and overseas, hold on to jobs, serve in our NS to protect us. They took nothing that we other ethnic group did not enjoy.</p>
              <p>Should my reservist unit be seconded to our Malay general, his every word would be our command, for we citizens look beyond the color of his skin or his ethnic belongings, but look towards the system that promoted him and is where our loyalties lay -SAF, the institution that protects and answerable to society through our freely elected MPs and Parliament.</p>
              <p>And it is the 'system' that keeps us all equal - rule of law. Anyone is free to seek redress from the law - our corrupt free courts - against anyone else, rich or poor. Even our PM had been hauled to a civilian court while still in office and disgustedly cross-examined there, something which no other country would allow, let alone contemplate.</p>
              <p>Singapore governance may be far from perfect, but the model which we are comparing is not that of any mortal rule, let alone to the cruel tyrant racist mad hatter, but one that is of eternal glory envisioned by philosophers since the dawn of civilisation.</p>
              <p>It will be our civic duty as citizens to groom and be prepared for that human enfranchisement model of governance, which may take generations yet, regardless if thru the ruling party or the opposition, an ideal we must all patiently cultivate, if not for us, at least for the next generations.</p>
              <p>Singapore is our evolving homeland, our one and only whom our forefathers had suffered and worked hard for, by ourselves or with help from motivated foreigners turned citizens who shares our vision, one of which is that no one, no matter how insignificant he is in our society, will not get left behind as we all progress together regardless of rapid or slow economic growth.</p>
              <p>I am a egalitarian by choice and doubted Darwin's work while still as a young boy. But reading the first article in this thread , I began to believe that Darwin may be right - Natural selection is at work, and will soon see the demise of the proven weak writer. May he be an exception rather than the norm. I and many more other educated citizens lived to fight and prove Darwin's theories wrong - given the right man-made conditions and environment such as education and opportunities, anyone can excel.</p>

              <p><br> If he wants change, then he should join opposition.  Or join
              PAP and change from within which is almost impossible.  He can
              have his cake and eat it too if he moves to a better place and
              still continuing cursing the despots.  That way, he does not
              have to life in this miserable place.  Perhaps then he can
              write with better perspective.  Not like some frustrated
