              <p><br>Racial harmony my foot!  How many people of another race do you know other than people you work with or go to school with?  Have you ever invited peolple of a different race to your house or visited the house of someone of a different race?  Racial harmony is just government propaganda.  Everyone has been warned not to create trouble even if he is unhappy.  Just grin an bear with it.  It's all good if you belong to the dominant race.  You just have to be upset about how ministers live a good life and you're not.  You don't care how the others are suffering.</p>

              <p>If the bank gave you the loan, meaning they see you got up and believe you can pay, with interest! they believe you can more than afford the principle sum the bank give you!</p>

              <p>After 10 years, if you can sell the house and have capital appreciation to pay off  the bank, and have surplus, and 10 years of staying in the flat, you have succeeded in this venture already.</p>
              <p>why you think the bank will lend YOU the money to buy expensive flats??</p>

              <p>Using other peoples money is all right for investment, it is different from using your future money for your present pleasure. You need loan to buy a 3 room HDB, or a bigger house as long as you can afford the installment.</p>
              <p>There is never THE right way of using money, debt free and see all the opportunities lost, save and save only to see that you can't catch up with the rising property prices, and by the time you save enough money your children had missed the chance to go to universities abroad, .....</p>
              <p>What is your risk profile? do you have a financial plan?</p>
              <p>If you have a high risk profile and smart in investment, you still need luck to make it big. If you are cautious but smart you still progress, abeit slowly, if you are only looking forward to being debt free, you need to be 50 years old and are contented with whatever you already have, which may not be much if you had not invested, using other's money wisely, or you need to win 4D or toto.</p>
              <p>this time, the lady angel is right, " smart people dun use their money ya." We think with our brain, we take risk because we got balls, hahaha....</p>
