              <p>That's one option.  Will have to see what Singapore is like when I retire.  If too expensive, retiring in another country may be the only choice.  Can't expect the government to look after you.  Have to make your dollar stretch.</p>

              <p>I am not cursed to be born Singaporean. I feel that Singapore has taught me alot of valuable lessons about survival. The government has taught me alot about independence (meaning just depending on yourself). The English education I got gave me an advantage over alot of foreigners from Asia. In fact , I feel privileged to be born Singaporean.</p>

              <p>It is this privilege that allowed me to migrate to another country which gave me a better lifestyle. I will not forget Singapore. She will always remain in my heart as the country which taught me the meaning of 'survival of the fittest' , 'think out of the box' and ' get out of your comfort zone'. I studied the 'foreign talent' policy and took it upon myself to be a foreign talent, sadly not in Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>i just wants to hit those tutor only, u think serious ar,..please lah, relax abit lah, but you got to agree that students who get tuition get that psychology edge over others, they are more confident with a tutor, just like a player, he/she is more confident with a coach around ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me alway get B...B stand for Boleh, sometime i get E also..stand for Excellent. When i start working, i realised that academy is secondary to office survival.</p>

              <p>as long as you are happy with what you are, life is good, same to me, i am doing what i love in entertainment business, so life is happy and good too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ultimate happiness in life is not entirely about money, but to do what you like, that is the most important things, many peoples failed to realize it, but anyway, we are born to suffer.</p>
