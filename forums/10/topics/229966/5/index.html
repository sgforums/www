            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans are already venting their frustration on our new residents (eg PRC).. just look at the level of resentment online and in real-life.<br><br>Our one-party govt has yet to realise it's taking the wrong approach by expecting to make a change while refusing to budge from on their ivory thrones.  There must be a .. ahem.. <strong>balance</strong>.. between "benefit" from the citizens' point of view and the govt's point of view.<br><br>It is sowing alot of seeds of hate on the ground by blocking out the voice of the majority in the mainstream media (it's not what they want to hear) and doing what it wants against its own ppl's will.. Asking us if we want to take our "medicine" now or later is not even an option.. it should be <strong>"Do you think this medicine is right for us?"</strong><br><br>Govt and people have to work together to come up with a real solution - one cannot survive without the other.  We do not need "Gods" in our government.  Will our citizens have to resort to riots to have a say in how this country is run?  It would be so sad that we would have to fight for this basic right as citizens of a "first world" country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few weeks ago, Sunday Times reported the results of a survey concerning SÂ’poreansÂ’ perceptions of foreign workers in Singapore. While workers from India, MÂ’sia and Philippines were deemed by SÂ’poreans to be Â‘hardworkingÂ’, Â‘honestÂ’ &amp; Â‘intelligentÂ’, China workers didnÂ’t fare as well. SÂ’poreans thought that workers from China are Â‘hardworkingÂ’ but Â‘rudeÂ’ &amp; Â‘greedyÂ’.<br><br>No point contesting the survey results because from the people IÂ’ve spoken to, SÂ’poreans do indeed detest the uncouth behaviour of the many China nationals working here.

IÂ’m sure my ancestors came to Singapore and they too spat in public, spoke very loudly, jumped queues and shoved their way through crowds. Yet the people of SÂ’pore gave them a chance to make a living here, and many today have come a long way socially from the Â‘peasantsÂ’ that their great/grandparents were.<br><br>So, while SÂ’porean Chinese have snobbish and are making fun of these contemporary China immigrants to SÂ’pore, let us be reminded, and indeed be humbled, by our similar early beginnings.<br><br></div>

Sometimes when i was sitting in front of them, i can see them gesturing and talking very loudly when they are just sitting beside one another. This if close one eye still can accept, some singaporeans do tt anyway.<br><br>But one thing that is totally unacceptable is that they criticise about EVERYTHING!<br><br>They criticise about the food saying that they always eat different food daily back in china. The clothings here are very ordinary and have no taste. The country is very small and is preventing them from nuturing their talent(as if they have). Talk about how bad the attitude that singaporeans kids have and all that. Also claiming that the academic level here are very easy and are simply peanuts.<br><br>And just when they have said all these, i gathered the following:<br>1) In china, there are very little foodcourt or place where all different types of food can be ordered at the same time. Talking about variety, i think we can win them easily with just one hawker centre. They only have an eatery which sells a speciality or all of the same type of cuisine.<br><br>2) I went to china before and dont see any extroadinary clothings or anything different from what singaporeans wear. (except winter wear). All wear jeans and shirts.<br><br>3) Small and cannot nurture their talents. If they have the talent, they would have already flourish in china given its current status and the rate of its expansion.<br><br>4) Ta ma is their most frequently use words when they just arrive, after a few months, those mispronounced hokkien vulgarities became their jia chang bian fan. They accused singaporeans teenagers of being unfilial to their parents when i heard them criticising their parents about something to do with wealth.<br><br>5) Easy and peanuts academic levels. They are among the last position in the whole cohort. Besides, they are usually older than the average singaporean student by 1 to 3 yrs.
