When you have the hunger, the desire and the passion to succeed in a foreign land, you will definitely do whatever it takes to succeed. That's why you see these Chinese people having the correct attitude and service. Singaporeans basically want to be served well, but do not want to treat other people well. That basically is where it has gone all wrong for us.<br><br>Let's be fair to them, and call a spade a spade. Basically, what they have done is want a better future for themselves, and Singapore, because of the fact that we have a Chinese majority and also because of our excellant education system and facilities, decide to come here and make a living, because they believe that if they are hardworking and willing to learn, they can succeed. That was what helped Spore to become a first world country in the first place, isn't it? Much as I dislike the fact that there are too many of them here, I think there's NO wrong in them wanting a better life for themselves, and coming here. But of course, I abhor those that come here and do all sort of stuff that disgraces their country.<br><br>Besides, so many Sporeans migrating to Australia, how can we be so sure that they ain't complaining about us the same way we complain about Chinese people?

We have a Chinese majority and a good economy. They are encouraged to come here by our leaders - university recruiters go to China to actively bring them into Singapore.<br><br>Chinese nationals assume that we should be culturally identical to other Chinese majority societies like Hong Kong and Taiwan. They expect the cultural "purity" of a Chinese society.<br><br>They assumed wrong.<br><br>This is why they have so many criticisms of Singapore. If you have an in-depth conversation with them you will realize just how little respect they have for non-Chinese races and societies, even including the Europeans.<br><br>They have been competing with Singaporeans for jobs since the late 1990s. Until the wages in China rise to parity with us, our current policies guarantee continued competition.<br><br>As Singaporeans we cannot outcompete them in terms of costs, productivity, production capacity... not even our much exaggerated 'communications' advantages. The Chinese nationals are learning English faster and better than we are.<br><br>We only have one advantage.<br><br>Trust.<br><br>Chinese nationals cannot even trust each other. And they never will. If you have a good understanding of Chinese political and cultural history, you will realize just how complex their society is, with so many undertable rules and nuances and layer upon layer of complications.<br><br>As China becomes richer and more powerful, mistrust and misunderstandings are bound to worsen.<br><br>Singapore, an island of clear rules and 'stupid' people, is a comparative safe haven.<br></div>
