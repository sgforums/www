There is NO way we can close our doors to foreigners. If companies and factories cannot get cheap labour here, they would go elsewhere. But these are my gripes:<br><br>1. Why is it that we cannot compete with them on salaries? We are here for the long-term, we have to buy HDB flats, we have to pay for our children's education, we have to save up for our retirement here. ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE. Foreigners can take the low pay and cramped living conditions because many are here for the short-term ONLY.<br><br>3. To elaborate on point 1, not ALL foreigners are cheap and good. Cheap? The professionals demand the same pay. The government is opening up the medical sector to foreign (Indian) doctors, most of whic have been ejected from UK. Does anyone think they will accept long-term lower pay than our own doctors? If they are going to get the same pay anyway, why not train more of our own as Singaporeans prefer to be seen by Singaporean doctors? As for being good, well, in anecdotes I have heard and incidents I have witnessed, our friendly Indian FTs are good in putting up shows, but ask them to "cho kang" and .................<br>. </div></blockquote>I absolutely agree on you on the points above. As I said, these Indian nationals earned more than us (some twice as much), and they siphon taxpayers' money or the company who paid them, to India. Thus I don't see anything good about them as our money is outflowing.<br><br>Also, as my experience is similar to yours, I too find that Indians are good at "YES, I KNOW!!!"

We need to sometimes be able to talk and "brag" about our achievements in a formal setting.  I think generally, we S'poreans are the "doers" and the "writers" and somehow lacking in this area.  Not many of us are able to stand out there and "brag" about something that we do.  When I say "bragging", I mean actually marketing ourselves.<br><br>Perhaps this has got something to do with our education and also our system of having to "show proof" in everything we do.  Sometimes, we may have only half the proof, but we have to bite the bullet and have the guts to go out there to "brag" about it.  Maybe this part, the FTs do better than us.<br><br>I hv personally encountered a PRC who actually speaks quite well and has excellent type (2) skills.
