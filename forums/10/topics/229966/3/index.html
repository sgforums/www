            <div class='col-md body'>Of course ppl from China will compete with you for jobs. I worked in a company that hires more than 85% of foreigners - Mainland Chinese, Philippina, Indonesians, Malaysians, Burmese, Israeli, Pakistani, etc. Singaporeans are actually a <strong>minority</strong> in this company. The boss is always looking for ways to reduce costs and increase profits. Otherwise, why would he hire foreigners in the first place? He has foreigners in almost all positions - accountants, engineers, IT support, purchasing, sales, marketing, etc.<br><br>There was a time when he hired more than the required number of people in my department. I'm an engineer and the only Singaporean in this department. The rest are foreigners. As you know, <strong>if you hire a Singaporean, you could probably hire at least two foreigners (talent or not)</strong>. Not long after a new foreign engineer joined my department, I was told to leave. He was willing to accept a wage lower than me.<br><br>My fellow Singaporeans, the day has arrived for foreigners to take away your rice bowls just like it did in my case. If you do not believe what I said, you could apply for jobs at <strong><span style="color: red;">Esco Micro Pte Ltd</span></strong>, work there and find out for yourself whether you see more foreigners than Singaporeans. The company is founded by a Singaporean.<br><br>I do not know about other companies though. Maybe you would like to list them here so that I will never apply to such companies in the future. Thank you.<br></div>
