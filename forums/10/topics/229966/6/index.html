But the worst is hearing that these are just assumptions.<br><br>Just take up the many Indian consultants I have dealt with.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's be balanced about this. There is NO way we can close our doors to foreigners. If companies and factories cannot get cheap labour here, they would go elsewhere. But these are my gripes:<br><br>1. Why is it that we cannot compete with them on salaries? We are here for the long-term, we have to buy HDB flats, we have to pay for our children's education, we have to save up for our retirement here. ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE. Foreigners can take the low pay and cramped living conditions because many are here for the short-term ONLY.<br><br>2. What about NS. Our boys and men will spend or spent the best 2 years of their lives to help "jagar" the country. The government, rightly, stated that it should be a duty. Fine. But foreign males don't do it. And i am sure many have heard of how our fellow PR colleagues sent their boys overseas instead of serving NS, AFTER they have studied here all the way up to JC level. Great isn't it?<br><br>3. To elaborate on point 1, not ALL foreigners are cheap and good. Cheap? The professionals demand the same pay. The government is opening up the medical sector to foreign (Indian) doctors, most of whic have been ejected from UK. Does anyone think they will accept long-term lower pay than our own doctors? If they are going to get the same pay anyway, why not train more of our own as Singaporeans prefer to be seen by Singaporean doctors? As for being good, well, in anecdotes I have heard and incidents I have witnessed, our friendly Indian FTs are good in putting up shows, but ask them to "cho kang" and .................<br><br>4. For any companies, would the employer prefer to employ a male Singaporean who may have to spend up to 2-3 weeks every year away from the company or a foreign male is better since he is always around?<br><br>By all means, make Singapore competitive by letting in some foreign "talents" in, the principle is correct, but the implementation has to be fine-tuned.</div>

Right now Singapore's legs have literally been spread for the foreigners.  Our National shame!<br><br>But hitting out directly at these foreigners who accepted our country's invitation to come over is a waste of our time.  Neither Locals nor FTs stand to gain from indiscriminate bashing of FTs..the FTs don't, and won't, fully understand our actions.  Plus our govt will simply take the opportunity to announce that Singaporeans aren't mature enough to have a say in our country's affairs.<br><br>Let's keep our quarrel focused on the people responsible for these stupid lax rules.. let them feel the heat.  After we get the influx of FTs under control, we can subject our existing FTs to a system of stringent checks, like a yearly review, in order to prove their worth and stay on.  Eventually, we can filter all the bad ones out and reverse the govt's terrible mistake.<br><br></div>
