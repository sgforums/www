I worked in a company that hires more than 85% of foreigners - Mainland Chinese, Philippina, Indonesians, Malaysians, Burmese, Israeli, Pakistani, etc. Singaporeans are actually a [b]minority</strong> in this company. The boss is always looking for ways to reduce costs and increase profits. Otherwise, why would he hire foreigners in the first place? He has foreigners in almost all positions - accountants, engineers, IT support, purchasing, sales, marketing, etc.<br><br>There was a time when he hired more than the required number of people in my department. I'm an engineer and the only Singaporean in this department. The rest are foreigners. As you know, <strong>if you hire a Singaporean, you could probably hire at least two foreigners (talent or not)</strong>. Not long after a new foreign engineer joined my department, I was told to leave. He was willing to accept a wage lower than me.<br><br>My fellow Singaporeans, the day has arrived for foreigners to take away your rice bowls just like it did in my case. If you do not believe what I said, you could apply for jobs at <strong><span style="color: red;">Esco Micro Pte Ltd</span></strong>, work there and find out for yourself whether you see more foreigners than Singaporeans. The company is founded by a Singaporean.<br><br>I do not know about other companies though. Maybe you would like to list them here so that I will never apply to such companies in the future. Thank you.<br>[/b]</blockquote>U said u r an enginner ? in what field and from which Uni? cauz a bookeeper can claim he is an acct w/o qulification.<br><br>Mind u, there is  a guy self proclaimed as a doc ,lawyer and economist here!!!but his edu level is below A level cause he doesnot know wat is discounts vs  subsidies, bond price vs interest rate, dogs vs human beings etc!!!<br><br>A professional's salary in Spore is  at least10 times more expensive than a counterpart in a third world country!!! that why it is strange that u said one Sporean professional  is more than 2 foreigners from  the third world country???

            <div class='col-md body'>True for some of the earlier post where they condemn about Singapore.<br><br>I have some China schoolmates. Sometimes when i was sitting in front of them, i can see them gesturing and talking very loudly when they are just sitting beside one another. This if close one eye still can accept, some singaporeans do tt anyway.<br><br>But one thing that is totally unacceptable is that they criticise about EVERYTHING!<br><br>They criticise about the food saying that they always eat different food daily back in china. The clothings here are very ordinary and have no taste. The country is very small and is preventing them from nuturing their talent(as if they have). Talk about how bad the attitude that singaporeans kids have and all that. Also claiming that the academic level here are very easy and are simply peanuts.<br><br>And just when they have said all these, i gathered the following:<br>1) In china, there are very little foodcourt or place where all different types of food can be ordered at the same time. Talking about variety, i think we can win them easily with just one hawker centre. They only have an eatery which sells a speciality or all of the same type of cuisine.<br><br>2) I went to china before and dont see any extroadinary clothings or anything different from what singaporeans wear. (except winter wear). All wear jeans and shirts.<br><br>3) Small and cannot nurture their talents. If they have the talent, they would have already flourish in china given its current status and the rate of its expansion.<br><br>4) Ta ma is their most frequently use words when they just arrive, after a few months, those mispronounced hokkien vulgarities became their jia chang bian fan. They accused singaporeans teenagers of being unfilial to their parents when i heard them criticising their parents about something to do with wealth.<br><br>5) Easy and peanuts academic levels. They are among the last position in the whole cohort. Besides, they are usually older than the average singaporean student by 1 to 3 yrs. So what makes them qualified to condemn the education system?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The effects of globalisation hits every nation on earth....British car makers MG-Rovers has been bought over by a Chinese company with loss of many jobs, British cleaners have been replaced with Polish ones, British nurses with Filippino nurses....<br><br>The cheap supply of labour and services keep inflation low and prevent interest rate hikes. The competitiveness of a country now depends on it. Until China's labour costs catch up with those of developed nations, our low  income groups will lose out.<br><br>The solution is education and skill development. There should be a safety net to help those who are unable to compete...but how tight the net should be depends on how much society is prepared to pay in terms of taxes. In addition, as the Scandinavian nations are learning now, a welfare state discourages hard work and nurtures a dependent mentality.</div>
