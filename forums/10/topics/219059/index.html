            <div class='col-md body'>Is this not the Korean bank that DBS was looking to buy ? Luckily they rejected our higher offer else there will be another controversial issue to talk about. Money in the bank, hehe is stll our money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"> SKorean former top banker arrested over deal with US fund  </span></span><br><br>A former top South Korean banker has been arrested for alleged wrongdoing over the sale of his bank to US fund Lone Star three years ago, state prosecutors have said.<br><br>Lee Kang-Won, the former president of Korea Exchange Bank (KEB), was taken to a Seoul detention center overnight, the supreme prosecutor's office said.<br><br>A court late Monday had granted prosecutors an arrest warrant for Lee on suspicion of breach of trust and bribery offences.<br><br>State auditors said in June that KEB's value was intentionally underestimated by its then-executives but they cleared Lone Star of any wrongdoing in its acquisition of the bank.<br><br>Lone Star bought a 51 percent stake in KEB for 1.38 trillion won (1.45 billion dollars) in 2003. It has now signed an agreement with South Korea's top lender Kookmin Bank to sell a majority stake for a potentially huge profit but the sale has been delayed by the investigation.<br><br>The Dallas-based fund has denied any wrongdoing over the sale or subsequently, and said it is the victim of a politically motivated prosecution driven by hostility toward foreign investors.<br><br>The affair is being closely watched by other foreign investors amid concerns that nationalist feelings may undercut their welcome here.<br><br>Lee is also suspected of having received 1.98 billion won in bribes from subcontractors while in office, investigators said.<br><br>The former KEB chief, who has denied any wrongdoing, is the first person to be arrested over the 2003 deal.<br><br>Meanwhile, a court is due later Tuesday to rule on a prosecution application for the arrest of Lone Star vice chairman Ellis Short, Lone Star general counsel Michael Thompson and Yoo Hoe-Won, current head of Lone Star Advisors Korea.<br><br>The court Friday had refused to issue arrest warrants for them, citing lack of evidence of alleged stock manipulation, but prosecutors immediately resubmitted their request.<br><br>Prosecutors claim the US fund, after buying the main bank, acquired KEB's credit card company at a discounted price after spreading false rumors of a capital write-down.<br><br>Lone Star is also under a separate investigation for allegedly evading large sums in taxes and illegally transferring dollars abroad after the 2003 bank acquisition.<br></div>
