              <p>To say he works at 85 for the power?  I think he could make ten trips to beautiful beaches around the world without losing his power a bit.  Most of us would do this also.  He did not.  Mr Lee showed us a very high standard of "sacrificial" spirit for the community.</p>

              <p>At this age, he is still cleverer than you cuz he is thinking how to get $$ from you while you marvel at how he does it..no wonder he got no dementia ya.</p>
              <p>high standard comes with high cost. a man with no consideration to money can come to that standard easily. meanwhile, you just need to emulate the singaporeans that mindlessly try to get by.</p>
              <p>old Lee used to say he will retire when Sg no longer needs him.apparently Sg no longer wants him..why he still ard in the political scene?? why dont he F.O (fall out) like he said??</p>

              <p><br>Anti government conspiracy theorists in this forum are only interested to bring the government down at all cost, even to the extend of spreading lies to corrupt the mind of others. What they didnt realise is that to be a good leader, should concerntrate on things ahead of your, and not what is behind you.  </p>
