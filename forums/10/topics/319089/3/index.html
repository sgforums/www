              <p>Is it true LKY has set a very high standard?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What did he do during the last two deep recessions. We did not see any success in restructuring the economy to value-adding technology-driven economy talked about for 20 over years by all his million-dollar ministers.</p>
              <p>All major projects aimed at restructuring the economy so far still have not taken off or achieved major breakthrough from micro-electronic to wafer fab to precision engineering or biomedical which was even criticised by her own daughter for lack of vision, practicality or breakthrough like a shotgun approach.</p>
              <p>All the million-dollar still have not implemented the value-adding technology-driven knowledge-based economic restructuring. There was very little mention of the failed economic restructuring other than occasional lip service.</p>
              <p>Such lack of talents in economic restructuring has been the main factor for our last two deep recessions. Go and read the old newspaper cuttings on
              ministers constantly putting the blame on people for failures in restructuring their skill instead of ministers for lack of ability in master-planning and executing as previously Dr. Goh Keng Swee would have done. Perhaps after Dr. Goh Keng Swee has left there was no heavy weight
              minister including LKY himself who are equally able and capable to create whole new technology start-ups or
              new industries to create value-adding jobs for our new graduates or citizens. Up to now LHL who was supposed to oversee the entire economic restructuring exercise during the last two recessions have yet to produce the desired final results.</p>
              <p>LKY probably is only relying on property and location play to get by with the help of world recovery to say he was successful without any real solid success to sustain the frail economy.<br> <br> However at the first sign of world recovery of which Singapore was
              among the last of the Asian dragons to recover from about 2004 once the property began to move due to economic cycle the
              ministers and MM Lee quickly claimed for credit talking about
              leadership and many theories like all foreigners will create jobs for citizens when actually the real intention was to suppress
              wages of citizens to be competitive. It looks like other than cutting CPF and citizens' wages and open the door to cheap foreign labor on the excuse of talent there is no other solutions to restructuring.<br> <br> Intrinsically our own domestic sector of the economy is still very
              frail and weak thriving mainly on some retailing and services and we
              have not created in-depth strategic manufacturing facilities as smaller
              countries like Finland or Switzerland have done.<br> <br> During any recessions these foreign companies would be more attracted
              to lower-cost countries as seen during past recessions leaving us very
              much in a lurch.<br> <br> Through years of one-tracked cutting of citizens' wages and promoting foreign investments at the expense of own SMEs and domestic sector and strategic skill training
              and technology-start-ups, the whole economy has been downgraded to third world falling behind Korea, Taiwan and even Hong Kong in terms of creating major world-beating computer, or manufacturing world-needed products or services.</p>
              <p>The ministers are only keen in throwing monies at foreign investors but not create more incentives for our own domestic businesses which have to struggle against all kinds of taxes and rising business costs in utility and transportation etc.</p>
              <p>Surely if our ministers have the talents they would not have neglected promoting our own local businesses first before promoting the foreigners. There has been a total lack of understanding of the need to promote hands-on practical knowledge applications and incentivise manufacturing of our own technology and
              knowledge-based products.<br> <br> A first-world country is one which should excel in terms of practical
              knowledge applications, innovation and abilities to produce
              world-needed products by being able to motivate our own citizens and just keep throwing money incentives at foreign companies or engaging in property play IR or being at the mercy of world economy.</p>
              <p>This kind of wage-cutting pro-foreigner government could only be good in putting up showy
              look-good projects like various world-class hubbing or biotech or biomedcal which have yet to make any
              major breakthrough.</p>
              <p>In any world slow down or recession we will again see the true color of this type of look-good pretentious talent-talk boasting. It will be another repeat of the last two recessions with no particular areas of excellence. People will once again lose their jobs by thousands and foreigners will again be leaving us to go elsewhere to cream another golden pots and take us for fools.</p>
              <p>So judge for yourself : Is LKY that world-best as he has claimed?</p>
