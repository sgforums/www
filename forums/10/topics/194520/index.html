Something like each lawyer firm that handles client monies must pay no. of lawyer X $1million each to the gov for safe keeping of conduct?<br><br>The last thing we ever want to happen to us is lawyer cheating us... </blockquote>I don't think this is the best solution. If the top beam is not straight the framework will be slanted or crooked too. Men will obey laws willingly if there is a supportive ingrained cultural element in the community's laws and customs to make men live honestly. All the laws and enforcements may come to naught one day if there is no such maturity.<br><br>We have built everything legalistically for too long and it does not look like we have become a better society. We have internal social turmoil where people do not bother with morality and ethics. Lawyers have been fined and gone to jail before for cheating on clients and so many law firms have closed down due to government megalomania with bigness of everything.<br><br>By increasing more laws and enforcements of deposits more law firms will have to close to make the existing law firms more monopolisitc and charge higher fees. Professional fidelity insurance and similar policies might be better than deposit. But the better solution especially after what has happened in the recent buying of votes and electioneering use of public fund for upgrading to win votes the real solution will be starting at the top or at the fundamentals.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Citizens indeed may need lawyers' services to do many things e.g.<br><br>(1)  Fighting for our justice when we are deprived, wrongly accused or exploited unfairly by powerful monopolies or evil forces.<br>(2)  Establish rule of laws, by upholding the constitutions to better assure the citizens to take part in contributing to nation building and and their individual freedoms and rights to elect their best representatives to govern the country, etc etc.<br>(3)  Establish greater accountability and transparency in all aspects of governance of the country and trade and commerce to protect citizens of unfairness, iniquities, evil and wrong doings etc.<br><br>Today, look around our society for (1) to (4). Do our lawyers and law makers help us to achieve our objectives in nation building or are we getting worse.<br><br>Let us look at some recent occurrences to see whether they may be positive or negative to the evolvement of our society and nation building.<br><br>Is our society being over-dominated by lawyers or lawyers' involvements in government. For example, let us examine the following trends or occurrences:-<br><br>(1)  More lawyers are monopolising commerce and industries e.g. conveyancing of real estates are being successfully done by more open and cheaper alternative system as practised in US and UK or Japan e.g. realtors can register conveyancing by relatively hassle-free processes without being compelled to pay 2-4% scale fees being protected by our pro-lawyer system for years.<br><br>(2)  Gerrymandering and passing of more control laws relating to commerce and economy affecting entrepreneurship and free market system and running down our economic competitiveness. Is this not the result of lawyer's legalistic shallow or short-sighted control thinking.<br><br>(3)  Gerrymandering and passing of more controls and regulations affecting basic rights and freedoms of citizens stated in the constitution thereby underming their freedom to choose and elect their best representatives to parliaments in the freest manner under one-man-one-vote system.<br><br>(4)  More lawyer MPs are being brought in in every election by the ruling party as if only the lawyers know how to represent the people's rights and interests.<br><br>(5)  Lawyers are being engaged to run top jobs in government and NGOs like the NKF resulting in legalistically managing organization to suit narraw legalistic control purposes which are counter to larger needs and aspirations of the public or citizens.<br><br>(6)  Lawyers engaged in large nos. in public sector to provide greater justice, equity and accountability by the government. But despite investing so much on lawyers are citizens getting better lives and more social and economic progressions. Are we becoming a better society with lesser defamation litigations to suit narrow ends of people in power. Are we having more conscientious leaders who could prevent us from falling into dangers of narrow controls or abolition of trial of facts by internationally acceptable and equitable Jury system thereby giving full power to politicians to enforce their narrow agendas on the whole nation.<br><br>(7)  Lawyers are supposed to represent us for justice and settle inquitable commerce or contractual rights but are seen to be frequently involved in running away with clients' monies with hardly any protection measures in place as found in other countries.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Lawyers in public sector seem to be running us more and more in a legalistic system whereby for as long as laws can be passed by fellow MPs in parliaments, the government can do anything it likes e.g. ministers can by legalistic system of government decide they want more salaries can get the highest salaries and any amounts of bonuses they like without batting an eyelid or worrying about citizens' plights and suffering. (20% of population are living below poverty line)<br><br>If more lawyers running the country means more restrictions and less freedoms and choices and more legalistic manoerving to serve control purposes, why do we want to have more lawyer MPs or lawyer CEOs in high places so at the end we will be less well off.</div>
