            <div class='col-md body'>shall we rename Straits Times as Propaganda Times? all i see is articles on the PAP on its local news section. today it even had an article from the PAP in house propaganda magazine written by jayakumar. other days its constantly harping about the good things that the 'loosers' in the PAP wards are doing in Hougang and Potong Pasir to win back the constituency.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> i dont even know why i pay 80c for such a crapy paper. thank god there is the internet lor or else i also sure kena brain wash  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That name is too blunt and direct. Think of something not so direct otherwise it is not of reality. But i cannot agree more with what you said. Compared to press-freedom in the world, Singapore has alot to learn. Singapore's position of press-freedom is ranked 140/160 in the world! That suggests something. . .<br><br>And on top of that, there were no anti-government topics especially speeches given by dissidents, if Singapore is a truly democratic country then there should be right (like the USA)...<br><br>Interesting why people just accept things on face value and never question why they do not see the other side of the picture.</div>
