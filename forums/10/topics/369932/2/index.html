              <p>The U.S army also says that Lee Kuan Yew is peranakan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A significant category of Chinese, although one not listed in the census reports, were the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Baba Chinese or Straits Chinese </strong></span></span>. They were Chinese who after long residence in Southeast Asia spoke Malay or English as their first language, and whose culture contained elements from China, Southeast Asia, and sometimes Europe as well.</p>
              <p>An indication of the size of the Baba Chinese community was provided by the 1980 census report that 9 percent of Chinese families spoke English at home.</p>
              <p>Stereotypically the Baba were the offspring of Chinese migrants and local women. In the nineteenth century, they tended to be wealthier and better educated than the mass of immigrants and to identify more with Singapore and Southeast Asia than with China.</p>
              <p>In spite of their language, the Baba considered themselves Chinese, retained Chinese kinship patterns and religion, and even when speaking Malay used a distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many loan words from Hokkien.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Never a large proportion of Singapore's Chinese population, in the late nineteenth century they took advantage of opportunities for education in English and promoted themselves as loyal to Britain. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>In Singapore, many Baba families spoke English as a first language and produced many of the leaders of Singapore's independent political movements,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> including Lee Kuan Yew. </strong></span></span></p>

              <p>He has something to hide.</p>

              <p>Politics has nothing to do with your many flippant and irrelevant commentaries that have little relation to the threads, and which you insist on ritualistically polluting across all the threads every morning after you finish work at your father's Bar; and every afternoon before you start work again for the night.</p>
