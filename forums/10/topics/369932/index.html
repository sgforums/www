              <p>Sunday, 26 July 2009</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br><img style="margin: 1px 5px 1px 1px; float: left;" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/posters_and_logos/censorship-button.jpg" alt="" width="140">The title to this report <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/444695/1/.html">"Political parties go online to extend their reach"</a> by Valarie Tan of Channel News Asia seems straightforward enough --
                      Singapore's political parties, both ruling and opposition, are fully
                      utilising the Internet to achieve their ends.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But wait, there's
                      no mention of the Singapore Democrats anywhere!</strong></span></span> It reports on only two
                      parties - the PAP and WP. This is particularly strange when the SDP's
                      website, updated daily, is by far the most read website of all
                      political parties in Singapore.</p>
              <p><br>CNA also writes that "Social networking websites like Facebook and
                      Twitter are the latest ways Singapore political parties are reaching
                      out to people online."<br><br>This website employs all manner of online
                      instruments to reach out to Singaporeans. We have produced the most
                      number of YouTube presentations, we were the first to get on Twitter
                      with the most number of followers, and our supporters have even
                      established a Friends of SDP Facebook page.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And yet in CNA's report, only silence about the Singapore Democrats.</strong></span></span><br><br>The
                      report also talks about the youth wings of both the PAP and WP. Yet,
                      the SDP is the first opposition party to establish a youth wing. The
                      Young Democrats was formed in 2000 and has since grown robustly. Again,
                      absolutely no mention of this in CNA's report.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is obvious
                      that the media want Singaporeans to know as little as possible about
                      the Singapore Democrats. If and when they do report on us, they will
                      put on the worst possible spin. This is what the SDP is up against.<br></strong></span></span><br>This
                      trend will intensify as elections draw closer. The question that must
                      be asked is: Why is the media so intent on hushing up news about,
                      particularly, the Singapore Democrats?<br><br>In another instance, Alicia Wong of <em>Today</em> reported yesterday about the installation of CCTVs at Hong Lim Park (see <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC090725-0000099/CCTV-installed-at-Speakers-Corner">here</a>), obviously reading and then following up on the SDP's report two days before (see <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/2584-police-put-up-camera-at-speakers-corner">here</a>).<br><br>Yet the newspaper refuses to acknowledge that the story was first reported on this website.<br><br>Are
                      we complaining? No. We take this as the PAP badly wanting to get rid of
                      us and a signal that we must work even harder to deny them the
                      pleasure. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is important that Singaporeans know the truth.
                      The Singapore Democrats are not only alive and well, but leading the
                      way on the Internet. We cannot let the media cover up this fact.</strong></span></span> <br><br>We
                      ask our supporters and followers to step up efforts to help us overcome
                      this hurdle by spreading the SDP's news as far and as wide as possible
                      through your emails, Facebook pages, blogs and so on.<br><br>Don't let the PAP use the New Media to fool the people too.</p>

              <p>Having been previously chastised for the baseless call that CSJ is an <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"attention seeking whore"</span></em> - the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>now prefer to be more careful in the efforts to deride CSJ by resorting to vague and unspecific charges.</p>
              <p>Is there any basis for accusing CSJ for some supposedly vague and insidious <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"actions towards a certain mentor of his"</span></em> ?</p>
              <p>What were these unspecified actions that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>prefer to be vague and keep matters foggy and allow one's mind to play out the intended plot in the drama ?</p>
              <p>Did the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"mentor"</em></span> assume the title of being one, or did the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> assigned one for CSJ to suit the intended drama ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Mentor"</span></em> ?</p>
              <p>It seems that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> is inclined towards a term favored by those who needs mentoring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the whole Singapore opposition movement be destroyed by one CSJ ?</p>
              <p>If this is not sheer drama, what else can the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> of Speaker's Corner have in mind for our entertainment ?</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> is clearly helping the PAP to prevent CSJ from becoming a potent threat, and at the same time to deride the entire 'opposition movement' as being useless.</p>
              <p>Has CSJ - single-handedly destroyed the political fortunes of the WP and SDA, or even sabotaged the efforts by JBJ's son - Kenneth Jeyaratnam to continue the struggle with the Reform Party ?</p>
              <p>It is clear that the "opposition movement" remains alive, and even more so now with a youthful Kenneth Jeyaratnam's Triple Star qualification from Cambridge in Economics that will surely bolster the ranks of the "opposition movement", and make him a more relevant player than even PM LHL's 'triple star' qualification from Cambridge in Mathematics. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One can only wonder if the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> of this Speaker's Corner has not a personal axe to grind against CSJ - perhaps CSJ had thrown him out for being a fraud in CSJ's class at the NUS.</p>

              <p>Chiam was as much a dramatic player as the resident Drama Queen in the Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p>He had tendered his resignation the first time, when he could not get the SDP Central Executive Committee to support his demand to censure CSJ for the hunger strike.</p>
              <p>Even as Chiam tendered his resignation, the SDP Central Executive Committee and CSJ had persuaded Chiam to withdraw the resignation and continue to be the SDP Secretary-General.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The second time that Chiam offered his resignation - did Chiam See Tong resigned on his own accord, or was he left without any choice but to do so AFTER Chiam was expelled by SDP's Central Executive Committee - (which CSJ did not participate) - by common consensus when Chiam had conducted a Press Interview attacking the SDP leadership for supporting CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Why did Chiam resort to the Judiciary to reinstate his position in the SDP after the CEC had expelled him ?</p>
              <p>Why should the Judiciary interfere in a legitimately conducted CEC procedural matters that had followed the SDP Constitution, and which even the Registrar of Society had not objected ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Following the election in 1993, Dr Chee was sacked by the National University of Singapore where he was a Lecturer. Dr Chee went on a hunger strike as a mark of protest. He was subsequently sued by his department head, Dr S Vasoo, faculty dean, Dr Ernest Chew, and secretary, Ms Janice Chen, when he disputed his sacking.<br><br>Mr Chiam first supported Dr Chee's action but later changed his mind and called for the Party to censure his the assistant secretary-general (Dr Chee was elected to the post in February 1993). None of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) members supported Mr Chiam's motion whereupon the Party leader tended his resignation, citing that he had lost the confidence of his colleagues.<br><br>A few of the CEC members, including Dr Chee, tried to persuade Mr Chiam to remain as secretary-general. However, Mr Chiam stated that he would do so only if he could be granted the power to appoint and dismiss the Party's cadre members. He also wanted the removal of Mr Wong Hong Toy as vice-chairman.<br><br>Under the Party's constitution a simple majority of the CEC was needed to appoint cadre members, not any one individual leader. The CEC did not have the constitutional power to accede to Mr Chiam's demands. A few weeks later, Mr Chiam gave a speech at the Singapore Press Club attacking the Party's leadership. It was only then that the CEC voted to expel him.<br><br>The Press Club had extended a similar invitation to Dr Chee to counter Mr Chiam. Knowing that the PAP-controlled media had every intention to fan the flames Dr Chee declined the invitation. But when he subsequently informed the organizers that he would speak but on the Party's alternative policy ideas instead of the altercation with Mr Chiam, the Press Club withdrew the invitation.<br><br>Mr Chiam sued the CEC for wrongful dismissal and won. He remained with the Party until the 1997 general elections when he resigned to form another party.<br><br>In 1994, the SDP published <em>Dare To Change: An Alternative Vision for Singapore</em> and adopted the book, written by Dr Chee as its manifesto. The following year, Dr Chee was elected Secretary-General.<br><br>The Party also amended its constitution to update its objectives and changed the name of its newspaper to <em>The New Democrat</em>.</span></p>

              <p>Chiam was as much a dramatic player as the resident Drama Queen in the Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p>He had tendered his resignation the first time, when he could not get the SDP Central Executive Committee to support his demand to censure CSJ for the hunger strike.</p>
              <p>Even as Chiam tendered his resignation, the SDP Central Executive Committee and CSJ had persuaded Chiam to withdraw the resignation and continue to be the SDP Secretary-General.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The second time that Chiam offered his resignation - did Chiam See Tong resigned on his own accord, or was he left without any choice but to do so AFTER Chiam was expelled by SDP's Central Executive Committee - (which CSJ did not participate) - by common consensus when Chiam had conducted a Press Interview attacking the SDP leadership for supporting CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Why did Chiam resort to the Judiciary to reinstate his position in the SDP after the CEC had expelled him ?</p>
              <p>Why should the Judiciary interfere in a legitimately conducted CEC procedural matters that had followed the SDP Constitution, and which even the Registrar of Society had not objected ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should we be surprised that Chiam had attempted to implement the undemocratic model adopted by the PAP in the POWER of ONE to appoint and dismiss anyone into the Central Executive Committee ?</p>
