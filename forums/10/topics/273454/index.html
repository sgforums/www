            <div class='col-md body'>Shocking! Taken from Melvin Tan's blog http://melvintansg.blogspot.com/:<br><br>09 August 2007<br>Care versus cost - lopsided?<br>Yesterday, a day before the National Day holiday, I had some drinks with a couple of friends.<br><br>One of them, presently sourcing for a nursing home to place his semi-mobile father in, learnt that the costs of doing so could run up to more than $2,000 per month and lamented the high fees charged by such homes.<br><br>Only in the event where a family has an average income of $1,000 and below per member, the government will subsidise 80% of the costs.<br><br>To me, it odd to expect a family with an average income of, say, $1,100 per member, to fork out expenses of about $2,000 per month if they had to opt for the assistance of a nursing home.<br><br>Having to deal with expenses that outstrip their earnings is an impossible feat for any family even if they could do the impossible of not spending a single cent of their income.<br><br>In my view, the income ceiling to qualify for this subsidy should be at least $3,000 or more instead of $1,000.<br><br>My friend and his other siblings had no problem with the costs but he wondered about the plight of less well-off families who, if under inevitable circumstances like his own, have to put a family member in a nursing home as last resort.<br><br>For their case, it is not their desire to leave their father in a home but they do not have much of a choice as their mother is also semi-mobile and they were worried their maid will be unable to handle both.<br><br>How will poorer families under the same situation, except being unable to afford a maid or hospice costs, cope?<br><br>Another topic discussed was means testing, a policy idea introduced by the PAP (with several u-turns on the implementation deadline) that the Workers' Party was concerned with and became one of the mentioned topics during the General Election in 2006.<br><br>We wondered why government hospitals had to institute means testing when they can maintain C Class wards while reducing or abolishing A and B Class wards, leaving it to the private hospitals to run the latter classes of wards?<br><br>The two reasons we could think of is, firstly, to give the world the perception that Singaporeans are generally well-off for the government to have high-class hospitals and secondly, the usual engrossment with surplus at the people's expense.<br><br>Today, on Singapore's 42nd birthday, let us reflect on the society the country will have in the near and distant future.<br><br>A new video by activist-filmmaker Martyn See lends a lesser-seen insight.</div>
