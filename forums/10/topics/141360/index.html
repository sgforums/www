            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that many of us are brought up with the idea that loving Singapore means being proud of her achievements and showing loyalty to her. But is that all? I do not think so. Loving Singapore also means criticising our country's problems especially the faults of the government. During National Day, we participated the national day parade, wave flags but we are not exactly bothered about our politics or rather we speak and do nothing. Our opposition is in disarray and all we do nothing about it! is this a sign of patriotism?</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>To my mind, loving Singapore is not the same as acts of celebrations of national day or loving the politicians the ruling party, or leaders.<br><br>Blind love or puppy love accepting what the leaders are doing or sayings without questions may be just the opposite as such ac ts might lead to disastrous consequences and decline of the country.<br><br>Truly loving Singapore calls for adding values to the collective wellbeing, economic competitiveness and defence of the country in the event of aggressions from the outsiders.<br><br>To act values to the collective wellbeing of the people as a whole, the highest act of love will be in my view:-<br><br>(1) To participate in governing and running of the country.<br><br>(2) To play the role of active citizens offering views and opinions and checking on government where their acts go wrong or not in accord with the rule of laws or expectation of the citizens.<br><br>(3) To defend the country against any aggressions or attacks on the country.<br><br>The lowest and ambivalent form of loving the country is to listen to and blindly follow the ruling party's unacountable acts or conducts so as to benefit oneself as grassroots or beneficiaries which are not in accord with the collective wellbeing of the people.<br><br>Even though our opposition parties might not attain the right qualities to be elected into parliaments, they belong to the highest form of loving of the country. With them questioning the acts of governments whether through taking part in election they are doing something desirable to the collective wellbeing of the country. Let there be gradual growing of political maturity especially among the ruling party elites so that they will not equate loving of the country as loving of the party thereby perpetuating potential wrong-doings committed against the people.</div>

Then you find your money worthwhile on the colourful posters with the MP's photo hanging on the street lamps.<br><br>2. To feedback on uncessary waste to the Cut Waste commitee to find your feedback wasted.<br><br>3. To work as a cleaner even though u have a degree just to support our government that we should not being chooooosey when finding jobs.<br><br>4. To be concern in politics by joining PAP but they tell you that you are not "scholarly" enough.<br><br>5. To be concern in politics by joining opposition and find yourself being sued.<br><br>6. To dial 999 when you see suspicious objects in MRT and they warn you of making false report.<br><br>7. To train fit, Garung Commando to protect our country only to find that Garung Commando need only splashing of water on them.<br><br>Above all,  the greatest love for Singapore is to struggle to earn enough for a living, and take a break on National Day to enjoy the fireworks and then struggle again the next day.</div>
