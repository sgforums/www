            <div class='col-md body'>Yep when Ex-PM wife make comment of peanuts - all singaporean does was to talk about it and post it on internet.<br><br>We should take a lesson from US - as to what is call taking action with some fun too without breaking the law and still get the point across.<br><br>You see when CBS cancel the series "Jericho" - the fans when nuts. They not only talk about it but what we can learn from them is they take actions, but within lawful means .... and creative too.<br><br>(CBS) NEW YORK You might say fans of the recently canceled CBS drama "Jericho" have gone nuts.<br><br>With the help of distributor NutsOnline.com, supporters of the show have ordered thousands of pounds of peanuts and other nuts, and have had them shipped to the network's headquarters on 52nd Street in Manhattan to protest the cancellation.<br><br>The idea stemmed from the final episode of the show in which Jake Green, a character played by actor Skeet Ulrich, was asked to surrender. He responded by saying, "Nuts!"<br><br>The line was an homage to the famous reply from Gen. Anthony McAuliffe, U.S. commander at the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, when his German counterpart demanded that he surrender his besieged American troops in the cold Belgian forest.<br><br>"Jericho" fans are pooling their money online to order the nuts, which are mostly peanuts, but have also included walnuts, almonds and sunflower seeds. The grassroots campaign had ordered for 10,818 pounds of nuts to be shipped as of 6 p.m. Wednesday, according to NutsOnline.com.<br><br>On Wednesday morning, 4,042 pounds arrived at Black Rock.<br><br>CBS spokesman Chris Ender estimated Wednesday that about 300 boxes of nuts ranging in size from three pounds to 10 pounds had arrived.<br><br>"We've made arrangements for the bulk of the boxes to be picked up by Staten Island Project Home Front, an organization that focuses on fundraising and supporting military serving in Iraq and Afghanistan," Ender told wcbstv.com. "We've also made contact with the Bronx Zoo to see if they'd like some of these, as well as local homeless shelters and food banks."<br><br>CEO Jeffrey Braverman was stunned when he saw the orders suddenly pouring in.<br><br>"It caught us a little by surprise when we had the first few orders come in," he told wcbstv.com. "I thought, 'What the heck is this?' I thought it might be fraudulent, but I looked around and saw this battle cry of nuts."<br><br>"We jammed away, put up a Web page and then things went nuts, no pun intended," chuckled Braverman. "And the crazy thing is there are hundreds if not thousands of people clicking on this thing and I've received hundreds and hundreds of e-mails and over 1,000 orders from all over the world. It's insane!"<br><br>To monitor the shipments, NutsOnline created a special Web page designated for the campaign, which includes a log of the shipments being sent to CBS as well as their arrival, and pictures of the NutsOnline workers posing with the massive shipments.<br><br>Jericho fans were inspired by the 2002 campaign to save the WB series "Roswell." Disgruntled fans of that program sent 6,000 bottles of Tabasco sauce to network executives because it was the favorite condiment of aliens on the show. The show did eventually return, but on a different network.<br><br>Will the same happen for Jericho? Nina Tassler, President of CBS Entertainment, released a statement to Jericho fans that seems to hint that there could be a future for Jericho, albeit a short one.<br><br>"Thank you for supporting Jericho with such passion," her statement read. "We truly appreciate the commitment you made to the series and we are humbled by your disappointment. In the coming weeks, we hope to develop a way to provide closure to the compelling drama that was the Jericho story."<br><br>What the network is planning for that "closure" is not known.<br><br>In the meantime, Braverman is pleased with the publicity that the campaign has brought to his company. Although he admits he's never watched the show, he says the intrigue created by the die-hard fans would certainly bring him to start if it were brought back.<br><br>"Something is going to happen. Are they gonna bring back Jericho? I don't know, I certainly hope so because now I'm extremely interested in watching this, and I think this campaign will bring others to start watching it too," he said. "I'm enjoying the excitement of this, these fans are passionate and they're not going to stop anytime soon. These are people who you think are crazy, but they're real people. They're mothers and fathers and grandmothers and students. It's just phenomenal how this happens."<br><br>The initial batch of nuts, totaling just 89 pounds, was sent on May 17. Another 24 pounds was shipped the following day, and on Monday the first pooled order of 1,393 pounds was sent out.<br><br>"Yesterday we shipped out 4,042 pounds which is a sick amount of nuts, more than you can imagine," Braverman said Wednesday. "That's 160 25-pound cases."<br><br>Maybe next time we should be ordering some peanuts to send to Ms Goh.</div>
