IMO one should only be paid to a level that is in proportion to his or her productivity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps you have a point...but how can the government compensate for the 2 years they have taken away from the men who dedicated their lives to the country? it is not a voluntary service that they chose....giving recognition is not enough....if women wants equality in pay...perhaps they should have a taste of what men do in the army....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, guess the 1/3 extra could be probably our NS allowance. If you read thru all the advertisement, you'll realised that those finished NS will be paid more and 6 mth later another increment! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
