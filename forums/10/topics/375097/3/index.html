              <p>No amout of bitching can get me out of this situation. All I can do is pack up and leave. But this bloody packing process is unbearable. It means to save enough to ensure I can last long in another land. Soon.... i hope soon enough I can still have family and kids. But I doubt so. But late also nevermind. Old and lonely in another land is much better than old and lonely and desperate and poor and being a liability and worrying and stressed and people fucking my enforced savings up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you may not know. I observed a trend amongst my friends. The rich, some having made hundreds of thousands by property doesn't realise the pain living in this country. I know some of them. They are actually very pro PAP. Some are fearful of change and cont voting for the current ... I admit I am not rich and having a painful time. I broke up a relationship because I calculated there's no way a can fund a proper family. To provide for education and stuffs like that. My friends don't have that worry. They downgrade their 800K house in the event income stop coming they got enough to bear the cost of a school attending kid. Like what TV tells me, I have to shove myself with peanuts and try to be happy with it for a while... </p>

              <p><br>I feel your pain, and am saddened by your plight.I wish I could be an immortal being with power and grant you your every wish.</p>
              <p>However we must face reality, and truth can be painful. More so when you had been bombarded by hollywood fairy tales, channel 8 happy endings every night, and feel like a loser for not achieving what others who gets to live up to their fantasies, being rich, have lovely wives, kids, beautiful homes, etc.</p>
              <p>But you are not a loser, never is and never will be one till you tell yourself you are one and behave like one. No one can look down you, except yourself.</p>
              <p>You are one us, Singaporeans. Who provided govt hospitals, with medical care for you when you were born? Who provided you with subsidized education and training facillities when you were were a child? Who provided security for you so that you can sleep peacefully at night without a worry? You want me to go on and list it all down?</p>
              <p>It was us.Your fellow citizens. You and your parents could neve have afforded it on your own. We do it because we know that fact, and it is thru our contributions and efforts that had given you the opportunity to grow.</p>
              <p>Why are you forsaking us now?</p>
              <p>Please do not worry about failure to start a family here. It is your lack of confidence that is hindering it. You are as capable as any of us, and none of us had it easy in life. We had to work hard to get where we are today. The trappings of wealth you see on us is not by magic, but only thru sheer hardwork.</p>
              <p>We are not machines, but of blood and flesh. Same as you. You too, can be like us, but you must first have confidence in yourself that you can do it.</p>
              <p>It doesnt matter if you are a clerk, only $1,200 a mth. In time, your salary will rise, and will be promoted. Most important of all is to be responsible in your work, and employers value responsible persons more than anyone else.</p>
              <p>But if your mentality is to get a 9 to 5 job 5 day week, to hell with the bosses, then you will either be stagnant or replaced in time.</p>
              <p>Widen your social circle, so that you may hear of other opportunities for you to excel in, or use our ready funds to upgrade yourself further. We will not leave you behind, for you are one of us.</p>
              <p>As you rise, so too will your income be, to provide for a family. It will be love that holds you and your wife together, both your characters complementing and supporting each other, and not the dollars. Divorce stats had proven that fact - money alone is no sure guarantee of a life long partnership.</p>
              <p>When you have children, our society will not abandon you, so long as you are responsible. If they show academic promise, they will be supported by us all. But if they dont, it doesnt really matter, for our society cannot have all of our young as scholars. We will all be bored to tears. We would be thankful and support them in sports achievements, talent, technical or any other endeavor that can help enhance our society to the next level.</p>
              <p>We Singaporeans are not rich. But combined with our intangible and dollar contributions, we can make wonders, inspire an entire world, help others in our society and leave no one behind.</p>
              <p>We need you. To help others like you. It is you and I and others that make up our country, to righfully inherit our birthright, not by expecting life on a silver platter, but by making it better for ourselves and the next generation as the previous generations had made it for us, towards a better life and a meaningful sojourn on Earth for all.</p>
              <p> </p>

              Of course, it is only a matter of time. Nothing is forever.
