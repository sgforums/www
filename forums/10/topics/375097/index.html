              <p>It may.......perharps all that is needed is a percentage point. But Particularly the PRC there is no voting history because they don't Vote in China.....so they might stick to the govt. (the new citizens i mean)</p>
              <p>So that is why i think there are alot of reverse govt policies because we are too western.</p>

              <p>We are not brave enough to vote them out yet,we're too pampered with life here.we're weak and meek.The PAP has moulded us into this pathetic condition that we do not have the guts to stand up and tell them we've had enough of their bullshit.They know it and they are adding more salt into our lives by importing more foreigners to keep us fighting to keep our ricebowls so that we have no time for serious political participations to challenge them.</p>
              <p>The very wealthy ones definitely want the PAP to rule to keep their wealth safe and these are ones that help the ruling party sustain their grip on power.</p>
              <p>The electorates here actually are very undecisive and gutless- if I may use this term.Many of us write to forums some very strong and gutsy things to show our dissapprovals of the way things are done by the gov and how not to vote for PAP again in the coming elections,all these will eventually melts when the actual time comes to vote and the results in past elections showed.The best and the nearest the oppositions came into being was a hardfought election.</p>
              <p>We are still not strong in our beliefs to having to stand up to our rights to be treated fairly.We are afraid of being labelled as troublemakers by the laws and then charged and thrown into prisons, our lives affected,our families suffer,etc..therefore these are things that block our claims to our social rights as a citizen to our nation.They(pap) very well aware of this and it's planned this way(our way of life).</p>
              <p>The only thing I anticipate is-if there more pple join the oppositions parties- more pple,do not mean any "tom,dick or harry",pls, we must show seriousness and integrity when we're dealing matters concerning the pple and the Nation. Brave,righteous,honest,want-to-win proffessionals and non-proffessionals must come together,form a party or join existing oppostions partes of their choice to change the political environment here to a more bearable one for the pple to live in.Until then we can say we're on the right path to true democracy,bearable and a better and freeier SG(of cos w/o PAP).</p>
