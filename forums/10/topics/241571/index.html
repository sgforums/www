            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Most varsity cheats are Chinese  </strong><br>Statement by NZ university causes uproar<br>March 10, 2007<br><br>MOST of the cheats at one New Zealand university are from China.<br><br>That's what Lincoln University is claiming. And it has sparked outrage in Christchurch.<br><br>A local newspaper reported last week that a majority of cheating cases at Lincoln University, a rural campus about half an hour's drive from the town that focuses on agricultural studies, involved students from mainland China.<br><br>Almost half the college's 4,000 students are drawn from overseas, 60 per cent of them from China.<br><br>Several students contacted the newspaper after the report appeared to rebut the claims.<br><br>Many studied hard for their qualifications, they told The Press newspaper.<br><br>One said: 'I can only say some Chinese may cheat in the exam but I never cheat during any of my exams, and assignments.'<br><br>Student Rockie Hsu said: 'I was a student at Lincoln and I saw some Kiwi students cheating... My point is most cheaters are Chinese because the supervisors are not catching the Kiwi cheaters at all.'<br><br>Others agreed that students from all groups cheated.<br><br>Student Jaemi Tan: 'Yes, I do believe there are some Chinese students who cheat in the exams, but Kiwi students cheat in the exams as well. You can't deny that.<br><br>'I think it is a little bit unfair to single out Chinese students about cheating at the university. From my own time at a different university I'm aware cheaters come from all groups.'<br><br>UNFAIR ASSUMPTION?<br><br>Another student, Hai Yan Jiang, said it was unfair to make assumptions about a whole race based on just a few people.<br><br>'It is unfair to judge a nation according to several individuals. Can I make conclusion that all the Kiwi are stupid, drunk people because I saw lots of them drunk in the late night standing in the street and making mess?'<br><br>Since The Press published the story on Wednesday several people have also contacted the newspaper to back up the claims made by students and staff at Lincoln University. They believe cheating by Chinese students is widespread, not only at Lincoln but also at other New Zealand universities.<br><br>Mr Rutherford Ward, a former tutor at two leading North Island universities, said he frequently raised the issue of cheating among Chinese students.<br><br>'It is a problem, no matter what people say,' he said.<br><br>'I came across it while I was tutoring.<br><br>'There are cultural differences and Chinese students are under a lot of pressure because they pay a lot to come here but universities do make it clear what the rules are.<br><br>'It isn't just Chinese students who cheat or have poor language skills but they make up a large number.'<br><br>Meanwhile, thousands of British students have been cheating on their university application forms, reported The Telegraph.<br><br>The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said one in 20 candidates copied material from websites when writing personal statements.<br><br>University applicants have to complete a Ucas form. This means they have to submit a personal statement describing their interests and explaining why they want to study their chosen degree course.<br><br></div>

Being prejudiced wouldn't help matters and could lead to hostility. Since the PRC are here to stay for sure why don't we try to open our mind and learn as much about them as possible? This will enable both sides to have a better understanding of each other's psyche and culture which will bring about a richer, happier and more harmonious co-existence.</div>

As singaporean, most of us stand tall, on equal footing with people from all countries. If you are here to study as students, or to do business and contribute to the society, you are most welcome. We don't resort to name callings, and to those who resort to name calling, their respect worth nothing.

            <div class='col-md body'>I borrow the following thread from Blueheeler in another Topic: More and More PRC in Singapore for leverage on what I'm talking about.<br><br>=============================================<br><br>A few weeks ago, Sunday Times reported the results of a survey concerning SÂ’poreansÂ’ perceptions of foreign workers in Singapore. While workers from India, MÂ’sia and Philippines were deemed by SÂ’poreans to be Â‘hardworkingÂ’, Â‘honestÂ’ &amp; Â‘intelligentÂ’, China workers didnÂ’t fare as well. SÂ’poreans thought that workers from China are <strong>Â‘hardworkingÂ’ but Â‘rudeÂ’ &amp; Â‘greedyÂ’. </strong><br><br>No point contesting the survey results because from the people IÂ’ve spoken to, SÂ’poreans do indeed detest the uncouth behaviour of the many China nationals working here. ItÂ’s easy to see why: <strong>China nationals are frequently seen spitting in public, speaking very loudly, jumping queues, shoving their way through crowds. </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we shouldn't generalise, just because you catch some cheats within that particular group. The article also mentioned 60% of the students are from China, therefore with a larger population size, there would be more instances of it. I am sure that other races cheat too, it's not a phenomenon associated with only the Chinese, so don't stigmatised all the Chinese just because you caught some cheating.</div>
