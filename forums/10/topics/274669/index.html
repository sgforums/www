            <div class='col-md body'>PM must headhunt for 4th generation of leaders before next GE: MM Lee<br>By Dominique Loh, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 17 August 2007 2232 hrs<br><br>PM must headhunt for 4th generation of leaders before next GE: MM Lee<br><br>SINGAPORE : Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his team need to headhunt for candidates in their 30s and 40s to be the fourth generation of leaders before the next general elections.<br><br>This is according to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who was speaking at a National Day Dinner in Tanjong Pagar on Friday night.<br><br>Mr Lee said to become effective ministers, the new Members of Parliament and Ministers of State will need two terms to mature.<br><br>The Minister Mentor added that the current leadership is vigorous enough to herald at least a decade of political stability, economic growth and social progress.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "We must have MPs and ministers who calculate long term not just for the next election, but for the election after that and for the next generation. In other words, we must have people of integrity and every five years, one quarter at least of the MPs should come from a fresh batch that comes as the new generation emerges. That's how we're self renewed at every level."<br><br>Mr Lee also said Singaporeans have the promise of many good years ahead.<br><br>He is confident that the present nervousness in the stock markets will not derail the long-term growth potential of China, India and the rest of East Asia.<br><br>The Minister Mentor also urged those above 60 years old to continue working.<br><br>He said the CPF drawdown age or retirement age will have to move up to life expectancy minus 20 years.<br><br>Legal age for retirement will have to go up from 62 to 65 and to 67.<br><br>Eventually, he added, all those healthy and able to work, should be able to work regardless of age. - CNA/ch<br></div>

Work, work, work.  Already at the age of 40, many people have problem looking for jobs.  In Singapore, when people work in their old age, there is salary reduction.

Moreover, Singapore is a small country, we don't need so many heavy weights in the govt.   US a big country does not have so many heavy weights.<br><br>Gazelle is crap, he will oppose for the sake of opposing.  NOw, his latest project is informing people that the public is allowed to send SMS regarding the National Day Rally speech.   There is motive behing this move of the gahmen.
