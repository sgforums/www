Foreign talent is to me a rather good initiative, but the best solution would still be to raise the birth rates, which is a project that has not really succeeded for a very long time. Our PAP is paid world class salaries. They should be able to come out with world class solutions to address this possible future labour shortage rather than raise the retirement age<br><br></div>

Self-renewal is, by and large, hardly a problem than confronts the political landscape of the free world for most of these countries have got functional political institutions in place to sustain a natural self-renewal process without the need to artificially induce such a process.<br><br>Taking examples from afar (consider any part of the free world), you wouldn't see a scenario where any particular party or individual is so firmly entrenched in power you could be forgiven for thinking the planet would stop revolving in its absence, would you? In truth, the players (both the incumbents and politicians, notwithstanding most are coalition governments) of such political arena are pretty much just instruments sustaining the very institutions which they have been tasked to oversee. For dictatorships and regimes run by despots, however, it's pretty much the reverse - you see mindless gnomes manipulating the very institutions they've been tasked to oversee instead of sustaining them. <span style="font-style: italic;">Surely, it's not rocket science to figure self-renewal for the formal is effectively the antithesis of the latter</span>?<br><br>That said, how self-renewal in this particular instance could be regarded as a due process for a country's survival is beyond me - if anything, it just reinforces the notion self-renewal is but a quintessential process for regime survival in the case of despots and tyrants. Then again, how long could this self-renewal really last?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In essence, the brand of self-renewal the despot is referring to for his beloved regime bears an uncanny semblance to the economic woes confronting various communist regimes in the 20th Century when they converted a state-planned to a market economy. This obviously begs the question : were the economic woes experienced by such regimes really flaws stemming from economic theories in a free economy (as they claimed)? Or were such problems a pragmatic and inevitable realisation of their inability to pepper the cracks which had surfaced (and had been ignored) long before? If there's indeed a parallel between these instances (ie.the economic woes confronting those communist regimes adopting a market economy and this regime's problem with self-renewal) one could infer, it would perhaps lie very much in the eventual destiny of these regimes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

There was no mention of any disadvantages of self-renewal as a process, but rather, as inferred from your argument, the point that it is not required for survival, which I strongly disagree. By merely basing your arguments on PAP's brand of self-renewal, aren't you purely viewing self-renewal within a restricted area? Self-renewal gives you new competencies which are definitely vital for the future of the country, be it self-induced or by willing participants.<br><br></div></blockquote>It isn't so much where our difference lies that has sparked this discourse - it's your inability to defend what I challenged in your initial argument that self-renewal (as preached by this regime) is quintessential to the survival of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">country</span></span></strong> that has yielded this civil discourse. If anything and lest you're disillusioned and unable to comprehend what you'd failed to address, I'm saying the brand of self-renewal which you regard to be vital for the country's survival is a fallacy (which you're obviously entitled to disagree; after all, even lunatics are entitled to think their conduct is an acceptable norm) for ultimately, it sustains the regime above all else. If you need any evidence to call on to see how the country has survived various methods of leadership renewal, just look to the colonial era under the British and imperialism under Japanese occupation.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eagle:</div><div class="quote_body">from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev<br>"While Gorbachev's political initiatives were positive for freedom and democracy in the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc allies, the economic policy of his government gradually brought the country close to disaster. By the end of the 1980s, severe shortages of basic food supplies (meat, sugar) led to the reintroduction of the war-time system of distribution using food cards that limited each citizen to a certain amount of product per month. Compared to 1985, the state deficit grew from 0 to 109 billion rubles; gold funds decreased from 2,000 to 200 tons; and external debt grew from 0 to 120 billion dollars."<br><br>It is clear here that his policies were for the good of the people, yet brought economic disaster to his country, which finally result in the physical suffering of the people! Isn't this called 'incapable'?<br><br></div></blockquote><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong><br>An incapable successor incur the wrath of the people, who will rise to overthrow. Off hand, I can only remember the downfall of the Tang dynasty.<br><br>A good successor will ensure happiness, and off hand, I can remember only Kang Xi emperor of the Qing dynasty. </strong>[/quote]<br><br>Were Gorbachev's policies not grounded on the principle of improving his people's lives? The very example you cited just exposes a critical flaw you obviously haven't addressed.<br><br>As a matter of fact, food shortages in the 1930's under Stalin were far more dire than it had been under Gorbachev in the 1980's. On that account, would it not be reasonable to say Gorbachev actually did <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">more</span></span></strong> for the masses (in your words, making them "happier" ) than Stalin had done? Taking your argument at face value, surely it's not hard to see Gorbachev had actually brought more happiness and had been more capable at addressing the interests of the masses than Stalin.<br>After all, it was you who said <span style="font-style: italic;">"An incapable successor incur the wrath of the people, who will rise to overthrow."</span> By all accounts, surely Stalin would have been more incapable than Gorbachev! So how then was Stalin able to sustain the regime with brute force, but not Gorbachev?<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by eagle:</div><div class="quote_body">I only learned German for 2 yrs for student exchange  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Hmmm...
