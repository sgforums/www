I am not treating him as a patriot but am trying to be fair and objective.<br><br>CSJ was not really guilty of anything terrible so far. He has raised major issues with the government and in doing so he has stepped on the toes of the powerful politicians.<br><br>In asking GCT "where is our monies" for which he was heavily criticized by some weak-minded fellow citizens he was doing all citizens a big favor. Look at how bold our government has become due to its assuming absolute power today to such an extent that today citizens' monies are being thrown at all the bail-outs of foreign institutions for their own names and connections sake when back home our own fellow citizens are facing much financial problems.<br><br>If CSJ is indeed a foreign agent, we have all the police and intelligence service to pin him down with full evidence. So far there is no evidence against him but only suspicions. All these suggest that there may be a lot of propagandas being built up against him to destroy him politically.<br><br>Should our fellow citizens fail prey to such propagandas to fix the oppositions.<br><br>For all the weird actions or behavior highlighted by propagandas, he is not guilty of any serious crimes or anti-people activities. So we the people should try to be objective and fair and not believe in propaganda and start joining the bullies to bully him.<br><br>Tang Liang Hong, Francis Seow along with JBJ were targeted for the same threat or perceived political threats.<br><br>So let us see the larger picture and not fall for propagandas against any more good potential opposition leaders we may find.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Dr Chee did right too. No sane righteous man could say what he did was wrong.<br><br>Unfortunately, the 'media' helped to distort the message Dr Chee was trying to put across to the nation. Yeah, I could still remember the many men in white standing forth to condemn him for his 'bad manners'. You know, I really worry for a nation whose citizenry could have such misplaced priorities... Did they seriously think 'good manners' was more important than all the money in our Reserves?<br><br>I notice there are some members posting to this thread saying they agree with us in general, but feel that Dr Chee's method of questioning was wrong or whatever...<br><br>I find that most suspicious. If you are drawing attention to how 'rude' Dr Chee was when he questioned GCT about our monies, you are not acting like a normal person. Think about it. If someone owes you a huge sum of money, and your representative went after the errant debtor, the first thing on your mind shouldn't be how 'rude' your representative was to the debtor.<br><br>Unless you have a job to do, which is to detract the people from the important issues at stake.<br><br>Crew</div>

He is aiming for a much bigger goal: bringing down the city-stateÂ’s one-party system of government. His weapon is a campaign of civil disobedience against laws designed to curtail democratic freedoms.<br><br>Â“You donÂ’t vote out a dictatorship,Â” he says. Â“And basically thatÂ’s what Singapore is, albeit a very sophisticated one. ItÂ’s not possible for us to effect change just through the ballot box. TheyÂ’ve got control of everything else around us.Â” Instead whatÂ’s needed is a coalition of civil society and political society coming together and demanding changeÂ—a color revolution for Singapore.<br><br>The <strong>need for transparency and accountability </strong>also means that Singapore will have to change. That is the source of Mr. CheeÂ’s optimism in the face of all his setbacks: Â“I realize that Singapore is not at that level yet. But weÂ’ve got to start somewhere. And IÂ’m prepared to see this out, in the sense that in the next five, 10, 15 years, time is on our side. We need to continue to organize and educate and encourage. And it will come.Â”<br><br></blockquote>Want to know more? Click and go read ..... Anyways Im voting for your PAP so don't flame me.... see if i care anymore</div>
