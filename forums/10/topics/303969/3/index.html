              <p>Most welfare systems are on a PAYG basis (unless paid by oil)...the money don't come from "profits". Basically workers feed non-workers and if your population is ageing, there is no guarantee you'll get the money. It won't take long for a professional to hit top income tax bracket as well. Thats how it goes. Profits don't trickle down to the  average joes, get it ?!</p>
              <p>As i said, your best chance of getting profits trickling down to citizens is communism but it is doomed to fail as with any other system, there are people who want to do less but get more. I prefer studying/working in some of these countries rather than hole up in the library reading political science textbooks and decide i can rule the world.</p>

              <p>Poh Ah Pek,</p>
              <p>What you have said is absolutely correct!!!</p>
              <p>If we have quiet and mild pretentious oppositions like now we might as well not have them at all!!!</p>
              <p>Sad to say, defamations suits against politicians have worked wonders here.</p>
              <p>Our citizens have been mostly brainwashed into believing in all those propagandas against CSJ and we see them criticising CSJ instead of the wrong doings like NKF or rising costs of living due to scheming and profiteering by power.</p>
              <p>If the government is truly talented it should not be afraid of CSJ but answer him and his criticisms solidly with facts and not defamation suits of all kinds which are heard in their own powered courtrooms.</p>
              <p>In the first place, it is common sense that politically motivated defamation suits are against natural justice and should nothave been heard in our politically controlled courts where chief justice was appointed by and their salary and promotion administered by the government without independent scrutiny by the parliament or other independent panel.</p>
