            <div class='col-md body'>The more important issue of the day is whether our ministers being paid millions of salaries are doing their jobs.<br><br>They are simply ordinary mortals who were lucky enough (like touching a lottery as GCT once put it in referring shop tenants given the right to buy over their tenanted shops at market price) to be given the opportunity to serve. So in this perspective our ministers should be humble and be willing to serve and be subjected to queries for mistakes in policies or actions.<br><br>CSJ is not being paid a single cent to do his job as an aspiring politicians participating in our particular nation building whereas our ministers are paid millions and many extra bonuses and life pensions.<br><br>So who should be made more answerable to the people and should be subjected to people's scrutiny. Is he CSJ or Jeyaratnam who should be criticized for their behavior or mannerism?<br><br>Do our people realize the plain truth who is answerable for problems and who should reply to criticisms with facts and rationale and take corrective actions?<br><br>Instead when people see government ministers using their power to bully CSJ or JBJ or Francis Seow or Tang Liang Hong what do they do?<br><br>There seems to be something wrong with the people if they only know how to condemn the critics for the slightest fault with mannerism or whatever. I think may be having a rather sick society that is all.<br><br>We reap what we sow. If our quality as a people do not improve we do not deserve a good government now or in the future.<br><br>No wonder our people's retirement or CPF drawdown age is continuously postponed without much avail because they have been taken for granted by such a government who has been encouraged by their own conduct to do wrong to serve only their own ends.</div>
