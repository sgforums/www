            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee should take a more proactive planning approach instead of just relying on concepts and policies to lower costs and increase our economic competitiveness as shown in one such model as follows:-<br><br>HOW TO INCREASE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AND LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE LIVING STANDARDS<br><br>Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the embryo life-blood of a national economy. Through nurturing capital formation, technology start-ups and looking after the growths and health of small and medium enterprises, a country can go a long way in upgrading its own economic competitiveness, resilience, and vibrancy.<br><br>That is why perhaps, many countries are in the forefront of encouraging business and technology start-ups in their own respective Silicon Valleys.<br><br>However, many governments tend to take short-cut and prefer to woe the bigger and more established enterprises and MNCs with incentives forgetting to look after their own domestic sector SMEs.<br><br>They would even practise a tax-and-recover system of economic management which double-charge on lands and all essential services which drives up business costs thereby curtailing their own peopleÂ’s entrepreneurship and SMEs.<br><br>SMEs are vulnerable to turbulence, ups-and-downs in the economy. They are the sources of new capital formation, applications of knowledge and internal resources. They need to be supported in order to compete and grow so as to create more business start-ups.<br><br>It makes sense for the government not only to support their own SMEs with incentives but wherever possible to create special procurement policies to allow them to put to better use the idling internal resources of lands, capital, material, commodities, advertising, promotion and market penetration.<br><br>TYPICAL PROBLEMS FACING SMEs.<br><br>SMEs typically face the following problems:-<br>1.	Higher start-up costs.<br>2.	Fuzziness of management.<br>3.	Lack of process management.<br>4.	Lack of transparency and accountability.<br>5.	Lack of capital and resources.<br>6.	Lack of total management know-how.<br><br>DEVELOPING NEW OPPORTUNITIES<br><br>Government should therefore make in their total economic plans, adopt a more proactive policy to promote the growths and health of its own domestic SMEs including automating work processes to capitalize on SMEsÂ’ strengths in ideas, experimentations, creativity, standardization, specialization, objectivity, coordination, integration and information management.<br><br>CURRENT BUSINESS MODELS<br><br>Unfortunately, so far the efforts seem to be expended in window-dress performance and limited to getting SMEs to go for look-good SOP or ISO certification or financing deals rather than upgrading their management excellence to true cause-effect empowering work processes to motivate workers and to tap on their practical knowledge application and technological competitiveness.<br><br>Without empowering the staff in practical knowledge and creativity in every field the enterprise will remain conceptual putting up with a great deal of ad hoc training and re-training without producing the needed mass knowledge applications and results.<br><br>Look-good marketing ISOs, employed by many SMEs were unable to upgrade mass participation by workers in knowledge application as witnessed by business malpractices and failures during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.<br><br>RE-INVENTION AND SETTING NEW DIRECTIONS<br><br>There is a critical need for businesses to standardize tasks to enable staff to perform them with true efficiency and productivity as follows:-<br><br>1.	STEPS AND CORE ACTIVITIES<br>2.	ADMININSTRATIVE MANAGEMENT<br>3.	OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT<br>4.	PARAMETERS (TIME- COST-QUALITY)<br>5.	QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT<br>6.	CONTINUOUS STANDARDIZATION<br>7.	INTEGRATING OVERALL TASKS.<br>8.	PROCESSING TASKS IN DOCUMENTATION<br>9.	CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ON VARIANCES<br><br>For example, in marketing, SMEs could excel in the following areas :-<br><br>(1)	Capitalizing on advantages of your products and services.<br>(2)	Implementing market penetration through joint economy of scale.<br>(3)	Standardizing processes for implementation in regional operations.<br>(4)	Follow through implementation of tasks in steps to reach results from coordination, knowledge application.<br><br>SMEsÂ’ automation of work processes are supported by departmentalization of diverse tasks hence:-<br><br>1.(General) 2.(Human Resource) 3.(Revenue) 4.(Accounts) 5.(Marketing) 6.(Services-all outsourced activities) 7.(Facility) 8.(Enforcement) 9. (Production) 10.(Compliance).<br><br>WORK FORM (PRODUCTION)<br><br>All departmental core activities will be efficiently managed with hands-on controls, processing, comparison and corrective actions as set up in the OSP Process File List.<br><br>Core production tasks are easily set up in sets of core activities to be processed at scheduled intervals with feedbacks and corrective actions taken at all levels.<br><br>WORK FORM (ACCOUNTS)<br><br>For example, Work Form (Accounts) monitor all accounts, revenues and payments with hands-on coordinated processing through forms and work forms to prevent any leakage or malpractices. Call centre ensures integrated work processes to attain results from systematic quality-time-cost controls, objective and timely supervision, certification of works through 2-way communication task-lines as elaborated.<br><br>WORK FORM (SERVICE - TECHNOLOGY/R&amp;D)<br><br>All the enterpriseÂ’s services e.g. from housekeeping to security, M&amp;E, logistics, R&amp;D, project management etc are set up as core activities to be processed at scheduled time intervals with coordination and knowledge application.<br><br>WORK FORM (MARKETING)<br><br>Marketing tasks are no longer complex or ad hoc but consistently performed core activities e.g. customersÂ’ needs/values, equipment/material/manpower changes, price/cost, A&amp;P - 4 P (product differentiations or technology excellence) to bring about competitiveness.<br><br>WORK FORM (REVENUE)<br><br>The Revenue Department will be able to oversee funds, investments, loans, cash flow and profitability and revenue and take corrective actions to prevent leakages and malpractices due to closed individual ad hoc control and self-centredness.<br><br></div>

Rolling Eyes In fact I can safely say most companies, about 99.9% of them do not have such obscene cronism. I think we should be fair here. Bureaucracy is a common and non lethal problem. I can safely say even in private sector there r many bureacractic problems. I can give a figur of 50%. It is totally different from corruption which is uncommon and lethal. The extent is different. Furthermore, why do u think singapore gov have serious problem in beauracracy compared with other country ? Is it difficult to register for business ? Is the library unchanging for years ? Is it more convenient to pay tax through online ? Do we see increasing red tape or increasing improvement to services ?

I think tat the available help provided is adequate. Remember the money given to the poor have to come off from somewhere. R u willing to pay anther 3% GST so we can be sure they r helped substantially ?</blockquote>Goodness, have you not been reading the papers? The entire restructuring of taxes was not aimed at "helping the people" but rather attracting more foreign investment. While they increase the GST, they lower the corporate tax which generates heck a lot more revenue. So they made people suffer so that they can balance the damn budget. And at the same time they refuse to address the problem of the stagnant wages which are imposed by these foreign companies because there is little incentive for them to raise the current wages and while that happens inflation is still at work.<br><br><blockquote>To be fair, everybody take calculated risk because no one can predict the future.

Otherwise u have to agree with my point tat it is an economy imposibility to have low cost and economically developed city at the same time, especially when it have no resources. Fair ?

Tat is wat u want isn't it ?</blockquote>Not you can't predict the future, but there are branches of mathematics designed to calculate risks and it is called Actuarial Math. They are heavily used by insurance companies to calculate risks etc. There are also economists who work the models to see how the trend develops. The problem with Singapore is that costs were artificially inflated a decade or so ago because the Govt thought it a good policy for people to have high landed assets but the property market burst. Also, the Govt measured the costs of land by considering every damn piece of land a potential Raffles place. It was largely the Govt's stupid attempt to maximise returns that led to such consequences which the Govt has been unapologetic about it till today. Read Ngiam Tong Dow's book for more info.<br><br>As for Suzhou, I assume you are, if I notice your trend of posts, to be rather ignorant about the history of Suzhou.

The project took off after the Govt sold most of it.<br><br>You seem to have forgotten that most of the profits in Temasek most likely ended up in the foreign reserves because i have never seen a budget that explicitly draws money out from foreign investment, and the CPF rate must be far less than the increase in the size of the reserves.

R u going to say they r boastful and losing their credibility, reputation and integrity ?</blockquote>You are comparing apples and oranges. The issue here is that Ministers, as public figures, must stand by their claims, or apologise for making such outrageous ones. As it is, the Govt's entire economic policy is littered with the wreckages of past policy mistakes or misteps, from the Intelligent Singapore nonsense, to Singapore One and what not.<br><br>So first, we have a Govt die hard supporter and now an apologist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Developing country focus on "meritocratic education ". Developed country start to develop other areas. Singapore is a developing country 20 years ago. U may think it is "narrow minded" but twenty years ago people r facing different problems then such as lack of professionals, similar to wat many developing countries face.

About thaksin, it seems to be mention before above. And again investment is risk taking. A lot of acquisition give back very good result.
