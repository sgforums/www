              White Paper written by law firm Amsterdam &amp; Peroff about repression
              in Singapore is receiving extensive attention across the world. More
              than 160 online media organisations and news agencies have picked up
              the press release of the White Paper.<br> <br> Entitled: <a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2009/11/the_repression_of_political_freedoms_in_singapore_the_case_of_opposition_leader_dr_chee_soon_juan.htm">The Repression of Political Freedoms in Singapore: The Case of Opposition Leader Dr. Chee Soon Juan</a>, the document traces the years of oppressive measures taken by the PAP to silence its critics in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Robert Amsterdam, a prominent international human rights lawyer
              as well as an expert in corporate disputes, spearheaded the project.</strong></span><br> <br> The press release was picked up by major news organisations like <a href="http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/provider/providerarticle.aspx?feed=PR&amp;date=20091104&amp;id=10633910">MSN</a> (which boasts of 25 million visitors a day), <a href="http://money.aol.com/article/white-paper-condemns-the-repression-of/751618">AOL</a> (18 million), <a href="http://www.examiner.com/p-429413%7EWhite_Paper_Condemns_the_Repression_of_Political_Freedoms_in_Singapore.html">National Examiner</a> (half a million) and  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS63199+04-Nov-2009+PRN20091104">Reuters</a> (quarter million).<br> <br> Apart from these giant news networks, the statement was also featured by global investment and trade organisations like <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/prnewswire/2009/11/04/prnewswire200911040200PR_NEWS_USPR_____UKTU033.html">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=prnw.20091104.UKTU033&amp;show_article=1">Breitbart</a>, <a href="http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=10714452">EuroInvestor</a> and <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/United_Kingdom/2009/11/04/UKTU033">Bizjournals</a>.<br> <br> The news was, perhaps, carried most extensively in the US by scores of local news networks all across the country. From <a href="http://www.kivitv.com/Global/story.asp?S=11439580">Boise</a>, Idaho to <a href="http://www.kdbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=11439580">El Paso</a>, Texas; from <a href="http://www.kgun9.com/Global/story.asp?S=11439580">Tucson</a>, Arizona to <a href="http://www.khq.com/Global/story.asp?S=11439580">Spokane</a>, Washington; from <a href="http://www.ktvn.com/Global/story.asp?S=11439580">Reno</a>, Nevada to <a href="http://www.ksla.com/Global/story.asp?S=11439580">Shreveport</a>, Louisiana website after website featured the news. Even <a href="http://www.k5thehometeam.com/Global/story.asp?S=11439580">Honolulu</a> carried the statement.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All in all, an incredible 160 news websites, big and small, published
              the press release. Many of these media outlets are affiliates of major
              TV networks like ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC.</strong></span><br> <br> Because of the upcoming APEC meeting many of the websites posted the news on its business and money sections.<br> <br> The statement talks about the Government's use of "unconstitutional
              domestic laws" to silence dissent and highlights the recently passed
              Public Order Act that has "consolidated further the authority of the
              ruling PAP over the political opposition."<br> <br> The release also
              mentions the judiciary and media. It says that the threat of defamation
              and libel suits have "created a climate for the suppression of
              political freedoms."<br> <br> It also calls for APEC leaders to meet
              with civil society and opposition leaders in Singapore, for ASEAN to
              establish a viable human rights commission, and for charges against Dr
              Chee and colleagues to be dropped.<br></p>

              <p>Mr
              Amsterdam met Dr Chee when he attended the International Bar
              Association conference held in Singapore in 2007. The IBA subsequently
              published a paper that was critical of the judicial and legal systems
              in Singapore.<br> <br> The lawyer had gone to the Istana where Dr Chee
              was protesting against Singapore's investments and arms deals with the
              military regime in Burma.<br> <br> The London-based Canadian lawyer
              agreed to become the SDP's and Dr Chee's lawyer in 2008 and has
              assisted the parties in their on-going trials in Singapore courts.<br> <br> Mr Amsterdam's clients include Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky
              who has been in jail for the last six years for supporting the Russia's
              opposition. <br> <br> Mr Amsterdam writes a high-profile blog <a href="http://robertamsterdam.com/">here</a>.</p>

              <div class="post-body entry-content">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore's
              state controlled newspaper the Straits Times online edition of Nov 02,
              2009 has this rather unusual article "PM Future leaders ready.
              Committed candidates-including potential office holders-already
              identified". <br><br>It is true that Singapore has some unusual
              practices, one being the criminalizing of chewing gum. It also appears
              to have a penchant for blood and killing, because they officially
              brutally beat criminals convicted of offenses (this is called caning)
              and hang hundreds of people every year, even teenagers, even for petty
              drug offenses. I understand this government has lately refused to
              release the actual numbers of people caught with chewing gum or
              executed by hanging, but there is anecdotal evidence that it is the
              highest in the world. As someone once said, "Singapore is the beating
              and hanging capital of the world"!<br><br>One other weird practice that
              goes on is this. Despite its claim to be a democracy with political
              parties and a Parliament, the Lee Kuan Yew family, that is Lee Kuan Yew
              the 86 year old man who has appointed himself the Minister Mentor and
              his son, whom he has placed as Prime Minister, go around the island
              each year, looking for suitable Singaporeans they like and anoint them
              as Singapore's leaders. This is what this state controlled newspaper is
              referring to. It says "The ruling PAP (Lee Kuan Yew's party) will have
              the next generation of leaders in place by the next general election in
              2011 or 2012, said Lee Hsien Loong (Lee Kuan Yew's son) on Sunday".<br><br>The
              son said, at a PAP convention on Sunday, some candidates have already
              been identified but the full team is not ready now! He has also said
              "the hunt for successors has been a constant PAP agenda"<br><br>You can
              see why this is astonishing of course! <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee Kuan Yew's son, although we
              know this is the case anyway, speaks as if Singapore belongs to him,
              and he will decide who will govern Singapore. But wait a minute!
              Surely, it is supposed to be a democracy is it not? And if so, should
              not the electorate be deciding who the leaders are supposed to be? Why
              is he assuming that only his chosen candidates will be future leaders?
              Are there not opposition political parties like the SDP? What makes him
              think that Singaporeans would not vote for them at the elections? Is he
              not being too presumptive? </strong></span></span><br><br>No, he is not. He is not being too
              presumptive at all. If you knew Singapore, the elections mean nothing.
              It is a some screen. A charade. First because there are no real leaders
              among it's people anyway, because they are all sued or bankrupted or
              jailed; and there are no real elections because no one dares to run for
              office. The only ones who do are those selected by the father Lee Kuan
              Yew and son, and they will naturally be elected into office since no
              one dares challenge them. It is as simple as that.<br><br>So in this
              dictatorship (that is what it is), Lee Kuan Yew and his son will
              appoint the next leaders like they have always done. And to accomplish
              that task, they are, as they have always done before commenced their
              "hunt" for candidates as the article correctly says.<br><br>In truth
              Singapore is no different from Communist China which renews itself at
              each election by nominating new leaders which the people will rubber
              stamp their approval. <br><br>Interesting is it not? That is why Lee Kuan Yew's family members have coined the phrase "Uniquely Singapore". <br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, CA 94538, USA<br>Tel: 510 657 6107<br>Fax: 510 657 6914<br>Email: <a href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</a><br>Blog: <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/</a><br><br><em><em><em>Your letters are welcome.

              <p>Dear Mr Nair,<br><br>It is unfair to put China together with Singapore.<br><br>1.
              Everyone know that China is a one-party communist-rule state. But, not
              many people realise that Singapore is a one-party state. Singapore is
              masquadering as a .... well, you remember the Singapore Pledge. The
              opposition parties and elections are for show as well. Tell me another
              freely elected leader who is handpicked by the current leader.<br><br>2.
              China has no history of democracy and freedom. But Singapore is borned
              out of the ashes of the British colony, and like the political peers
              from Africa, Lee Kuan Yew managed to school himself in the UK and made
              the choice to be a dictator.<br><br>3. Singapore inherits the British common law and made a mess of it during its peace time.<br>China does not have this luxury. After the last monarchy, China was sucked into wars and revolutions.</p>

              <p>It is true that Singapore has some unusual practices, one being the
                                      criminalizing of chewing gum. It also appears to have a penchant
                                      for blood and killing, because they officially brutally beat
                                      criminals convicted of offenses (this is called caning) and hang
                                      hundreds of people every year, even teenagers, even for petty drug
                                      offenses. I understand this government has lately refused to
                                      release the actual numbers of people caught with chewing gum or
                                      executed by hanging, but there is anecdotal evidence that it is the
                                      highest in the world. As someone once said, "Singapore is the
                                      beating and hanging capital of the world"!</p>

              <p>its not the system. . The law and order system is there. it works efficiently for anyone utilizes it. Also note that the system also prosecutes those within the ruling party, civil service  itself, that of the opposition and the general public as well. its not fair to equate the law and order system to that of one individual.</p>
              <p>I think its fair, because our president appointed was previously a national security worker, the same breed as me. So in the even when the ruling party is gone, he takes over.</p>

                                What??! I'm merely trying to expose this corrupt regime as what it is a despotic nation. But then again I suspect that this lky govt came to power through cheating hence even this govt may not hold legitimacy at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>And just how do you protest in funny Singapore anyway? Even a one man peaceful protests are made illegal. That old man is paranoid. He dare to criticize Singaporeans through his media while not allowing Singaporean or anybody else to critize his ruling much less through his media. And what fairness is that? So everybody needs to clench their mouth and keep to themselves and suffer the curtailment of civic liberties while this despot can say whatever he wants through the media?</div>
