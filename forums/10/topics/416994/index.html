              <p>Hey Dear MM Lee, we Singaporeans like the North Koreans are 'psychopathic types' too!<br> <br> Thanks to WikiLeaks revelation of MM Lee's comments to US Deputy  
              Secretary of State James Steinberg at the Istana on May 30, 2009 ['<a href="http://the-diplomat.com/asean-beat/2010/12/03/wikileaks-exposes-kim-flab-jab/">WikiLeaks Exposes Kim Flab Jab</a>'- The Diplomat,3Dec2010], or see [<a href="http://www.razor.tv/site/servlet/segment/main/news/57296.html">Razor TV Video</a>],
                we now know that in MM Lee's opinion, North Koreans are  ‘psychopathic
               types’ and their leader Kim Jong-il is a  ‘flabby old chap  who prances
               around stadiums seeking adulation.’<br> <br> But aren't we Singaporeans quite the same too?<br> <br> Here's how it could be so:<br> <strong>1)</strong> We continue believe in a main political party insincere in its efforts at upholding racial harmony. <br> - In GE1988, PAP govt used 39 parliamentary seats for its inaugural  
              implementation of the GRC system of elections, the main purported reason
                for such being the achievement of inter-racial harmony and equality  
              through the <a href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/elections_type_electoral.html#group">guarantee of minority MPs being elected to parliament</a>.
                At inception, the effectiveness of 'ensuring minority representation' 
               (referenced to actual resident minority proportions) with 13GRCs was  
              73.960% (see <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/THTMjsVwbNI/AAAAAAAAAO8/uNlT3dUTQnk/s1600/100825-+Betrayal+of+the+original+intent+of+the+GRC+system+of+elections..JPG">chart </a>or <a href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?p=467896#post467896">post </a>for
                date and calculation details), but this figure is projected to fall by
                12.657% to 64.599% by GE2011 despite there being 1 more GRC in GE2011 
              as  compared to GE1988 (<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/THTMjsVwbNI/AAAAAAAAAO8/uNlT3dUTQnk/s1600/100825-+Betrayal+of+the+original+intent+of+the+GRC+system+of+elections..JPG">due mostly to increased minority populations in Singapore- 1980s cf 2009</a>).<br> <br> - The negative side-effect of GRCs- i.e. the tendency of GRCs seats to  
              take up parliamentary seats and thus reduce SMC seats; (reduction in SMC
                seats is disadvantageous to younger, smaller opposition parties and 
              independents as  these have neither the memberships not the funds to 
              compete in large  GRCs of 5-6members each- <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/THTMjsVwbNI/AAAAAAAAAO8/uNlT3dUTQnk/s1600/100825-+Betrayal+of+the+original+intent+of+the+GRC+system+of+elections..JPG">just little over 10% of all parliamentary seats were SMCs in GE2006</a>, GRCs in addition are very much subject to <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/04/grcs-and-gerrymandering-the-roots-causes-of-problems-sylvia-lim/">the problem of gerrymandering</a> to suite the incumbent during elections). <br> Despite the size of the Singapore parliament growing (marginally) between GE1988 and  GE2006, from 81 to 84 MPs respectively [<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TPffpHt6OhI/AAAAAAAAAP8/bqBGxi06Vtw/s900/Electoral+Politics+in+Singapore%2C+YeoLH%2C+Table1%2C+Constituencies-+SG1%2C+Ethnic%2C+jpg+%282%29.jpg">chart</a>].
                That same period saw the number of SMCs for contest however fall 
              drastically- from 42 in GE1988 to 9 in GE2006, the reason for this  
              being that across the board, GRCs had ballooned in size from 3MPs/GRC in
               GE1988 to uniformly 5 to 6MPs/GRC by GE2006.<br> Thus in the midst of the failing effectiveness of 'ensuring minority 
              racial representation' by 12.657%, the prevalence of GRC MPs in 
              parliament actually rose from  48.148%(GE1988) to 89.286%(GE2006): an 
              increase of 85.441%.<br> <br> Adding to the insincerity of the GRC system is the fact that upon demise of any GRC MP, <a href="http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4363900">even if it were to be the minority member, no by-election need be held</a>. By this, the original premise of having GRCs in the first place has effectively been disposed.<br> <br> It seems to me that the GRC system of elections is a policy built more 
              so to  suite the interest of PAP and its aversion to any political 
              contest, rather than the original intentions of ensuring racial equality
               and harmony in  Singapore.<br> <br> <strong>2)</strong> We have complete adulation for our <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/CabinetAppointments/index.htm">ex-Prime Ministers</a>.
                They are elevated post-retirement firstly to the post of 'Senior  
              Minister' and when the current PM retires, to the grand and royal 
              appointment of 'Minister Mentor'. We pay them royally well too, 'MM(s)' 
              and  'SM(s)' <a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/misc/clippings/web/mstr0.jpg">earning in 2008</a> S$3.7M each, a figure less than 1.6% below that of the Prime 
              Minister's  salary and a lofty 24% more than either of the 2 DPM's. <br> <br> We must continually vote for them during elections no matter how sickl, 
              old, tired or even confused they may look, for only current MPs are 
              eligible<br> for a <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/CabinetAppointments/index.htm">Cabinet appointment</a> in Singapore. Imagine the shame and insult we  would inflict upon 
              ourselves should we not support the 'SM' or 'MM' and vote for them. Our 
              change of heart would surely give the foreign press a field day with 
              unpatriotic  headlines like "Minister Mentor looses post, Singaporeans 
              loose direction",  "Minister Mentor dies in office, Nation set for 
              chaos".<br> <br> Perhaps our ex-PMs should take a leaf from the book of  4th and ex-Malaysian PM, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahathir_bin_Mohamad">Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> (b. 10July1925) who'd started his blog <a href="http://chedet.co.cc/chedetblog/">http://chedet.co.cc/chedetblog/</a> in May2008, and whose immensely popular blog to continues to engage 
              and influence both Malaysian politics and the young  in a discreet and 
              elegant way. Tun Mahathir's blog will remain a historic and emblematic 
              guiding light to his political followers if not the nation, long after 
              his demise.<br> <br> <strong>3)</strong> We believe that a paranoid and incompetent PM is the way to 
              go,  recall PM Lee's infamous election rally in the heart of town that 
              state  media reported as [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">'PM Lee says countries worldwide respect and admire Singapore's proven system'</a> CNA:03May2006]:  "...I'm going to spend all my time thinking what's 
              the  right way to fix  them, to buy my supporters votes, how can I solve
                this week's problem  and forget about next year's challenges?...". PM 
               Lee then threatened to fix the opposition, start vote buying and screw 
               policy prudence if 10 or more opposition entered parliament. Me thinks 
               that PM Lee has either improved upon his leadership skills or is 
              perhaps pushing his own limits by the making of yet another promise, 
              this time  guaranteeing <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1052726/1/.html">the presence of 9 opposition members in parliament, their status as mostly consolatory NCMPs notwithstanding</a>.<br> <br> <strong>4)</strong> Don't we all love puppetry of coat-tail MPs and the state 
              bestowed culture of always voting for PAP Cabinet Ministers and their 
              royal entourage?<br> According to [<a href="http://www.youngpap.org.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158:thought-of-the-month-top-5-reasons-why-we-should-retain-the-grc-system&amp;catid=41:politics&amp;Itemid=34">'THOUGHT OF THE MONTH- Top 5 reasons why we should retain the GRC system'</a>-
                YPAP/ Fong Yoong Kheong, 11 May 2010, Updated 28June2010]&gt;3)  
              Electorate gets to vote Cabinet Minister&gt;   ... "The GRC system 
              entitles more Singaporeans  with a chance to   directly vote for a 
              Minister. This translates into  empowerment of the   people and a 
              stronger voting power.", Singaporeans feel heard and  honored in getting
               to vote for GRCs led by Cabinet Ministers, whom by  their devious 
              manipulation (see pt1 'GRC' above), have managed to  guarantee 
              themselves a Cabinet position even before the polls have been  
              concluded- indeed are PAP Ministers divine in their ability to prophesy 
              the  future; crafty PAP politicians.<br> This contrasted with [<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020321af.htm">'Singapore lifts whip on orchestrated parliament'</a>-
                AFP   21Mar2002]: "The free   vote is given to them when they make a  
              request,  and the Whip will   consider. In the past it was simply: 'No  
              you can't  even request', he   said." This only goes to show how 
              dependent we now are upon our hierarchical cabinet to direct and 
              instruct our untested coat-tail PAP MPs.<br> <br> In  most democracies, it is the winning MPs, having each attained the 
              mandate of the electorate they represent that decide amongst those 
              elected who and whom should become ministers and form the cabinet. It is
               perhaps 'uniquely Singapore' that each minister elects amongst his 
              entourage whom is deserving of a 'coat-tail MP' post; see: [<a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-615.htm">'GRCs make it easier to find top talent: SM' </a>-
               ST   27 June 2006]. For these coat-tail MP candidates, the only work 
              requirement in exchange for a plump pay check is probably that one's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYJX-v4FdCs&amp;#t=2m18s">'morals have been (thoroughly) washed with soap'</a>;
               for those whose convictions tell otherwise, herd instinct and the 
              parliament whip would dissuade any further significant political 
              dissent.<br> <br> <br> So yes, we Singaporeans in allowing the PAP to manipulate and 
              hyper-inflate the GRC system of elections to their unethical advantage, 
              have implicitly endorsed PAP's current political dynasty. With so many 
              coat-tail MPs around, I guess we are set to see many more SM, MMs, DPMs,
               ministers without portfolios in the PM's office needed to select, guide
               and defend coat-tail MPs from 'dark and evil opposition forces' late 
              into their retirement years.<br> So in our own little way, we too have ‘<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">flabby</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">devious</span> old chap<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(s)</span> who <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">prances around stadiums </span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/04/grcs-and-gerrymandering-the-roots-causes-of-problems-sylvia-lim/">hyper-inflated the GRC system of elections to gerrymander and rig electoral systems (i.e.fix the opposition)</a>, <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/merlion1/petition.html">buy supporter's votes</a>,  and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5qDQc5UpRg&amp;#t=1m24s">make myopic decisions</a></span> seeking <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">adulation</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">walkover elections, a pliable electorate,  an endangered political opposition, pompous titles of political appointment and a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TPnS-Od66mI/AAAAAAAAAQA/1zIg1MAsCxs/s1600/SG+Gov+sal+2006-2008.JPG">salary scale</a> second to no other democratic country</span>’.<br> <br> So Dear Mr MM Lee, we Singaporeans aren't so special after all, wouldn't you agree?<br> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TNhBxobgRYI/AAAAAAAAAPo/YRuexTbay_s/s400/kim-jong-il.0.0.0x0.384x306.jpeg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TNhBxobgRYI/AAAAAAAAAPo/YRuexTbay_s/s100/kim-jong-il.0.0.0x0.384x306.jpeg" border="0" alt=""></a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il">Wikipedia: Kim Jong Il</a>]<br> Majulah Singapura and a nice day to all.<br> <br> Inspiration/ Motivation:<br> - <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:40&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 25:40</a>:

              <p>Much of the early records of his life come from his own personal accounts and official North Korean government publications, which often conflict with independent sources. Nevertheless, there is some consensus on at least the basic story of his early life, corroborated by witnesses from the period.</p>
              <p>Kim was born to <a title="Kim HyÅ�ng-jik" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Kim_Hy%C5%8Fng-jik"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Kim HyÅ�ng-jik</span></a> and Kang Pan-sÅ�k, who gave him the name <strong>Kim SÅ�ng-ju</strong>, and had two younger brothers, Ch’Å�l-chu and YÅ�ng-ju. The ancestral seat (<em><a title="Bon-gwan" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Bon-gwan"><span style="color: #0645ad;">pon’gwan</span></a></em>) of Kim's family is <a title="Jeonju" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Jeonju"><span style="color: #0645ad;">ChÅ�nju</span></a>, <a title="Jeollabuk-do" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Jeollabuk-do"><span style="color: #0645ad;">North ChÅ�lla Province</span></a>, and what little that is known about the family contends that sometime around the time of the Korean-Japanese war of 1592–98, a direct ancestor moved north. The claim may be understood in light of the fact that the early ChosÅ�n government’s policy of populating the north resulted in mass resettlement of southern farmers in PhyÅ�ngan and HamgyÅ�ng regions in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. At any rate, the majority of the ChÅ�nju Kim today live in North Korea, and extant ChÅ�nju Kim genealogies provide spotty records.</p>
              <p>The exact history of Kim's family is somewhat obscure. The family was neither very poor nor comfortably well-off, but was always a step away from poverty. Kim was raised in a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Presbyterian" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Presbyterian"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Presbyterian</span></a> family; his maternal grandfather was a Protestant <a title="Minister (Christianity)" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Minister_(Christianity)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">minister</span></a>, his father had gone to a missionary school and was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, and both his parents were reportedly very active in the religious community. Kim was an accomplished church organist.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-3"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-4"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-5"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup> According to the official version, Kim’s family participated in anti-Japanese activities and in 1920 they fled to <a title="Manchuria" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Manchuria"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Manchuria</span></a>. The more objective view seems to be that his family settled in Manchuria like many Koreans at the time to escape famine. Nonetheless, Kim’s parents apparently did play a minor role in some activist groups, though whether their cause was missionary, nationalist, or both is unclear.<sup id="cite_ref-formation53_6-0" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-formation53-6"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rogue_7-0" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-Rogue-7"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Kim's father died in 1926, when Kim was fourteen years old. Kim attended Yuwen Middle School in <a title="Jilin" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Jilin"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Jilin</span></a> from 1927 to 1930,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-8"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></span></a></sup> where he rejected the feudal traditions of older generation Koreans and became interested in Communist ideologies; his formal education ended when he was arrested and jailed for his subversive activities. At seventeen, Kim had become the youngest member of an underground Marxist organization with fewer than twenty members, led by HÅ� So, who belonged to the South Manchurian Communist Youth Association. The police discovered the group three weeks after it was formed in 1929, and jailed Kim for several months.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-9"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-10"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>Kim was appointed commander of the 6th division in 1937, at the age of 24, controlling a few hundred men in a group that came to be known as “Kim Il Sung’s division.” It was while he was in command of this division that he executed a raid on <a class="new" title="Poch’onbo (page does not exist)" href="http://www.sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=Poch%E2%80%99onbo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="color: #ba0000;">Poch’onbo</span></a>, on 4 June. Although Kim’s division only captured a small Japanese-held town just across the Korean border for a few hours, it was nonetheless considered a military success at this time, when the guerrilla units had experienced difficulty in capturing any enemy territory. This accomplishment would grant Kim some measure of fame among Chinese guerrillas, and North Korean biographies would later exploit it as a great victory for Korea. Kim was appointed commander of the 2nd operational region for the 1st Army, but by the end of 1940, he was the only 1st Army leader still alive. Pursued by Japanese troops, Kim and what remained of his army escaped by crossing the <a title="Amur River" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Amur_River"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Amur River</span></a> into the <a title="Soviet Union" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Soviet_Union"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Soviet Union</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-16"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Kim was sent to a camp near <a title="Khabarovsk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Khabarovsk"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Khabarovsk</span></a>, where the Korean Communist guerrillas were retrained by the Soviets. Kim became a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Captain (OF-2)" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Captain_(OF-2)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Captain</span></a> in the Soviet <a title="Red Army" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Red_Army"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Red Army</span></a> and served in it until the end of World War II.</p>
              <p>In later years, Kim would heavily embellish his guerrilla feats in order to build up his personality cult. He was portrayed as a boy-conspirator who joined the resistance at 14 and had founded a battle-ready army at 19. North Korean students are taught that this Kim-led army singlehandedly drove the Japanese off the peninsula.<sup id="cite_ref-Rogue_7-2" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-Rogue-7"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
