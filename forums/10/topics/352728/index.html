              <p>I would say that communist manifesto and theory is good to the society, but men are bound by their weakness in greed, power, cheating, jealous and hatre, therefore communism fail as the founder failed to foreseen the weakness in men whilst manifesting his own theory of world utopia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Likewise, capitalism, which we had embraced for many years and had make most of us rich and lead a good life have recently show sign of weakness...and again it is due to men weakness.</p>

              <p>The international Socialist movement was both a
              product of the nineteenth century and a revulsion against it. It was
              rooted in some of the characteristics of the century, such as its
              industrialism, its optimism, its belief in progress, its
              humanitarianism, its scientific materialism, and its democracy, but it
              was in revolt against its laissez faire, its middle-class domination,
              its nationalism, its urban slums, and its emphasis on the price-profit
              system as the dominant factor in all human values. This does not mean
              that all Socialists had the same beliefs or that these beliefs did not
              change with the passing years. On the contrary, there were almost as
              many different kinds of Socialism as there were Socialists, and the
              beliefs categorized under this term changed from year to year and from
              country to country.</p>
              <p>     Industrialism, especially in its early years,
              brought with it social and economic conditions which were admittedly
              horrible. Human beings were brought together around factories to form
              great new cities which were sordid and unsanitary. In many cases, these
              persons were reduced to conditions of animality which shock the
              imagination. Crowded together in want and disease, with no leisure and
              no security, completely dependent on a weekly wage which was less than
              a pittance, they worked twelve to fifteen hours a day for six days in
              the week among dusty and dangerous machines with no protection against
              inevitable accidents, disease, or old age, and returned at night to
              crowded rooms without adequate food and lacking light, fresh air, heat,
              pure water, or sanitation.</p>
              <p>     These conditions have been described for us in the
              writings of novelists such as Dickens in England, Hugo or Zola in
              France, in the reports of parliamentary committees such as the Sadler
              Committee of 1832 or Lord Ashley's Committee in 1842, and in numerous
              private studies like <em>In Darkest England</em> by General William
              Booth of the Salvation Army. Just at the end of the century, private
              scientific studies of these conditions began to appear in England, led
              by Charles Booth's <em>Life</em> <em>and Labour of the People in London</em> or B. Seebohm Rowntree's <em>Poverty, a Study of l own Life</em>.</p>
              <p>     The Socialist movement was a reaction against
              these deplorable conditions of the working masses. It has been
              customary to divide this movement into two parts at the year 1848, the
              earlier part being called "the period of the Utopian Socialists" while
              the later part has been called "the period of scientific Socialism."
              The dividing line between the two parts is marked by the publication in
              1848 of <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> of Karl Marx and Friedrich
              Engels. This work, which began with the ominous sentence, "A spectre is
              haunting Europe—the spectre of Communism," and ended with the trumpet
              blast, "Workers of the world, unite!" is generally regarded as the seed
              from which developed, in the twentieth century, Russian Bolshevism and
              Stalinism. Such a view is undoubtedly an oversimplification, for the
              development of Socialist ideology is full of twists and turns and might
              well have grown along quite different paths if the history of the
              movement itself had been different.</p>
              <p>     The history of the Socialist movement may be
              divided into three periods associated with the three Socialist
              Internationals. The First International lasted from 1864 to 1876 and
              was as much anarchistic as Socialistic. It w as finally disrupted by
              the controversies of these two groups. The Second International was the
              Socialist International, founded in 1889. This became increasingly
              conservative and was disrupted by the Communists during World War I.
              The Third, or Communist, International was organized in 1919 by
              dissident elements from the Second International. .As a result of the
              controversies of these three movements, the whole anticapitalist
              ideology, which began as a confused revolt against the economic and
              social conditions of industrialism in 1848, became sorted out into four
              chief schools. These schools became increasingly doctrinaire and
              increasingly bitter in their relationships.</p>
              <p>     The basic division within the Socialist movement
              after 1848 was between those who wished to abolish or reduce the
              functions of the state and those who wished to increase these functions
              by giving economic activities to the state. The former division came in
              time to include the anarchists and the syndicalists, while the latter
              division came to include the Socialists and the Communists. In general
              the former division believed that man was innately good and that all
              coercive power was bad, with public authority the worst form of such
              coercive power. All of the world's evil, according to the anarchists,
              arose because man's innate goodness was corrupted and distorted by
              coercive power. The remedy, they felt, was to destroy the state. This
              would lead to the disappearance of all other forms of coercive power
              and to the liberation of the innate goodness of man. The simplest way
              to destroy the state, they felt, would be to assassinate the chief of
              the state; this would act as a spark to ignite a wholesale uprising of
              oppressed humanity against all forms of coercive power. These views led
              to numerous assassinations of various political leaders, including a
              king of Italy and a president of the United States, in the period
              1895-1905.</p>
              <p>     Syndicalism was a somewhat more realistic and
              later version of anarchism. It was equally determined to abolish all
              public authority, but did not rely on the innate goodness of
              individuals for the continuance of social life. Rather it aimed to
              replace public authority by voluntary associations of individuals to
              supply the companionship and management of social life which, according
              to these thinkers, the state had so signally failed to provide. The
              chief of such voluntary associations replacing the state would be labor
              unions. According to the syndicalists, the state was to be destroyed,
              not by the assassination of individual heads of states, but by a
              general strike of the workers organized in labor unions. Such a strike
              would give the workers a powerful esprit de corps based on a sense of
              their power and solidarity. By making all forms of coercion impossible,
              the general strike would destroy the state and replace it by a flexible
              federation of free associations of workers (syndicates).</p>
              <p>     Anarchism's most vigorous proponent was the
              Russian exile Michael Bakunin (1814-1876). His doctrines had
              considerable appeal in Russia itself, but in western Europe they were
              widely accepted only in Spain, especially Barcelona, and in parts of
              Italy where economic and psychological conditions were somewhat similar
              to those in Russia. Syndicalism flourished in the same areas at a later
              date, although its chief theorists were French, led by Georges Sorel
              (1847-1922).</p>
              <p>     The second group of radical social theorists was
              fundamentally opposed to the anarcho-syndicalists, although this fact
              was recognized only gradually. This second group wished to widen the
              power and scope of governments by giving them a dominant role in
              economic life. In the course of time, the confusions within this second
              group began to sort themselves out, and the group divided into two
              chief schools: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the Socialists and the Communists. </strong></span>These two schools
              were further apart in organization and in their activities than they
              were in their theories, because the Socialists became increasingly
              moderate and even conservative in their activities, while remaining
              relatively revolutionary in their theories. However, as their theories
              gradually followed their activities in the direction of moderation, in
              the period of the Second International (1889-1919), violent
              controversies arose between those who pretended to remain loyal to the
              revolutionary ideas of Karl Marx and those who wished to revise these
              ideas in a more moderate direction to adapt them to what they
              considered to be changing social and economic conditions. l he strict
              interpreters of Karl Marx came to be known as Communists, while the
              more moderate revisionist group came to be known as Socialists. The
              rivalries of the two groups ultimately disrupted the Second
              International as well as the labor movement as a whole, so that
              anti-labor regimes were able to come to power in much of Europe in the
              period 1918-1939. This disruption and failure of the working-class
              movement is one of the chief factors in European history in the
              twentieth century and, accordingly, requires at least a brief survey of
              its nature and background.</p>
              <p>     The ideas of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and of his associate Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) were published in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> of 1848 and in their three-volume opus, <em>Das Kapital</em> (1867-1894). Although they were aroused by the deplorable conditions of
              the European working classes under industrialism, the chief sources of
              the ideas themselves were to be found in the idealism of Hegel, the
              materialism of the ancient Greek atomists (especially Democritus), and
              the theories of the English classical economists (especially Ricardo).
              Marx derived from Hegel what has come to be known as the "historical
              dialectic." This theory maintained that all historical events were the
              result of a struggle between opposing forces which ultimately merged to
              create a situation which was different from either. Any existing
              organization of society or of ideas (<em>thesis</em>) calls forth, in time, an opposition (<em>anti-thesis</em>).
              These two struggle with each other and give rise to the events of
              history, until finally the two fuse into a new organization (<em>synthesis)</em>.
              This synthesis in turn becomes established as a new thesis to a new
              opposition or antithesis, and the struggle continues, as history
              continues.</p>
              <p>     A chief element in Marxist theory was the economic
              interpretation of history. According to this view, the economic
              organization of any society was the basic aspect of that society, since
              all other aspects, such as political, social, intellectual, or
              religious, reflected the organization and powers of the economic level.</p>
              <p>     From Ricardo, Marx derived the theory that the
              value of economic goods was based on the amount of labor put into them.
              Applying this idea to industrial society where labor obtains wages
              which reflect only part of the value of the product they are making,
              Marx decided that labor was being exploited. Such exploitation was
              possible, he believed, because the working classes did not own the
              "instruments of production" (that is, factories, land, and tools) but
              had allowed these, by legal chicanery, to fall into the hands of the
              possessing classes. In this way, the capitalistic system of production
              had divided society into two antithetical classes: the bourgeoisie who
              owned the instruments of production and the proletariat who lived from
              selling their labor. The proletariat, however, were robbed of part of
              their product by the fact that their wages represented only a portion
              of the value of their labor, the "surplus value" of which they were
              deprived going to the bourgeoisie as profits. The bourgeoisie were able
              to maintain this exploitative system because the economic, social,
              intellectual, and religious portions of society reflected the
              exploitative nature of the economic system. The money which the
              bourgeoisie took from the proletariat in the economic system made it
              possible for them to dominate the political system (including the
              police and the army), the social system (including family life and
              education), as well as the religious system and the intellectual
              aspects of society (including the arts, literature, philosophy, and all
              the avenues of publicity for these).</p>
              <p>     From these three concepts of the historical
              dialectic, economic determinism, and the labor theory of value, Marx
              built up a complicated theory of past and future history. He believed
              that "all history is the history of class struggles." Just as in
              antiquity, history was concerned with the struggles of free men and
              slaves or of plebians and patricians, so, in the Middle Ages, it was
              concerned with the struggles of serfs and lords, and, in modern times,
              with the struggles of proletariat and bourgeoisie. Each privileged
              group arises from opposition to an earlier privileged group, plays its
              necessary role in historical progress, and is, in time, successfully
              challenged by those it has been exploiting. Thus the bourgeoisie rose
              from exploited serfs to challenge successfully the older privileged
              group of feudal lords and moved into a period of bourgeois supremacy in
              which it contributed to history a fully capitalized industrial society
              but will be challenged, in its turn, by the rising power of the
              laboring masses.</p>
              <p>     To Marx, the revolution of the proletariat was not
              only inevitable but would inevitably be successful, and would give rise
              to an entirely new society with a proletariat system of government,
              social life, intellectual patterns, and religious organization. The
              "inevitable revolution" must lead to an "inevitable victory of the
              proletariat" because the privileged position of the bourgeoisie allowed
              them to practice a merciless exploitation of the proletariat, pressing
              these laboring masses downward to a level of bare subsistence, because
              labor, having become nothing but a commodity for sale for wages in the
              competitive market, would naturally fall to the level which would just
              allo\v the necessary supply of labor to survive. From such
              exploitation, the bourgeoisie would become richer and richer and fewer
              and fewer in numbers, and acquire ownership of all property in the
              society while the proletariat would become poorer and poorer and more
              and more numerous and be driven closer and closer to desperation.
              Eventually, the bourgeoisie would become so few and the proletariat
              would become so numerous that the latter could rise up in their wrath
              and take over the instruments of production and thus control of the
              whole society.</p>
              <p>     According to this theory, the "inevitable
              revolution" would occur in tile most advanced industrial country
              because only after a long period of industrialism would the
              revolutionary situation become acute and would the society itself be
              equipped with factories able to support a Socialist system. Once the
              revolution has taken place, there will be established a "dictatorship
              of the proletariat" during which the political, social, military,
              intellectual, and religious aspects of society will be transformed in a
              Socialist fashion. At the end of this period, full Socialism will he
              established, the state will disappear, and a "classless society" will
              come into existence. At this point history will end. This rather
              surprising conclusion to the historical process would occur because
              Marx had defined history as the process of class struggle and had
              defined the state as the instrument of class exploitation. Since, in
              the Socialist state, there will be no exploitation and thus no classes,
              there will be no class struggles and no need for a state.</p>
              <p>     In 1889, after the First International had been
              disrupted by the controversies between anarchists and Socialists, a
              Second International had been formed by the Socialists. This group
              retained its allegiance to Marxist theory for a considerable period,
              but even from the beginning Socialist actions did not follow Marxist
              theory. This divergence arose from the fact that Marxist theory did not
              provide a realistic or workable picture of social and economic
              developments. It had no real provision for labor unions, for workers'
              political parties, for bourgeois reformers, for rising standards of
              living, or for nationalism, yet these became, after Marx's death, the
              dominant concerns of the working class. Accordingly, the labor unions
              and the Social-Democratic political parties which they dominated became
              reformist rather than revolutionary groups. They were supported by
              upper-class groups with humanitarian or religious motivations, with the
              result that the conditions of life and of work among the laboring
              classes were raised to a higher level, at first slowly and reluctantly,
              but, in time, with increasing rapidity. So long as industry itself
              remained competitive, the struggle between industrialists and labor
              remained intense, because any success which the workers in one factory
              might achieve in improving their wage levels or their working
              conditions would raise the costs of their employer and injure his
              competitive position with respect to other employers. But as
              industrialists combined together after 1890 to reduce competition among
              themselves by regulating their prices and production, and as labor
              unions combined together into associations covering many factories and
              even whole industries, the struggle between capital and labor became
              less intense because any concessions made to labor would affect all
              capitalists in the same activity equally and could be covered simply by
              raising the price of the product of all factories to the final
              consumers.</p>
              <p>     In fact, the picture which Marx had drawn of more
              and more numerous workers reduced to lower and lower standards of
              living by fewer and fewer exploitative capitalists proved to be
              completely erroneous in the more advanced industrial countries in the
              twentieth century. Instead, what occurred could be pictured as a
              cooperative effort by unionized workers and monopolized industry to
              exploit unorganized consumers by raising prices higher and higher to
              provide both higher wages and higher profits. This whole process was
              advanced by the actions of governments which imposed such reforms as
              eight-hour days, minimum-wage laws, or compulsory accident, old age,
              and retirement insurance on whole industries at once. As a consequence,
              the workers did not become worse off but became much better off with
              the advance of industrialism in the twentieth century.</p>
              <p>     <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This tendency toward rising standards of living
              also revealed another Marxist error. Marx had missed the real essence
              of the Industrial Revolution. </strong></span>He tended to find this in the complete
              separation of labor from ownership of tools and the reduction of labor
              to nothing but a commodity in the market. The real essence of
              industrialism was to be found in the application of nonhuman energy,
              such as that from coal, oil, or waterpower, to production. This process
              increased man's ability to make goods, and did so to an amazing degree.
              But mass production could exist only if it were followed by mass
              consumption and rising standards of living. Moreover, it must lead, in
              the long run, to a decreasing demand for hand labor and an increasing
              demand for highly trained technicians who are managers rather than
              laborers. And, in the longer run, this process would give rise to a
              productive system of such a high level of technical complexity that it
              could no longer be run by the owners but would have to be run by
              technically trained managers. Moreover, the use of the corporate form
              of industrial organization as a means for bringing the savings of the
              many into the control of a few by sales of securities to wider and
              wider groups of investors (including both managerial and laboring
              groups) would lead to a separation of management from ownership and to
              a great increase in the number of owners.</p>
              <p>     All these developments were quite contrary to the
              expectations of Karl Marx. Where he had expected impoverishment of the
              masses and concentration of ownership, with a great increase in the
              number of workers and a great decrease in the number of owners, with a
              gradual elimination of the middle class, there occurred instead (in
              highly industrialized countries) rising standards of living, dispersal
              of ownership, a relative decrease in the numbers of laborers, and a
              great increase in the middle classes. In the long run, under the impact
              of graduated income taxes and inheritance taxes, ... the great problem
              of advanced industrial societies became ... the exploitation of
              unorganized consumers (of the professional and lower-middle-class
              levels) by unionized labor and monopolized managers acting in concert.
              The influence of these last two groups on the state in an advanced
              industrial country also served to increase their ability to obtain what
              they wished from society as a whole.</p>
              <p>     As a consequence of all these influences, the
              revolutionary spirit did not continue to advance with the advance of
              industrialism, as Marx had expected, but began to decrease, with the
              result that the more advanced industrial countries became less and less
              revolutionary. Moreover, what revolutionary spirit did exist in
              advanced industrial countries was not to be found, as Marx had
              expected, among the laboring population but among the lower middle
              class (so-called "petty bourgeoisie"). The average bank clerk,
              architect's draftsman, or schoolteacher was unorganized, found himself
              oppressed by organized labor, monopolized industry, and the growing
              power of the state, and found himself caught in the spiral of rising
              costs resulting from the efforts of his three oppressors to push the
              costs of social welfare and steady profits on to the unorganized
              consumer. The petty bourgeois found that he wore a white collar, had a
              better education, was expected to maintain more expensive standards of
              personal appearance and living conditions, but received a lower income
              than unionized labor. As a consequence of all this, the revolutionary
              feeling existing in advanced industrial countries appeared among the
              petty bourgeoisie rather than among the proletariat, and was
              accompanied by psychopathic overtones arising from the suppressed
              resentments and social insecurities of this group. But these dangerous
              and even explosive feelings among the petty bourgeoisie took an
              anti-revolutionary rather than a revolutionary form and appeared as
              nationalistic, anti-Semitic, anti-democratic, and anti-labor-union
              movements rather than as anti-bourgeois or anticapitalist movements
              such as Marx had expected.</p>
              <p>     Unfortunately, as economic and social developments
              in advanced industrial countries moved in the un-Marxian directions we
              have mentioned, the unionized laborers and their Social Democratic
              political parties continued to accept the Marxist ideology or at least
              to utter the old Marxist war cries of "Down with the capitalists!" or
              "Long live the revolution" or "Workers of the world, unite!" Since the
              Marxist ideology and the Marxist war cries were more easily observed
              than the social realities they served to conceal, especially when labor
              leaders sought all publicity for what they said and profound secrecy
              for what they did, many capitalists, some workers, and almost all
              outsiders missed the new developments completely and continued to
              believe that a workers' revolution was just around the corner. All this
              served to distort and to confuse people's minds and people's actions in
              much of the twentieth century. The areas in which such confusions
              became of great significance were in regard to the class struggle and
              to nationalism...</p>

              <p>...Are we witnessing the collapse of capitalism itself, as some have
              suggested?  That is unlikely in my view.  More is needed to bring about
              the end of the capitalist system than an economic crisis, no matter how
              severe.  A change of system, or mode of production, has a positive as
              well as a negative side to it.  It involves not just crisis and the
              collapse of the old system, but also the creation of an alternative, of
              a new order.  This is not only an economic process it is also a
              political one.  It requires the existence of political forces that can
              bring this about.  Despite the enormous and widening gulf of inequality
              and widespread poverty and misery, however, such forces do not exist.
               There are, at present, no effective and credible anti-capitalist
              forces.</p>
              <p>Marx believed that such forces would be brought
              into being by capitalism itself.  He argued that the industrial working
              class, created by the conditions of modern industrial work under
              capitalism, would constitute such a force.  The conditions of the
              working class in industrial countries at the time he was writing were
              dreadful.  Agricultural and handicraft workers were driven off the land
              and into cities and factories.  Industrial production in factories had
              greatly intensified exploitation and worsened working conditions. 
              Workers, including women and even young children, were driven by
              economic necessity to work extraordinarily long hours for near
              starvation wages.  Protection for workers' welfare and rights was
              minimal.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, for Marx the working class are not a
              mere impoverished, downtrodden, dehumanized and exploited mass.  The
              impact of industry is not purely negative.  The working class was
              energised and radicalized by these conditions.  It was united and
              educated, its solidarity and consciousness were increased.  Steadily,
              through the 19th and into the first half of the 20th century, it became
              politically stronger -- better organized and more militant.  A
              revolutionary industrial working class grew up just as Marx predicted.</p>
              <p>In
              the advanced capitalist world, however, conditions are much changed
              since then.  Whether these ideas apply still today is questionable.  In
              particular, the character of the classes that make up these societies
              has been transformed.  The industrial working class is now only a small
              and still diminishing part of work force of advanced industrial
              societies.  This is due partly to global economic changes and the
              growth of industry in China and elsewhere; but it is due also to
              changes in the character of production itself, particularly with
              automation and the use of information technology.  The old industries
              which gave birth to the revolutionary working class have been
              transformed.  The old industrial working class in these industries is
              only a small fraction of its former self.  Increasing numbers of people
              work in the service sector -- in offices, shops and even at home using
              computers.  Trade union membership and political militancy have
              declined.  The solidarity and class consciousness which characterized
              the industrial proletariat in its heyday is gone.  It is doubtful that
              it will ever return.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, it is important to see
              that class is still the fundamental form of division in capitalist
              society: that aspect of Marx's analysis still stands.  The working
              class still makes up the great majority of the population even though
              its character has changed.  For the most part it is now located in
              offices and shops, in distribution depots and call centres, rather than
              in factories.  But it is still the working class, made of people who
              are in subordinate positions, who have no share in capital and are
              dependent entirely on their labour for their livelihood.</p>
              <p>Many
              commentators have ceased to regard the working class of any sort as a
              potential revolutionary force.  Instead they look to disenfranchised,
              dispossessed and disaffected social groups -- to women and minority
              groups, and to the young.  They look for revolutionary potential to the
              environmental movement, the women's movement, and to the amorphous
              anti-capitalist movement.  However, these groups lack the solidarity
              and unity of interests of the class-based socialist movement or the
              unifying vision of Marxism.  It is doubtful that they can form a
              sufficiently united or coherent movement.  The working class is still
              the most likely revolutionary agent.</p>
              <p>There is little
              present sign of its fulfilling this role, but it would be a mistake to
              interpret this as a mark of satisfaction with the present state of
              things.  Particularly with the economic recession that is now upon us,
              there is a large measure of alienation and disillusion.  The main
              reason why people are so quiescent is that they see no way in which
              they can bring about significant change which will lead to a better
              future.  Once that hope is present the situation could change quite
              rapidly.</p>
              <p>It is likely that the economic crisis will erode
              still further people's faith in the established political parties that
              support the present order, and lead to a greater level of support for
              radical alternatives, of both left and right.  However, it is not
              certain that the left will be the main beneficiary.  If the experience
              of the great Depression of the 1930s is anything to go by, the danger
              is that a nationalist and far right reaction will develop.  The
              prospects for socialism are still distant.</p>
              <p>Similar things
              must be said about the situation in the third world.  The theory that
              the massive wealth that was generated in the bubble of the last thirty
              years would 'trickle down' and benefit even the very poorest has proved
              illusory.  On the contrary the gulf between rich and poor has increased
              dramatically, not only within nations like the USA and Britain, but
              also globally.  In large parts of Africa and Latin America the most
              dreadful levels of poverty and disease are endemic, and yet for the
              present there are no signs of revolutionary forces emerging.  Who can
              doubt, however, that the conditions exist for revolutionary movements
              and that they will arise given the right circumstances.</p>
              <p>In
              the newly industrializing nations of Asia the situation is perhaps
              different.  China and more recently India have been industrializing at
              an unprecedented rate.  The processes that were occurring in Britain in
              the middle of the 19th century, and which Marx analyzes in <em>Capital,</em> are being repeated on a massive scale and at an accelerated pace. 
              People are flooding in from the countryside to the cities to work in
              the newly created factories and sweatshops which have sprung up. 
              Extremes of wealth and poverty exist side by side.  Whether these
              developments will lead to the creation of a militant working class in
              Asia, as they did in Britain, remains to be seen.  But again, there are
              few signs of this so far that I am aware of.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The current
              crisis has brought the capitalist economic system to the brink of
              breakdown.  It has demonstrated that the free market is a dysfunctional
              basis for economic life. </strong></span> In this respect it has confirmed Marx's
              critique of capitalism.  There is no sign yet of the forces that Marx
              believed would emerge to bring about its overthrow and supersession. 
              Nevertheless, the conditions in which such forces could develop are
              present.  The question of alternatives to capitalism is on the agenda
              once again.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The failure of the market has forced
              Governments to take a large stake in banks and a major role in the
              economy. </strong></span> These measures have been described as 'socialist' by
              advocates of the free market.  There is an element of truth in that
              description.  State ownership and control of the financial system and
              other large enterprises is a necessary condition for socialism in that
              these enterprises are taken out of private hands and social control
              exercised over their operations.  But more is involved in socialism.</p>
              <p>What
              more?  Now that Governments have taken these measures, the question is:
              what should they do with these newly acquired assets and powers?  What
              sort of economic and financial system do we want?  It is for his
              answers to these questions, as much as for his criticisms of
              capitalism, that Marx is important and relevant today.</p>
              <p>What
              has been done so far should not be confused with socialism as Marx
              understood it.  These measures have not been taken in the interests of
              working people or the community as a whole.  Their primary aim is to
              rescue the banks and other parts of the system from collapse.  The
              intention is to return them to the private sector and the free market
              as soon as conditions make this possible, and to do nothing in the
              meantime which will jeopardise this aim.</p>
              <p>Socialism is
              something quite different.  It involves a planned economy, run in the
              interests of the community and particularly of working people. 
              Socialism means an economy ruled not by alien and uncontrollable
              economic forces, but consciously planned and operated for the good of
              all rather than for the profits of a few.  In the present context, this
              means, for example, investment in hospitals, schools, social housing,
              public transport and other much needed infrastructure, and in
              initiatives to deal with the threat to the environment.<a class="style6" name="_ednref6" href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/sayers200309.html#_edn6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
              <p>Moreover,
              for Marx this would be only the first step towards a fully socialist
              society.  Ultimately he envisages a further stage in which the alien
              mechanism of the market is not only brought under control, but
              eliminated altogether, and society is governed by the principle 'From
              each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!'<a class="style6" name="_ednref7" href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/sayers200309.html#_edn7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
              <p>This is a remote and distant vision.  Nevertheless, it is a vitally important idea which must be kept alive.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One
              of Marx's most important insights is that capitalism is a particular
              stage of historical development not an inescapable necessity.  </strong></span>Society
              and the economy need not be ruled by the hostile and alien mechanism of
              the market.  Capitalism came into existence at a certain time, it has a
              life history, and it is likely to become an increasing barrier to the
              full use of productive powers.   Marx envisages that it will eventually
              be superseded by a voluntary and cooperative organization of social and
              economic life in which goods and services are distributed according to
              need rather than ability to pay, and people contribute their labour to
              produce them willingly and not only because they are paid to do so.  A
              better alternative to capitalism is possible.  This is the basis of
              Marx's criticism of it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Until 1935, Mao's position in the CCP was that of a dissident,
              and he was, more than once, reprimanded and demoted, or removed from
              party positions. His chief difficulty was that he refused to accept the
              party's official view, insisted on by Russian-trained Communist
              leaders, that the revolution must be based on urban industrial workers,
              the "real proletariat."</p>
              <p>Instead Mao envisioned the party as a tightly
              disciplined group that could be raised to power <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>on the revolutionary
              activities of the great mass of impoverished and discontented
              peasantry. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Closely related to this idea were two others that were
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>equally unorthodox:</strong></span></p>
              <p>(1)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the role of rural guerrilla warfare</strong></span> in wearing
              down and ultimately defeating a "reactionary government" and</p>
              <p>(2) a
              fundamental emphasis on the distinction between "imperialist" and
              "colonial" nations.</p>
              <p>This last point made it possible for Mao to regard
              the backward and undeveloped colonial areas as possible areas of
              revolutionary activity, where, as in China, the exploited peasants
              could provide the revolutionary impetus and could defend their
              revolutionary achievements by guerrilla warfare.</p>
              <p>The more orthodox
              Communist line was that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> a revolution could be carried out only by an
              urban proletariat that could be found only in an advanced industrial
              area, and that such an industrial base was essential to provide the
              modern military equipment needed to defend the revolutionary
              achievement against the counterattacks of aggressive, capitalist
              countries. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In a sense Mao was much closer to the realities of modern
              politics and to the experience of Soviet Russia itself, since it is
              perfectly clear that no advanced industrial nation will go Communist
              and that the movement must make its advances in underdeveloped areas if
              it is to be successful anywhere.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Since the objections to Mao's position
              came from the center of world Communist theory in Moscow, Mao
              distinguished between the Russian and the Chinese experience by calling
              Russia an "ex-imperialist" country and China an "ex-colonial country."</p>

              <p>This, as we have said, has passed through six
              successive stages, of which at least four are called "capitalism."
              Three features are notable about this development as a whole.</p>
              <p>     In the first place, each stage crated the
              conditions which tended to bring about the next stage; therefore we
              could say, in a sense, that each stage committed suicide.</p>
              <p>The original
              economic organization of self-sufficient agrarian units (manors) was in
              a society organized so that its upper ranks—the lords, lay and
              ecclesiastical—found their desires for necessities so well met that
              they sought to exchange their surpluses of necessities for luxuries of
              remote origin. This gave rise to a trade in foreign luxuries (spices,
              fine textiles, fine metals) which was the first evidence of the stage
              of commercial capitalism. In this second stage, mercantile profits and
              widening markets created a demand for textiles and other goods which
              could be met only by application of power to production. This gave the
              third stage: industrial capitalism. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The stage of industrial capitalism
              soon gave rise to such an insatiable demand for heavy fixed capital,
              like railroad lines, steel mills, shipyards, and so on, that these
              investments could not be financed from the profits and private fortunes
              of individual proprietors. New instruments for financing industry came
              into existence in the form of limited-liability corporations and
              investment banks. </strong></span></p>
              <p>These were soon in a position to control the chief
              parts of the industrial system, since they provided capital to it. This
              gave rise to financial capitalism. The control of financial capitalism
              was used to integrate the industrial system into ever-larger units with
              interlinking financial controls. This made possible a reduction of
              competition with a resulting increase in profits.</p>
              <p>As a result, the
              industrial system soon found that it was again able to finance its own
              expansion from its own profits, and, with this achievement, financial
              controls were weakened, and the stage of monopoly capitalism arrived.
              In this fifth stage, great industrial units, working together either
              directly or through cartels and trade associations, were in a position
              to exploit the majority of the people.</p>
              <p>The result was a great economic
              crisis which soon developed into a struggle for control of the
              state—the minority hoping to use political power to defend their
              privileged position, the majority hoping to use the state to curtail
              the power and privileges of the minority. Both hoped to use the power
              of the state to find some solution to the economic aspects of the
              crisis. This dualist struggle dwindled with the rise of economic and
              social pluralism after 1945.</p>
              <p>   The second notable feature of this whole development is that
              the transition of each stage to the next was associated with a period
              of depression or low economic activity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This was because each stage,
              after an earlier progressive phase, became later, in its final phase,
              an organization of vested interests more concerned with protecting its
              established modes of action than in continuing progressive changes by
              the application of resources to new, improved methods.</strong></span> This is
              inevitable in any social organization, but is peculiarly so in regard
              to capitalism.</p>
              <p> The third notable feature of the whole development is closely
              related to this special nature of capitalism. Capitalism provides very
              powerful motivations for economic activity because it associates
              economic motivations so closely with self-interest.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But this same
              feature, which is a source of strength in providing economic motivation
              through the pursuit of profits, is also a source of weakness owing to
              the fact that so self-centered a motivation contributes very readily to
              a loss of economic coordination.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Each individual, just because he is so
              powerfully motivated by self-interest, easily loses sight of the role
              which his own activities play in the economic system as a whole, and
              tends to act as if his activities <em>were </em>the whole, with
              inevitable injury to that whole. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We could indicate this by pointing out
              that capitalism, because it seeks profits as its primary goal, is never
              primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high
              consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Any of these may be achieved under capitalism, and any (or all) of them
              may he sacrificed and lost under capitalism, depending on this
              relationship to the primary goal of capitalist activity—the pursuit of
              profits. During the nine-hundred-year history of capitalism, it has, at
              various times, contributed both to the achievement and to the
              destruction of these other social goals.</p>
              <p>The different stages of capitalism have sought to win profits by
              different kinds of economic activities. The original stage, which we
              call commercial capitalism, sought profits by moving goods from one
              place to another. In this effort, goods went from places where they
              were less valuable to places where they were more valuable, while
              money, doing the same thing, moved in the opposite direction.</p>
              <p>This
              valuation, which determined the movement both of goods and of money and
              which made them move <em>in opposite directions, </em>was measured by
              the relationship between these two things. Thus the value of goods was
              expressed in money. and the value of money was expressed in goods.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Goods moved from low-price areas to high-price areas, and money moved
              from high-price areas to low-price areas, because goods were more
              valuable where prices were high and <em>money was more valuable where prices were low.</em></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thus, clearly, money and goods are not the same thing but are, on
              the contrary, exactly opposite things. </strong></span>Most confusion in economic
              thinking arises from failure to recognize this fact. Goods are wealth
              which you have, while money is <em>a claim on wealth </em>which you do
              not have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt. If goods are
              wealth; money is not wealth, or negative wealth, or even anti-wealth.</p>
              <p>They always behave in opposite ways, just as they usually move in
              opposite directions. If the value of one goes up, the value of the
              other goes down, and in the same proportion. The value of goods,
              expressed in money, is called "prices," while the value of money,
              expressed in goods, is called "value."</p>
