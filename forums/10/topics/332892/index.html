              <p>Our government said, they censor the SDP or other oppositition talk or western media news because their news is bad, not real.Only what the government said is real and good.</p>
              <p>Let me ask back the PAP government, there are 2 people selling a product, which product is real or not, it's up to the indiviual to listen and think.Businessman A of course will keep telling the people his product is real, same like Businessman B.This is called fair play and also freedom of thought.</p>
              <p>What if Business A maybe because he know some government people, and he ask the government to censor what Business B said, or better still arrest him when he wanted to sell his product because he is not saying the real thing while Business A is?</p>
              <p>So, now Business A already get rip of his Business B opponent and now he is the king.He now say what he can, and he can even say all his product is good and real.And please don't listen to other Businessman.</p>
              <p>The question is, who is the one to judge who is right and wrong?If the government side the Business A because of some political or financial reason, so regarding of Business A good or bad, we had to listen to him?And think that only him is good and other's bad?</p>
              <p>Isit good that, we are been told everything that the Business A said is good and real and if whoever want to complete with Business A business, he will be condemn to prison or bankcrupt regardless of the truth?</p>
              <p>Do what is right and don't do what is wrong.This is what had been taught in our school all the years.</p>

              <p>Yeaa the root of the problem is that the government has unlimited power</p>
              <p>Notice that our 'education' also never consisted of individual rights because once everyone is taught that the very structure of this totalitarian state will fall apart</p>

              <p>Conversely, if 2 lawyers have differing views, than you will have to judge who is correct.</p>
              <p>but let's say one of the lawyer, A, decide to slander the other lawyer, B, in order to gain an advantage. than lawyer B has the right to sue A.</p>
