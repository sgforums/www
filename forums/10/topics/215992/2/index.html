Why isn't ITE doing great? And why people doesn't treat ITE as a good place to be? Are ITE students really bad? Bad until it really means "It's The End"? Do you guys looked down on ITE students?<br><br>ItE students are not gangsters. It's the people thinks that only. ITE students maybe bad, hot tempered. But at least they dd their best but end up in ITE.<br><br>Maybe you disagree or never heard of it, but this message comes out, you should know that ITE it's not really the end.<br><br>ITE roxxs.</div></blockquote><strong>Wee Shu Min: ITE = It's The End.<br>MP Wee: Apologies for the harsh language. ITE = It's To End.<br>Point is that this is Singapore -- the system will probably not change for decades.<br>Can kao peh, but ultimately you have to break out of it.<br>Please go decide how you want to live your life.<br><br>Below is a classic example which you will face: </strong><br><br>if you're not good enough, life will kick you in the balls. that's just how things go. there's no point in lambasting the government for making our society one that is, i quote, "far too survival of fittest". it's the same everywhere. yes discrimination exists, and it is sad, but most of the time if people would prefer hiring other people over you, it's because they're better. it's so sad when people like old derek lament the kind of world that singapore will be if we make it so uncertain. go be friggin communist, if uncertainty of success offends you so much - you will certainly be poor and miserable. unless you are an arm-twisting commie bully, which, given your whiny middle-class undereducated penchant, i doubt.<br><br>then again, it's easy for me to say. my future isn't certain but i guess right now it's a lot brighter than most people's. derek will read this and brand me as an 18-year old elite, one of the sinners who will inherit the country and run his stock to the gutter. go ahead. the world is about winners and losers. it's only sad when people who could be winners are marginalised and oppressed. is dear derek starving? has dear derek been denied an education? has dear derek been forced into child prostitution? has dear derek had his clan massacred by the government?<br><br>i should think not. dear derek is one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country, and in this world. one of those who would prefer to be unemployed and wax lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for the foreigner's, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a sales assistant. it's not even about being a road sweeper. these $*@^bags don't want anything without "manager" and a name card.<br><br>please, get out of my elite uncaring face.</div>
