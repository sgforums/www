              <p>before u meet the MP, you make appointment with his or her secretary first, if your problem is consider too minor for the MP take note, you dun even get to see the MP, and even if your problem is really a huge one, you also have to wait in the Q, by which they will tell you when to come.</p>
              <p>If you really want to see the MP fast, be a CC or RC member, alternatively, if you sponsor alot to the community like my Dad did, the MP personally can come and visit you, if not, you wait long long...</p>

              <p>No need make appointment. Just walk-in during Meet-the-people session. Bring IC. You'll need to fill up a form on what category ur problem is in. Then u get a Q no and wait. You'll meet the grassroot leaders first to elaborate on ur problem. The grassroot leader will write a letter on ur MP's behalf. Then go out and wait again until they call u to meet the MP.</p>
              <p>There are many many categories of problems or requests u can talk to the MP abt. I'm not sure what the MP can actually do except write a letter of appeal for u. Perhaps for school admission wise, MP may write a letter for u and send to school. But final decision rest with the school. If it's family problems wise, He could direct u to the right places for financial aid, mediation for problems with neighbours, counselling, etc. So me, I've only meet my MP to waive parking fines. keke</p>
              <p>Now approaching election liao. MPs may suddenly turn very helpful. So use them, use them well. Haha</p>

              <p><br>please hor,  in layman term, they call it meet the people session, but technically, it means, meet their own special people session. You got to understand this first before we can go on further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Own people meaning, those 3 legs supporters, friends and relative. Are u one of them?</p>

              <p><br>problem like you owe the govt alot of money...sure the MP will see you. Other than that, if you talk about jobless, low pay, getting loan, funneral issue, cannot pay medicate bills or phone bills etc etc, he/she dun even bother to look at it</p>

              <p>You may have the required qualifications, physical and on paper, but not the x factor.</p>
              <p>It means you personality, character, acumen, mentality do not suit police work.</p>
              <p>That means the MP cannot help you.</p>
