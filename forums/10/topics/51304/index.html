They rather jump down from their flats than to protest against the incompetence of the government.<br><br>Those who have their jobs and are doing well will hardly bother about the plight of the jobless.<br><br>In the last election, the PAP promised to address Singaporean's concern and the election was held early because the PAP government said it was eager to form a government to tackle the unemployment problem.<br><br>However, not only did the government take ages just to have a parliamentary sitting, it took more than a year to do anything by way of committee that took ages to make some common sense recommendations.<br><br>In the meantime, the economy worsen and little was done to help the unemployed. Since there is no opposition and the government has full control of the Press, it is not even necessary for the government to solve the unemployment problem....it is easier to hush it up.<br><br>People don't give a damn if you're unemployed, they have their own lives.<br><br>Since Singaporeans gave up all their rights by not supporting their opposition and not proactively organising themselves to safeguard interests, I think in the end when it all falls apart, they only have themselves to blame.<br><br>Edited 29/06/2003 23:51:37 ET by BART (CFKM)<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=30900.9" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=30900.9</a><br><br></div>

Try taking out what is yours in the first place and it is a nightmare.<br><br>They say the CPF was suppossed to be our nest-egg to look support us when we are old. Well I have hit 55 years old 9 years ago.<br><br>Theoretically I should have access to all my CPF monies. BUT I DON'T. In fact, because i am still working at least 5% of my monthly wage is still channeled into CPF!!!<br><br>I am above the mandatory retirement age now, so when will I get to take out the rest of my CPF money? After I am 6 feet under?<br><br>Ministers with million dollar salaries can afford to flippantly say there are jobs available and to refuse to release the CPF monies. But they only need to take a lok at the papers.<br><br>Look at how thin the classifieds are. 2 years ago the Saturday job section is several hundred pages.<br><br>Today it is so thin by comparison.<br><br>If that is not sufficient indication, then take a look also at the Sunday issue of the Sunday Times (29 June 2003 issue "Down But not out" ) .<br><br>White collared professionals form the largest percentage of the unamployed (43%). This is very worrying because jobs are created from top-down. If you cannot create an environment to create jobs at senior levels, then it means that further down the employment level, fewer jobs will also be available for everyone.<br><br>You think we are too choosy? Well you try giving up your million dollar iron rice bowls and come look for a job yourselves. Share the experience first hand with the rest of us before you make that comment!<br><br>But the bottom line is this, by refusing to allow me to have my CPF money, you are effectively taking my destiny into your hands.<br><br>WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO DO THAT???<br><br>You may be a million dollar minister BUT YOU DO NOT OWN OUR SOUL AND YOU CANNOT DICTATE OUR DESTINIES.<br><br>So stop playing God and start being more human. Perhaps you need to adjust your million dollar salary downwards by 99% to come to our level before you can appreciate a working man's plight.<br><br>Below are more feedback from other singaporeans in the political forums.<br><br>Disgustedly yours.<br><br>Goh Wee Soon<br><br><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/354" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/354</a><br><br>This message from Sammyboy.com's Alfresco Coffee Shop on DelphiForums.com was forwarded to you by Weesoon@s...<br><br>You can view it in the context of the entire discussion by going to:<br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=30900.9" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=30900.9</a><br><br></div>

Many have given up trying to understand the complex bureucratic rules that govern operation of these funds.<br><br>The original justification for the CPF was that it was meant to look after retired workers in their old age.<br><br>This looked good on paper but seldome materailised in reality as workers found that they were denied access to their hard-earned money even when they were unemployed or ill!!!<br><br>This was a double whammy as Singapore is not a welfare state and the Singapore Government has effectivelym passed the buck onto the private individual to fend for themselves, whilst at the same time depriving them of 20% of their montly take-home salaries!!!<br><br><strong><span class="large">WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? </span></strong><br><br>Not only do CPF holders suffer low returns on their contributions, they are also left in the dark about how their savings are invested.<br><br>By law, CPF monies that aren't withdrawn by members must be invested in government bonds and deposits with the central bank.<br><br>In turn, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) invests the funds thus raised, but does not publicly disclose its portfolio or investment performance.<br><br>People have criticized the government for using the CPF to raise cheap funds for investment projects at the citizens' expense.<br><br>The government defends itself by claiming the investment gains are used to fund infrastructure development and provide other public amenities, which benefit all Singaporeans.<br><br>Still, the average Singaporean may prefer at least having the option of receiving those gains directly.<br><br>And funding of state/public projects should come from other sources of public revenue (like Income and Corporate Tax).<br><br>By its very origin (from a workers' personal income), CPF cannot be categorised as a source of public revenue.<br><br>Therein lies the logical inconsistency.<br><br>23 June 2003<br><br><a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2111" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2111</a><br><br>Sources and Links<br><br>23 Jun 2003, Sg_Review CPF: Let Singaporeans have their money back<br><br>25 Jun 2003, Sg_Review Let jobless tap CPF in bad times<br><br>27 Jun 2003, Sg_Review RE: LET US HAVE OUR CPF MONEY BACK<br><br>Alfresco Coffee Shop Forum Please show us 100,000 jobs<br><br></div>

It can also be used to pay for medical needs.<br><br>MP Ho Geok Choo had asked in parliament if the government would consider liberalising the use of the CPF for other purposes.<br><br>Ho asked if parents could dip into their contributions to finance the overseas tertiary education of their children who are not admitted to local universities, or to use it to start a small business.<br></div>

Where were the concerns when you let us use our CPF to reduce our burden on you when we fell sick.</div>

But some of these problems have been debated since the 1980 elections and yet no solutions were found.<br><br>The recommendations are as hollow as the words of the former Iraqi information minister. The PAP is pouring old wine into new bottles to market themselves as a party that listens to feedback and a party that can be radical.<br><br>This is not true.<br><br>The PAP does not listen to feedback and nearing its fiftieth anniversary the party has successfully transformed itself as the bastion of Confucianist Conservatism.<br><br>These recommendations serve only two purposes. One, to provide some boost in self- image for PAP activists and the believers that they serve a party that has some compassion for the common man. Two, to provide the necessary mirage to gain the apathetic Singaporean vote on the pretext that they care and listen and act upon feedback.<br><br>What does this all mean? It means that the so-called liberal wing of the PAP is dead and buried. It also means that Singaporeans can continue their constipated frustrations with the government as political apathy and an uneven electoral field continues.<br><br>An old man is taking ownership of Singapore in his own way by selling his books despite being made a bankrupt because he wanted to take ownership of Singapore.<br><br>PAP ministers and MPs who have entered parliament through the back door should be more humble when they ask Singaporeans to take ownership of this country.<br><br>Our fathers and mothers made this country prosper because they wanted a stake in it. It is the PAP who has alienated themselves from the people and not the other way round.<br><br>Your illiberal democratic practices are the main obstacles to taking ownership of this country. By the way taking ownership of this country is the peoples' right not one you the PAP recommend.<br><br><a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2106" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2106</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a few lines... I agree with u guys for most context though...<br><br>Don't be too harsh on Gov for making life difficult for us during this time. Why ? Because we r a sinking ship. The boat used to be big, who can carry lots of load and all the people on it can afford to have TV, lots of food and entertainment thingy inside the boat. HOWever bad times will come eventually. NOW, we r in the middle of a terrible storm, and to survive, we have to clear up some load... So if u r captain, wat will u throw overboard ? The engines of the boat along with the heavy life boats or all the entertainment thingy like TV, some food and the pool table aka The fun stuff.<br><br>So wat is engine and wat is entertainment ? Engine is lousy undesirable policies like retrenchment, lower taxes and foreign workers. Entertainment r the other policies tat make people life happy. I guess u all can recommend a few.<br><br>Tis is sort of a crisis now. We better try to find ways to attract investsment. The other we will talk later when we r getting better</div>
