              within days, be able to account for where he [mas selamat] is? Or,
              if you meant he should account for his position as PM, just
              remember: he was voted in by Singaporeans.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sure, this incident has brought feelings of shame upon
              many of us, however you should consider this point: at best, his
              appearance will only help boost the nation's morale. Is this really
              worth the threat to his life when such a terrorist is out on the
              loose? I think it'd be much worse if an attempt was made on his
              life, not to mention if it were to be successful. Anything is

              <p>His appearance will cause a threat to his life? I don't think so. They are not asking for a public appearance (that is, at orchard road, etc to make a speech), but for him to appear in parliament or public television instead.</p>
              <p>And if a single unarmed, limping JI leader escaping cause such a serious threat to the PM, then what about the President? The PM is the head of gov but the President is head of state (oh, I forgot, maybe our President is also hiding together with PM since we also don't see him often except on NDP). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

Who can we really blame when a terrorist escape? Lets blame ourselves then for voting for incompetent people and sitting on it and not doing anything.</p>
              <p>When a crisis arises, the 1st thing to do is reassurance from him. But no, he choose to hide his face from all of us. How enchanting this tale of "oh I fear for my life" is. Really, that story is working. That just made me despise him more, thanks for the reminder.</p>

              <p>There will always be a terrorist threat regardless of the JI leader escape incidence happening or not. So even if he is finally capture, does this mean there will be absolutely no terrorist threat in Singapore?</p>

              <p>Quesce, you are the one who started the topic (quoted below) to suggest that he hasn't made an appearance as there may be a threat to his life, isn't it?</p>

              <p>"<strong>he could be abstaining from making public

              <p><br>i'm definitely referring to where <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>he himself the prime minister is. i know he's not god and he can't know where mas selamat is. i'm not setting a deadline too, like you must find within 100 hours (which btw is past). there can be mistakes and i can accept.</em></strong></span></p>
              <p>what i cannot accept is not being accountable to mistakes. now, i'm sure one terrorist on the loose is a marginal or negligible addition to his risk.</p>
              <p>fellow forumers are right. doesn't mean terrorist is on the loose, the US president or chinese president go into hiding. if they don't have confidence in the country with all the protection they get, how will the public have confidence? moreover these are high profile countries, people want to kill them just because they head these governments. singapore is, realistically speaking, not.</p>
              <p>the salary part is just an additional point. it's the basic goodwill and faith that by paying you so much, you should be doing things and letting people know what you're doing. having a public servant go into hiding, totally without any notice, is not being accountable.</p>
              <p>a public appearance, as 33225520 says, does not have to be at some hawker centre (that's wayang la). from his office will be good enough. at least let us know, what you're doing, what you feel, what you can promise.</p>

              <p>33225520 &gt; his life .. ? yes , he cares alot for his life and so are we . and i think since he is already the PM , and if he dies , the public will vote or he had already apointed another PM inadvanced . even if he die , it doesnt even matters . are you interested in him ? why do you want to know what he is wearing , doing , feelings ?</p>

              <p>Again, many of you are placing so much emphasis on the unimportant, thrashing the example of our PM "hiding". His not appearing to us is a hypothetical explanation which I believe to be as plausible as any suggestions others may have. Singapore may not be a US or a China, but it is nevertheless an ally of the cause against terrorism; His not appearing does not automatically denote that he is attempting to evade responsibility; his salary has also no direct link to whether or not he should make an appearance...the list could go on. The main point to grasp, however, is that all of this is completely irrelevant.<br><br>At any rate, many of you seem to have a low opinion of the PM - therefore, why does it matter whether he makes an appearance or not? Or, to put it simply, even if he were to make an appearance, I see little in its purpose. Mas Selamat is still out there, PM appearance or no.<br><br>Once again, we should be focusing on staying vigilant and not on speculating or harboring ill will against him just because he hasn't yet appeared.</p>

              <p>first of all, let me clarify that i have nothing against the PM. in fact i've been supportive of his work and policies over the past 4 years. with Mr Lee Kuan Yew we built up a stable society, with Mr Lee Hsien Loong this society goes into maturity with openness and dynamism. this i dare say can't be achieved by any of the opposition of today and for that i salute them.</p>
              <p>like suharto, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said he made contributions to Indonesia far more than anyone else could have, but he made mistakes too. that's history. we're talking current now. my main focus has been accountability. on WKS, on LHL, it's the same issue.</p>
              <p>doesn't mean cos he's been doing good work for 20 years he should be let off once or twice for not being accountable. politics is about people's life, and allowing any lapse would be absolutely disastrous.</p>
              <p>i support this government, i proclaim now.</p>
              <p>but i want to identify a flaw with it: you're doing a good job, i accept and appreciate. but your system does not ensure that if you screw you're responsible. now you've screwed and you're not responsible.</p>
              <p>this i want to see change in.</p>
              <p>my second point is, i accept that even if the PM comes out many people will thrash him anyway. but at least i want to know his take, his commitment to fighting terrorism and most importantly, accounting for the many unexplained things, such as embargoed and ever changing information, as i've mentioned on topic's beginning.</p>
              <p>i'm grateful to courteous discussion even when our views differ.</p>
