            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think pm is hiding. He is on top of the situation and busy dealing with this incident. He is delegating the job of announcing the escape of Mas Selamat to Wong Kan Seng. It is more efficient for minister in charge to deal with media on his ministry purview. George bush don't need to show face everytime there is any crisis so its the same for our PM. All this speculation on our pm is futile and pointless. My guest is that they know this mas selamat is still in Singapore. PM is thus I guess pondering over how to lure this guy out from hiding. Have more faith in your pm since you all elected him.</div>

              <p>i can't stand all these nonsensical excuse why he disappeared.  Fear for his life?  If you really meant that then you must have really insulted the PM.</p>
              <p>The person who really must fear for his life is WKS.  And why LHL and not LKY, since the latter is effectively above the former.  We are not expecting LHL to put on his general uniform and join the search and mingle with the public.  Who could touch him on the stage giving a speech with all his ah beng secret service around him?</p>
              <p>Or maybe after the escape of Mas Selamat, everyone loses faith in security. It's a national security crisis. Even the PM losing faith with his own guards.</p>
              <p>Wherever he is, whatever he do, he can at least make an overseas press statement to show that he cares and is responsible, in order to pacify the public.  That is better than giving away pre-election bribes to the nation.</p>
              <p>Who says George Bush is not better.  At least he will appear before the public and promise to re-capture the fugitive.  He will in his capacity send in armies to a country just to bring back a fugitive.</p>
              <p>And did we really vote for him?  If NTUC runs out of stock and you have only the choice of one stale apple and three rotten ones, wouldn't you choose the stale one?</p>

              <p><strong>Has our Prime Minister gone missing too?<br>Posted by theonlinecitizen on March 5, 2008</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Mas Selamat Kastari is the most wanted man in Singapore right now.</p>
              <p>He is the number one terrorist threat to Singapore.</p>
              <p>A massive island-wide manhunt is on the way to find him.</p>
              <p>Malaysia and Indonesia are also on the lookout for the escapee.</p>
              <p>Interpol has put out a worldwide warrant of arrest for the man.</p>
              <p>The international news media has reported on his escape.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, both on the internet and in the mainstream media, have given their opinion on the matter.</p>
              <p>It seems that the only person missing from all of these is the prime minister himself.</p>
              <p>Perhaps we should start asking: Where is prime minister Lee Hsien Loong?</p>
              <p><br>Not a squeak from the PM</p>
              <p>The PM has not made any public statements or even commented on the matter of the so-called “Limping Terrorist” or the massive manhunt to look for him the entire week.</p>
              <p>The person who has been trying to reassure Singaporeans is Home Affairs minister Wong Kan Seng. Though it is expected that Mr Wong would do so, the escape itself has cast doubts and raised questions on his credibility as Home Affairs chief. Thus, it would be better if his boss, the PM, did the reassuring instead.</p>
              <p>Conspiracy theories</p>
              <p>Conspiracy theorists would undoubtedly have a few colourful – or wild – take on the missing PM. Perhaps the PM does not want to add more pressure on Mr Wong Kan Seng, they might say. Or the PM does not want to distract the security forces from their work – catching the JI leader.</p>
              <p>Still others may say that the PM and Mr Wong cannot get along and the PM is letting Mr Wong carry the buck himself, as it were. Or it could simply be that the prime minister is actually the one running the show behind the scenes.</p>
              <p>I am sure there are many other theories.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, there doesn’t seem to be a good enough reason for the PM to keep quiet – especially when it’s been one week since the “prison break”.</p>
              <p>Leadership</p>
              <p>I think Singaporeans have the right to expect leadership from our PM in a time like this. His continued silence is jarring – and conspicuous.</p>
              <p>A nation is anxious, to say the least. We are the focus of attention worldwide. All that the media here is reporting is the manhunt that is going on.</p>
              <p>One hopes that someone in the media (and the Prime Minister’s Office) will do the necessary job and yes, hunt down the prime minister for a comment, in the very least.</p>
              <p>For if the prime minister seems disinterested in the biggest story in Singapore’s history, why then is he the prime minister?</p>
              <p>His leadership at a time like this is crucial.</p>
              <p>Sadly, a week of silence is deafening – and worrying.</p>
              <p>Has our prime minister gone missing too?</p>

              <p>LOL, what does being in politic has anything to do with him not fearing for his life?</p>
              <p>I mean, so far, we have only see opposition party members have their life wrecked (sue until bankrupt, jailed again and again, unfair dismissal from job, etc) while relatives of the ruling party hold major positions (Ho Ching, CEO of Temasek Holding and LHL wife; Lee Hsien Yang, CEO of SingTel and LKY son, etc). I think those in opposition are much more braver to dare enter Singapore politic.</p>
              <p>Of course you didn't receive any bribe, cause we call them election goodies in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Nah, I never voted for the ruling party too. Too bad, mine a walkover.</p>

              				goes AWOL</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Singapore
              				Democrats<br>5 Mar 08<br><br>Is it possible for a leader of a
              				country to go missing in the midst of a national outcry?<br><br>Yet,
              				this is what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has managed to do. He
              				has not uttered a single comment about the "escape" of
              				ISA detainee, Mr Mas Selamat Kastari. <br><br>In a situation that
              				has caused great concern to Singaporeans and one in which his
              				Home Affairs Minister has turned into unfunny comedy, it is
              				imperative that Mr Lee steps up and takes charge. <br><br>He must
              				assure the public that action will be taken to resolve the
              				situation, demand answers from those responsible, and provide
              				these answers to the public in a timely fashion. <br><br>It has
              				been one full week since Mr Kastari's uncanny disappearance and,
              				amazingly, the nation has not heard from the PM. <br><br>At times
              				such as these people look for leadership. The leader has,
              				however, gone AWOL.<br><br>Even the father, MM Lee Kuan Yew, who
              				does not easily pass up a chance of offering a sagely word or
              				two, solicited or otherwise, is strangely quiet. <br><br>The
              				question that is screaming to be asked is: Why? Why have the PM
              				and MM steered clear of making public statements on the
              				issue?<br><br>Why are they not publicly backing Mr Wong Kan Seng
              				in his utterances? Has the PM met Mr Wong and is he satisfied
              				that the Minister has discharged his ministerial duties in a
              				responsible and forthright manner? If not, what course of action
              				does he recommend?<br><br>Most important, why has PM Lee not come
              				out and unequivocally tell the nation that the Government will
              				present clear evidence to show that the detainee has indeed
              				escaped and how he managed to do it?<br><br>Whatever the case, Mr
              				Lee Hsien Loong must provide the answers. That's what leaders do.
              				His silence is not only deafening, but also very eerie. <br><br>The
              				more-than-strange responses coming from the authorities over the
              				past week indicate that there is much more than meets the eye.
              				<br><br>This is not helped by those in charge of the government
              				who act like they are tip-toeing through a minefield. <br><br>The
              				media and parliamentarians have not covered themselves with glory
              				either. At a time when hard questions need to be asked, they have
              				been singularly negligent. If
              				this is the sign of things to come for Singapore, we are in more
              				trouble than we think.</p>

              <p>One hopes that someone in the media (and the Prime Minister’s Office) will do the necessary job and yes, hunt down the prime minister for a comment, in the very least.</p>
              <p>For if the prime minister seems disinterested in the biggest story in Singapore’s history, why then is he the prime minister?</p>
              <p>His leadership at a time like this is crucial.</p>
              <p>Sadly, a week of silence is deafening – and worrying.</p>
              <p>Has our prime minister gone missing too?</p>

              <p>am deeply honoured that SDP and theonlinecitizen picked up my story.</p>
              <p>it was really, after a few days into the incident did i realise his absence. shows what our media has been doing.</p>
              <p>anyway, my argument is still accountability. i'm not saying top level ministers should be held responsible for his escape directly. but they should be responsible to account for the mistake, to reassure singaporeans on national security.</p>
              <p>it is not as if before the escape, cabinet ministers were never under the threat of an attack. i'm sure they're intelligent enough to be aware that threats are an always and everywhere phenomenon.</p>
              <p>to the point that we should trust the PM because we elected him, well to begin with only 66.6% of voters in contested wards voted for his party (and not him since it's not a direct election). <strong>furthermore, it is precisely because he was elected by the people should he be even more accountable.</strong></p>

              <p>he's not made a public appearance ever since the mas selamat incident, nor has he made any comments about it.</p>

              <p>as far as i know he's not in parliament for budget debate.</p>
              <p>this is so suspicious. government is trying to conceal something of great magnitude. information about mas selamat is released bit by bit, first one photo, then another. first he's 160cm, now he's 158cm. first he's limp, now he's sometimes limp. and now they release pictures of his attire.</p>

              <p>... if MSK has succeeded in leaving SG, WKS is wasting resources &amp; money sustaining this intense search...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... just come on TV again, and say; ".... well, despite all our efforts, MSK still could not be found... this shouldn't be so, but I'm SORRY it is so...lets move on..."</p>
