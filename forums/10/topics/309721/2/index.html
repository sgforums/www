              <p>Singapore mainstream media is not useless, it's just that they are controlled by the state, so they cannot criticise the state, cannot disagree with the state, cannot oppose the state, cannot have views different from the state, cannot report on negative things about the state.</p>
              <p>They are just a propaganda tool of the state.</p>
              <p>That is why I want the media industry to be freed.</p>
              <p>Now nothing but state propaganda.</p>
              <p>It's boring living in a state with media being controlled by the state to serve its agenda.</p>

              <p>i think the question here is really about accountability.</p>
              <p>the prime minister, as head of government, should really respond when something big like this happens. and in the event that he's not able to, he should account for where he is. after all he's being paid millions for this job.</p>
              <p>as for wong kan seng, he should account for the lapse in security, instead of just saying "let's not speculate". if they don't know how he escaped that day, it's unlikely that they'll know in one month. it means they're hiding something.</p>

              <p><br>YES. I registered to shout out all my feeling toward SINGAPORE GOVT. Everything their decision involved $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.</p>
              <p>ERP - more gantries, operation longer hour and all along i always thought we only need to pay money when we go to TOWN but now we have to pay money even we are on the way BACK!!!! ERP till 1030PM. WHAT IS THE rational? Dun go back home too EARLY? 2 ERP along the way back to CTE? WHAT IS TAT? then if we stays braddell? 3 ERP just to go back HOME? WHAT IS THAT? BUT IT STILL JAMMED.... why ERP?</p>
              <p>Increase GST.</p>
              <p>Increase petrol and everything.</p>
              <p>CPF contribution? Increase in interest RATE? SO WHAT? can we draw out all the $ when we reach 55? NOPE!!!! 100k must be stay in our CPF account. WHY? 100k / $300 how much can we DRAW from that? What they do to all our MONEY? Burn HELL notes to us when we DIE? Anyway In order to survive, $300 monthly? NOW CHICKEN rice cost at least $2.5 to $3. Do u think chicken rice wont increase in price in future? What to do? No saving and stay in house till you DIE lor. I have 100k but I CANT USE it to enjoy!!!!! Yes they always have their reason to keep our $. Still say the reminding balance might not be fully transfer to our spouse or kids if we passed away. WTF? Then? Give YOU?</p>
              <p>HDB flat increase? Thought the rational of having the HDB is to support those who are poor or newly couple who just got married?</p>
              <p>Yes, of cause to be FAIR to THEM (GOVT) not all the $$$$$$$$$$$$$ involvement INCREASE. Please look down. They are good and always take good cares of US.</p>

              <p>The best is dont own a car in Singapore, so expensive. A conservative estimated amount to own a cheap car here in Singapore for 10yrs is around 160K.</p>
              <p>And about CPF, there are still many singaporeans who dont know how to manage their expenses well. How many singaporeans actually managed to save 20% of their monthly salary and invest it? After spending on your big car and condo,how much do you have left? So the government has to be THE NANNY. Financial literacy in Singapore is still not there.</p>
              <p>I simply dont like the CPF system, I can get better returns than that investing in fixed deposits overseas risk free!</p>
              <p>CPF is just a way for the employee to earn more, but they cant take it. Employers have to pay more, you should be happy about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
