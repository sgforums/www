              <p><em>PM never fear for his life otherwise he would not be in politics
              in the first place. </em></p>
              <p><strong>Your the other clone said earlier that he should not appear because there is a danger to his life.</strong></p>
              <p><em>Several press statements have been made by Wong
              Kan Seng and two independant inquiries were set up. Singaporean
              were all kept to the latest development released by the AC of
              police.</em></p>
              <p><strong>We are not going to hear any more cover-up stories.  Latest development is always four hours behind.</strong></p>
              <p><em> So there is no need to ask PM to reassure everyone again
              like a father pacifying a bunch of crying babies.</em></p>
              <p><strong>You
              called us "A bunch of crying babies".  We trusted our lives with the
              government, not only our lives, our family, our loved ones, our future,
              our everything.  Now you cocked up and called us crying babies?  Wait
              until your loved ones became the victims of terrorist acts, then you
              tell me who is the crying baby.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We are not asking to be
              pacified.  We are watching to see if our leader is responsible and
              accountable, we need to appraise to see who deserve our vote in the
              next round.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If you go to a restaurant and there is a
              cockroach or lizard in your soup and the manager went missing. Then the
              waiter ask you why are you screaming like a crying baby.  How you feel?</strong></p>
              <p><em>I don't
              receive bribes from anyone when I cast my vote, so all these are
              made up fantasies by the opposition.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Fantasies? Bribes are never labeled bribes. They are called, kopi money, under-table gift, rebates, angbao.  Pre-election cash bonus, GST rebates, etc. That's money politics.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Wake up, I think he needs higher educated and smarter supporter that is more logical and convincing.</strong></p>

              <p>based on the impression I get from sg security standard, it is very world class wan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so, how can that guy be MIA ? how could he run out the 5-finger-mountain of sg security? I am really not able to comprehend this.</p>
              <p>Even he could luckily exit a toilet due to toilet weakness, how can the fence and wall of the compound also coincidenterly have weakness allowing him escape? this is just a guess. no one officially knows what happened in terms of how he escaped. I think if got video surveilance, sure have some clue how he exit right?  else I really the lia-boh-kiu ah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some more, sg has always given people and around the world the impression that it is good in security. Now, how to interprete things?  i no no de. u so smart, u tell me lorz.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i wonder who will or could be the ultimate responsible person for this incident where terror is now on the loose. The impact could be big or small .  one thing for sure, terror managed to escape the 5-finger-mountain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My next concern is security of the people, not just citizens, living in this tiny , highly densed city and that includes TOURISTS.</p>
              <p>I am concern for the residents who take the public transports as well as office workers in buildings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, there is UNCERTAINTY introduced into the system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on the impression i have of sg security, I am confident that in time to come that man will be caught , AGAIN. but hope that after that, procedures, policies, if necessary , and infrastructure and personnel involved are educated on the need to be more vigilent than they already are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1 escape can be too many. sometimes. touchwood nothing badly bombastic happens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>relying on the impression i get, he in still in SG at large.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thus, i expect he be caught, given that so many resources have been deployed and we have engaged so many world record talents.</p>
              <p>i anticipate this case be closed asap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thankyou for reading, thankyou many many lady and gentersmans.</p>

So ladies and gentlemen, from now on, if I see mas selamat or a limping man, I wont call 999 because our MM said he is not a threat even if not found. So I think they will close case and say we have to move on, they don't admit their incompetency. This is called first world leaders, they care for their pocket only</p></div>

              <p>1. Escape from Toilet is 1 issue.</p>
              <p>2. Escape from toilet to outside the fence/wall is another.</p>
              <p>3. Escape from Wall and disappear is another.</p>
              <p>4. Escaped and still inside the island is another.</p>
              <p>5. Escaped and inside the island for over 1 week is another.</p>
              <p>6. Escaped and outside the island could be another.</p>
              <p>7. Escaped and outside the island Without a TRACE could be another.</p>

              <p>4 hours enough time for selamat to reach any safe haven transit island in indonesia, south of singapore.  indonesia is a archipelago of 17,000 islands. many of these islands are without inhabitant.  From transit, he must have traveled to his destination by sea on board a fishing boat to avoid coast guard.  sumatra is easier access compared to kalimantan.</p>
              <p>don't have to travel far, just the tip of sumatra he can find many friends who are fanatics.  There are still many AK47 leftover from recent civil war.</p>
              <p>I think mas selamat will live there comfortably with one objective in mind.  He will seek revenge but he remember his cell member ah seng since told him; "gentlemen seek revenge, 10 years not late".  He don't have to wait long.  He is planning to stage a grand opening ceremony for Singapore casino.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile he is teaching young terrorists how to speak english and make bombs, while rekindle the network with the ex-arms dealers and getting his fund coming in via the north-west coast.</p>

              <p><br>i think before the escape incident,</p>
              <p>people would generally think its no problem for them to handle the casino and all the troubles and problems and social ills it could bring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think once the escapee is re-captured,</p>
              <p>i think the people's believe in the system could return.</p>
              <p>As long as they can prove to the world they can capture an escapee, they should have no problem convincing people, with casino, sg will be able to be happy many many, ie, can stop the problems and make society just as peaceful and safe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wow, sg is really got talent siah. so i think limp man will be captured soon since i got the impression they so stedi bombibi.</p>
