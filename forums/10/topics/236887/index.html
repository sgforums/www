            <div class='col-md body'>The article in the Economist simply summarised it all: Our foreign policy is often "winners takes all and it better be us". Naturally that doesn't grind well with cultures that values face. Then again, most politicians value face, so naturally we are abrasive to our neighbours. As the Economist puts it: Our greatest crime is to be successful and unapologetic about it.</div>

Moreover, his elitist coda has been passed down to the civil service, who have been anything but separate from the PAP.</div>
