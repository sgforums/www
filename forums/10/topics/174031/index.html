In the opening up of the economy, the lower income families might have trouble catching up, but opening society doesn't discriminate based on income. The arguments that law and order might go hay-wire and peace and stability may get disrupted are essentially the same argument, and the same excuse that the government uses time and time again. The problem is that there is no reliable global statistic that can prove that argument. Govt pretends we are doing perestroika before glasnost, but our perestroika never ends. Investments and jobs wonce again are economic elements. Listening to people's opinions on the other hand is very different from economy or society (the latter involves allowing bar-top dancing and the casino). It is political opneness. Political openness is of course, often confused by the government (deliberately) with social openness. As for "others", that is very vague.<br><br>Don't let the govt play on your fears; see through its facade. Yes, slow and gradual is good, insofar as it allows people to adapt. But it is clear that in some areas - and not security-sensitive even - the government still holds a monopoly. AN example is education. No matter how many times parents, students and teachers feedback on the unfairness and inadequacy of the streaming system (+ GEP + Sports School), the government comes back with the same replies and stubbornly refuses to make a proper concrete amendment. THe few changes it has done to the education system, I like to say, are like changing ornaments on a broken Christmas tree. I agree change must be carried out slowly, but when change is done, it should be REAL change. The problem with the MOE is that it either suddenly overhauls everything in one year or shifts bits and pieces around without effecting any proper change except increased confusion about what the syllabus is. And most unfortunately, students are the ones at the suffering end.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr Catherine Lim descrided our situation very aptly:<br><br><br>The need for authentic expression was too important, she said. "It can neither be intimidated into permanent silence nor seduced by material wealth," she said. "And if it is, we are all worse off for it."<br><br>She called on the Government to let mavericks and "troublemakers" play their roles, as they give society a certain rambunctiousness. That kind of environment, she noted, nurtured a leader like Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>The alternative, she said, is a monolithic society, which makes standard copies of its leaders.<br><br>She also had a bigger concern.<br><br>"I've come to believe with a heavy heart that even if the Government wanted to do something about it, Singaporeans are so used to the Government making decisions for us, any major change will be viewed with alarm," said Dr Lim.&gt;<br></div>
