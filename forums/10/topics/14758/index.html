            <div class='col-md body'>Education is a must in today's high powered society that is hunger for paper qualification. But of course, this paper qualificaiton requires one to be flexible as well. The holder of this qualification have to posess other non-academic qualities, such as interpersonal relationship, well spoken english (at least fluent) and the list goes on.<br><br>Put it this way, without education, i will loose out to those who have. But even if i have a paper qualification, i may not be at a great advantage bcos there are a lot more others who have the same, if not better and higher qualificaion than me.<br><br>Hence, i would say that paper qualificaiton is just a passport to the real world in order for us to have a "respectable" job. After we are secured of a job, the rest depends on how the individual is able to cope with. Remember that studying and working are 2 very different kind of "jobs". Some might be able to excel in one, but not the other.<br><br>Although there is a very strong correlation between education and income, it is not always the case. In the past ppl with low education still managed to be high income earners. Take Bill Gates for example, he dropped out from Havard, but still is the world's richest man.<br><br>Personally i feel that besides education, opportunity and luck still played a great role in determining whhether one will succeed in future.<br><br>Hence, the importance of education is still a very open-ended question subjected to debate. We shall see what the others got to say... ...<br><br>[This message has been edited by yoohoo (edited 06 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True, nowadays ppl don normally study for the primary objective of learning. Rather, ppl study so as to get a job that can command higher salary.<br><br>In such a competitive society, it is very costly to pursue one's interest at the expense of the higher salary that could be earned. Given the high cost of living, is it still possible for one to survive with a low salary?<br><br>So, in order to live in luxury, most ppl had tuned themselves to the courses that will command the highest possible salary given their ability (O-level or A-lever results).<br><br>Of course there are ppl who will pursue their interest regardless of what. But i must say that these ppl form a minority only.<br><br>Quite sad to say this......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember this question during my interview to enter the course I am in now.<br>"Why don't you go to the JC since you scored pretty well for your 'O's?" (Erm, ok only lah, can go to average JC only)<br>My answer: "I believe in pursuing my interests rather then doing something that may bring me a better job but I do not have the interest in. If I go to the JC, I will regret my decision and turn back to the path I had wanted to take in the first place. So might as well choose what I wanted from the start."<br><br>Ok, my future job does not have a high pay but it is a stable one. That is more important I guess. =)<br><br>Do something you enjoy, you will be working till you retire and not just for a year =)<br><br>------------------<br>Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them.<br>If you do, they might break your heart..but if you dun, u might break theirs..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maestro.... education does not make u less than what u are today... but u cant deny the fact that it is the passport to give you a head start in your career.<br><br>I am aware that whatever we learn in school is "useless" in some sense. It is not likely to be useful (in some cases). When we reli start working, we have to learn all over again~!!<br><br>But the fact that u have a paper qualification, it allows u to have a better start. It also ensures that u will be able to reach a higher position in the system. This is on the condition that one does not cock up during the course of work.<br><br>So imagine that u do not have any qualification but posess great learning abilities and is a good worker. You will excel only when you meet a good boss, one who is willing to bring the better side out of you and not one who will steal credit out of your work. In short, you will succeed only if you have that bit of luck and opportunity~! otherwise, your talent will be wasted and kept unknown.....<br><br>This is the power of education: it makes others notice you~!</div>
