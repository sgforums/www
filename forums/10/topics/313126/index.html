              Stores, Inc. Pursuing Transfer of Substantial Portion of Disney Store
              North America Business to The Walt Disney Company Under Chapter 11 Case </span></p>
              <p>SECAUCUS, N.J., March 26, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Hoop
              Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of The Children's Place Retail Stores, Inc.
              (Nasdaq:PLCE), today announced that Hoop Holdings, LLC and its
              subsidiaries ("Hoop") D/B/A Disney Store North America ("DSNA") have
              voluntarily filed petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States
              Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
              Delaware, and the Canadian subsidiary expects to file under the
              Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Toronto, Canada. Hoop intends
              to pursue the transfer of a substantial portion of the DSNA business to
              an affiliate of The Walt Disney Company. Neither Hoop's parent company,
              The Children's Place Retail Stores, Inc., nor any of its parent
              company's other subsidiaries is commencing a Chapter 11 case.</p>
              <p>These
              filings follow an extensive review of various strategic alternatives
              for the DSNA business, which is run by Hoop pursuant to a license
              agreement with The Walt Disney Company. Hoop and its parent company
              have been engaged in advanced negotiations concerning the transfer of a
              substantial portion of the DSNA business to The Walt Disney Company. In
              connection with these negotiations, Hoop's Board of Directors has
              determined, with the limited strategic and financial options available
              under the license agreement that its only alternative was to file
              bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>Through these proceedings, Hoop expects to complete
              an orderly wind-down of its affairs. The transaction that is currently
              being negotiated is being pursued in order to maximize proceeds
              available to Hoop stakeholders. The transaction under negotiation is
              subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval
              of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the Canadian Court, and is targeted
              for completion by April 30, 2008.</p>
              <p>In order to assist in the
              financing of the wind-down of Hoop's affairs, and subject to court
              approval, Hoop has executed a debtors-in-possession credit facility
              with Wells Fargo Retail Financing, consisting of a $35 million
              revolving credit facility, including a sub-facility for letters of
              credit.</p>
              <p>Hoop has appointed a Chief Restructuring Officer, Perry
              M. Mandarino of Traxi, LLC, a firm that specializes in restructuring.
              Mr. Mandarino will work with Hoop's Board in guiding the business
              through the Chapter 11 process.</p>
              <p>Hoop Holdings, LLC and its
              subsidiaries design, contract to manufacture and sell merchandise under
              the licensed "Disney Store" brand name. As of March 24, 2008, Hoop
              owned 322 Disney Stores in North America.</p>

              <p>this is old news. the retail disney arm has never been able to replicate the success anticipated. is michael eisner to blame? u draw your conclusion. it was maybe a case of brand expansion too fast.</p>
              <p>part of the failure is the proliferation of the image rights franchise to all sorts of people. you get mickey this, mickey that on every conceivable product. so much so, one can't tell if it's genuine or a rip-off. the disney retail store hence do not actually have exclusive rights to the brand/images. only their product differs. the aura of exclusivity is lost, but the price remains high.</p>
              <p>hoop was also not able to promise that disney experience at its shops. it's a me too experience, which is unlike unique shop experience than say, apple store in the US. </p>
              <p>i had the great pleasure of buying lots of the good disney stuff in the US last year during a visit to the factory outlets. jeans and apparel for kids could be had for as little as US$3.</p>
