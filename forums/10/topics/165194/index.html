Can you name us the cases?<br><br><blockquote><br>No satisfactory explanations were given why there is still the old practice of engaging audit firms to do checking on wrong doings when clearly audit firms have caused many problems resulting in malpractices or collapses of so many large and small firms alike.</blockquote>How did they answer you? What would be a satisfactory answer to you? Please explain.<br>Collpase of companies can be due to marketing, wrong decisions, high costs etc, few are due to accounting fraud.<br><br><blockquote><br>Yet we have adopted such a strong practice in Singapore of using audit firms to check on mismanagement or malpractices. Surely something is wrong?</blockquote>Auidts check on fraud or accounting errors, not on mismanagement. You need to understand that.<br><br><blockquote><br>What is the reason for continuing practice to use audit firms for investigation of malpractices?</blockquote>Are you suggesting discontinue of audits? What is your suggestion for an alternative?<br><br><blockquote><br>Is it because the government itself is currently relying on some big audit firms to report on their works and performance? Therefore to avoid such possible tie with audit firms and at the end any cover-ups or compromise, citizens should ask for more independent overseers to check on wrong doings or malpractices and not those with business relations with government.</blockquote>There you go again, spinning and issue to throw straws at the govt.<br>Independent over seers?

            <div class='col-md body'>Audit is a farce. The company pays the auditor fees to audit the accounts hence there is the element of conflict of interest. The company is free to change auditor as they pay them fees. The auditor will try his best to pass the accounts as true and fair so that they can work on the next company, but there is the stick of legal liability from the public if they screw up. Worst still these companies often offer more lucrative consulting contracts to influence these auditors. The problems of auditing industry can be seen in US where there are so many financial scandals.<br><br>In an audit, it is easier for companies with big clout to doctor accounts or bend rules. MP Davinder Singh was saying the level of the corporate governance is not as high as the western counterparts. Some Boards have many family members on the boards and are more likely to make decisions that are detrimental to the public investors and benefit of family members.<br><br>If you are talking about Goverment Sector, the level accountability and tranparency is much lower.The GIC who manages our reserves had 3 traders who were fined for insider trading. This was discovered by the Japanese Authorities and informed MAS. Initially they were only fined by MAS and GIC refused to sack them. Later they were merely removed from the operations in Japan but retained in GIC. I think the Japanese authorities gave singapore face by not prosecuting the case in Japan. I am not familiar with Japanese Laws but in US if you commit insider trading, it is a criminal offence. Martha Stewart, a celebrity went to jail because of insider trading. To let off insiders  who trade on price sensitive information lightly sends a wrong signal on accountability and tranparency.<br><br>Its important to have a system of check and balances, or you may find gold taps and all sorts of nonsense. The argument of not opening GICs to audit due to fear of foreign speculator attacks is a weak one. The president in his private capacity should then be able to audit the accounts. Why was an ex-president denied an internal audit of the accounts?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way Salman, the auditors exposed them because they wanted to protect themselves from legal liablity. If the threat wasnt there, they might probably pass it as True and fair. Remember Enron and the collapse of Arthur Andersen? The problem with audit is big companies have too much clout to influence the Audit. Robert was very observant and had a point. There is an element of conflict of interest.<br><br>I dont see the problem as evil or bad auditors. The system of auditing has some inherent problems. It is just like paying police constables $500 a month then expect them not to be corrupt,be independent and fair. Of course we shouldn't twist the argument to say we should pay police constables $10,000 a month to prevent corruption. A comparison must be done with other countries, study the feasibility and make a reasonable decision on wages.</div>
