              <p>Sunday, 06 September 2009</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/CSJ/csj_chinatown.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="180" height="135" align="left">District
                  Judge Thian Yee Sze convicted Dr Chee Soon Juan on two counts of
                  speaking without a permit on Friday. She imposed a fine of $10,000 or
                  10 weeks imprisonment in default. The execution of the sentence was
                  stayed pending appeal.<br> <br> Dr Chee is charged with eight counts of speaking in public under the
                  Public Entertainment and Meetings Act. He is already convicted of four,
                  including the present two.<br> <br> Judges Eddy Tham and Jasvender Kaur had previous found Dr Chee guilty
                  of one count each. The SDP secretary-general served a five-week jail
                  term in 2006 for Mr Tham's conviction. The sentence for Judge Kaur's
                  decision in 2008 is still awaiting appeal.<br> <br> The charges are over Dr Chee and his party colleagues selling <em>The New Democrat</em> during elections in 2006. He had asked for all the eight cases to be
                  consolidated and tried at one go. The AG's Chambers and courts refuse
                  to do this.<br> <br> The SDP leader has repeatedly argued that the charge of him not having
                  a permit is a red herring. The Ministry for Home Affairs and police
                  have stated that no permit will be issued for outdoor political events.<br> <br> Dr Chee pointed out that such a policy to issue a blanket ban on public
                  speaking and assembly clearly violated the Constitution and are
                  therefore legally invaild.<br> <br> Citing legal authorities in common law jurisdictions, he drew Judge
                  Thian's attention to the decision of the House of Lords in the UK that
                  "a man commits no crime if he infringes an invalid [policy or
                  administrative act] and has the right to <em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span>challenge</span></span></em> the validity of the [policy] before any court in which he is being tried."<br> <br> Judge Thian refused to listen and proceeded to convict Dr Chee.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: center;"><strong>Chee Soon Juan's closing submissions</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I have been charged under Section
                  19(1)(a) of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act, Chapter 257 for
                  speaking without a permit. <br> <br> We are citizens of Singapore and as citizens, we are guaranteed of our
                  fundamental freedoms under Article 14 of our Constitution which states
                  that:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression;<br> b. all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms; and<br> c. all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br> This Constitution was written and promulgated when we wrestled our
                  country back from the British colonial government. It wasn't just a
                  flight of fancy on the part of the framers of the constitution when it
                  was written. Every word was scrutinised and considered before its
                  inclusion in the document. <br> <br> In other words, the Article 14 was written in to ensure that we, as a
                  people, would be able to fully partake of our freedoms of speech and
                  assembly. We were guaranteed these basic political and civil rights
                  that enable us as free individuals to choose our own government instead
                  of having to rely on and be subject to the rule of another sovereign.<br> <br> The idea of applying for a permit is a red herring. The Minister for
                  Home Affairs Mr Wong Kan Seng stated in February 2003 that the
                  "government does not authorise protests and demonstrations of any
                  nature."<br> <br> He repeated in Parliament in February 2009 and I quote the Hansard: "We
                  have stopped short of allowing outdoor and street demonstrations...Our
                  experiences in the past have taught us to be very circumspect about
                  outdoor and street protests."<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> As you can see, the Singapore government has stated plainly that it
                  will not allow anyone to hold protests and demonstrations of any nature.</strong></span></span><br> <br> Contrast this with Article 14. The constitution says we have the right
                  to freedom of speech but the Minister says he will not authorise such
                  activity. <br> <br> Clearly there is a contradiction. In other words what the Minister says and does is in conflict with the Constitution. <br> <br> There is display of our legal system and the Constitution in the foyer
                  of the Subordinate Courts. One of the display panels describes the
                  "Tools of the Law" and a paragraph in it states that "Any law that
                  conflicts with the Constitution is void and Singapore courts can strike
                  down any legislation or executive acts that go against the
                  Constitution."<br> <br> It cannot have been the intention of the framers of Singapore’s
                  constitution that Parliament can exercise its authority to limit free
                  speech in an arbitrary manner. What limits exist must have at least
                  some rational and bona fide basis.<br> <br> A sweeping ban, one that presumptively eliminates the right of free
                  expression, cannot possibly be one that is genuinely and rationally
                  targeted at any mischief that Parliament can lawfully address.<br> <br> Moreover, the Constitution of Singapore must be construed, where
                  possible, to be consistent with customary international law. The latter
                  provides for free expression for all citizens everywhere; it does not
                  tolerate bans that are massive, arbitrary and disproportionate.<br> <br> Still less does the administrative law of Singapore permit the exercise
                  of executive discretion in a manner that is harshly, arbitrarily and
                  disportionately inimical to freedom of expression and assembly.<br> <br> The across the board refusal of the Executive to issue permits is not
                  consistent with the rule of administrative law, which requires
                  rationality and good faith in the exercise of discretion, a willingness
                  to consider situations on their merits rather than adopting rigid rules
                  that have no basis in enabling legislation, and the interpretation and
                  application of legislation in a manner that is consistent with the
                  basic principles of a human rights, customary international law,
                  Singapore’s solemn international commitments, and parliamentary
                  democracy.<br> <br> Freedom of expression and assembly are part of the preconditions for a
                  meaningful parliamentary democracy. An interpretation of the
                  constitutional and administrative law of Singapore must take into
                  account all of its components.<br> <br> It is not reasonable to accept any and all interferences with political
                  liberties that Legislature or Executive attempt, forgetting that it is
                  political freedom and accountability to the public that is the
                  foundation for the exercise of legislative and executive authority.
                  This point was acknowledged by the Supreme Court of the United States
                  in many cases that identify freedom of expression and assembly as
                  “preferred freedoms” because they are absolutely fundamental to the
                  existence and operation of a free and democratic society.<br> <br> Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada arrived at a similar conclusion in the famous Alberta Press case.<br> <br> Ironically, the Minister for Home Affairs Mr Wong Kan Seng goes on to
                  couch such a Constitutional breach by invoking the concept of the rule
                  of law: "I believe that Singaporeans understand and support the
                  fundamentals that have made Singapore what it is today. What are these
                  fundamentals? The first fundamental is the rule of law."<br> <br> But what really does the rule of law specify and require? The former
                  Chief Justice of India Mr P N Bhagwatie stated that the State must act<br> <br> <em>"within the limits of power conferred upon it by the Constitution
                  and the laws...thereby, making the rule of law meaningful and
                  effective. Most countries have a written constitution which provides
                  the structure allocating and regulating power relations amongst the
                  different organs of the State. The Constitution confers power on the
                  various organs of the State and also lays down the limits within which
                  such power may be exercised...in other words, where the State or its
                  officers act outside the Constitution on the laws...the rule of law is
                  violated.</em>"<br> <br> But when the constitution, and by extension the rule of law, is
                  undermined by the executive branch of the government, who is going to
                  ensure that the problem is corrected? Mr Bhagwatie says:<br> <br> <em>"The judiciary is one such institution on which rests the noble
                  edifice of democracy and the rule of law. It is to the judiciary that
                  is entrusted the task of keeping every organ of the State within the
                  limits of power conferred upon it by the Constitution...It is the
                  solemn function of the judiciary to ensure that no constitutional or
                  legal functionary or authority acts beyond the limits of its power nor
                  that there be any abuse or misuse of power.<br> <br> </em><em>It should be the goal of the rule of law that these
                  multifarious and diverse encounters are fair, just and free from
                  arbitrariness, and it is, therefore, necessary to structure and
                  regulate the power of the executive so as to prevent its abuse or
                  misuse or arbitrary application or exercise...</em><br> <br> <em>The judiciary stands between the citizen and the State as a bulwark
                  against executive excesses of misuse or abuse of power or the
                  transgression of constitutional or legal limitations by the executive
                  as well as the legislature."</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span><br> Chief Justice of Canada, Madam Beverly McLachlin, wrote in December
                  2005 that "Judges must resist...making 'law' out of what cannot be
                  just, and hence, in a profound sense, cannot be legal. To do otherwise
                  is to allow injustice to hide itself under the cloak of false legality."<br> <br> But what is she referring to when she talks about making law out of
                  what cannot be just? She is referring to the Universal Declaration of
                  Human Rights (UDHR). She stated plainly that "the drafting and adoption
                  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was a giant step
                  forward in </span><em><strong>legal</strong></em><span> and societal thinking." (emphasis added)<br> <br> Explicitly and unambiguously stated in the UDHR, I believe they are
                  Articles 19 and 20, that no person shall be denied his or her right to
                  freedom of speech, association and assembly.<br> <br> May I point out that Singapore has ratified two United Nations
                  conventions, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination
                  Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child
                  (CRC).<br> <br> It is clear that the Singapore accepts the fundamental premise of the
                  UDHR, otherwise we would not have ratified these two Conventions.
                  Underpinned in these Conventions, CEDAW and CRC, are the general rules
                  of which the game is played, so to speak.<br> <br> In other words the UDHR is the foundational statement from which CEDAW
                  and CRC are born. What this means is that when Singapore raitifies
                  these Conventions, we have to abide by the general rules as laid out in
                  the UDHR. We cannot pick and choose which rules we want to abide by and
                  which ones we want to ignore.<br> <br> Also at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Abuja, Nigeria,
                  in December 2003, Singapore fully endorsed the Commonwealth (Latimer
                  House) Principles on the Three Branches of Government.<br> <br> This document states that the Commonwealth countries reaffirm their
                  commitment to the Statement on Freedom of Expression adopted in March
                  2002: "We stand united in our commitment to democracy, the rule of law,
                  good governance, freedom of expression and the protection of human
                  rights..."<br> <br> In addition, Singapore has ratified the Association of Southeast Asian
                  Nations (ASEAN) Human Rights Charter which states in Article 1(7) that
                  members states will "strengthen democracy, enhance good governance and
                  the rule of law, and to promote and protect human rights and
                  fundamental freedoms..."<br> <br> It is clear that Singapore has agreed to abide by customary
                  international norms regarding the fundamental freedoms of speech and
                  assembly. It is also clear that the Singapore government refuses to
                  honour and practice what its has signed on to.<br> <br> </span>I will do this by citing the decision of Yong Pung How, then CJ, in <em>Colin Chan v PP</em> (1994) 3 SLR 662. In the decision, Yong CJ had examined a host of
                  authorities and culminated with the citing of an English case <em>Bugg v PP</em> (1993) 2 WLR 628 which was heard by Woolf LJ. <br> <br> Yong CJ remarked that some “conflicting decisions seem to have been finally determined" by Woolf LJ in <em>Bugg v DPP</em>.
                  I quote Yong CJ to emphasize the weight he placed on Woolf's LJ
                  judgment, that there was a sense of a finality, and hence great
                  importance, in Woolf's decision.<br> <br> Woolf had addressed the issue of the role of a criminal court, such as
                  this one, as it related to the question of substantive validity of a
                  law or subordinate law. Woolf LJ said:<br> <br> <em>"These developments are, in our judgment, of importance when
                  considering the proper role of a criminal court where a defendant who
                  is charged with breaching a byelaw seeks to challenge the validity of
                  that byelaw. It is possible to identify at least two different
                  situations in which this will arise. The first is where the byelaw is
                  on its face invalid because either it is without the power pursuant to
                  which it was made because, for example, it seeks to deal with matters
                  outside the scope of the enabling legislation, or it is patently
                  unreasonable. This can be described as substantive invalidity."</em><br> <br> Constitution which states in Article 4: "This Constitution is the
                  supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the
                  Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is
                  inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the
                  inconsistency, be void."<br> <br> It would take someone very reckless to say that there is no substantive
                  invalidity in this police policy. No person, able to reason, would
                  conclude that the policy is not substantially out of line and patently
                  unreasonable with the Constitution, both in spirit and in the letter.<br> <br> Or course the next question that is: Does this court have the power to
                  consider such a question of substantive validity? Of course, you have.
                  Woolf LJ writes:<br> <br> <em>"In the criminal proceeding what has to be established is that the
                  byelaw is unreasonable in the way in which it operates. This aspect of
                  substantive invalidity was illustrated by Lord Russell of Killowen CJ
                  in Kruse v Johnson (1898) 2 Q B 91, 99 as occurring, for instance, if
                  the byelaws:'were found to be partial and unequal in their operation as
                  between different classes; if they were manifestly unjust; if they
                  disclosed bad faith; if they involved such oppressive or gratuitous
                  interference with the rights of those subject to them as could find no
                  justification in the minds of reasonable men...' "</em><br> <br> Woolf reiterates this point later:<br> <br> <em>"In the case of substantive invalidity, it is a matter of law
                  whether, for example, a byelaw is unreasonable in operation or is out
                  with the authorising power. No evidence is required; the [criminal]
                  court can decide the issue by looking at the terms of the primary
                  legislation and the subordinate legislation which is alleged to be
                  invalid.</em>"<br> <br> So the law is utterly clear that the criminal court, that is this
                  present court, can consider the question of whether the written policy
                  of the Singapore Police Force is substantively invalid of the
                  Constitution.<br> <br> Which brings us to the next question: What does this Court do with a
                  policy that is substantively invalid? On this subject Woolf LJ he
                  didn'tt mince his words:<br> <br> <em>"Where the law is substantively invalid...No citizen is required to
                  comply with a law which is bad on its face. If the citizen is satisfied
                  that that is the situation, he is entitled to ignore the law.</em>"<br> <br> Let me use the analogy of a person being penalised for not displaying a
                  parking coupon. An element of the charge is that there was no coupon
                  displayed at the time the car was checked. The driver cannot then say
                  that at that time the shops were all closed and there was no one from
                  whom he could purchase the parking coupon. Such a defence is irrelevant
                  to the element of the charge.<br> <br> But what if the authorities said they did not sell the coupons? Would
                  the matter now change? The driver had no way of buying such coupons at
                  any time to display on his car. Could he still be charged for parking
                  his without a coupon?<br> <br> This is exactly what is happening in our present charge. The
                  prosecution maintains that the element of the charge, or at least one
                  of the elements, is that we did not have a permit for the procession.
                  But as you have heard from DSP Marc E, the police's policy position is
                  that they reject all applications and that they disallow all
                  processions.<br> <br> The illogic of the charge jars the reasonable mind. Can the police
                  accuse anyone of not having a permit when it makes clear that it will
                  not give that permit?<br> <br> If the Constitution clearly tells me that I have the right to freedom
                  of speech and assembly but the police tells me that it will not grant
                  me a permit for it, then the police policy is clearly substantively
                  invalid and this being the case Woolf's LJ decision, to which Yong CJ
                  attached much importance, tells me that I am not required to comply
                  with such a policy.<br> <br> Clearly there is an abuse of power on the part of the police to not
                  give permits under any circumstance because, as I outlined above, the
                  Constitution does not grant the blanket ban on demonstrations and
                  processions.<br> <br> We have been trying to demonstrate to the court that there is abuse of
                  power, mala fide and bad faith by the police. Woolf LJ cannot be
                  clearer on this:<br> <br> <em>"We have particularly in mind cases where it is suggested that
                  there has been an abuse of power because of mala fides on the part of
                  the byelaw maker. In the case of bad faith, there may be an issue which
                  the criminal court can determine and if so, evidence will be required.</em>"<br> <br> <strong>Summary</strong><br> <br> The crux of the matter is that our constitutional rights may not be
                  taken away by the police taking on some "policy position." Such policy
                  is substantively invalid.<br> <br> The issue of substantive invalidity of the police policy must be
                  relevant to the charge because it renders the charge null and void. No
                  citizen is expected to obey a law that is substantively invalid to the
                  Constitution.<br> <br> There is more than a suggestion of bad faith and mala fide on the part
                  of the police. This necessitates our cross-examination of the licensing
                  officer in order for us to adduce evidence.<br> <br> Because of the issues of substantive invalidity and bad faith, this
                  court has the power to hear the arguments without the need for a
                  Judicial Review.<br> <br> Your Honour, the law is clearly with the defence and we ask that you administer justice accordingly.</p>
