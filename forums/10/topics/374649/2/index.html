So what, last time also got PAP minister commit suicide over HDB case, people like Dhana resign over slapping case and many other who resigned, like yeo ning hong etc etc..some are even downgraded.  So what is wrong to resign over 600 death because you never manage well?? that is poor government.

              <p>To cut it short, what Dr.Chee is doing is fighting for <strong>HIS OWN</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">political rights</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">political survival</span>.</p>
              <p>It's got nothing to do with us.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It is not our civil rights that were trampled</span>. We had never been denied of our civil liberties, to conduct civil activities. When acting outside such civil activities, into the realm of political affairs, is it thus not better to apply for permits, make the public security apparatus prepared and ready for any eventuallties?</p>
              <p>The issue is not about who is denied of speech, but rather, who had acted ABOVE THE LAW, AS AN OUTLAW, DEEMED HIMSELF INVIOLATE, to manipulate others to serve his political purposes, and to install himself as a ruler of our lives.</p>
              <p>Is this who we want to rule over us, the man who break laws to get his voice heard, use others to secure himself on the throne? How many other laws will he attempt to break?</p>
              <p>Politics are dirty biz. I agree that the opposition parties have a much more difficult challenge in a face off fight with the ruling party. So too were the ruling party when they fought against the thieving brits and commies. And rightly so that the opposition be boxed in, the way thieving brits, bloodlusty commies and corrupt rulers boxed the ruling party prior to independence.</p>
              <p>Whomever within the law,can think and get out of the box, a box called the constitution and amended by our freely elected representatives as legislators,deserves to rule.</p>
              <p>Only thing is, whoever he is whom can outwit our founding fathers will either turn out to be an enlightened ruler or the most tyrannical despot, once power is in his hands. Let us all citizens not be blinded by emotions, but be ruled by logic and reason, and watch the soap operas and circus being played by the current performers, instead of being used as tools for their ascension.</p>

              <p>I would like to take this opportunity to speak up freely, as guaranteed by our constitution, as a citizen through my birthright as a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>I will not contest the decision made by the judiciary, for I am not of such learned status.</p>
              <p>I will not contest the claims made by the executives against Dr Chee, nor his charge against them or the judiciary.</p>
              <p>I will only comment on the laws proposed, made and legislated by our elected representatives, freely elected in an open election. And that is the right of assembly.</p>
              <p>Is it not always a rational policy that prevention is better than cure? Must we wait till something wrong happens, then wring our hearts in anguish and hindsight that it should have been prevented? Had not the racial ethnic riots taught us nothing, during the formative years of our independence?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The right of assembly had NEVER been denied to us citizens in any way. We meet up with friends, enjoy recreation at faciallities with no encroachment from the authorities. Families freely visit each other across the length and breath of our nation unhindered in any way.</span></strong></p>
              <p>However, due to  often highly charged emotional nature of politics, where emotions are at times manipulated to serve different ends across characteristics spectrums, our legislators only sought for more responsibilities to be excercise by such politicians - ruling party or opposition, or even the general public - BY APPLYING FOR A PERMIT.</p>
              <p>IS  IT  SO  DIFFICULT  TO  APPLY  FOR  A  PERMIT?  IS  IT  SO  DIFFICULT  TO ENSURE  POLITICIANS  OR  WANNABES  TAKE  SOME  FORM  OF RESPONSIBLITY? Are our our society so miserly that we cannot afford to allow some public security officers to be nearby to ensure things dont get out of control, by just making a simple application to them?</p>
              <p>WHY SUCH STUNTS, DR. CHEE???!!!</p>

              <p><br>If Dr Chee dun do that kind of stunts, he is not Dr Chee anymore, that is what i called his trademarks. Whenever there is an illegal speech or assembly, he will be in the picture, it had become a celebrity status to him. Even the PAP minister dun do that, speaking in public with a loudspeaker and blah blah all his way out like there is no laws in this country, what maddness and shame had he cause to us, he can always call for a news conferences and speak on a legal platform, and of course, whatever you said in such high profile situation, you better take your words with responsibility.</p>

              <p>Why did you not claim that Nelson Mandela went to jail for the sake of fighting to gain his own rights in Apartheid ?</p>
              <p>In the same breadth, you might as well claim that Aung San Suu Kyi has allowed herself to be confined for the last 13 years in her stubborn battle with the Myanmese Military Dictators simply to forced her views on the Military Regime.</p>
              <p>Yes, even Mahatma Ghandi's principles were all about his own personal stake in India's volatile racial divide between the Hindus and the Muslims.</p>
              <p>Was Chia Thye Poh insistence on a principle of truth that got him locked up for 32 years to be seen as a battle for his rights or to expose the fraud in LKY's accusation ?</p>
              <p>If Dr Chee is to succeed in exposing the desparation of LKY's PAP to use the worst method to stamp him down, he would have achieved part of his goals.</p>
              <p>When Dr Chee is able to get the LHL Government to bend a little, and accomodate the growing demands for a politically awakened and more concious Singapore population, he would have achieved another part of his goals with his political activism.</p>

              <p>It is obvious that you know nothing about civil liberties that you are entitled to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you believe that outlaws should not rule us, then it is best that you study the political and judiciary records to understand why "outlaws, and those who are above the laws, and those who abuse the laws to protect their interests" continue to rule over us for 52 years.</p>
              <p>If you have no objections to the existing outlaws - why should you make exception in the case of Dr Chee ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The PAP Government has praised the Brits for leaving behind a functioning system of government compared to the Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese Colonial Government.</p>
              <p>If you believe that those Singaporeans who were accused by LKY to be Communists -trying to emulate China's Communist Party - you should look again with the benefit of 52 years of hindsight comparing China today under Communist Rule, to the rule of Singapore by LKY and his PAP for 52 years.</p>
              <p>Obviously, you will not notice that China prospered to boost their huge reserves without their President or PM demanding that their annual wages should be commensurate with the Private Sector - compared to Singapore self-proclaimed elites demanding their meritocratic abilities should be compensated millions annually.</p>
              <p>Is it not surprising that Communist China is introducint democratic practices at the village, county and provincial levels - even as Singapore attempt to divide this small island into more constituencies to suit the LKY's plans to dominate politics ?</p>
              <p>With you blind faith to the PAP's communist methods used to perpetuate their own political security - you have remained ignorant to the sensitivities of China's Central Government in devolving direct State involvement in commerce and industries that had resulted in massive corruption. </p>
              <p>The private sector in China's economy is NOT a PAP type sham entity where the private corporation is but another name taking over the previous role of certain government services with the capital structure being funded by the government and the directors being political appointees.</p>
              <p>For one who claims the use of logic, it is amazing that your distorted logic have overwhelmed your common sense.</p>
              <p>Yes, you will certainly prefer Singaporeans to be mere onlookers, instead of being passionate about their roles as Citizens, upholding the Singapore Pledge that has been solemnly recited as an Oath for 44 years.</p>
              <p>When come to the defense of Singapore - we can depend on your logic and not your emotion to be passionate in defending Singapore.</p>

              <p>Dr. Chee is another Sui Ky living in a despotic illegal regime?</p>
              <p>Dr. Chee is a Gandhi living in a criminal Brit rapacious dictatorship?</p>
              <p>Why do you persist in delusion, and spread your delusions to others?</p>
              <p>You are obviously an intelligent person, and by that meaning you can read and write, why make an irrational exception to support an obvious outlaw like Dr.Chee, who only fight for his political survival and not for our society's survival, such as increasing our wealth, job creation and improving on social needs and necessities?</p>

              <p><br>Well. After reading the walls of text that I usually like posting, I think you both are intelligent people.</p>
              <p>Basically, each of you have your own points of view (both of which are actually valid imho), and I am honestly a little too young and know too little about politics right now to comment on both of your arguments.</p>
              <p>But may I please interject a thought.</p>
              <p>Many of my seniors have great respect for Mr <strong><em>J B</em></strong> Jeyaretnam, but not all of them think the same of Mr Chee. Do both of you understand why?</p>
