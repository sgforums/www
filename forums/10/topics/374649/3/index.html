              <p>And I really do want a change of government in Singapore as well. Dr Chee would not be a good choice though. Why not Mr Low?</p>

              <p>Ignoring the blatant insults,</p>
              <p>I remembered once when I attended the final interview for RSAF pilot trainning. The interviewer asked:-</p>
              <p>From records, you have many relatives living up north, espacially in Malacca. Are you prepared to drop the bomb there if a need is required in an outright declaration of war?</p>
              <p>My answer:- Bombing missions will mean specifically selected targets such as ammo dumps, military production centres. Should my relatives be there, they will be considered 'collateral damage' in an official war zone.</p>
              <p>I will not hesitate for even one second to activate the release trigger to drop my bombs, for it would mean saving million of other lives and stopping the war.</p>
              <p>Does my answer makes me less a human, an outlaw, a murderer, in self denial of realities that millions of lives are at stake?</p>

              <p>From the US point of view, the pilots who dropped the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not criminals, neither did the survivors who lived through the horrors of the atomic catastrophies who were too shocked to even feel any animosity towards the US.</p>
              <p>From the Vietnamese point of view, the US pilots that bombed the bridges of Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, and were captured when their planes were downed - they were not merely prisoners of war, but criminals and outlaws.</p>
              <p>Singapore Government hung the two captured Indonesian saboteurs who bombed MacDonald House, despite the fact that they were simple soldiers sent on a mission to demoralize Singaporeans and shorten the Konfrontasi - and the two were hung two years after Konfrontasi was declared officially over and despite the call from Suharto for the Singapore Government to show clemency.</p>
              <p>Criminals or outlaws or not - depend on which side of the fence you are on.</p>
              <p>The fact remains that acts against lawlessness cannot be illegal, when the laws itself are illegal and immoral.</p>
              <p>Should it not be time for you to be awaken to the fact that your Rights enshrined in the Singapore Constitution have been raped, while the spirit and intent of the Singapore Constitution has been bastardised by the many PAP addendums passed in the self-interest of the PAP - to perpetuate their own domination in Singapore politics ?</p>

              <p>Seating on the throne may help solve society's woes, but it is also a double edge sword in that the one who seats there may turn out far worse than we can imagine, more so when the signs are already clear to see now at the extend he would go for his own self glory.</p>
              <p>But that's only my, as you allude and claim, my low intelligence perceptions. The question remains -  </p>
              <p> You are obviously an intelligent person, and by that meaning you can read and write, why make an irrational exception to support an obvious outlaw like Dr.Chee, who only fight for his political survival and not for our society's survival, such as increasing our wealth, job creation and improving on social needs and necessities?</p>

              <p>Is Dr Chee an outlaw who has done any damage to Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Or is the outlaw not already in office in the willful ways that have been described that have repeated hurt Singapore for the last 52 years - or are you selectively blind ?</p>
              <p>Is support for Dr Chee irrational, or are you playing politics safely by standing with the crowd that prefer to play it dishonest safe and wait for the crumbs to fall off the from the main table ?</p>
              <p>Are you deliberately ignorant, or are you to amateurish to clearly expose your real purpose with your slanted propaganda to undermine the efforts of Dr Chee's clear agenda that has been well publicised ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that you are in a willfull denial mode to the economic, educational, social and political reforms that Dr Chee had clearly written in all his books since 1992.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that you will prefer to indulge in propagating your ignorance by taking the center stage by pretending to be a bystander - when you are nothing more then a PAP wolf pretending to be a disinterested citizen.</p>
              <p>At least the resident Drama Queen in this Speaker's Corner is more honest with his fence squatting posture.</p>

              <p>The time was there to make a difference, but many became mere onlookers.</p>
              <p>When events overwhelmed them, and Singaporeans succumbed to the ruthless methods employed by LKY towards those who openly supported J.B. Jeyaretnam - many Singaporeans preferred to sell their souls to the devil for the few material benefits given in return to upgrade neighborhoods - in exchange for the political rights forgone.</p>

              <p>Is Dr Chee an outlaw who has done any damage to Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Or is the outlaw not already in office in the willful ways that have been described that have repeated hurt Singapore for the last 52 years - or are you selectively blind ?</p>
              <p>Is support for Dr Chee irrational, or are you playing politics safely by standing with the crowd that prefer to play it dishonest safe and wait for the crumbs to fall off the from the main table ?</p>
              <p>Are you deliberately ignorant, or are you to amateurish to clearly expose your real purpose with your slanted propaganda to undermine the efforts of Dr Chee's clear agenda that has been well publicised ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that you are in a willfull denial mode to the economic, educational, social and political reforms that Dr Chee had clearly written in all his books since 1992.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that you will prefer to indulge in propagating your ignorance by taking the center stage by pretending to be a bystander - when you are nothing more then a PAP wolf pretending to be a disinterested citizen.</p>

              <p>Those Catholics succumbed to the abusive bullying and threats from ISD controlled by LKY, and were released only after they signed false statements admitting to the accusation that were made without any evidence.</p>
              <p>Why was Chia Thye Poh released without giving any undertaking - whether verbal or written in the same manner as the Catholic Activists ?</p>

              <p>If Singapore had you in the 1950s, will we have class acts of heroism with names like Lim Bo Seng, Elizabeth Choy, Tan Kar Kee and the other early pioneers ?</p>
              <p>Even JBJ was derided with the worst name calling efforts by an insecure LKY - if we follow your naive ignorance in accepting the Bible truth of LKY's opinions - should we not slap you back to conciousness, when suddenly LHL praised JBJ for being a true Singaporean for his determined efforts ?</p>
              <p>Outlaw today when it is convenient, and a Hero tomorrow when it suits your agenda ?</p>
              <p>Labels cannot hide the truth of the political agenda.</p>
              <p>Read the agenda of the SDP and see how much efforts have been made by their members to move in the direction of the stated agenda.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> If you compare what Dr Chee had written in his books since 1992, and compared his ideas with the PAP changes made to the education policies and some economic directions taken in Year 2002 and 2003 - you will perhaps be more discerning with your views.</p>
              <p>More then eight years had passed, and at least two generation of Singaporeans had to endure the consequences of failed policies that stubbornly lasted through two recession in 1987 and 1992.</p>
              <p>Without much fanfare, the changes were made - and CSJ's vindication was ignored and obviously not acknowledged - least of all by the PAP leadership and their lackeys</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should your ignorance and hypocrisy be recognised in your ability to slant new ways to view the reality ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, you cannot be vital to the future of Singapore, when your opinion is clearly supporting the legalised outlaw activities of those currently in office, whose actions are designed to rape common sense, and legitimately steal from the Citizens.</p>
              <p>If Dr Chee is made to be an outlaw, it is designed by the outlaws who hold the keys to the legislature by deceit and guile.</p>
              <p>Was Chia Thye Poh a Communist like those 22 Catholic Activists who were accused by LKY to be "Marxist Conspirators"  ?</p>
              <p>Those 22 Catholics succumbed to the bullying and blackmail from ISD controlled by LKY, and were released after they signed false statements admitting to the accusation that were made without any evidence.</p>
              <p>Why was Chia Thye Poh released without giving any undertaking - whether verbal or written in the same manner as the Catholic Activists ?</p>
              <p>Was Chia a Communist and locked up for 32 years on the statement of one Man ?</p>
              <p>Is your opinion that Dr Chee is an Outlaw valid ?</p>
              <p>The skewed politics practised by LKY and his PAP is designed only for the purpose of perpetuating themselves in monopolising politics, and supporting opinions like yours - dishonestly disguised as mere onlookers is simply disingenious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The circus is already here, and you are already part of the act with LKY as the Circus Master. If he tell you to jump through the hoop, will you not jump ?</p>
              <p>It is only your limited intelligence and inability to be discerning that prevent you from distinguishing between the various shades of White - when your eyesight has been blinded for 52 years bathed in a constant white glow that distort your vision of depths.</p>
              <p>Do you think that LKY will work for the glory of dumb Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you match your reading abilities with those who are more discerning in their interpretations of what they read, or do you depend on the interpretation of what others have read to know the difference ?</p>
              <p>If you beleive that the Police under the control of Wong Kang Seng will be allowed to assist Dr Chee to get his permits speedily, why do you not assist Dr Chee in applying permits on his or SDP behalf ?</p>
              <p>That will save the need for anyone to be an outlaw.</p>
              <p>Or are you only talking from a naivete virginal point of view - like an eager recruit at BMT expert at "singing cock and talking song" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you fail in your achieving your goals to correct some wrongs - are you not determined to pursue the course, or are you the type who will give up in the face of the challenge in going it alone ?</p>
              <p>If Singapore had you in the 1950s, will we have class acts of heroism with names like Lim Bo Seng, Elizabeth Choy, Tan Kar Kee ?</p>
              <p>Even JBJ was derided with the worst name calling efforts by an insecure LKY - if we follow your naive ignorance in accepting the Bible truth of LKY's opinions - should we not slap you back to conciousness, when suddenly LHL praised JBJ for being a true Singaporean for his determined efforts ?</p>
              <p>Outlaw today when it is convenient, and a Hero tomorrow when it suits your agenda ?</p>
              <p>Labels cannot hide the truth of the political agenda.</p>
              <p>Read the agenda of the SDP and see how much efforts have been made by their members to move in the direction of the stated agenda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did PM LHL renegade on his own words in his first speech after being sworn in as PM ? </p>

              <p>The choice is between two outlaws -</p>
              <p>one group of outlaws has got into power by guile and deceit, and stayed for for 52 years, and had begun to milk the treasury, and displaying total indifference and arrogance to the point of being no longer duty bound to be accountable to the electorates, and will begin to scheme to change the voting arrangements by giving two ballot papers to the older generation, and toying with the idea of calling in the "Army" - (not the SAF who was not named) - to intercede in the event of a freak election results;</p>
              <p>the other one was made an outlaw by the outlaws in office, still it has a declared agenda to firstly reform the present skewed institutions by returning to the original Constitution that was drafted with the interests of the electorate; with the basis put in place the Singapore political structures have to be reformed to give confidence for stable and secure growth to the economic, social and political environments; with education reforms that will provide creative minds and develop enterprising spirit that will challenge the status quo; to disenfranchise the government monopolies in stifling private businesses, and liberalise the economy from monopolistic government involvement; to allow an environment that MNCs positively contribute to the social and economic progress for Singapore and not expect Singapore to be a source of cheap labor to meet their profit goals..</p>
              <p>Do you have enough maturity and experience to know what to choose for yourself and future generations ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>At the end of the day, I am only 1 vote against an ocean of votes. If he or his kind ever gets elected, I will respect the choice made by my fellow citizens.

              <p> </p>
              <p>If an election is held with the full participation of every Singaporean registered in the electoral roll, without any gerrymeandering by the PAP, and with the full independence of the Judiciary, Attorney-General's Department and the Police in enforcing the Law equitably without fear or recrimination - any election outcome will be acceptable on such a basis to any fair minded Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, this has been a long forgone conclusion that LKY will never accede to be subjected to the vagaries of such democratic system  </p>

              <p>If the same beliefs had come from the minds of our forefathers, unable to accept the challenges of facing the unknown with an untested leader in LKY, would we have been here today ?</p>
              <p>We are at the edge of the beginning of the 21st Century, and the PAP's worn out ways are beginning to show - with LKY not even clear that his tenous position in 1959, was saved by the single vote of confidence from Dr Toh Chin Chye, that allowed LKY to become the Prime Minister, when the votes were tied equally with his rival Ong Eng Guan -  new challenges are to be faced, can Singapore afford not to allow more voices to be heard as so eloquently said by LHL in his first speech after being sworn in as PM ?</p>
              <p>Can the PAP have the monopoly of ideas only ?</p>
              <p>Is this all about philosophy of freedom ?</p>
              <p>Or is it not about the freedom to recover control from the PAP over the opportunity to be responsible for our own futures, and not to be subjugated to the guilles and cunning political manipulations that legitimised the PAP monopoly in all aspect of Singapore Life ?</p>
              <p>It is quite obvious that you are unable to tolerate differences in ideas and new challenges to the status quo; and despite your guille in adopting a disinterest and being modestly insignificant, your approach is to prevent any alternative views that question the status quo.</p>
              <p>It is Singaporeans like you who will be detrimental to the progress of our new generation.</p>
              <p>Without any ideas of your own for the future - can the future generation have anything to eat when the PAP run itself flat ?</p>
              <p>Are you so confident that the PAP will always have a monopoly of talent ?</p>
              <p>How valid should we position your views - when you have dismissed yourself as being disinterested, and claim yourself to be insignificant in the entire political equation ?</p>

              <p>Even New York City with a population larger than Singapore has only ONE mayor, while Singapore needs more then ONE.</p>

              <p>In his time, JBJ was insulted and driven to the ground by LKY - and it was conscience or for LHL's own karma that JBJ good name was redeemed before his passing.</p>
              <p>CSJ has similarly been derided by LKY for the same determination as JBJ had shown, and with at least more focus then JBJ, which has caused LKY and the PAP to redouble their efforts to protect LHL time in office.</p>

              <p>Freedom to insult and abuse others, claiming fresh and untried outlaw bullshit is good for our society?</p>
              <p>Freedom to praise a politically romantic dead but ineffectual politician wannabe, and lamblast others for saying kind words in obituary of his passing?</p>
              <p>I can go on, but in the end, the more you try to justify your hatred and support for an outlaw, the more ridiculous you become, suspending logic and reason, more so when you need to insult, step over other's heads to be heard, following the example of your beloved outlaw.</p>
              <p>My hand is still reached out, for you are my fellow citizen. Be an opposition party member as is your right and choice. Elevate your party by smearing the present with half truths and lies as is your choice.</p>
              <p>But do be aware that many others will needlessly suffer, not because of 'new and untried' methods to deal with challenges, but rather, made to suffer for the ambitions of outlaw knaves attempting to be rulers, believing themselves above the law, just as you are suffering now by being dishonest to yourself and insulting your own intelligence with your pathetic justifications.</p>

              <p>Yes, brilliant reply considering that you avoided to address the various points given that debunked your myopic positions, and now taking a new tangent.</p>
              <p>Who is creating anarchy ?</p>
              <p>Is this a new idea ?</p>
              <p>The call for the return of the Political Rights to Singapore has been ongoing for more then 52 years - when even LKY had called for this same Rights to be returned by the Colonial Government and from the Malaysian Federal Government.</p>
              <p>Obviously, you prefer to be selectively myopic.</p>
              <p>Was Dr Chee calling for riot to depose of the PAP, or was he challenging the unlawful acts of a PAP dominated Parliament to change the Constitution that disenfranchised Singaporeans  while the PAP hold themselves unaccountable and non-transparent for their actions ? </p>

              <p>Was it disparaging untruths, or are the truths spoken so disparagingly honest ?</p>
              <p>Why should there be others living in difficult times if the PAP had taken measures to prevent such difficult times to fall on Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Are they not supposed to be the elites with the talents and the merits that justify being paid the highest wages amongst all the world government presidents and ministers ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, we will never know if we may not be alive one day or the next, when our CPF savings are continuously prevented from bailing us out in times of joblessness, recessions, and even as we arrived at our retirement age.</p>
              <p>With the CPF withdrawal age continuously being manipulated now to 85 years, and with holding sums continuously increased - and new programs that deduct what little is left in the balance - can Singaporeans be sure that they will get back what they have contributed all their working lives ?</p>
              <p>Under such conditions can we be certain if we can live through one day or the next ?</p>
              <p>If you wish to take on the role of being the mouthpiece and brain for the PAP - perhaps you have all the answers for such concerns ?</p>

              <p>Have you considered that Sweden has the highest social cost in the World that is coupled with the highest tax regimes that created the well publicised high costs - and yet they have a satisfied and happy citizens that have even boosted their birth rates in this 21st Century ?</p>
              <p>Considering that Singaporeans are paying as much as the Swedes in terms of direct and indirect taxes, and a major portion of our wages is paid to the government for all the essential services that the government provide and charge at market rates despite the capital costs being funded from National Reserves - do Singaporeans get as much government support as the Swedes ?</p>
              <p>Does the falling Singapore Birth Rate not tell something, or perhaps your myopia prevent the grey cells from understanding the bigger picture ?</p>

              <p>What are you alluding to with this new bald lie to create some new controversies ?</p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that Dr Chee had lambasted J.B.Jeyeratnam prior to his death and subsequently saying kind words on his passing ?</p>
              <p>Did the PAP say anything kind to JBJ on his passing, other then the belated and minimalist ritualistic words of condolence to the family members of JBJ ?</p>
              <p>If anything humane that came from the PAP to the Jeyeratnam family, it had come only from Goh Chok Tong's personal intervention in writing a letter to both JBJ's son - to be used in their job applicatin to any prospective employers that they should be considered on their own qualification and merit, when most employers had shunned them for the high public profile taken by their controvesial father.</p>
              <p>This focus the degrading level of politics in Singapore as projected by LKY and the PAP in which they operate the pervasive fear element that filter down to the social and commercial world.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore not already being managed by Outlaws who abuse their political powers that will strangle the possibility of anyone making a living for deciding to enter politics and challenge the position of the PAP ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, as a myopic and dull witted supporter of the PAP, you can hardly discern nor will admit to such a Third World Political environment, despite all the glitter of a false image of a First World environment.</p>

              <p>Perhaps the reason for such Third World Politics is due to the fact that the glass and glitter of the First World environment is all a sham that hides the Third World living conditions that continue to exist in the heartlands of Singapore ? </p>

              <p>With your unchallenged and confirmed myopic attitude, we can surely depend on your suggestions that we stay in the status quo when old methods no longer are effective - that has been the PAP's position since 1987.</p>

              <p>The first generation of political leaders know of these circumstance.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately LHL had a cushy upbringing, and even his NSF days were molly-coddled as a "Super White Horse" through special programmes that benefitted him and his fortunate batch; and with the training that did not give him any foundation as an officer leading men in tactical circumstance, but taking a helicopter perspective of training manouvres at BMT to OCS that had prepared him at these early stages for his destined role as a General.</p>
              <p>If the Opposition Members have been made to be an Outlaw - to face the challenges designed by the Outlaws in Power, Singapore would be assured that such a politician has the experience from the challenges designed by the Master Outlaw himself.</p>
