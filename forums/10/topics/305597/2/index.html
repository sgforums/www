              in terms of accessibility and quality.</p>
              <p>When you say HDB flats are out of reach for middle class,

              <p>To the poor, having a cheapo healthcare is always better then having one of
                  the best but out of reach? But then again, why does healthcare need to be
                  expensive in the first place? Think in term of GST. Wasn’t it there so that
                  those willing to spend more fork out more in term of taxation on thing they
                  crave to have rather then on necessity? Why do u have to include GST on healthcare
                  too? Healthcare purchase equipment? Healthcare expenses aren’t something that
                  we can avoid. If we are sick, we have to need the service, period.</p>

              <p>Are u telling me that gov don’t earn for each HDB flat sold? How much does it
                  take to construct a unit of HDB flat? Is construction it in the outskirt any
                  more expensive then constructing it near the town? What is being done to the
                  profit generate from HDB sale of flat in those prime district? Does it goes to
                  the subsidies of flat sold in the outskirt, thus making it alot more cheaper
                  then the construction cost? If it the can increase the cost of prime location
                  10 fold of it construction cost, why cant they reduce the cost of those in the
                  outskirt way below the cost price? Afterall, the purpose of HDB is lower cost
                  affordable housing for every s'porean?</p>

              <p>If u think of foreign worker a source of cheap labour? Why dun we replace
                  all the poor, lower class job with foreign worker? After all, why employ a
                  s'porean when u can just employed a foreigner which are way cheaper and do the
                  work just as good? Wouldnt all s'porean  be rich with no poor s'porean?</p>
              <p>Implementing mini wages is a form of human right protection that help
                  prevent the exploitation of the lower class by the richer one. Dun forget, now
                  that the poor class are being better compensated by their job, hence better
                  equiped with higher spending ability to cope the inflation. On the other hand,
                  a mini wages will significantly reduce the rich ppl profit. Increase in labour
                  cost, hence making us less completive globally? So our wise leaders choose to
                  build our wealth at the suffering of the poor and lower class. Just another
                  classic example like china. Ever wonder what law we have to preventing any
                  company from flooding our country with cheaper foreign worker? Are there any
                  solution to higher labour cost? Look at how the europe
                  done it? But sadly, higher labour cost = slower growth, but defiantly not
                  higher inflation.</p>

              <p>No, I am not in favour off ALL the government policies, however
                  I do not blame the government on why I cant make as much money as
                  others.</p>
              <p>The government policis is always to take care of
                  the average singaporeans either directly (putting money
                  into their hand) or indirectly (creating job, education and
                  opportunities) because rich people doesnt need government's
                  help and they are capable to helping themselves. Plus, PAP doesnt
                  need their vote either because they are all living in uncontested
                  district.</p>
              <p>Several reasons why we are seeing a widening income gap in
                  Singapore because</p>
              <p>a) Booming banking and wealth management industry which
                  benefited Singaporeans, including those belongs to low income
                  family working in the industry</p>
              <p>b) Home owners of enbloc properties (include people
                  who are cash poor) who become sudden millionaire</p>
              <p>c) There is a influx of HNWI into Singapore because of Singapore
                  favourable tax structure (Singapore government didnt make them
                  millionaire and they made their money overseas before the come to
                  singapore)</p>
              <p>d) People who speculated on stocks and properties.</p>
              <p>Singapore income inequility might be similar to philippines, but
                  Singapore lower income is definitely living in better
                  condition than those poor in filipinos.</p>
              <p>Singapore will continue to prosperous as long as Singaporeans
                  are still motivated to be sucessful and its our government job to
                  ensure that they provide Singaporeans the opportunities
                  and tools to do so.</p>
              <p>Government doesnt force older people to works, they only
                  ensure that if you need to work, employer cannot reject you.</p>

              <p><br> You just mention the mean of how people can get rich. But how many can
                  truly achieve that? What happen to those left behind? Dun they deserve to be
                  look after by the gov? If so, does our gov's policy ensure their welfare? If
                  the older people doesnt need to work at old age, do u think the gov need to
                  come up with an older retirement age or force annuity? Why is it that ppl in
                  this category cant look after themselves when they are old?</p>
              <p>The reason is simply, coz spore is run by pro business leaders with priorities in
                  economic growth. With laws the rules that only take care of the
                  rich's pokect. The side effect of that is ton of poor folk, barely able to self feed when gotten old and usless. Most of the lower class are honest folk that once put in 44hrs or more per
                  week till old ages prevent them from doing so. What or how does our gov treat
                  them when their CPF cant feed them? Give them the golden opportunity to work
                  more at the age of 70+ at mere $3.50 at some fast food rest or hawker/ food cout?</p>

                                                    economic inequality has put Lee to the political 
                                                    test, one that is challenging his economic 
                                                    lieutenants to devise ways to redistribute

                                                    laissez-faire capitalist tradition. The formula 
                                                    they've arrived at, however, seems likely to widen 
                                                    rather than bridge the divide. <br><br>In 
                                                    mid-November, Lee announced government plans to

                                                    from 5% to 7%. The tax hike is designed to 
                                                    generate about S$1.5 billion (US$960 million) 
                                                    annually, funds that will be earmarked to develop 
                                                    a more generous social safety net. "It's essential

                                                    of lower-income Singaporeans because globalization 
                                                    is going to strain our social compact," Lee said 
                                                    upon announcing the policy. <br><br>It was an

                                                    Asia's richest countries in the 1980s and 1990s. 
                                                    <br><br>Now, it appears those same policies are 
                                                    disproportionately lifting the top tier of society 
                                                    while leaving a growing number of lower-wage 
                                                    earners in the economic lurch. That trend arguably 
                                                    began with the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis 
                                                    when, government statistics show, the wages of 
                                                    lower-skilled workers fell by about one-third. 
                                                    <br><br>Despite economic recovery, the income gap 
                                                    has continued to widen as Singapore's past 
                                                    advantage in manufacturing industries has been 
                                                    eroded by China and other lower-cost countries in 
                                                    the region. Over the past five years, about 20% of 
                                                    Singapore's households have suffered from 
                                                    declining incomes. And that's arguably starting to 
                                                    take a toll on the PAP's popularity.</p>

                                                    clearly a reaction to those shifting perceptions.

                                                    schemes - known provisionally as "offset packages" 
                                                    - will be announced in February along with the

                                                    welfare schemes introduced. <br><br>Lee has said

                                                    introduced as a one-off measure just weeks before 
                                                    last May's general election - would be employed to 
                                                    redistribute government budget surpluses back to 
                                                    taxpayers. <br><br>The PAP in the run-up to the 
                                                    polls doled out S$150 million of bonuses to about 
                                                    330,000 low-wage earners, representing about 9% of 
                                                    Singapore's population of citizens and permanent 
                                                    residents. That payout anticipated but didn't 
                                                    blunt opposition parties' class-oriented attacks 
                                                    against the PAP-dominated government, claiming it 
                                                    systematically neglected the island state's many 
                                                    low-wage earners. <br><br>The PAP won those polls 
                                                    handily, capturing 82 of 84 parliamentary seats - 
                                                    though the weak opposition has since the 1980s 
                                                    claimed that the election system is structured and 
                                                    regulated in ways that inhibit small parties from 
                                                    fielding candidates, including the requirement 
                                                    that parties must assemble an ethnically balanced 
                                                    six-member committee to contest some electoral

                                                    income-inequality issue was quickly resurrected 
                                                    one month after the elections when a blogger 
                                                    writing under the pseudonym Mr Brown pointedly 
                                                    asked why official data that showed that 20% of 
                                                    national households were suffering from declining 
                                                    incomes were released after rather than before the 
                                                    general polls. <br><br>For his pains, Mr Brown's 
                                                    regular column in the government-owned Today 
                                                    newspaper was brusquely terminated - fueling 
                                                    outrage in Internet chat rooms about the 
                                                    government's heavy-handedness and apparent lack of 
                                                    transparency. Meanwhile, the PAP-led government 
                                                    proposed this month to tighten laws that govern 
                                                    the Internet as part of an overhaul of the 
                                                    national penal code. <br><br>The proposed 
                                                    amendments would hold Internet users liable for 
                                                    statements the government deemed to "cause public 
                                                    mischief" or "wound racial feelings". If passed, 
                                                    the legislation would appear to institutionalize 
                                                    the ban on posting inflammatory political content 
                                                    the government enforced temporarily in the run-up 
                                                    to this year's polls and would give it broad new 
                                                    powers to curtail freedom of expression. 
                                                    <br><br>It's unclear whether public debates over 
                                                    the Internet about the GST rise would be 
                                                    considered "mischievous" under the proposed new 
                                                    rules. Some commentators have already dared to 
                                                    note that raising the consumption tax is by 
                                                    definition regressive and will hit poor households 
                                                    harder than rich ones as they are forced to spend 
                                                    a greater proportion of their income on 
                                                    tax-inflated necessities. <br><br>The Singapore 
                                                    Chinese Chamber of Commerce, a grouping of about 
                                                    4,000 mostly small businesses, likewise took the 
                                                    chance to express its "great concern and 
                                                    disappointment" about the tax hike. That's because 
                                                    the policy has the dual purpose of also covering 
                                                    the expected shortfall in tax revenues that will 
                                                    occur when the government cuts corporate-tax rates 
                                                    from their current level of 20%. It has not yet

                                                    take effect, but Singapore is under growing 
                                                    competitive pressure to reduce its tax rates to 
                                                    remain attractive to foreign investors. <br><br>To 
                                                    justify his government's corporate-tax cut, Lee 
                                                    recently said in parliament that developing Baltic 
                                                    nations such as Latvia and Lithuania levy a flat 
                                                    15% tax on corporations. More to the competitive 
                                                    point, Hong Kong's top personal income-tax rate is 
                                                    currently 16%, a full 4 percentage points lower 
                                                    than Singapore's rate. <br><br>"Such a reduction 
                                                    would only benefit profitable companies and not

                                                    the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce said in 
                                                    a statement. <br><br>The unspoken subtext is that

                                                    in effect shift the tax burden from big companies 
                                                    to ordinary citizens, particularly lower-income

                                                    Lee's government appears to have shaken its

                                                    on board providing long-term state assistance to a 
                                                    large cross section of the population. Singapore 
                                                    currently does not impose minimum wages, nor are 
                                                    there state-backed pension plans as in many 
                                                    Western countries. In nanny-state fashion, each 
                                                    Singaporean is currently compelled by law to set 
                                                    aside a certain proportion of his or her income 
                                                    for retirement purposes. <br><br>The government 
                                                    insists it will fashion the new assistance schemes 
                                                    in a way that avoids institutionalizing the

                                                    parliament: "I would like to caution members that 
                                                    we should proceed with care ... it is a real 
                                                    slippery slope. And many, many social-welfare 
                                                    schemes which have ended up in serious trouble 
                                                    have started off with good intentions." 
                                                    <br><br>Notwithstanding those words, the scale of 
                                                    the proposed changes suggests a fundamental 
                                                    philosophical shift for the PAP. That's largely 
                                                    because the growing chorus of complaints about the 
                                                    widening income gap has grown politically too loud 
                                                    to ignore.</p>
              <p><br><strong>Entrenched elitism</strong> <br>The issue is also significantly tied to 
                                                    growing public perceptions about elitism among PAP 
                                                    members of parliament (MPs) and their family 
                                                    members - a perceived social arrogance and 
                                                    economic selfishness that increasingly sticks in 
                                                    the craw of many Singaporeans, particularly among 
                                                    low-wage earners. <br><br>Sin Boon Ann, a PAP MP, 
                                                    recently highlighted the danger of class conflict 
                                                    in a speech to parliament. "The perception exists 
                                                    that Singapore is a society bifurcated between the 
                                                    elites and the commoners, the scholars and the 
                                                    normal streams, the gifted and the ordinary, the

                                                    owner, the rich and the poor," the parliamentarian 
                                                    said. It is necessary to "break down the 
                                                    institution of snobbery within our society", he 
                                                    said. <br><br>He spoke amid a surge in 
                                                    cyber-criticism aimed at PAP MP Wee Siew Kim. In a

                                                    blogosphere, Derek Wee (no relation to the 
                                                    parliamentarian) wrote in his blog on October 12 
                                                    about his economic insecurities as he approached 
                                                    middle age. He opined that Singapore's liberal 
                                                    immigration policies were putting his job at risk, 
                                                    and he urged the government to be more 
                                                    understanding of ordinary citizens' plight. 
                                                    <br><br>An 18-year-old girl in her own blog 
                                                    replied and disparaged Derek Wee's concerns, 
                                                    saying, "If you're not good enough, life will kick 
                                                    you in the balls ... There's no point in 
                                                    lambasting the government for making our society 
                                                    one that is, I quote, 'far too 
                                                    survival-of-fittest'. <br><br>"If uncertainty of

                                                    poor and miserable," the young blogger added. She 
                                                    went on to refer to Derek Wee as "one of many

                                                    in our country", and rounded off her attack by 
                                                    telling him to "get out of my elite uncaring 
                                                    face". <br><br>It was quickly discovered that the

                                                    less-known PAP MP, demonstrating to many Internet 
                                                    users that Singapore's highly touted meritocracy 
                                                    was being undermined by an intolerant elitism at 
                                                    the top. Her name, "Wee Shu Min", rocketed to the 
                                                    top of keyword searches in Singapore as measured 
                                                    by Technorati.com. <br><br>Her father, Wee Siew 
                                                    Kim, later unapologetically waded into the 
                                                    controversy. "I think if you cut through the

                                                    reasonable," he told the government-controlled 
                                                    Straits Times newspaper, adding: "Some people

                                                    language, so she ought to learn from it." 
                                                    <br><br>It is against this ferment that Lee's 
                                                    government is now emphasizing the need for 
                                                    long-term social support for the poor, and at the

                                                    the Internet. Yet Lee's tax reforms and welfare 
                                                    promises are unlikely to bridge quickly the divide

              <p>I haven't been paying attention to the budget previously.</p>
              <p>However my assumption is that it is used to fund policy.</p>
              <p>For example if the government believes there should be more computers in public schools, they would set the budget for education accordingly. Or if they felt that teacher'ss salaries needed to be increased to keep up the number of teachers from leaving to join the private sector etc.</p>
              <p>Simply setting aside money for education without a policy to back it up may result in the money going to other things like beautiful gardens or expensive decorative sculptures.</p>
              <p>Even if there was a policy, eg computers, the schools may purchase expensive specialized equipment and limit it's use to a few students or buy generic computers and and allow access to as many students as possible.</p>
              <p>I think looking at the budget without looking at the policies that shape it is pretty pointless.</p>

              <p><br>I believe this is the first budget after the GST hike and I think the government should finish last year with a surplus again because of the booming property industry and revenue related to tourism and income tax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am pretty sure the hot topic of discussion will be how to fund the aggressive MRT rail expansion which government annouced recently. I think drivers will have to be prepared to pay more for ERP because that seems to be the only growing revenue for LTA at the moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope government will offer more scholarship and funding for post grad education. In time for recession (if it happen) it will be the best time to study.</p>

              <p>After reading the cut and paste of Alex Au's article. I think the PAP had better look into Mr. Wee Siew Kim's remarks.</p>
              <p>If the government backs him while this controversy is going on, they're likely to lose a lot of sympathy and erode the faith of the people that they are working so hard for. </p>
              <p>And that may translate to lost votes. </p>

              <p>In the first place, the money comes from our tax-payer's hard-earned money.
