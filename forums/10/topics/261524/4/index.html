Just admit the error and do not mislead. Otherwise, prove how you got this figure.<br><br>First error: S$149.3 billion / yr. There's no such thing as per year. Income revenue changes from year to year.<br><br>Second error: The correct figure should be A$185 billion.<br><br>Allow me to explain the concept of benefits to you. Since we are referring to budget and income tax in this topic, benefits simply refers to all social, economic, health, education etc inputs as stated in the budget. This is located under "interest expense", "capital transfers" and "current transfers".<br><br>Let me explain to you the benefits/tax ratio.<br><br><strong>Australia:</strong><br><br>Their income tax revenue for 2006-2007 is <span style="color: blue;">A$185 billion</span>.<br><br><a href="http://www.budget.gov.au/2006-07/myefo/html/03_part_3-03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.budget.gov.au/2006-07/myefo/html/03_part_3-03.htm</a> Table 7<br><br>The benefits input for 2006-2007 is <span style="color: blue;">A$144 billion</span><br><br><a href="http://www.budget.gov.au/2006-07/myefo/html/03_part_3-09.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.budget.gov.au/2006-07/myefo/html/03_part_3-09.htm</a><br>Table 14<br><br><strong>Benefit/tax ratio: 0.78</strong> (2 dec pl)<br><br>Singapore:<br><br>Their income tax revenue for 2006 is <span style="color: red;">S$13.8 billion</span>.<br><br><a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/revenue_expenditure/attachment/Revenue_Estimates.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/revenue_expenditure/attachment/Revenue_Estimates.pdf </a><br><br>The benefits input for 2006-2007 is <span style="color: red;">S$10.6 billion</span><br><br><a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/revenue_expenditure/attachment/Expenditure_Estimates.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/revenue_expenditure/attachment/Expenditure_Estimates.pdf </a><strong><br>(Pg 6 of 8 )<br><br>Benefit/tax ratio: 0.77</strong> (2 dec pl)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">According to the budget of the two governments, for every A$1 of tax the Australians pay, they receive A$0.78 in return.

Oh, I forgot that our civil service is one of the highest paid in the world. People don't praise the social and edcuational benefits there for nothing.<br><br>I have asked you:<br><br>1) to explain your figure of S$149.3 b but you kept pushing the ball to me. Can't you see that I need to have a look at your explanation before I commence my benefit/tax ratio presentation??<br><br>I can only speculate that you have gotten the wrong figure but are too proud to admit.<br><br>2) I genuinely and sincerely ask you to prove the "naysayers" wrong and you mistake it for aggression. Since you have dug out the information, why not carry it through to the end? Perhaps you are afraid of a sinister attack from me.<br><br>3) I believe you are trying to corner me by asking me to explain the term "benefits". Well, it's really simple. Refer to my explanation above.<br><br>Please do not misunderstand me; I do not argue for the sake of arguing. If I'm wrong, I'm ready to face the truth....unlike you. Have you forgotten my advice to you before? Refer below.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I have nothing to prove and given any other day, I will still beat you.......for your desire to prove one wrong is greater than your hunger for the truth."</span><br><br>Do try to channel your energy for better uses like responding to my post on HDBs and retirement here.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=261207" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=261207</a><br><br>Thanks and appreciate your effort.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all , Gazelle does not live in Australia. So you all have to forgive him for his ignorance.<br><br>Second of all, I have an accountant who fills in my tax forms . Where it comes to taxes , Australia is quite liberal in the sense that they allow you to claim back anything related to work and study - yes that includes phone bills.<br><br>Third, in witholding tax from me , my employer has to add on the medicare levy ( free healthcare) - approx 680+per year of the tax I pay but I can be sure that  I got something to fall back on if I cannot afford private health insurance anymore. And I claim back rebates on my private health insurance as well as get one free new spects every year and twice yearly dental checkups courtesy of Medibank Private.<br><br>Fourth , they recently changed the rules on superannuation - they won't tax the amount coming out when you are over a certain age and the govt pays 1.5 dollars per dollar you put into your super - at least that is what I see in my super statement.<br><br>Fifth, if I have kids , I probably send them to private schools but the public schooling system is good to fall back on.<br><br>Sixth , I was warded for 6 days in an Australian Hospital for pneumonia- 1 day in a high dependency unit - bill is ......$0. In Singapore, I more than likely pay like shit for it. Of course, the metropolitan public hospital is not as high tech as SGH but their technology is still consider ok  and their rooms are like your B1 class.</div>
