Fake claim I suppose?<br><br></div></blockquote>My mistake because I never earnt 36k before in Australia - in Singapore I would earn less than 36k- maybe 30k at the time of my departure. Yes ,both sides still pay taxes.<br><br>Ok so 36 k in Australia , you pay 6660 dollars worth of taxes. In Singapore , 30k , you pay 3500 worth of taxes. What can you claim back in Australia vs Singapore in benefits?<br><br>However if you note the part about me having student ship and with a good accountant in Australia- you can claim back everything.  If let's say , I took up unsubsidised study which cost me 6k per year and I claim for every expense in my study. So in total my course fee and my expenses are 6660 and IF I earnt 36k - my tax would have been 6660 dollars but because I paid it up in full - my tax is utterly offset. It is legal and it has been done by quite a few people I know. Get over it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. Tax is offset.<br><br>Singapore,  you can claim course fees only up to 3.5k. Tax offset but if your course costs 8k - you only got back ...what 3.5k? 4.5k your own money .<br><br>Then let's talk doctor fees- Australia medicare rebate - pays up to 31 dollars for a doctor's consultantation. I offset my cost of seeing a doctor.<br><br>In Singapore, doctor charges you 31 dollars. You have to pay without the benefit of a medicare rebate. Heck you still have to pay in Polyclinic .<br><br>Then if you get hit by a car, you have to stay in the ICU, HDU and then general ward for 10 days. In Australia, public health system - 0 dollars. In Singapore, get to know a cardiothoracic surgeon because the bill will probably give you a heart attack. Ok lets say B2 - so you have to pay 5k in total (guestimate). No security there - the government will chase you for payment.<br><br>Now let's talk property- in Australia - you have no taxes to pay on your principal residence so you can buy a one million dollar house and not worry about property tax. That is legal and that is what I am doing - not worrying about my property. In Singapore - I think still must pay property tax of 4% regardless of income right?<br><br>So let's say - if my property in Australia is 350k , and it is my principal residential address. I pay nothing.<br>In Singapore, you still pay taxes on what the government calls annual value.<br><br>Then let's talk study and work related equipment. Under ATO's rules, you can claim anything you bought for study or work.<br><br>In Singapore, $0 claiming of items you bought for study or work.<br><br>So ....pay higher in Australia - for me it is worthit with the security net in place.  But in Singapore , you are a 36k a year worker - yes your tax is lower, you pay for your own healthcare and you pay property tax, not forgetting that you cannot claim for your work/study equipment , you pay GST on those.  You lose your job , you still have to freaking pay property tax. <strong>Even after tax in Australia , I still earn more than what I earn in Singapore. HAHAHA</strong><br><br>I have never escaped taxation in Australia. I just continue to study and then offset my taxes this way. <strong>My pay in Australia has never been in the lower tier of taxation. </strong>It has been near the mid- top tier brackets-so I don't get away from paying income tax at all.<br><br>And ya , if I was in Singapore, I don't have earning power with the pathetic pay I would have got there. Don't believe? Go ask Ged or Rhonda how often I fly from Canberra to Melb. HAHAHAHA<br><br>As far as I know, I go to an accountant so that I don't get screwed by ATO for filing anything that should not be claimed.<br><br>This is ATO's territory. And they are like the IRS of America.<br><br></div>
