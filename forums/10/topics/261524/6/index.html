            <div class='col-md body'>To: Gazelle (the panties sniffing dog)<br><br>fymk has already told us the benefits of living in Australia, I think fymk would provide the best possible opinion on the situation.<br><br>You don't live there and you will never qualify to live there, so let's face it, you will never understand the benefits of living there. You are akin to a person who read a book on driving a car (theoretical aspects), never driven a car before, but tries to analyse the practicality of driving a car. How quaint.<br><br>Knowing your style, you will persist in continuing with your losing argument regardless of the evidence provided.<br><br>1) There is no basis for comparison, you are comparing apples with oranges. The best part is, you don't even eat oranges (you don't live there, don't even understand their system) and you are trying to pass judgement on it.<br><br>2) How the Australian government decides to fund their free healthcare and free education is not within the scope of this discussion. It's about free education and free medical care, which fymk has already elaborated to us, it's free.<br><br>You are trying to extrapolate into the future, about the Australian government's ability to provide free healthcare and free education in the future. Which to my understanding will never ever be accurate, how the future will churn out, we will never know, unless you are god. Each system has it ways of working around the figures, like Germany who has a high unemployment rate , though the rate might be high for us, it's considered a natural rate (in economic terms) for them, they have had high unemployment rate for decades, yet they are the world's second largest in surpluses. Hell!!! You don't even live in Australia, you have never lived in Australia, from the looks of it, you will never live in Australia (who would want a liability in their country), how does it concern you.<br><br>I think you will go on ranting like a madman as usual, not wanting to succumb to being defeated. Happy chatting to yourself, I am withdrawing from this thread, rather spend my time doing something useful than trying to make dogs understand logic.</div>

Anything below 36k is non taxable in Australia . If I get Singaporean type of shitty pay in Australia -then  I don't pay tax in Australia. I pay heavier taxes because of my current salary but after tax, I still earn twice  what I would earn in Singapore ....So really........<br><br>B. Can't remember - I think I paid about 1k .

If you stop by Australia - go to their national library and request for copies of their portfolio budget statements - be aware , one department may have a 500 page long account of how they administer the funds from taxpayer money and into what programs and what outcomes .<br><br>This is in accordance with the Financial Management Act (FMA) and all departments have to undergo senate estimates twice a year ( which means they have to justify their spending to the senators). I can tell you that their senate estimates is not wayang kulit because senators from the ruling party and opposition parties are in it . The opposition party senators tend to ask alot of questions. If any of you want to see how transparent this process is , go to www.aph.gov.au and then type "senate estimates" in the search form- have a look at their transcripts.<br><br>B. I am not qualified to answer that. Only a qualified economist will be able to answer that.<br><br>C. Australians do not pay their ministers million dollar payouts - any ruling party tries to do that - there will be a risk that they will be voted out the next round.  An Australian has a right to social security , health and education. This is what they believe in and I am not complaining .</div>

It is all about elitist class and owning a second hand audi does not qualify you into that class . Second hand audis are nothing but an overpriced status symbol for those who cannot afford first hand audis in Singapore and in fact cheap in Australia - buy yourself a custom ordered rolls royce phantom in Singapore then you can talk . Don't talk so much.<br><br>If Singapore govt is smart to reward people who have the drive to succeed in life, then the Australian government is a genious to create an environment to attract truly talented people who are already successful in their life as well as nurture their local talents on home ground . As much as you like to laugh at Australia for being slacker country , Australians are known for their biomedical industry ( heard of the bionic ear? Heard of CSL which produces vaccine?) , don't be too arrogant.<br><br>If you want to be a slacker in life in Australia, you are setting yourself up for failure . However under current immigration rules , I don't see "slacker " occupation as one of the wanted. It is not easy to come to Australia but it is easy to build your wealth in Australia once you are already in.</div>
