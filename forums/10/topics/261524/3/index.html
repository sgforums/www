It's a  FACT, because low income Australians and unemployed Australians don't pay for medical care and education. It's available to all Australians. Unlike Singapore, if you don't have any CPF or money, think you are left to bide your time.</div>

Can you please provide both countries future expenses to make the comparison? I reiterate, your topic is "Free Education and Medical Care: Fact or Myth?". As I do not have a crystal ball like you, to gaze into the future, I cannot tell you what the future will be. With your crystal ball, you can make a 100% assessment of the future, highly remarkable. Can your crystal ball tell us which counter on the SGX will go up tomorrow?<br><br>b) Anything can pan out in the future, unless you are gods like P?P, then your predictions will be reality.<br><br>c) Not necessary, as cost can decrease over time too. Just like the cost of handphones in the 1990s as compared to now.<br><br>d) Do you have the figures to make this stake this claim? Please provide the relevant data, that states that the "working class population is shrinking". NPNT.</div>
