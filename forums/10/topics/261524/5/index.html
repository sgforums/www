Then what? we going to get into a debate about income distribution again to see which country has more happy people? Gimme a break.. I think we have already established that the free health care is not a myth, it just has a selected target population segment. The more money you make, the more you give back to society, fair in my book.<br><br>Which again brings about another whole new topic or can of worms about Singapore's economic environment being more beneficial to the rich...</div>
