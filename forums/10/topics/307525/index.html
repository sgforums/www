              <p><strong>Clarissa Oon <br>Wed, Feb 13, 2008<br>The Straits Times</strong> </p>
              <p> <br>SINGAPORE is losing about 1,000 of its best and brightest every year and the numbers are growing, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said, sounding the alarm on the severity of the brain drain.</p>
              <p>And the main magnet for these talents is not regional powerhouse China, but the United States and other developed English-speaking countries, he told the United Press International news agency in an interview earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Citing figures of Singaporeans who gave up their citizenship and took out their savings and CPF funds, he said this meant 'losing about, at the top end, 1,000 a year, which is about - if you take the top 30 per cent of the population - about four or five per cent'.</p>
              <p> <br>Mr Lee believes this exodus could only grow because 'every year, there are more people going abroad for their first or second degree'.</p>
              <p>Some of these Singaporean talents head for China, but return eventually because, at the end of the day, they do not want to compete with the Chinese, he said.</p>
              <p>'You go to China, you're going to compete against 1,300 million very bright fellows, hardworking, starving. Do you stand a chance to be on top of that pole? No.'</p>
              <p>'But if you go there as a Singaporean with a different base, speaking English which they can't, with connections to the world, then you've got a different platform.'</p>
              <p>In comparison, the pull of US is difficult to reverse, he said, noting that American firms recruited bright Singaporean students straight out of universities there.</p>
              <p>After acclimatising to life and work in the US, 'if they decide to take the Green Card and settle in America, then I think we've lost them', said Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans who do not want the stiff competition in the US go to Australia and Canada, he added.</p>
              <p>The brain drain has been a regular issue addressed by MM Lee, who has repeatedly said that this is Singapore's Achilles heel.</p>
              <p>To stem this loss of talent, Singapore has wooed many top professionals from China and India here, he said.</p>
              <p>The draw for the Chinese is that their children can learn both English and Chinese, while the Indians like Singapore because it is close to home, yet a step up in terms of First World infrastructure.</p>
              <p>'The trouble is many of the Chinese then use us as a stepping stone to go to America, where the grass is greener.'</p>
              <p>'But even if we only keep 30 to 40 per cent and lose 60 to 70 per cent, we're a net gainer,' he said. He said, however, that the Chinese would cease to come in 20 to 30 years' time, when China's living standards rise to match Singapore's.<br> </p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Lee Kuan Yew says, Singapore is losing about 1,000 capable people every year.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>In the state owned and controlled
                  newspaper, the Straits Times, with a picture of his looking very grim,
                  in their report of Feb 14, 2008, Lee Kuan Yew, the dictator of the one
                  party state of Singapore says " S'pore losing about 1,000 capable
                  people every year".<br><br>For a small country of 3 million people, a
                  loss of highly talented people at this rate and such numbers;
                  emigrating to Western countries permanently; means nothing less than
                  disaster for the island state.<br><br>I do not think Mr. Lee needs to
                  be reminded of the reasons for educated Singaporeans wanting to flee
                  the island, but let me do it anyway.<br><br>The primary reason is Lee
                  Kuan Yew himself.</p>
              <p>Today Singaporeans look upon him as a thief who
                  steals from his people no less than $3.7 million a year which he calls
                  salary; five times more money than the President of the United States
                  is paid.<br><br>This theft is perpetrated also by all his family
                  members and his chosen ministers. This is bribery and corruption at
                  unprecedented levels unknown in the world; sufficient even to exceed
                  that of the criminal Suharto and Mobutu of the Congo who stole the
                  country’s diamonds.<br><br>Singaporeans hate his arrogance. He goes
                  around the world making speeches to heads of state and captains of
                  industry who are unaware of the real tragedy that is Singapore;
                  deceived into thinking that since it has such a fine waterfront
                  resplendent with glass and crystal office towers; that Singapore is one
                  great success and he is the one who has made it possible.<br><br>Little
                  do they know that in Singapore almost 40 % of the people do not pay any
                  income tax because their wages are too little? Little do they know that
                  there is widespread poverty while only the top of society, well
                  connected with the government enjoy unimaginable wealth?<br><br>Singaporeans
                  see him as a cruel ruthless heartless unscrupulous person who
                  eliminates his political opposition with not a single modicum of human
                  decency. A totally ruthless unscrupulous person; that is how people see
                  him. And they hate him. They look at him not as gentlemen, but more as
                  gangster. Even some gangsters have some sense of decency about them. He
                  has none.<br><br>Examples are of course what he does to people such as
                  JB Jeyaretnam and Dr. Chee Soon Juan. He knows that these men have not
                  broken any law whatsoever, not maligned him in any way whatsoever; but
                  had just engaged in normal political activity.<br><br>But because he is
                  unable and incapable of challenging them in a fair debate, he gets
                  corrupted judges such as Judge Belinda Ang to award false judgments,
                  crippling awards of hundreds of thousands of dollars against them; with
                  the sole intent of bankrupting them so that they cannot contest
                  elections as bankrupts; and has them bankrupted.<br><br>Not only that,
                  as long as they continue in their political activity, he repeatedly
                  strikes, attacks with repeated defamation actions, like a black mamba
                  of the African plains, repeatedly attacking his victims using his
                  corrupt judges such as Judge Belinda Ang as the snakes with the deadly
                  venom.<br><br>And what do you think Singaporeans think of him after this? Nothing more than a plain and simple shameless bully.<br><br>And
                  how do you think young capable educated Singaporeans look upon the
                  vital institutions of the country itself, the judiciary, the civil
                  service, the police force and the professions after he has dealt with
                  them?<br><br>He, Lee Kuan Yew has managed to discredit each of these
                  institutions resulting in their total loss of all credibility and
                  respect. Singaporeans can plainly see corrupt judges, paid
                  astronomically high salaries which is nothing less than corruption;
                  routinely using the law to eliminate his opponents. They see the
                  politicized civil service giving favors to Lee's friends and cronies
                  and punishing non supporters.<br><br>Singaporeans can see now that the
                  country has already been destroyed by this man. No self respecting
                  honorable young man would want to be a lawyer in Singapore; since it is
                  not ability but political connections that decide success and failure.<br><br>It
                  is not possible to excel in the law by hard work, since there is no
                  longer rule of law. The law is what pleases Lee Kuan Yew. It is the
                  same in every other profession, all politicized, all neutralized; all
                  brought under the heel of this demented power hungry tyrant.<br><br>It
                  takes a very dishonest young man or woman to want to remain in
                  Singapore and succeed in a professional career, because it means
                  sucking up to this man and his policies no matter how repugnant to
                  justice and fairness.<br><br>Of course, in any society you have those
                  who will do anything for money, but these are few. Such men would stay
                  behind, join his party and sing his tune, hoping that in the end the
                  goodies will eventually come.<br><br>But thankfully, such dregs of
                  society are few. The vast majority of upright men and women want to
                  succeed by themselves under their own steam; without any need for Lee
                  Kuan Yew. The vast majority want to experience life, not the sheltered
                  quid pro quo of life that Lee Kuan Yew has to offer. Any young man with
                  qualifications would want to see how good he is in the open world where
                  people are judged by their abilities, not because they are card
                  carrying members of Lee Kuan Yew's party.<br><br>Singapore is now seen
                  today by Singaporeans as a country with an arrogant gangster at the top
                  talking down to his subjects; bullying his political opponents and
                  suing them using his corrupt judges such as Belinda Ang; a country
                  which no longer has the rule of law; no respectable public institutions
                  and which has become a laughing stock of the world.<br><br>A country
                  that prohibits chewing gum penalizes pornography but allows
                  prostitution. A country that hangs petty drug mules but metes out a
                  lenient 10 year sentence for man who chopped up his wife with a meat
                  cleaver in the public in Toa Payoh!<br><br>There are those, less
                  fortunate without tertiary qualifications, unable to leave Singapore,
                  even though they detest Lee Kuan Yew and his government. But why should
                  an educated highly talented person remain in Singapore; when if he
                  spoke his mind in criticism of Lee Kuan Yew; he will be sued for
                  defamation of character with trumped up charges and bankrupted. There
                  is no need for him to take such nonsense. He prefers to be free, so he
                  leaves for the United States.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew is fooling himself in
                  thinking that Communist Chinese from China that he imports in large
                  numbers and some Indians from India can replace those native born
                  highly educated young Singaporeans who leave.<br><br>Young Singapore born and educated, young men and women are vastly superior to these imports from overseas.<br><br>Firstly
                  foreigners who come have no idea of the history politics and social
                  culture of the island. They are only able to do jobs that they are told
                  without any background understanding of the country itself like native
                  born Singaporeans.<br><br>Neither do they have the loyalty or roots in
                  Singapore that native born Singaporeans have. Their culture and outlook
                  to life are completely different from Singaporeans.<br><br>It would have made no difference to them had they gone to any other country other than Singapore.<br><br>These
                  foreigners, lacking a true understanding of the country, will continue
                  to erode the effectiveness of the administration, until after a time,
                  with almost no Singaporean administrators at the top, Singapore will
                  change completely to become another third world Philippines or another
                  Peoples Republic of Communist China.<br><br>If Lee Kuan Yew is serious
                  about the welfare of Singapore, then he should stop stealing $3.7
                  million from his people every year; stop filing defamation of character
                  lawsuits against political opponents; replace Judge Belinda Ang with
                  honest judges; reverse the judgments against Dr. Chee and JB Jeyaretnam
                  and return their money illegally collected in defamation of character
                  awards and allow Dr. Chee to speak freely.<br><br>If you do all this,
                  Dr. Chee Soon Juan will perhaps become the Prime Minister and if that
                  happens, educated Singaporeans from all over the world will return to
                  help and work for the future of Singapore. When Singaporeans leave
                  Singapore, it is not because they hate Singapore; it is because they
                  hate Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>If you allow educated Singaporeans to speak
                  freely, to interact freely, to think and debate and discuss freely
                  without the fear of defamation actions and bankruptcy, you will be
                  surprised to see what educated Singaporeans can do for Singapore.<br><br>It is quite certain that with your arrogance and greed, you cannot allow Singapore to become a democracy.<br><br>As
                  you are 85 years old, not only will you die soon, but your son whom you
                  placed as Prime Minister will fail out of incompetence and Singapore
                  will be seriously damaged.<br><br>Alas, this is the fate of countries
                  when rulers become greedy, stubborn and unscrupulous all over the world
                  and throughout history. But what is worse is that the fall will be all
                  the more precipitous in a small country with only 3 million people,
                  without natural resources, without sufficient land or without educated
                  people. They are leaving at the rate of 1,000 per year and increasing
                  by the day!<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              to see how good he is in the open world where people are judged by
              their abilities, not because they are card carrying members of Lee
              Kuan Yew's party.<br> <br> Singapore is now seen today by Singaporeans as a country with an
              arrogant gangster at the top talking down to his subjects; bullying
              his political opponents and suing them using his corrupt judges
              such as Belinda Ang; a country which no longer has the rule of law;
              no respectable public institutions and which has become a laughing
              stock of the world.<br> <br> A country that prohibits chewing gum penalizes pornography but
              allows prostitution. A country that hangs petty drug mules but
              metes out a lenient 10 year sentence for man who chopped up his
              wife with a meat cleaver in the public in Toa Payoh!<br> <br> There are those, less fortunate without tertiary qualifications,
              unable to leave Singapore, even though they detest Lee Kuan Yew and
              his government. But why should an educated highly talented person
              remain in Singapore; when if he spoke his mind in criticism of Lee
              Kuan Yew; he will be sued for defamation of character with trumped
              up charges and bankrupted. There is no need for him to take such
              nonsense. He prefers to be free, so he leaves for the United
              States.<br> <br> Lee Kuan Yew is fooling himself in thinking that Communist Chinese
              from China that he imports in large numbers and some Indians from
              India can replace those native born highly educated young
              Singaporeans who leave.<br> <br> Young Singapore born and educated, young men and women are vastly
              superior to these imports from overseas.<br> <br> Firstly foreigners who come have no idea of the history politics
              and social culture of the island. They are only able to do jobs
              that they are told without any background understanding of the
              country itself like native born Singaporeans.<br> <br> Neither do they have the loyalty or roots in Singapore that native
              born Singaporeans have. Their culture and outlook to life are
              completely different from Singaporeans.<br> <br> It would have made no difference to them had they gone to any other
              country other than Singapore.<br> <br> These foreigners, lacking a true understanding of the country, will
              continue to erode the effectiveness of the administration, until
              after a time, with almost no Singaporean administrators at the top,
              Singapore will change completely to become another third world
              Philippines or another Peoples Republic of Communist China.<br> <br> If Lee Kuan Yew is serious about the welfare of Singapore, then he
              should stop stealing $3.7 million from his people every year; stop
              filing defamation of character lawsuits against political
              opponents; replace Judge Belinda Ang with honest judges; reverse
              the judgments against Dr. Chee and JB Jeyaretnam and return their
              money illegally collected in defamation of character awards and
              allow Dr. Chee to speak freely.<br> <br> If you do all this, Dr. Chee Soon Juan will perhaps become the
              Prime Minister and if that happens, educated Singaporeans from all
              over the world will return to help and work for the future of
              Singapore. When Singaporeans leave Singapore, it is not because
              they hate Singapore; it is because they hate Lee Kuan Yew.<br> <br> If you allow educated Singaporeans to speak freely, to interact
              freely, to think and debate and discuss freely without the fear of
              defamation actions and bankruptcy, you will be surprised to see
              what educated Singaporeans can do for Singapore.<br> <br> It is quite certain that with your arrogance and greed, you cannot
              allow Singapore to become a democracy.<br> <br> As you are 85 years old, not only will you die soon, but your son
              whom you placed as Prime Minister will fail out of incompetence and
              Singapore will be seriously damaged.<br> <br> Alas, this is the fate of countries when rulers become greedy,
              stubborn and unscrupulous all over the world and throughout
              history. But what is worse is that the fall will be all the more
              precipitous in a small country with only 3 million people, without
              natural resources, without sufficient land or without educated
              people. They are leaving at the rate of 1,000 per year and
              increasing by the day!<br> <br> Gopalan Nair</p>

              PM Lee once mentioed during a National day rally speech saying 800 locals migrated to other countries each year.
              
              This time round, MM Lee said 1000 migrated to other countries each year n the trend is worrying considering the fact that he admitted the immgrants using here as a stwpping stone to US or other countries.

              <p>To answer the topic directly, the government has to take part of the blame.</p>
              <p>To address brain drain issue - import more foreign talent. Frankly, I've never seen a better answer than this.</p>
              <p>Does this address the brain drain issue? Yes.</p>
              <p>But does this address the main issue of Singapore losing her citizens? I doubt so.</p>
              <p>And I think part of the answer lies with us. Do we exactly see Singapore as our home?</p>
