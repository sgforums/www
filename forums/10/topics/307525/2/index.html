              <p>To answer the topic directly, the government has to take part of
              the blame.</p>
              <p>To address brain drain issue - import more foreign talent.
              Frankly, I've never seen a better answer than this.</p>
              <p>Does this address the brain drain issue? Yes.</p>
              <p>But does this address the main issue of Singapore losing her
              citizens? I doubt so.</p>
              <p>And I think part of the answer lies with us. Do we exactly see
              Singapore as our home?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No point in importation of second and third class foreign talents at the expense of local talents. </p>
              <p>The part of the answer doesn't lie with locals , it lies with the government and the flow down effect of their policies. It is known that their multimillion dollar salaries and FT policies did not sit well with the populance but still they went ahead and do it.</p>
              <p>Several years back,I asked an MP about the FT policy- he gave some cock and bull twist about Singaporeans shunning jobs that pay lowly. <strong>However when I pointed out that  foreign students recruited by Singapore in our local institutions getting more chances at scholarship than the locals </strong>, he went back to talking about bangladeshi workers. Why? Because he couldn't answer it.</p>
              <p>With no empowerment  and the top down orders from the ivory tower, how do you expect individuals in the community to feel a belonging?</p>

              <p>It now seems like the definitional term of FTs have been expanded to foreign workers who have the same level of skill as locals but can undercut locals easily.</p>

              <p>So now some people see it this way , if Singapore can take in second rate quitters and treat them as talents , they can also apply it to themselves.</p>
              <p>Global competition can go both ways - as much as you can make it cheaper for companies to operate in Singapore by suppressing wages for the common middle class worker, other countries are offering a higher wage than what companies in Singapore will pay - people will definitely go if they have no attachments in Singapore or just plainly got fed up.</p>

              <p>Agree with fymk. Foreign talents should only refer to "Foreigners with skill sets that Singaporean workers lack". The purpose of bringing them in should be to:</p>
              <p>1. Transfer their skill set to Singaporeans</p>
              <p>2. Create more jobs for Singaporeans through a win-win amalgamation of skills</p>
              <p>Bringing in cheap labour to force wages down is a win-lose situation - Singaporeans lose while foreign talents and MNCs gain. Many countries have labour laws that require foreign workers to be paid at least as much as local workers, to prevent exploitation by companies. In Singapore, the government is in cahoots with companies to sucker workers.</p>
