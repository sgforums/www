Has Temasek management that visions to read fine print and true company efficiency and productivity to escape from such potential pitfall due to movements of mega trend?<br><br>To begin with I suggest transferring all extraordinary investment windfalls or profits to safer baskets like people's piggie banks 1 (medishield) 2 (retirements) and 3 (education)<br><br>After all if Singapore is going to be a non-government but business entity, citizens should be paid dividends from investments in various overseas companies.

It's only a matter of following up on news and piecing them together.<br><br>As for the 'version' that you have mentioned. Personally, I don't buy the story of market 'churning' for the new PM.<br><br>Yes. Temasek Holding hold a leading role in shaping of industry standards and superinfrastructural developments in Singapore. But they have been doing so ever since incorporation in 1974.<br><br>In fact, the company had been leading the domestic economic scene when both MM Lee and SM Goh were serving as PM previously, and they will still continue to do so in the times of the new PM - irregardless of name.<br><br>Hence, based on this historical trend, my personal view is that the rumour is unsubstantiated and baseless in objectivity.<br><br>If you were to say that Temasek is extending its claws out for Singapore to gain a leadership position in the global environment, yes then I will share that view.<br><br>But for any single individual amidst the eyes of global business and industry leaders??<br><br>Nah.

Sure the SMEs will face increased challenge, but in our era, there are no longer any avenue for escape away from Globalization.<br><br>The above process is of course not a direct one, but the eventual benefits will flow into SG and potentially benefit us in an indirect manner.<br><br>By participating in foreign superinfrastructural developments via mergers, JVs or whatever we have, Temasek would also have gained first hand knowledge on a foreign government's plans for any selected geographical region.<br><br>When we have access to such infrastructure blueprints - made available either because these had been communicated by the foreign goverment or even drafted up internally by the merged or JV company, we will then KNOW what tricks or changes that our surrounding economic engines might be habouring.<br><br>By knowing the type of investments made, the degree of sophistication, the amount of investments poured in as well as the project's team of international participation, SG as a whole, will then at least have a greater frame of time to be prepared and to pre-empt and disarm any form of potential economic risk/threats to us.<br><br>That, will help to preserve jobs locally.<br><br></div>
