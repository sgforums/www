Is this kind of society where 90% of citizens are bonded or enslaved to their highest mortgage debt called a success in the true sense of success.<br><br>Well leaders have claimed using their controlled press and publicity machinery that they have succeeded. Not quite if there is a genuine election yet. Right now people cannot vote (only 42 % have voted) due to control of election participation under GRC and electoral boundary redrawing with all seats going to one-party to perpetuate one-party rule.<br><br>Democracy has given the advanced countries good lives with citizens actively checking on government leaders and implementation of policies including many Asian countries like Japan, Korea etc. Even Mahathir admitted that other than democracy there is no political system that will give proper check and balances. Theocracy is one that will be led by only a few as well who reads or knows the religious texts.<br><br>Unfortunately it is liable to abuse and tweaking to suit one-party or autocratic rule. If duly recognized and safeguards against current wrong doings and shortcomings introduced, demoracy should continue to do well for Singapore and the rest of the world.</div>
