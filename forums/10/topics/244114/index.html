            <div class='col-md body'>Politics are found everywhere in our daily life. On the road we'll have ERP,Road Tax,Summons. In the house we'll have,PUB,Tv tax,Maintenance Fee.<br>Even in work we have Politics. E.g. The income tax we have to pay yearly!!!<br><br>Those mentioned above are jus some of the issue of chaotic topic we are grumbling about. Why mus pay. and the PAP will tell u mus pay become of tis n tt n those! So ppl named them the Pay and Pay. Soon it wil be, Pay and Perish. They improvise sumth call ERP, ppl call them Everyday Rob People.<br>And again the PUB, english sayin will be Pay Until Broke or other wise wil be Pay Until Bersek!!!<br><br>So many things under this term call "Politics" We've grumbled enough about it everyday,everywhere,every people.<br><br>But now, or rather i shld say, Frm e past till nw. Living was already a hardship, fightin a war against Political issue. But now Loving is already another Issue. OR vice versa, was already an issue in e past.<br><br>Lesbianism and Gayism, not welcome!!! Politics are meant to be define in a terms wit law. But now are they goin to say NO! to Lesbianism n gayism because God made adam( the man) n eve(the woman) a pair? So does it mean that in the Book of Law, states the bible preaching as part of it? OR the goverment discrimniates it? Maybe i shld say NONE of the above i mentioned.<br><br>FAQ starts to run wild in people's mind. Lesbianism n Gayism are ban in Singapore, is it because of Political issue?<br>Many among the crowds are actually lesbians n gays. Or rather bisexual.<br>But of course Straights are common too.<br>Common doesn't means that its NORMAL.<br>Lesbian n Gays  are ban in Singapore because Goverment says, They are not healthy! But why so?<br><br>Gays- Anal sex are ban.(even Straights can't have anal sex!)<br>so many ppl starts to say. Tao Zeng shi si lin eh, ao bei shi zeng hu eh( in front belongs to personal, behinds belongs to goverment)<br>Lesbians-(Havent reali heard of it, will add it in once i come to noe! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>Another reason will be to the Country needs.<br>The live population n e death population.<br>When a life is dead, A man n woman will create another life to replace the death. Thats to equalise the death n live population. So its call "Make Love"<br>Make Love= neturalising the live population (when baby is born)<br><br>Frm this source we are able to supply Singapore with gd human resources.<br>Enough man for NS,Enough woman to create more human.<br>Improvising on this issue, is actually a schme of anti gayism n lesbianism.<br><br>Cause we cant make anything out e same organs we hve.<br>So Love, is once controlled by Goverment with their Political Strategry.<br><br>Accepting Gays n Lesbians=decreasement of HUMAN RESOURCE in e nation.<br>Human Resource=MONEY!!!<br>-psst- thats the onli RICH resources Singapore have, PEOPLE.<br><br>Discrimination about Lesbianism n gayism. Its already a public issue, why are there these kind of Discrimination Pointing Fingers at us. Tellin us its wrong, when the nature have gave us a heart to feel n a brain to tink for wht we are doin. By Following our senses is is wrong too? Does it means that our human rights are all FAKE!! Cause even our Heart n Brain are discrimniated too!<br>Discrimination within the soceity is already an outbreak. Another Chaotic issue will be discrimination when we are at e same boat. Butches to Pure les. Pure les to butches. Butch will say "Boy also nt boy, come out n fight spaces wit us for wht, go get urself a bf la,tis is nt ur cup of tea" Pure les will reply "Traditonal days of lesbians history, A femme girl wit a femme girl, suddenly feel e commitment and love between themselves. Being a lesbian is about Loving ur own gender, nt crossdressing to another opposition gender to make it call LESBIAN. Its e nature of 2 femme girls fallin in love. Not a chao ah qua wit a normal girl,Go plastic surgery if u wanna be a man la! come here act man for wht,Dick also dun have"<br>Same lyk wise, to the gays.<br><br>Then e straights will come n say, "you all are abnormal la, crazy bunch of ppl"<br><br>Come forward n tell me ur views about my post. will be willing to open my ears wide for comments. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
