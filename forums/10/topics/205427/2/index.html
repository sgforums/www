What for?<br><br>I am no politician but a working man. I do not have many facts but I know what I want and what I need.<br></span></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="font-style: italic;">We have many jobs in Singapore and unemployment is not a major problem. We have good housing. Our economy may not be super but it's good enough in that our Sing dollar is stronger than some other currencies</span>.</div></blockquote><br><span style="color: darkred;">Is it not typical of self-congratulatory, self-denial thinking, comparing ourselves with the worst, but never comparing ourselves with the best ?<br><br>Why is the US Dollar as strong as it has been for decades despite having a debt that amounts to trillions ?<br><br>Are there so many jobs that cannot resolve the unemployment at 2.5% of the population ? If this is not a major problem, what else can be a problem for one that has been paid to sing the song of praise ?</span><br><blockquote><br>Letter by Han Fook Kwang, quoted by BillyBong:<br><span style="color: indigo;"><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">We have a low crime rate</span>.</strong> At least I know that I don't fear walking down the street with the thought of being killed or stabbed. So there's no problem with jobs, housing, getting food on the table.<br><br>It's a pretty safe place to live in; no problem in getting big foreign investors to invest and create jobs in our country. So what is the problem?<br></span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Low crime rate - yes in petty thefts, but major crimes such as murder and major white collar million dollar crimes have shot up in 2006, compared to the last two years.<br><br>If <span style="font-style: italic;">'Ah Fook'</span> trying to paint a rosy picture to gain attention for himself and raise his profile to get some political attention from the POWER OF ONE ?<br></span><br><blockquote><br>Letter by Han Fook Kwang, quoted by BillyBong:<br><span style="color: indigo;"><br>Many people say that Singapore is not democratic enough. But which country in the world is truly democratic? I don't think there is one because it's impossible.<br><br>The USA? UK? Many Americans and British opposed the idea of going to war in Iraq. Not all opposed it, but almost half the population did. Opinions were split, at least in the UK.<br><br>Yet what did Tony Blair and George Bush do? They did not wait for another round of UN inspections and talks, etc. They invaded Iraq the moment they could.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Correct me if I'm wrong. Isn't democracy supposed to be when the majority or everyone is for the idea, and action is taken? That's the whole reason for consulting the public in the first place. Otherwise what's the use of it?</span></strong><br></span></blockquote><br><span style="color: darkred;">Has it not been the case of a wilful government - intent on reaching its own ends - ignoring the wisdom of others from within its community, and bull-dozed ahead against all opposition - even to the extent of manipulating a legal process to achieve its objective ?<br><br>The Singapore POWER OF ONE must be most skillful at this art after forty-five years in power, while Bush and Blair are mere amateurs - which explains for the mess that they have left behind.<br><br>Our entry and painful exit from Malaysia was a result of the willful personal views of LKY, in getting Singapore into Malaysia despite the other voices from political leaders from the Alternative Parties during the heavy politiking of the 1960s.<br><br>That shortlived experience has resulted in unfinished politial business that continue to haunt the relationship between Singapore and Malaysia since our forced exit in 1965. </span><br><blockquote><br>Letter by Han Fook Kwang, quoted by BillyBong:<br><span style="color: indigo;"><br>So if it's not the case of making Singapore a super, truly democratic country, what's the problem? Getting more opposition into parliament? But why? <strong>Is the PAP doing something wrong?</strong><br><br>I cannot honestly see what's wrong. <strong>All I can see is that the need for jobs, food, housing and security are all met.</strong> </span></blockquote><br><span style="color: darkred;">One see only what one wish to see; even under torture, one can trick one's brain to be blissful in pain.<br><br>Is it any wonder that <span style="font-style: italic;">'Ah Fook'</span> is bespectacled ? We can and will forgive him for his serious myopia that explains for his mental handicap.<br><br>Surely, something must be seriously wrong when there exist a large section of the Singapore population that is indebt for the better part of one's working Life, and that one is <span style="font-style: italic;">"asset rich"</span> but <span style="font-style: italic;">"cash poor"</span>, and ill prepared for <span style="font-style: italic;">"Old Age"</span>.<br><br>While the general Singapore population is suffering under the weight of the <span style="font-style: italic;">"SWISS Cost of Living"</span>, there is hardly any evidence or hint of the much touted <span style="font-style: italic;">"SWISS Standards of Living"</span>.<br><br>One can always hardened our senses to be numb to the pain that is inflicted continuously. Are we not seeing the incessant and regular call by GLCs to raise prices for the services provided ? As Singaporeans see a shrinking wage package, the GLCs are making obscene run-away profits that are reported annually. </span><br><blockquote><br>Letter by Han Fook Kwang, quoted by BillyBong:<br><span style="color: indigo;"><br>So what is the PAP doing wrong? Do we want to get more opposition into the parliament for the sake of it? So that the PAP will not be the dominant party? But why?<br><br>Will the opposition really do anything different that I want? I cannot imagine having any more needs other than jobs, food, housing and security. And I find the PAP is doing a good job at them. So why would I want anything different?<br><br><strong>Why spoil something that's already working?</strong> If one day the PAP starts to get things wrong and there are no more jobs, housing becomes amazingly expensive or there is none at all, or if I cannot walk down the street without peace of mind, I would then say that the PAP is finished.<br><br>We should change things. That is when I would want a good opposition that can change things to be in the parliament and make a difference to Singapore.<br><br>But for now, do we need that?<br></span><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Han Fook Kwang<br>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong></span></span><br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">How much more contradicting can a myopic Elitist thinking get ?<br><br>Is <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ah Fook"</span> exercising his rights to his own views by denying the same to the other Singaporeans - who are concious and affected by the many political, social and cultural damages done by the PAP for the last 45 years ?<br><br>It is unfortunate that while <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ah Fook"</span> has access to the Public Media - as a result of his employment - most views from Singaporeans can hardly passed the review of the ST Editors.<br><br>Is it not always the characteristic Elitist Thinking that as long as <span style="font-style: italic;">"it ain't broke, why fix it" </span> - and so long as it benefit the Elitist position, why expose themselves to a situation where their Elitist position can be eroded ?<br><br>Following the same line of thinking - why should Singapore invest in our SAF when there is little immediate dangers - at least within the next ten years ?<br><br>By the same token, of preparing for the worst, will it not be prudent for talented Singaporeans to challenge the POWER OF ONE, and prepare more talented Singaporeans for political leadership.<br><br>If we are to wake up from our present deep coma, can we suddenly respond to help ourselves to any crisis that is beyond the ability of the POWER OF ONE ?<br><br>The present sterility of creative thinking in Singaporea is a result of the closed door in-breeding that has been the key to the monopolistic political grip by the POWER OF ONE.<br><br>In the same standards employed by this typical carpet-begging Singaporean <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ah Fook"</span>, ASIAMedia should have kicked him out of the USA, for his present contemptuous review of the state of affairs in the USA.<br></span><br><br></div>
