            <div class='col-md body'>Date: 2006-05-11T01:55:27<br><br>This letter, sent to Senator Frist, from a retired<br>border patrol agent has more common sense than all the<br>bull being spewed from the Senate, with the exception<br>of a few sensible representatives.<br><br>Anyway, this guy has it together and shows the<br>rhetoric for what it is.<br><br>Dear Senator Frist:<br><br>There is a huge amount of propaganda and myths<br>circulating about illegal aliens, particularly illegal<br>Mexican, Salvadorian, Guatemalan and Honduran aliens.<br><br>1.  Illegal aliens generally do NOT want U.S.<br>citizenship.  Americans are very vain thinking that<br>everybody in the world wants to be a U.S.  citizen.<br>Mexicans, and other nationalities want to remain<br>citizens of their home countries while obtaining the<br>benefits offered by the United States such as<br>employment, medical care, in-state tuition, government<br>subsidized housing and free education for their<br>offspring.  Their main attraction is employment and<br>their loyalty usually remains at home.  They want<br>benefits earned and subsidized by middle class<br>Americans.  What illegal aliens want are benefits of<br>American residence without paying the price.<br><br>2.  There are no jobs that Americans won't do.<br>Illegal aliens are doing jobs that Americans can't<br>take and still support their families.  Illegal aliens<br>take low wage jobs, live dozens in a single residence<br>home, share expenses and send money to their home<br>country.  There are no jobs that Americans won't do<br>for a decent wage.<br><br>3.  Every person who illegally entered this nation<br>left a home.  They are NOT homeless and they are NOT<br>Americans.  Some left jobs in their home countries.<br>They come to send money to their real home as<br>evidenced by the more than<br>20 billion dollars sent out of the country each year<br>by illegal aliens.<br>These illegal aliens knowingly and willfully entered<br>this nation in violation of the law and therefore<br>assumed the risk of detection and deportation.  Those<br>who brought their alien children assumed the<br>responsibility and risk on behalf of their children.<br><br>4.  Illegal aliens are NOT critical to the economy.<br>Illegal aliens constitute less than 5% of the<br>workforce.  However, they reduce wages and benefits<br>for lawful U.S.  residents.<br><br>5.  This is NOT an immigrant nation.  There are 280<br>million native born Americans.  While it is true that<br>this nation was settled and founded by immigrants<br>(legal immigrants), it is also true that there is not<br>a nation on this planet that was not settled by<br>immigrants at one time or another.<br><br>6.  The United States is welcoming to legal<br>immigrants.  Illegal aliens are not immigrants by<br>definition.  The US  accepts more lawful immigrants<br>every year than the rest of the world combined.<br><br>7.  There is no such thing as the "Hispanic vote."<br>Hispanics are white, brown, black and every shade in<br>between.  Hispanics are Republicans, Democrats,<br>Anarchists, Communists, Marxists and Independents.<br>The so-called "Hispanic vote"<br>is a myth..  Pandering to illegal aliens to get the<br>Hispanic vote is a dead end.<br><br>8.  Mexico is NOT a friend of the United States.<br>Since 1848 Mexicans have resented the United States.<br><br>During World War I Mexico allowed German Spies to<br>operate freely in Mexico to spy on the US<br><br>During World War II Mexico allowed the Axis powers to<br>spy on the US  from Mexico.<br><br>During the Cold War Mexico allowed spies hostile to<br>the US  to operate freely.<br><br>The attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 was cheered and<br>applauded all across Mexico.<br><br>Today Mexican school children are taught that the US<br>stole California, Arizona, new Mexico and Texas  If<br>you don't believe it, check out some Mexican textbooks<br>written for their schoolchildren.<br><br>9.  Although some illegal aliens enter this country<br>for a better life, there are 6 billion people on this<br>planet.  At least 1 billion of those live on less than<br>one dollar a day.  If wanting a better life is a valid<br>excuse to break the law and sneak into America, then<br>let's allow those one billion to come to America and<br>we'll turn the USA into a Third World nation<br>overnight.  Besides, there are 280 million native born<br><br>Americans who want a better life.  I'll bet Bill Gates and<br>Donald Trump want a better life.  When will the USA<br>lifeboat be full?  Since when is wanting a better life<br>a good reason to trash another nation?<br><br>10.  There is a labor shortage in this country.  This<br>is a lie.  There are hundreds of thousands, if not<br>millions, of American housewives, senior citizens,<br>students, unemployed and underemployed who would<br>gladly take jobs at a decent wage.<br><br>11.  It is racist to want secure borders.  What is<br>racist about wanting secure borders and a secure<br>America?  What is racist about not wanting people to<br>sneak into America and steal benefits we have set<br>aside for legal aliens, senior citizens, children and<br>other legal residents?  What is it about race that<br>entitles people to violate our laws, steal identities,<br>and take the American Dream without paying the price?<br><br>For about four decades American politicians have<br>refused to secure our borders and look after the<br>welfare of middle class Americans.  These politicians<br>have been of both parties.  A huge debt to American<br>society has resulted.<br><br>This debt will be satisfied and the interest will be<br>high.  There has already been riots in the streets by<br>illegal aliens and their supporters.  There will be<br>more.  You, as a politician, have a choice to offend<br>the illegal aliens who have stolen into this country<br>and demanded the rights afforded to US<br>citizens or to offend those of us who are stakeholders<br>in this country.  The interest will be steep either<br>way.  There will be civil unrest.  There will be a<br>reckoning.<br><br>Do you have the courage to do what is right for<br>America?  Or, will you bow to the wants and needs of<br>those who don't even have the right to remain here?<br>There will be a reckoning.  It will come in November<br>of this year, again in 2008 and yet again in 2010.<br>We will not allow America to be stolen by third world<br>agitators and thieves.<br><br>David J.
