The cost of rebuilding increase, decreasing support from allies, increasing number of death of americans, its own citizen getting increasingly frustrated and dis illusioned, own agencies like inelligence losing all repuatation, increasing shame from issues such as wedding bombing and prison treatment, unified the terrorists more, losing friends who had earlier support for the war etc. Not harder ?

The iraqis offensive do make US rethink their policies, and probably assist in changing of power from the republican to democrats.

Almost all infrastructure was already gone before they send in the first soldier. Troops fighting become minimal, with the use of armoured personal carrier, tanks, planes, missiles and artillery.

Surely america can see lesser and lesser countries supporting his occupation ? Surely the price of reconstruction work has increase and it will put a pressure on the budget ?

I believe america had made MAJOR adjustments and TACTICS to due with tis new response. I believe the price tag of the war has increase tremendously due to tis new responce. The cost of rebuilding increase, decreasing support from allies, increasing number of death of americans, its own citizen getting increasingly frustrated and dis illusioned, own agencies like inelligence losing all repuatation, increasing shame from issues such as wedding bombing and prison treatment, unified the terrorists more, losing friends who had earlier support for the war etc. Not harder ?

The fighting spirit to prevent another 9-11 attack remains intact despite your attempt at trying to promote the private agendas of Journalists in promoting the views that the US spirit is dented by one accidental bombing of a wedding, a handful of miscreants abusing prisoners, intelligence failure or failures, and a death toll of 700 US lives lost.<br><br>Continuing post by stupidissmart:<strong><br><blockquote>Are the Insurgents anywhere nearer to getting the US Military to leave Iraq ?<br><br>HARDLY, as the USA simply arranged for an early handover to an Iraqi Interim Governing Council, while the US Military remain entrenched - AND this time with a certain degree of LEGITIMACY. </blockquote>R they not getting nearer ?

He has never done such things before, and u r already proclaiming him guilty. R u saddam ? How do u know he will act as such in future ?<br><br>Surprising talking about N-bombs, North korea HAVE it, PUBLICLY announce it and THREATHENED to use it them and america do nothing towards them.<br><br><blockquote>Have you forgetten that prior to the Iraq War, Saddam Hussein remained defiant to end, and had refused to allow the return of UN Weapons Inspectors to perform their tasks without interference; and that Saddam Hussein continued with his game of deception that resulted in NO ONE being able to confirm if he had or had not any WMD - when overwhelming evidence from earlier inspections confirmed their existence, and Saddam's use of WMD against his own Kurdish group and against Iran during the 7 Year War. </blockquote>HUH !! Do u get your facts right ? Saddam has given total cooperations toward the UN weopons incestigators and the investigators have proclaimed COOPERATIONS have met and NO SUCH weopons were found. They even asked american specialists to do the inspectors but america refuse ! Wat else can they do ? It is like someone accuse u of theft, refuse to do any investigations or show any proof and beat u up.<br><br>Wat do the US do then ? He REFUSE to give the weopon investigators MORE TIME, refuse to provide detail information on the supposed WMD and he launch the war IRREGARDLESS of the fact tat it is ILLEGAl in the UN assembly.

They had done nothing but report on the truth, and they have done much in righting the wrongs of the prison abuses and making the america curb its senseless bombings.
