Do they really have no guts to combat the american ? Sometimes it is wise to be realistic. If they hit the american head on, it will be the case of an egg smashing against a rock. I think it is dumb to throw away their lives meaninglesssly by launching an attack against a force too much stronger head on. For insurgents, they r known to have hit anyone, anywhere and anytime. Tat is one of their strength.<br><br><blockquote>You missed the the subject by digressing into the objectives of the Insurgents, which is not the concern in this discussion of Asian Lives. </blockquote>U missed the point tat these workers r helping the american companies.

They certainly discouraged a lot of country to stop sending troops and help for the US isn't it ?<br><br>Frankly, I do not see why do u say they feel more superior than Asians when they killed the nepalese. They kill a lot of other nationals too. Does tat mean they feel more superior than the rest of the world ? American also kill a lot of Iraqis too, so american must have feel more superior than iraqis ? Heck, vietnam had killed a lot of american and vice versa int he past too. Why do u make tat statement ?<br><br><blockquote>Are the Nepalese lives so worthless that all TWELVE Nepalese can be executed at one go, instead of killing one at a time over the next few days, weeks or months ?<br></blockquote>They r in Iraq, they should probably know they have a higher tendency to die there. Tat explains for their high pay isn't it. 12 Nepalese at one go... sad to say there has been so much killing in Iraq during these few years tat I begin to feel imune to it. In the war and the months after, several ten of thousands Iraqis r killed while millions of their lives has been ruined. The americans even drop a bomb at a couple wedding, killing tens of people instantly. Every day there r reports of insurgents killed by the americans. R the iraqis lives so worthless tat they r executed at one go ? Wat is 12 person lives compared with these figures ? If u want to blame, u should blame why does the war has to start.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, after this, I think that sometimes there can be no grey areas with respect to terrorism.Should we negotiate?Hasn't history shown us far enough that strength and overwhelming power is the victor?Repugnant as it may sound, there are factions who grow weary of negotiation and peaceful means and will do just whatever it takes military to crush such insurgents in our midst.The point here is, which is the correct side and are we on that right side.Only history will judge.Personally, I will take the more civil of the two.The United States may be overbearing, trying to bully its way around internationally and disregard the usual realpolitik that encompasses international relations.Still, they are not at that base, barbaric level in which these animals have descended to.Due to the fear of reforming their own society to advance in the world, they are trying to bring down your world and mine in order to suit their twisted mind.There is no alternative, it's my way or the highway, as they might say.<br><br>Give me a rifle today and a insurgent in my sights, and I swear to God I will gun him down to prevent one extra risk to civility.Call me equal to him if you want, but he would have died more humanely and less psychologically shocking than the butchering of fellow Asians by Iraqi militants.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact that the terrorists can seize french media hostages and demand that france rescind its policy on scarves for female muslims in France tells us one very simple thing -- the policy and objectives of the terrorists is not simply the withdrawal of foreign troops from the middle-east, but the Islamization of the world as is required and dictated by the Koran. Until this goal is achieved they will not quit, they will not respect citizens of any country within their grasp, and they will conduct themselves with barbarity, with contmept, and without compassion or remorse.<br><br>The muslim world has declared war on the the rest of the world -- we just haven't recognized and accepted it yet -- this is why they will attack Americans, Europeans, Asians -- anyone not deemed muslim enough in their eyes. If moderate muslims want to avoid an all-out conflict with the West and the westernized world they had better speak up quickly and get the radicals under control or they will all perish under an ultimate western retaliation and onslaught that the muslims cannot win.<br><br>Look at Chechnyian terrorists now attacking Russian kindergartens. The Russians should resort to bloody brute force in Chechnya to eradicate the problem -- no other way out than to annilate the Chechnyian population -- and who is going to stop them? Putin should wipe Chechnya from the map, period.<br><br>Lets stop pretending that this is anything other that what it is -- a war by muslims against non-muslims. The non-muslim world has tip-toed around the basic case in order not to appear racist and judgemental -- now is the time to set aside that poltically correct behaviour which is clouding the real issue and leading to more danger globally than we should accept. For the good of all non-muslims we need to show we have the guts and determination to wipe out the aggressive stance of muslims wherever they may be and whatever the cost. The case against the nazis was no less significant and time sensitive.<br><br>Early decisive action will stand better than late uncertain commitments.<br><br>The only way to prevent an all out confrontation is for the silent majority muslims in the world to finally speak up, organize and reject the terrorist muslims. Saudi Arabia has much to answer for. Sooner or later muslims will pay the price dearly for allowing this radical terrorist element to wage war agains the rest of us.<br><br></div>
