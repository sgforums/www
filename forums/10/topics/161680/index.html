It is also one of the very few countries that have close ties with Iran. Instead of trying to isolate and threaten Pyongyang and Tehran, Washington should cooperate with China to persuade those countries to abandon their nuclear programs.'<br><br>By Thomas Wiegand<br>Outside View Contributor<br>Bonn, Germany (UPI) Nov 04, 2005<br><br>When the Twin Towers in New York were destroyed by Islamic fundamentalists on Sept. 11, 2001, the United States learned two lessons: 1) The United States is invincible but not invulnerable and 2) The United States is a superpower but not almighty.<br><br>To fight the war against terrorism, the United States needs allies around the globe.<br><br>The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are extremely straining the U.S. armed forces. The United States cannot dare to wage a war against North Korea because U.S. capabilities are already overstretched. Washington needs allies to achieve its security goals.<br><br>There are spheres where China and the United States have the same interests. Both countries do not have any sympathy for Islamic terrorists. Both countries have a vital interest in a stable Korean peninsula. Both countries did not want to cause military conflict. Washington must be interested in cooperating with China on security affairs.<br><br>China so far is probably the only country that can influence North Korea. It is also one of the very few countries that have close ties with Iran. Instead of trying to isolate and threaten Pyongyang and Tehran, Washington should cooperate with China to persuade those countries to abandon their nuclear programs.<br><br>As a standing member of the United Nations Security Council, China can promote U.S. initiatives in the world organization. Washington should stop regarding China as a potential enemy without neglecting the differences between the two states.<br><br>With regard to Taiwan, Washington should make clear that it would neither tolerate Chinese military action nor coercive methods to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control or any development in Taiwan to declare formal independence.<br><br>The United States as well as all other Western nations should continue to watch closely the situation of human rights and religious freedom in China.<br><br>An intelligent policy with regard to China would support the integration of this country into the international political and economic community and would strive to build up a comprehensive cooperation between the countries. In the long term, only such a policy would help to improve the standard of living for all of China's people and promote political and religious freedom in the country.<br><br>Economic cooperation between the two countries is one of the most important factors for building a partnership. When in 1979 the Chinese leadership under Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping decided to implement a total reform of China's economy, the Chinese Communist Party regarded three elements as decisive for the success.<br><br>First of all, the planning system of the economy was carefully replaced by a more market-oriented model. Secondly, the system of prices that were fixed by political authorities was abandoned and substituted with prices that were determined by the open market. Thirdly, in order to gain access to foreign currency and technology, China was opened to investors from other countries.<br><br>The reasons for these fundamental reforms were to prevent the economy from collapsing and to maintain the power monopoly of the CCP. The reforms were extraordinary successful, but the more China's economy grew, the more dependent the country became on foreign trade.<br><br>Read the rest <a href="http://www.terradaily.com/news/china-05zzzzzzzzzzw.html//url" rel="nofollow">Here</a>[/url]</div>

Gen. Jorge Garcia Carneiro said a planned June 24 military ceremony that was to have been led by Chavez on the site of the battle of Carabobo, west of Caracas, had been canceled."<br><br>Investigations being conducted by Venezuela Security Forces are increasingly showing that this latest South American assassination plot is being organized by the United States, and as we can read as reported by the Latin American News Agency in their article titled "Assassination Clues in Venezuela Point to Colombia" and which says;<br><br>"Clues on opposition groups attempting to assassinate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez increasingly point to Colombia, although without the participation of the countryÂ’s authorities, VEA newspaper reported Wednesday. According to the daily, Venezuelan authorities discovered for recruiting terrorists and hired assassins in Bogota and Cucuta an organized network, which is sponsored by Miami and groups linked to US intelligence services."<br><br>Of the United States targeting by assassination South American Leaders not to their liking there is no doubt, and as we can read as reported by the United States Central Intelligence AgencyÂ’s report titled Â“Subject: CIA Activities in ChileÂ” and which states, Â“On 15 September President Nixon informed the DCI that an Allende regime in Chile would not be acceptable to the United States.  He instructed the CIA to prevent Allende from coming to power or unseat him and authorized $10 million for this purpose.  The President specifically directed that this action be carried out by the CIA without advising the Departments of State or Defense or the U.S. Ambassador in Chile.Â”<br><br>But according to a report from the Forbes News Service, VenezuelaÂ’s President is continuing his defiance of these latest American threats to his life, and as he has been quoted as saying, "Venezuela will never again be anyone's colony," said Chavez, a harsh critic of the U.S. government, which he says has exacerbated poverty through "imperialist" policies."<br><br>The difference though between the actions of the Americans against Chile in the 1970Â’s, and now against Venezuela during this new century lies with China, who has the second greatest power in the world today is actively challenging the United States for world hegemony, and specifically at the very doorstep of the United States, and as we can read from the testimony before the United States Congress by Peter T.R.
