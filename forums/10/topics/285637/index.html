If the father is PR and son born in Sg also a PR, by about 18, he should have decided if he wants to continue to be a PR right or not?<br><br>If they really want to be citizen , would not the father have done that long long until cannot long ago?<br><br>If the father does not want to be citizen altho easily qualify, why would the son want to be? suggest a reason anyone?  If by 18, the son of  a PR can decide to drop the PR and after 18 years found an opportunity in his father's country,  he would still have the freedom to bypass NS. And if so, does it mean the son of a PR cannot  come to sg to work as PR later? Is sg not welcoming of talents?  The son of a PR can be a PR by not being a talent but simply by virtue of being born ? How many are these? And enjoy the benefits that sg society has built. Sg so gracious leh.<br><br>Thus, I still have much unclarities about PR and the son of a PR.<br><br>What is Loyalty and how robust is Sg with Residents so many are PR or new immigrants and this number continues to grow every day as we speak?<br><br>What future will sg have?   Very bright I expect. That is the least of my expectations. and nothing less. 1 cent money 1 cent worth of goods.<br><br>I initiate my backup plan.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Given that sg welcome PR so many and more to come, I take it that PR is good thing.<br><br>Thus, I urge that Malaysia and Sg practise easy PR membership scheme.<br><br>Malaysians already have super access and easy can get PR and even citizen in SG. I hope the malaysia can do the same for sg'reans.  Since PR is welcomed must be good thing. Why should malaysia not practise the same?<br><br>If being PR criteria is to stay there for 2 years , I think Malaysia is the easiest and best choice to realise my backup plan.  Can zip between sg and JB for 2 years and then get PR and then enjoy best of both worlds. Backup plan ready.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">    I hope the criteria to be Malaysia PR can be made easy like no need stay there. Just have to visit there for vacation every 6 months or so. Like this, even ask me pay 1000 for that PR, I will do so willingly since I can realise my backup plan. I dunno what is the criteria for being malaysia PR.<br><br>Like this, anytime I not so the sing song, I can drop either 1.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  So song!<br><br>Anyone here a Malaysian PR and Sg citizen????   How many do you think there are?  Estimate estimate leh.  say 10,000 sg citizens have malaysia PR? I ever heard a malay comrade say he wants to be PR in Malaysia. He said easier than for other race?
