            <div class='col-md body'>This is probably a backlash to the gruesome murder of a controversial filmmaker about 1 year back.<br><br>I think the ban is quite extreme and perhaps a ban in schools and a ban on their use in banks would have been a more measureed approach. Still, its their country and I can certainly understand the depth of their anger towards these people.<br><br>In any case, wearing the burqua is arguably more cultural (or fashion depending on how you look at it) than religious.

            <div class='col-md body'>No, ok, we can go there and discuss about the religious customs and stuff and whether they are suitable in todays world, etc like that, but thats not the angle Im going for. The angle Im approaching is that, by banning a religious custom, it is violating a very basic right, and that is religious freedom. We can say religious freedom, and/ or personal choice freedom, so on.<br><br>I know someone will say Burqa is very covering, not like Sikhs with a little thing on the head, or maybe some Jews who wear special hats for example. But that is not the point. That is weak argument. It is not the main idea behind why it is banned.<br><br>For instance, why is Burqa not banned in Iran or Afganistan, but banned in Holland?<br><br>Wearing Burqa is a custom and tradition, a religious tradition of these people, and when they are in Iran or Afganistan they can wear it, but when they go to Holland they cannot wear it, because Holland politicians want integration, meaning they should discard and leave their religious custom. And this is the point where integration is sacrificing or being put above one very basic right, religious freedom. They are saying you can go and live here in Holland but you must not be who you are, you must discard your belief and religious custom.<br><br>Other than this we can also say it is a cultural subjugation or forced integration, because they are forced to abandon their cultural identity, customs, and religious teaching. They are told to dilute their cultural identity and 'integrate'.<br><br>Again this can only happen because they are Muslims, not Jews or Hindus whatever. It is also not a coincidence that it happen in Holland.<br><br>To me I just feel that they as a nation have some tough decision making to take, and this is probably not the best decision, from my view as a third party observer, but maybe since I dont live there, they have their own decision-making for their society and this is what they have decided and I have respect for that. I just feel abit sorry for the Muslims there because I think they will feel abit opressed and targeted/ offended.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I want to talk abit more about this, because it's interesting.<br><br>I think, if you think about women who used to wear Burqa in Holland, but now cannot anymore, how would they feel?<br><br>I can imagine probably they are in a dilemma now. If they wear Burqa that means they are very observant. Now they are told to be less observant. Cannot go outside with Burqa.<br><br>I feel it's like asking an observant Hindu to eat beef in public, outside his home, or a vegetarian (for religious reason) to eat meat outside his home, and so on.<br><br>Or like asking a Buddhist monk not to shave his head.<br><br>How can..??? It is very hard for them to do that.<br><br>Also since they are women, we can go abit different angle and say this is gender oppression, because women are being told what to wear and what not to wear, ironically by banning Burqa. By banning Burqa they make women not able to make her own choice and decision making, in the very personal domain like clothing, ironically precisely the same attacks other people have on these veils as being oppresive to women.<br><br>Ok, what is also interesting to me is that it happen in Holland, one of the most free country in the world where people can buy cocaine and homosexuals can marry. Isnt it interesting they should bother about 'integration' and want to regulate clothing in public. Do you know why??? I dont think this will happen if we are not living in the present condition of Islam-Western chasms and their own trauma with their domestic events.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I say it is a goddamn good rule too!<br><br>If they don't like it , they should go back to where they come from . Either integrate together with the locals or get out . When in rome, DO AS THE ROMANS DO.<br><br>In Australia , the reason for the cronulla riots was not due to racism - men of  middle eastern appearance  calling the white girls in bikini names and sexually harassing them because "they are not modestly dressed" , so the white guys decide to jump into the fray either out of self righteousness or  to defend the dignity of their women  . I remember this rape case involving some men of pakistani origin had one of the rapists say that the white girl was inviting them to rape because she was not "modest" in his culture. Since when was culture an excuse to freaking rape a woman. How about honor killings in Europe? Yeah yeah those might be the minority and in their culture ...so should we allow honor killings as well?<br><br>The hijab is fine with me but the burka - no . It covers the person's face too much. On the practical side , how do you even check the identity of the person you are talking to? Get the male relative to verify? NOW that is an excellent form of taking power from a woman.<br><br>We can talk human rights this and that - but if they chose to come to a country - they accept the local norms as the right of others AND accept that women are EQUALS regardless of whether it's their own or the locals BEFORE expecting others to accept their culture.<br><br></div>
