I was in no mood to do another reaction paper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Right, let's say that there will be a clash when you have two major cultures coming together. The former being the entrenched culture that has already "set the tone" so to speak. Thus, there will be the cultural context in which the Dutch see their new immigrants as trying to have their cake and eat it, meaning leveraging on Dutch liberal freedoms to practise what the Dutch view as oppressive behavior.<br><br>Then the Muslim immigrants view this whole hooha as hypocrisy because they believe that the liberal Dutch state should protect their rights to do as they please.<br><br>Still, it is not a zero-sum game lor, there will be a point of confluence where your behavior and my attitude will clash. It is in this middle are where moderation has to take effect. It is sad when extremism is found in the middle of two liberal interpretations.<br><br>Thus, secular regimes need our support now more than ever. Religion should never be shoved in your face, but then again, you cannot expect your adopted homeland to give up their socio-religious heritage to suit you in a hard-on fashion.<br><br>By all means, practise your religion to your fullest extent at home, but the public place is a public sphere.</div>
