              <p>As announced, the SDP will be in Toa
              Payoh to commemorate International Workers' Day on 1 May 08. The May
              Day event is part of the <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em>! campaign against rising costs in Singapore.  <br><br>We
              will be asking residents of Toa Payoh to sign a petition calling on the
              Government to do something about the unbearable cost of living and to
              stop the exploitation of Singaporean workers. <br><br>Singapore
              Democrats and friends will be at Toa Payoh Central (next to the Toa
              Payoh Community Library) from 11 am to 6 pm next Thursday.<br><br>We will encourage Singaporeans to support the campaign by signing the petition (see below). The SDP will also visit the <em>kopitiams</em> and talk with residents about their difficulties in coping with the horrendous increase in prices. <br><br>We
              will also be distributing flyers showing how the ministers, all
              multi-millionaires, continue to make use of cheap foreign labour to
              suppress the wages of locals so that they can squeeze yet greater
              profit and revenue to feed their opulent lifestyles. <br><br>We will also be selling <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em>!
              t-shirts and buttons. The aim is to turn the campaign into a national
              effort to stop the PAP from continuing its rapacious policies. Dr Chee
              Soon Juan's books will also be on sale. <br><br>All in all, the
              occasion will be a meaningful one where we hope to raise the voice of
              Singaporeans so that the PAP will sit up and listen. <br><br>There is
              also the added factor that Toa Payoh is the constituency of Mr Wong Kan
              Seng. It is opportune to let the Government know that the Home Affairs
              Minister must be held accountable for his failures.<br><br>Whatever your reason, come down to Toa Payoh Central on 1 May to support the campaign and tell the Government: “<em>Tak boleh tahan</em>!”<br><br><br><strong>The <strong><em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em>! </strong>Petition</strong><br><br>To: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong<br><br>We,
              the undersigned, call on the Government to help the ordinary citizen
              cope with the crushing cost of living which is making life unbearable.
              The slew of price hikes over the past several months and the increase
              of the GST has caused inflation to sore to record levels. <br><br>Coupled
              with decreasing wages, many of our workers can't even afford three
              square meals a day. Some can't afford to pay for water and electricity.
              Many are homeless. <br><br>Given the dire circumstances, we call on you to:<br><br>1.
              Show that you understand our plight by not increasing your salary to
              such an exorbitant amount of $3.8 million a year. This works out to be
              more than $10,000 a day! Many of us will take a year just to make what
              you earn in a single day. Such an attitude is making the rich like you
              richer and the poor like us poorer. <br><br>2. Be more judicious in
              allowing foreign workers into Singapore. Our society and economy cannot
              sustain the indiscriminate influx of the so-called foreign talent. We
              cannot live on the kind of wages that foreigners can because, unlike
              them, we have to raise our families here.<br><br>3. Remember that many
              of our male Singaporeans have to serve National Service and thereafter
              return for reservist training for many years. Yet the foreign
              nationals, who do not have to make such sacrifices are getting all the
              jobs. <br><br>4. Release our hard-earned CPF savings. We are the
              biggest savers in the world and yet, we have the lowest retirement
              incomes compared to other countries. This is because you keep the HDB
              prices unaccountably high and then use all sorts of schemes to retain
              the little that is left in our savings. compulsory annuity plan is the
              latest scheme.<br><br>5. Make public the information of the billions of
              our dollars that you conduct your businesses with through the GIC and
              Temasek. While you invest for the "long-term" many of us cannot afford
              to live decent lives and afford the soaring healthcare costs. <br><br>In
              veiw of these, we urge you to govern democratically and return to us
              our economic and political rights. Your policies are not benefiting us,
              the people. We say to you: "<em>Tak boleh tahan</em>!" and call on you to make things right. <br><br>Signed,</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">In Singapore, democracy has to take root from bottom up, not from top down.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Those fighting for a more democratic
              society in Singapore must introduce it first to the ordinary man. Once
              that is done, the government will automatically fall into place. In
              Singapore, democracy has to take root from bottom up, not from top
              down. Making brilliant Winston Churchill speeches in Parliment is
              unlikely to bring real change. You first have to awaken an entire
              Singapore population that has been numbed into wholesale submission.<br><br>Having
              lived abroad for many years, and through my work as an immigration
              lawyer met people from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, the entire alphabet of
              countries, I will tell you an astonishing fact. The Singaporean stands
              out as a totally different species from any other human being in the
              world.<br><br>For instance, no matter if you are an Afghan, a Hottentot
              or a Pygmy, one thing is certain. If a Prime Minister of any country
              pays himself $3.7 million a year and several million more a year in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">hidden</span> perks, while the average person earns no more than $2,000.00 a month,
              such as the case in Singapore; there is not a single breathing human
              being anywhere in the world who would not have picked up his cudgel or
              sickle of whatever he had at hand, marched to the Prime Ministers
              office to demand an answer to this outrage and would have refused to
              leave until he got it.<br><br>Believe me, this is normal human
              behaviour for an Afghan, a Belgian, a Canadian, a Dane, an Eskimo, a
              Finn, a German, a whatever. But in Singapore, except for the Internet
              where there is a great deal of criticism, but mind you, with everyone
              engaged in it being anonymous through fear; there is not a single soul
              in the entire island with enough courage to even so much as raise a
              whimper!<br><br>Singaporeans just like other humans around the world
              are taxpayers too. But all other taxpayers, since they are taxpayers to
              repeat the obvious; would demand an explanation as to how their taxes
              are being spent. Are you wasting it, through objectionably high
              salaries for Ministers, for scholarships for foreigners while denying
              it to Singapore children, training foreigners for jobs while
              Singaporeans are neglected? These are questions that any other human
              being taxpayer will ask; that is, any other human being except a
              Singaporean!<br><br>For one or more reasons, the Singaporean over the
              years has become entirely subdued, submissive and obedient. Such people
              are not conducive and do not comport with a democratic society, because
              for democracy to thrive, you first have to have an emboldened people. A
              people who refuse to take no for an answer when the inequity is
              obvious, such as, to take one example, million dollar ministerial
              salaries.<br><br>Take prisoner Mas <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Salamat</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> who recently escaped from his illegal detention at Whitley Detention
              Center; illegal by reason of the absence of any criminal charges filed
              against him for 2 long years, where criminal jurisprudence requires the
              release of a suspect after just 48 hours in the absence of a charge.<br><br>Despite
              the fact that we have been publicly told of nothing less than gross
              negligence, even criminal recklessness of the facility's guards in
              enabling the escape through an open window panel, no government
              official has yet been willing to take responsibility. The minister
              responsible has publicly stated that he does not care what people think
              of him and will not resign!<br><br>Now any other human being, even if
              he happens to be a Hottentot who inhabits the remotest parts of the
              German South West African bush, would have by now run amok demanding
              justice! But not so in quiet and obedient Singapore. From last I heard,
              there is not even a single miserable Singaporean except for the handful
              of brave protesters, raising a single complaint.<br><br>In a society like Singapore where the people have been numbed into a sense of helplessness and tolerance, no amount of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">democratic</span> institutions will actually change anything. As the saying goes, you can
              take a horse to water, you cannot make him drink. If a Singaporean is
              determined not to have freedom, no amount of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">persuasion</span> can make him accept it.<br><br>Therefore as I said in my last post, <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/04/singapore-parliament-is-white-elephant.html">The Singapore Parliament is a white elephant</a>; getting more <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">opposition</span> members to enter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Parliament</span> is unlikely to bring about any real change. Somehow the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">opposition</span> has to work on trying to embolden and empower the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporean</span>. Once that is done, the people, through their demands will resurrect the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Phoenix</span> of democracy.<br><br>The first thing to do is to remove the fear which <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">shrouds</span> each <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporean</span> keeping him in his straitjacket; by <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">telling</span> him that his fear is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">unnecessary;</span> that his fear is merely an illusion <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">designed</span> to keep him satisfied; that the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">government</span> is nothing more than a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">toothless</span> tiger if you think of it; that they really cannot sack and dismiss everyone from <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">their</span> jobs or imprison everyone and beat everyone. And once the ordinary man
              realises this, the taxi driver realises this, the Chinese sausage maker
              realises this, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Malay</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">belachan</span> maker <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">realizes</span> this, the Indian Mama P<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">rataman</span> (not the President) realises this, then you have it made.<br><br>If you can manage that, you will find this government <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">suddenly</span> becoming more <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">representative</span>, more concerned and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">more</span> humble. It will all automatically come about. All you have is to change the mindset of the Ah <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kow</span>, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ahmat</span> or the Ravi; you would have changed society and a democracy will come about overnight.<br><br>In order to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">achieve</span> this, you have to embolden each and every <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporean</span> not to accept injustice and stand his ground, like I said in my last post. The <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">opposition</span> needs to have a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">hot line</span> and a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">member</span> on <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">standby</span> to take the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">complaints</span> of the citizens, keeping ready for <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_34" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">deployment</span> a group of willing <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_35" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> with ready cameras and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_36" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">placards</span>, ready to be deployed at any offending location where the injustice has <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_37" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">occurred</span> to stage their protest.</p>
              <p>It may be the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_38" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> office which has <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_39" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">denied</span> justice to a tenant, a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_40" class="blsp-spelling-error">CPF</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_41" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">member</span> who was not paid, a taxi driver protesting high taxi rents or gasoline
              and so on. In other words, protesting has to become a pivotal <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_42" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">exercise</span> in the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_43" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">opposition's</span> work for democratic change.<br><br>In the present difficult circumstances that <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_44" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporeans</span> face, with high food costs, low salaries, fewer jobs, heavy unemployment, the ground is ripe to be worked for this <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_45" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">purpose</span>. There are <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_46" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">growing</span> numbers that have been pushed to the limit of their suffering who may be ready to be empowered. I think the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_47" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">opposition</span> should take advantage of the situation and start moving now.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
