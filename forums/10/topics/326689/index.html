              <p><em><strong>Australian police claim 'world's largest seizure of ecstasy'</strong></em></p>
              <p><span>SYDNEY: Australian Customs and police Friday announced they had seized 4.4 tonnes of ecstasy tablets, in what they said was the biggest haul of the illicit drug anywhere in the world. <br><br>Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty said the seizure of the drugs, which were concealed in tins of tomato shipped to Australia from Italy, had resulted in the arrests of 16 people across the country in pre-dawn raids. <br><br>Authorities had worked for more than a year to track the syndicate behind the drugs after Customs discovered the ecstasy hidden inside more than 3,000 tins, each weighing about 1.5 kilogrammes, in June 2007. <br><br>Customs officials replaced the ecstasy with an inert substance and monitored the consignment but the arrests were brought closer two weeks ago when a coffee bean shipment carrying 150 kilogrammes of cocaine was detected in Melbourne. <br><br>Keelty said the drugs were part of a global syndicate and the seizures would be "a major disruption to transnational organised crime, both in this country and abroad." <br><br>He said the ecstasy haul had been kept secret until now to allow the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Customs to carry out their investigations. <br><br>"There have been 185,000 telephone intercepts in this operation, there have been 400 members of the AFP deployed to this operation, there have been 10,000 hours of surveillance deployed to this operation to find the perpetrators of this world's largest seizure and importation into our country," he said. <br><br>Keelty said Australian and European police were attempting to stop the syndicate from trafficking and that search warrants had already been issued in Belgium and the Netherlands. <br><br>"It is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate," he told reporters. <br><br>Customs chief executive Michael Carmody said the bust was the result of "small snippets of information". <br><br>"This is a great result. This is what makes getting up in the morning and coming to work worthwhile," Carmody said. <br><br>- AFP/yb </span></p>

              <p class="intro"><strong>FEDERAL police have smashed an international drug syndicate after seizing a world-record<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 4.4 tonnes of ecstasy.</span></strong></p>
              <p>More
              than 16 people across Australia have been arrested over the drugs which
              have an estimated value of<span style="color: #ff0000;"> almost half-a-billion dollars.</span></p>
              <p>The joint AFP and Customs investigation uncovered the huge haul last
              June in a shipping container full of canned tomatoes from Europe and
              spent the past 12 months tracking the syndicate behind it. <br><br>Another shipment of drugs which arrived in Melbourne this year contained<span style="color: #ff0000;"> three bags of cocaine weighing about 150kg. <br></span><br>The
              investigation has also uncovered a money laundering operation worth
              more than $9 million that has allegedly been used to pay for the
              illegal drugs. <br><br>There were more than 105,000 telephone
              intercepts and 10,000 hours of surveillance done by police officers
              before dawn raids on properties in Victoria, NSW, South Australia and
              Tasmania this morning. <br><br>AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty said the
              crime syndicate behind the ecstasy haul was responsible for<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 60 per cent
              of the importation</span> of such drugs into Australia. <br><br>He said it was a "great result'' for the AFP, Customs and all the investigating officers involved. <br><br>"This is a major disruption to trans-national crime,'' the commissioner said.</p>
