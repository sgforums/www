            <div class='col-md body'>errr...there won't be any civil war in the first place...from what the TS is implying from the pictures he posted, it is gonna be only racial disturbance; don't think the civilians in Malaysia are able to gather weapons to fight a "civil war" against the government; and I don't think the civilians have any training to fight a war.  More likely to happen in Singapore since the civilians are trained through NS.<br><br>And in the first place, if there is a civil war, it is none of Singapore business and thus why should SAF be sent in to be peacekeepers?<br><br>Do you even know what peacekeeping means?  Peacekeeping missions are sent by the UN to help countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace; eg. monitor and observe peace processes that emerge in post-conflict situations and assist conflicting parties to implement the peace agreement they have signed.<br><br>Peacekeeping does not mean going in to stop an ongoing civil war.  If SAF is sent in during a civil war in Malaysia, that would be considered an invasion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Don't meddle in our affairs: M'sia</span></strong><br>TODAYonline Â• December 4, 2007<br><br>Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar yesterday warned other governments not to interfere in Malaysia's domestic affairs as the country braces for a new wave of activism that began with two separate demonstrations last month involving ethnic Indians and opposition groups.<br><br>"This is Malaysia. We'll deal with our problems according to our laws. Other countries should be mindful of our rights," Mr Syed Hamid said yesterday.<br><br>"If there is anything that we are dissatisfied with, there are avenues within our system to deal with it. Malaysians don't want foreign interference," he said.<br><br>Mr Syed Hamid urged the ethnic Indian minority to refer any complaints to the government rather than foreign countries. Activists from the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) had called on the United Kingdom UK to spearhead United Nations action against Malaysia.<br><br>In two letters sent to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, they claim to have suffered discrimination because of Malaysia's bumiputera policy that favours the Malay Muslim majority. They also cited the demolition of dozens of Hindu temples as evidence of "ethnic cleansing".<br><br>In comments aimed at calming religious and racial tensions, a minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Mr Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz, yesterday denounced the way in which Hindu temples were demolished, calling the action by local authorities insensitive. He noted that the latest site to be torn down was a 36-year-old temple in Selangor, which was destroyed last month even as devotees were praying there.<br><br>Hindraf had led a rally of 10,000 ethnic Indians in Kuala Lumpur on Nov 25 to demand equality in Malaysia. Police had dispersed protesters with teargas and charged 94 people with taking part in an illegal gathering.<br><br>Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said New Delhi was disturbed by reports about the use of force against the protesters, while Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said "the government remains deeply solicitous of the welfare of people of Indian origin living abroad".<br><br>On Sunday, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi denounced the discrimination claims by the country's ethnic Indians and accused activists of stirring up racial conflict.<br><br>Meanwhile, 10 people are expected to be charged today in Kuala Lumpur for their involvement in the Nov 10 mass rally organised by the poll reform group Bersih, Malaysiakini reported.<br><br>The Bersih-led demonstration in Kuala Lumpur was the country's largest political rally in nearly a decade, drawing 40,000 people from opposition parties and human rights groups. The demonstrators marched to the king's palace to submit a memorandum calling for electoral reforms. The protest was considered illegal because it was held without a police permit.<br><br>"We believe citizens of any country should be allowed to peacefully assemble and express their views," a US State Department official said, alluding to the crackdown against the protests.<br><br>More marches are planned across Malaysia in the coming weeks for a range of different causes. On Dec 9, the Malaysian Bar Council will hold its annual Human Rights Day March. Non-governmental organisations and opposition parties are also planning to hold demonstrations to protest impending hikes in highway toll charges beginning Jan 1. Â— AGENCIES</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shocked by Â‘apartheidÂ’ report<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz was shocked during a recent work trip to India to find a newspaper there carrying a front page article that claimed that Malaysia was practising apartheid against Hindus.<br><br>Holding up the DNA newspaper of Nov 28, the International Trade and Industry Minister said that the article quoted a 22-year-old Sri Lankan-born poet who had spent 17 years in Malaysia, as saying that she fled Malaysia last month to escape Â“systematic racial harassment.Â”<br><br>Â“Fleeing Malaysia? Oh my goodness gracious. Can you imagine? This is really telling lies,Â” Rafidah told reporters yesterday after chairing a Wanita Umno meeting.<br><br>The Wanita Umno chief said that the poet, Sharanya Manivannan, had also claimed in the article that there had been cases in Malaysia of Â“body-snatchingÂ” of Hindu corpses by the authorities so that the deceased could be buried according to Muslim rites.<br><br>She said that the poet, however, had never mentioned that these men had converted to Islam.<br><br>Rafidah added that Sharanya had said in the article that Â“countless (Hindu) temples have been demolished and idols smashed Â– oftentimes in the middle of prayer sessions and devotees attackedÂ”.<br><br>Â“What a lie. Words like this are terrible. The article really hurts,Â” she said.<br><br>Rafidah was heading a trade mission to India from Nov 26 to Dec 1 when she came across the newspaper article at one of the five-star hotels there.<br><br>Â“I was shocked. Obviously there is already an international network set up,Â” she said, adding that she believed that this was politically motivated.<br><br>During the mission to New Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai, the minister said she was asked once or twice about the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) Nov 25 demonstration in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>She said she explained that it was untrue that Hindus were being marginalised in Malaysia, adding that Malaysian Industrial Development Authority (MIDA) director-general Datuk R. Karuna Karan, who accompanied her on the trade mission, was himself a Malaysian Hindu.<br><br>Â“He (Karuna) is a perfect example of those who get to the top. HeÂ’s not there by chance. MIDA is the organisation we put our trust in to get billions in investments.<br><br>Â“And Datuk Karuna is the chief because heÂ’s the best,Â” she said, adding that his predecessor too was a Hindu.<br><br>Rafidah slammed Hindraf for using religion for its political purposes.<br><br>She said that if there were groups that felt sidelined, they should use the proper channels to let the Government know their grievances in black-and-white, rather than taking it to the streets and to the Queen of England.<br><br>Hindraf has filed a US$4 trillion (RM13.5 trillion) suit in London, claiming the British is to blame for the marginalisation of Indians in Malaysia, as they had brought them to the then Malaya as indentured labourers and exploited them.<br><br>Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said the system of democracy practised in Malaysia, though dissimilar to that in the other democratic nations, is fair and transparent.<br><br>Â“Our democracy is founded on our history, cultural values and our traditions.<br><br>Â“The important thing is that we give every citizen the right to fairly elect anyone they wish to make up the Government,Â” he said in the Bicarawara interview programme on RTM1 last night.</div>

They drew support from many ethnic Chinese living in Malaya. The Chinese supported the Commnists because they were denied the equal right to vote in elections, had no land rights to speak of, and were usually very poor. The Communists' supply organisation the 'Min Yuen' had already built up a network of contacts within the civilian population. As well as supplying food and weapons, these contacts gathered information and supplied intelligence.<br><br>During the first six months there was around 200 attacks a month. They employed guerrilla tactics, sabotaging installations, attacking rubber plantations and destroying transportation and infrastructure.

            <div class='col-md body'>(Bernama) -- The group calling itself the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) is unqualified to meet with Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to discuss the problems of the Indian community because the organisation is not recognised by anyone, Information Minister Datuk Seri Zainuddin Maidin said today.<br><br>"It would be unbefitting a prime minister to meet with a discredited organisation which had stooped to the level of street thugs and violated the laws of the country," he told reporters after a visit to the media centre at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) 2007 exhibition.<br><br>=========================================<br><br>PM Badawi don't want to talk to Indian group........then what you expect the Indians to do?<br><br>Badawi....wake up......pay more attention to the needs of your people...<br><br>SAF .......get ready......don't sleep like the Malaysian PM....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the idea is not totally far fetch Â“IfÂ”  a persistent shooting unrest that lead to a war occurred. For those who think this is not our business think again.<br><br>SG is always tied to MY as to HKG forever ties to China, we shared land, historical incidents and people.  In any case strategically would you prefer to have Indo soldier crawling around MY as peace keeper or SAF peace keeper?<br><br>Do you want SAF peace keeper to be in JHB or Indo peace keeper to stand across the causeway and SAF Â“Stand toÂ” in Mandai. Think again. Could you imagine if a shooting situation occurred the round would happily drop in the water without crossing the border?<br><br>The job would be urgly as peace keeper will be the target at the expense of local politics gain.Similarly if Sg have racial unrest, I am sure you see MY peace keeper crawling around SG.<br><br>Indians in general have extremely extensive social network connection, and they are ethnically bonded by race.  If this get bloody, A protest in MY by indians will be felt all the way to India.<br><br>We saw in Myanmar that an issue that classifiy as domestics in the 80;s is now regional.....so  anything happen is not going to be business as usual. The emotion felt by the public would be hard to contain.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even though the Indians  on the Malaysian side are more kwailan I dont think this problem is going to escalade into something serious. Other than a part of Sri Lanka and their own Tamil state,they survive by swaying to there the stronger wind blows.That is the Mama philosophy&gt; <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dont think ethnic based mobilization is the way to go. I think they are playing into the hands of UMNO.<br><br>Not to mention whats with the Ghandi pictures and Q.E II ? Somemore this HIDRAF is associated closely to its religion rather then a fight to all indians as a whole.<br><br>Think the hindu indians are making a mistake by projecting such a narrow image.<br><br>Even though thier grievances are real , still.. this will only further reinforce the government to clamp down hard on future protests.<br><br>Thats why thats one of the reason the bar protests were canceled.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Few people in Singapore is aware that thousands and thousands of people died in Hindu-Muslim riots in India when the British left in 1947 and India was divided into 2 states-India/Pakistan......when politics and religion got mixed....<br><br>IF we forget history, we may repeat its mistakes........<br><br>PM Badawi now must make the correct decisions.......the future of Malaysia rest on his shoulders.<br><br>It took Malaysia 40 years to battle the Communists (mainly Chinese).... they cannot afford another battle lasting another 40 years with the Indians.<br><br>Singapore will definately be affected. Even during the Sri Lanka war, Singapore was affected- some of our citizens were arrested under ISA for selling weapons to the Tamil Tigers.
