              <p>Just thought I would share this article here... I think this is well written!</p>
              <p>http://www.tremeritus.com/2012/10/29/casinos-are-the-bane-of-singapore/</p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">In
              2005, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the cabinet’s
              decision to build not one but two “integrated resorts”. This
              decision was met with widespread criticism from the public and
              religious groups. However, PM Lee stated that “As Prime Minister, I
              carry the ultimate responsibility for the decision”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">5
              years later, the casinos were open. Initially, busloads of people
              visited the casinos, most of them foreigners.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">When
              I visited the casinos recently, I discovered that 80% of the cars in
              the Resorts World Sentosa car park were Singapore registered
              vehicles. </span><span style="color: #101211;"><strong>One
              of the main objectives of the casinos was to boost tourism as well as
              create new jobs for Singaporeans.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;"><strong>However,
              I also noticed that most of the staff employed at the casinos,
              restaurants, hotels and theme park were foreigners.</strong></span><span style="color: #101211;"> Therefore, the casinos did not really create much jobs for
              Singaporeans. What percentage of the staff at the integrated resorts
              are actually Singaporeans? What’s more, the higher level jobs such
              as Pit Bosses are usually foreigners.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">I
              am a young working adult and even on a personal level, the casinos
              have affected me greatly. My parents are compulsive gamblers who have
              purchased the annual levy every year since they opened. And I rarely
              get to see them any more, as they visit the casinos as many as six to
              seven times in a week. They neglect their jobs and are only
              interested in gambling. I have tried to counsel them but they were
              very stubborn and unrelenting. To date, they have each lost more than
              50,000 dollars at the casinos.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">I
              strongly feel that there needs to be more safeguards to limit the
              damage caused by the casinos operating in Singapore. The current
              measures put in place are grossly inadequate. For example, the
              government should limit the number of times that Singaporeans can
              visit the casinos to for example, eight times per month. The reason
              for this is that there are people who are going to the casinos almost
              every day and neglecting the families and work. These need to be put
              in place as soon as possible, before it is too late.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">The
              day levy of 100 dollars is also counter productive. As a result of
              trying to recoup the fee, gamblers would bet bigger amounts. It also
              creates an unfair environment for Singaporeans, as foreigners are not
              subjected to this entry fee. As a result of the day levy being 24
              hours, Singaporeans would purchase the levy after work, gamble till
              midnight, skip work the next day just to utilise the full 24 hours.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">Secondly,
              the government has not been very transparent about the negative
              impact of the casinos in Singapore. Based on some investigation and
              insider information from staff, there have been a number of suicides
              related to the casinos that were unreported. For Singaporeans who
              might be considering staying in the resort hotels, do bear in mind
              that some of the rooms are not “clean”. During a stay at one of
              the hotels at one of the casinos, we could hear knocking sounds in
              the walls throughout the night. Besides these, there have been a
              sudden increase in suicides in Singapore this year, such as drownings
              at Bedok Reservoir, MRT tracks and jumping cases. I wonder how many
              of them are possibly gambling related…</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">There
              have also been multiple stories of families that were ruined by
              breakups, suicides or bankruptcy that were not reported in the
              mainstream media. The internet can provide some clues. Although the
              casinos did not force anyone to enter and gamble, by making it so
              easily accessible to Singaporeans, it basically tempts people to go
              in and try their luck. The newspapers only report the news of only
              Singaporeans such as the hawker who won 400k at MBS. This only serves
              to make people think that it is easy to make money at the casinos.
              However, I know of rich people who have lost millions at the casinos
              in a week as well as middle class people who have lost their life
              savings gambling, and had to sell their homes just to feed their
              family.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">Yes,
              although there are a few lucky ones who have won, but overall, 8 out
              of 10 people have lost money there. In 2011, the revenue of MBS and
              RWS was 2.3 billion and 2.6 billion respectively. Note that this is
              not revenue for Singapore. In the casino, I overheard a conversation
              between two elderly women in Hokkien that one of their relatives was
              addicted to gambling. They borrowed money from both loan sharks and
              licensed moneylenders. Being unable to pay their mounting debts, the
              parents “ran road” and left their children behind to fend for
              themselves. I hope this story isn’t true as I really pity the poor
              children.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">One
              day on the way to work, while taking the train on the circle line, I
              overheard two Singaporean uncles chatting:â€¨(Sic)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">“Today,
              I feeling lucky. I think today sure win big”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">“You
              sure? How come?”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">“Last
              night I dreamt that I win a lot of money.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">“Wah.
              Win already treat me dinner ah.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">“Ok
              no problem, if I win big, abalone and sharks fin also can!”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">I
              hope he had enough money to return home. More safeguards are needed
              to protect Singaporean families from the vice of casino gambling.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">A)
              Limiting the number of visits by Singaporeans to a maximum of eight
              times a month. In order to visit the casinos beyond that limit, they
              have to submit proof of their financial stability to the regulatory
              authority for approval.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">B)
              Implementing closing hours for the casino (between 4am to 6 am) so
              that people would not gamble non-stop for days on end without
              sleeping and fainting in the casino.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">C)
              Reduce the levy from 100 dollars for 24 hours to 100 dollars for 12
              hours. This is because the 24 hours hour levy encourages people to
              stay longer at the casinos and as a result, lose more money.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">D)
               Scrap the annual levy at the casinos. The annual levy actually
              encourages Singaporeans to visit the casinos very often as they can
              enter whenever they like. Each time Singaporeans visit the casinos,
              they should have to pay the entry levy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">E)
              The current proposed safeguards only serve to protect those who are
              clearly at risk, such as undischarged bankrupts or those on financial
              aid. However, those people who are earning a low salary below 1500
              dollars have little money to spare, and probably no savings.
              Therefore, only people who have a certain level of income should be
              allowed to visit the casinos more than a certain number of times per
              month.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">F)
              Better management of crime related activities at the casinos. My male
              friends as well as myself have witnessed multiple instance as well as
              been approached by foreign women offering “special services”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">G)
              There are also other forms of vice there, such as stealing other
              people’s chips, mobile phones, handbags, fraud and claiming other
              people’s winnings.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">H)
              Poor security measures at the casinos. There have been people who
              used other people’s identity cards to enter the casino.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">I)
              Allow family members, relatives, employers to have greater ability to
              apply for exclusion for someone that they know that is at a risk for
              gambling. For example, currently, children of problem gamblers find
              it hard to apply for exclusion for their parents as their parents
              would warn them not to.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">J)
              Parents leave their children waiting outside the casino with nothing
              to do. I saw children sitting down on the floor outside the casinos
              looking bored. Two hours later, they were still there.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">K)
              The casinos’ impact on Singaporeans’ lives needs to be better
              studied.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">L)
              The government should release the employment figures of the ratio of
              Singaporeans and PRs employed versus the foreigners.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in;"><span style="color: #101211;">M)
              Overall, I feel that the casinos and integrated resorts have brought
              more disadvantages than advantages for Singapore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">Problems
              such as proxy gambling have also cropped up. Employers send their
              foreign workers to the casinos to gamble on their behalf. These
              foreign workers are being exploited by their unscrupulous employers
              who even dock their salary when they lose money. The government needs
              to acknowledge that there have been shortcomings on their part and
              not claim that things are “well managed” and “under control”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">Nowadays,
              instead of spending time with their families, religious places or
              sports, gambling is becoming the new national pastime of many adult
              Singaporeans. Is Singapore becoming a SIN city? Should the casinos be
              shut down for good? I think that as a government, you cannot only
              look at GDP and ignore the social problems. Otherwise, you would be
              operating as a profit oriented company, Singapore Private Limited.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #101211;">The
              three buildings of MBS were said to be inspired by card decks.
              However, to me, they may very well represent three tombstones for
              Singapore if they are not managed appropriately. And the boat? I
              think it represents Singaporeans’ hard earned money being shipped
              away. I can only hope for the best for Singapore.</span></p>

              <p>Are you sure there are <strong>one million visits by locals </strong>to genting and cruise ships before the casinos in Singapore were opened? Cruise ships can have one million visits?</p>
              <p>Secondly, most of the cruise ship casinos are only open a few hours a day (have closing hours), not 24/7 like the casinos in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Agreed. This is like blaming money is evil when it is actually people who are at fault.</p>
              <p>I do gamble too, but only $1 per week in the toto draws and $3 per month in sg sweep. It all boils down to self control of individual. There is nothing wrong with gambling when you are able to control yourself. It's just a little leisure.</p>

              <p>You use statistic and make conclusion. How about this, before the two integrated resorts were built in Singapore, no Singaporean visit casino in Singapore, after the resorts were built, ONE MILLION SINGAPOREAN visit casino in Singapore, an increase of XXXX times.</p>
              <p>I have never been to the casino in Singapore, but I do know in my estate here go there to pass time. I know many clubs' income from jackpot has reduced significantly.</p>
              <p>I parked my cars at the resort car park to go universal studio and dinner at MBS. Me counted as gambler?</p>
              <p>I can't provide solution to the social problem such as gambling, but I do know that if your parents are compulsive gamblers, it is your duty to restrain them. It is your responsibility to ensure that your family won't sink and your money don't get gambled away.</p>
              <p>I empathize with you if you feel helpless because your parents won't listen to you. After all, if they feel it is their money they can do with it anyway they want, you just have to settle for the fact that your won't get any inheritance.</p>
              <p>Don't link your fate to Singapore.</p>

It makes my blood boil whenever I read how people complain that casinos are making them or their closed ones gamble their lives away. How is it anyone else's fault except themselves? No one's forcing them to gamble but it is the innate greed that compels them to do so.</div>
