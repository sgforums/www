            <div class='col-md body'>Politics sadly to say it a game of power where if you are in power, if you are a politician, you will also do everything to hand on to your power while  your opposition will do everything to topple you isn't it?<br><br>Every policy there will always be two face to it the good and the flaw. There is no such thing as a perfect policy so no matter who is in power, there will always be criticism to every policy.<br><br>While our present goverment may not be the best, but certainly they have been governing Singapore for the past 40 years which result us to reach where we are now as compare to 40 years ago. Even though not all decision made by them is good, but still our economic is growing and we are moving forward.<br><br>So if they can keep moving this country forward, i don't see why they shouldn't be in power and instead let some other that does not have the experience to take over which will place us with a more uncertainty future.<br><br>It always good to have opposition around to give their side of view as the goverment do not always do the right thing, so with opposition around, they will and hopefully will see the flaws of their policy and try to come up with a better one.<br><br>In life there can't be smooth sailing and expect everything to be perfect. Compared to most countries, we are indeed very fortunate already so what more can we ask for?<br><br>For example, many thing that australian are earning alot and their houses are cheap, but in fact there are many that still renting houses from real estate agency. So even though our houses are pretty expensive and it take a pretty long time to pay it off, still we have our own houses, so what more can you ask for?<br><br>In short, we won't and we can't understand why goverment do this and do that unless we are in their shoes for we all have our own thinking which will not always be fully understood by others.</div>

THe problem with letting them stay in power for too long is that they may atrophy. They may not realize, as former DPM Tony Tan points out, tha they need to change the core of their policy to keep the nation afloat in social or economic sense. In fact, we are already seeing this inertia in their refusal for example, to expand freedoms, to accept the criticisms of accredited international watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders, and of the Australian govenrment recently. The same thing has occured with their response to the WP manifesto.<br><br>5) ermm...

Our generation are the ones more likely to step outside the boundary of thought and ideas, a boundary that the Ruling party has so created and whom now blame us for a lack of creativity.<br><br>Now is as good a time as any to 'poke holes' in their propaganda, to show the people that there exists other possibilities, other opportunities and certainly other parties than the 'infallible' PAP, and if successful, could lead to the formation of a coalition govt, which will become a impartial check unto itself.<br><br>Over 40 years ago, when MM LKY first asked singaporeans to trust him to lead them into the future, the PAP was an untried and untested party with no experience in government, with policies where success was far from certain.<br><br>Today, the WP is simply asking for the same trust. With a new party leadership and creditable party members, we should at least hear their game plan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear ahtansh,<br><br>I think this is a good question. The battle could only be lost if your mind has already surrendered. Look at the Vietcongs in the Vietnam War. Nobody back then in the early days of the Vietnam War could ever imagine the almighty US Army would lose the war. The Vietcongs, in your very own words, were fighting a losing battle.... at least that's what everybody back then thought. On hindsight, everybody now knows that it is not the advanced weaponry that will help anyone to win the war, it will be the "mind" that will determine the outcome of the war.<br><br>As for why I want to fight a "seemingly" losing battle, I will put it in four simple forms:<br><br>1) Social consciousness to political consciousness.<br>2) Sense of social justice.<br>3) Non-conformist.<br>4) My children.<br><br>I have been active socially in various ways back from my schooling days till I join WP. It takes a gradual path from social consciousness to cultivate the political consciousness. Believe it or not, I was active in community centre back then. After being disillusioned by this "grassroot organization", I volunteer myself to charitable organization. Why disillusioned? Mr. Low's reply to the grassroot leader has explained it all. The fact that these grassroot organizations being totally "politicised" make someone like me (back then) who are not interested in PAP politics but just want to serve the community feel totally disgusted.<br><br>It was in 1997 GE when PAP brought up the HDB upgrading as "carrots" for voters to vote for PAP that invoke my great sense of social justice. I was outraged basically because such moves will destroy Singapore as it sets the social atmosphere into a totally individualistic and materialistic one. I do not want my future generation, especially my children to be cultivated under such social structure and atmosphere of materialism. This is the first seed of political awakening for me.<br><br>In 2001, PAP's further pepertuation of HDB upgrading with "PRECINCT COUNTING" irks me. I was debating with an old PAP veteran in soc.culture.singapore about why PAP's "time bomb" should not be allowed to continue, he challenged me that why would I want to support an opposition camp that does not seem to have any "working faculties" at all. In my heart, I wanted a more balanced and diversed democratic system but my head tells me that that PAP veteran has a point.<br><br>Thus the only logical conclusion for me is that I will have only two options left:<br><br>1) Shut up and prepare to migrate out in order to find a better place with a better social atmosphere to nurture my children and future generation.<br><br>2) Join the alternative party and make it works.<br><br>After a week of pondering, I decided to join Workers' Party and the rest is history.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ahtansh:</div><div class="quote_body">With Goh Meng Seng starting this thread.
