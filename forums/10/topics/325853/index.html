              <p>I thought this was a dead issue but there was a blog post that argued that Malaysia and Singapore should be united as one country. The argument, I think (it's not a very short post) was that the two countries strengths were complimentary and that both were "evolving" in ways that made it a good time now (yeah, despite all the bad blood and issues unresolved) for the two countries to re-merge.</p>
              <p>Anyway pullout-ing from the post (whoever interested can go to <a title="Mum and Singapore should be one country" href="http://mumsthewordorpa.blogspot.com/2008/07/malaysia-and-singapore-should-be-one.html">http://mumsthewordorpa.blogspot.com/2008/07/malaysia-and-singapore-should-be-one.html</a>):</p>
              <p>"...the respective visions illuminating their paths to progress are wildly
              at odds: One celebrates the importance of merit and ability, the other
              harks back to historical injustices in enshrining the rights and
              privileges of one community.<br><br>However, there is a remarkable
              confluence of broad trends evident at the moment, that the more
              far-seeing leaders from both sides might seize upon as a spur to act.
              In Malaysia, there is a growing willingness to revise the racial-based
              architecture that has defined the political discourse for decades, in
              favour of race-blind meritocracy and needs-based assistance. Singapore
              is reaching the limits of what it can achieve as a tiny spit of land,
              however competent its leadership and even though incremental
              improvements may still be possible. There is also a greater desire
              among its people for a less claustrophobic civic environment. In each
              case, the arrows are pointing to the neighbour as a source of
              inspiration, example and simple living space.<br><br>Yin and yang,
              then. If the strengths of the two nations could be fused, the resultant
              entity would be a far more formidable competitor in the global arena,
              and - perhaps more importantly - a richer social tapestry for each
              citizen to weave in his individual contribution. The excessive
              tendencies of each would be restrained by the other, whether this be a
              certain coldness masquerading as efficiency or a chaotic joyousness
              without sufficient direction."</p>
              <p>My own thought is that it would be very difficult and will take a long time, but also that it may be worth a try to enlarge Singapore's defensible space.</p>

              <p>I think this is very unlikely.</p>
              <p>Maybe regionalism in a form of free-trade agreements, closer ASEAN integration, etc, that is still possible, and I believe this is the trend that is going to take place in the future, not just among Singapore-Malaysia but more.</p>
              <p>But to be one country, I dont think so.</p>
              <p>The reason is the population.</p>
              <p>If we look at history, only countries which share similar demographics will willingly merge, for instance West Germany-East Germany, or even Bellarusia-Russia which form a kind of Union, because they share a common affinity or common identity towards each other.</p>
              <p>If we look at Singapore and Malaysia, it cannot be argued that the demographic is similar.</p>
              <p>For this reason alone, no merging will ever be possible.</p>

              When I read your post, I had this crazy idea.  lets unite for awhile, i.e. until the PAP and UMNO have sued each other bankrupt, sodomised each other, thrown each other in jail, etc, etc.  then we can split again and wipe the slate clean.
              
              Nah, it won't happen.  Just like we won't be one country again.

              Wasn't it reported in Channel News Asia or somewhere that it was LKY himself who floated this idea.  and his good ole nemesis Mahathir said the timing was not right.  This was sometime in 1995/96.

              <p>Well, for starters we can't even tolerate each other as neighbors across a shallow waterway, much less being part of the same nation - living under the same banner, with common goals and a common creed.Â </p>
              <p>The argument that a confluence of trends opens up the possibility of merger makes a good argument. Certainly merger can help both parties serves their ends - for us it's a need to rejuvenate a near stagnating economy, for them it would be a new impetus to wipe out old structures of race-driven politics. But to each of those ends agendas seperate goals and motivations of which the solution of merger might serve to fulfill, but also carries with it the bitter memory of failure.Â </p>
              <p>Should merger fail to serve both parties interest eventually, would the old lines of division resurface? Ad what will then become of these confluence of trends, but ammunition for the merchants of division who's source of power lie in stiring Â up these very divisions?Â </p>
              <p>I for one agree with MeatPao and Display Name, that greater regionalism is the way forward - an integrated Asean model without the inclination towards nationalistic fervor.Â </p>
