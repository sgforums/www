              <p>We need to survive in this harsh world. We need $$$. Who will pay  billions of dollars in singapore to look at worms for 20 years!? Research projects are most likely truncated when there is no significant results seen within a year. That is how singapore work.</p>

              <p>I don't really think it's somehow a racial thing.</p>
              <p>That's like saying Hwa Chong, River Valley and RI produces top students because it has an excellent educational system.</p>
              <p>But anyone familar with the PSLE system could tell when the system send students who are already top of their classes to a single or a few selected institution of course it's going to continue producing top scholars.</p>
              <p>Currently any significant breakthrough in scientific research requires a massive amount of funding because of the cost to run the experiments, and only the Western countries could really afford to give the universities that sort of money and most importantly pay salaries that can't be matched anywhere else in the world.</p>
              <p>Your average brilliant Chinese and Indian researcher who is tired of facing limited budgets and lousy salaries would naturally be attracted to the West because as a fact it just pays better and they get to conduct experiments/buy equipment that their own local universites could never afford. </p>
              <p>This creates a negative feedback loop( i hope i used the correct term here!), as the top brains from the "backward" Asian countries flow to the Western countries continue to fuel innovations and scientific progression thus providing the patents and inventions to continue paying top dollar for them.</p>
              <p>And of course, there is the quality of peers they are surrounded by. For scientists the work environment is more enjoyable if you're working together with people who are just as creative and intelligent as you yes?</p>
              <p>I quote Fareed Zakaria from his book "The Post American World". There was a time where people thought Hinduism and Confucism were incompatible with Capitalism.</p>

              <p><span>In terms of technological/scientific development,
              it's my theory that Asians will never be creative enough to produce
              something so innovative that it could be qualified for a Nobel
              prize, unless they're immersed in an utterly different, liberalized
              environment in the western nations.<br> <br> <span>http://asianhistory.about.com/od/profilesofasianleaders/tp/nobelprizewinners.htm</span><br> <br> Look at the list here, all of them were awarded for some kind of
              exceptional political effort, or effort for world peace. Will a
              Singaporean be awarded for political effort? HA! Fat chance. Even
              our best politicians are utter deadbeats. Effort for world peace?
              Singaporeans are only capable of responding "Come to Singapore
              lah!" and then start to complain when they have too many foreigners
              coming to Singapore for that aforementioned peace.<br> <br> What of technological development? Look at the history of
              technological development in ancient China. Only the inventor of
              paper, Imperial Court official Tsai Lun is known. What of the
              compass, rudder, gunpowder, silk, or even umbrella? All unknown!
              The Chinese were more preoccupied with the obsessive chase to excel
              at the Imperial exams and become a government official. Even
              popular Chinese martial arts folklore will always talk about the
              guy with the awesome manual who will learn an amazing skill from it
              and beat the shit out of everyone else. Technological inventions?
              What? Nobody cares about that! Let's all just become an official
              and grow fat from corruption!<br> <br> Do you see the parallels between ancient China and Singapore now?
              Singaporeans would love to get a government or PSC scholarship, get
              an education for free and fly back for an iron rice bowl in the
              civil service. Even better, become a Member of Parliament or Prime
              Minister! Who cares about researching technology?! That's not as
              productive as being a doctor or a lawyer. <img style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Wink" src="http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=""><br> <br> You may say, but NEWater! What about those Asians in the western
              environment you speak of. Have they won any Nobel prizes?<br> <br> <span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asian_Americans#Science</span><br> <br> One of the notable Nobel prize winner to cite: Steven Chu, present
              United States Secretary of Energy. His whole family came from
              China, and curiously enough, the whole lot of them became
              professors. All his siblings are professors, and even his aunt who
              came from China with her feet mini-bound, also, became a
              professor.</span></p>

              <p>The true character of the people is what kind of country that it has build for itself.</p>
              <p>First of foremost will be the political culture that sets the tone and create the environment that challenges the status quo of everything - to have the young to ask questions, to have the people ask questions, to have transparency in the system, to have information available that lessons are learnt from past experiences, to have an environment that allows for unfettered creativities, to encourage the seeking of Truth.</p>
              <p>Can we compare ourselves with the other First World Countries, where their systems may not be perfect, but at least will feature the political tolerance that guarantee the free space for the status quo to be challenged by the Citizens ?</p>
