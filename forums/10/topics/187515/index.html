            <div class='col-md body'>During the three prolonged recessions during the period 1997-2001, the leaders were in despair over many problems e.g. high costs of living, anti-business environments, anti-business pro-foreign investments and job policies. (Read various feedbacks posted to Feedback Unit).<br><br>Singapore has become uncompetitive as compared with competitions whether from China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan , Korea or even Vietnam.<br><br>Many Singapore's SMEs and domestic sector companies have closed shops and many continue to go under due to high costs.<br><br>The old economic strategy and other major government policies since 1970s did not work. The pro-foreign and the same tax-and-recover system of government could not produce competitiveness.<br><br>Government has been charging double on lands and triple on vehicle ownership amounting to some $500,000 - $800,000 per household life-cycle to build reserves without any corresponding plan to benefit the people in using these reserves to lower costs of living or creating a value-adding technology-driven new economy. The private sector suffers from squeeze of liquidity and losses of economic and social vibrancy. Such old policies did not change driving away our people's entrepreneurial spirits.<br><br>The following are 20 major policy errors as posted to the feedback unit demanded urgent solutions :-<br><br>(1) Bureaucracy in civil service.<br>(2) High costs of essential government services e.g. medical, utilities, housing, transportation, education, etc, etc<br>(3) Failure of Growth Triangles<br>(4) Affective divide causing a general apathy in political participation.<br>(5) Persistent Work site safety problems (Despite all the commissions of inquiry such as the Hotel New World and Nicol Highway collapse)<br>(6) Failure to Deliver the Swiss standard of living<br>(7) Asset enhancement scheme fiasco<br>(8 ) Unit trust investment fiasco<br>(9) Foreign relation fiascos<br>(10) Failure to implement value-adding economic restructuring strategy<br>(11) Double-charging on lands (already acquired under Land Acquisition Act and paid by taxpayers) and triple charges on vehicles.<br>(12) Meritocratic policy over-emphasising on academic talents causing neglect of practical talents and mass participation - brain drains of thousands<br>(13) Mother tongue fiasco - CL1 admission criterion causing major brain drain.<br>(14) No sign of reaching World Cup soccer league by 2010.<br>(15) Losses of CPF retirement nesteggs in various schemes by senior citizens.<br>(16) Goh Keng Swee wage-push doctrine for ministers and civil service resulting in over-inflation of public sector wages posing a burden to the economy.<br>(17) Non-implementation of good corporate governance based on accountability and transparency e.g. pro-foreign job and investment policies investments of surpluses in overseas investments.<br>(18 ) Loss of economic competitiveness due to high costs of living and doing business.<br>(19) Neglect in promoting entrepreneurship<br>(20) Neglect in nurturing domestic sector of economy.<br><br>These major policy errors were still so far not admitted or seriously addressed. If Singapore is truly run by talented people which are world-class then these should be admitted and solved urgently.</div>
