Afterall, in the example cited, the housewife's husband is making $6000 to $10,000 a month. And her children are all grown up.<br><br>How many of the ordinary folks are earning this amount?<br><br>Let's hope the homemakers will continue to support our govt. despite this mistake.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>March 4, 2006<br>PAP MPs do take sittings of Parliament seriously<br><br>I REFER to Mr Christopher Teo Kian Lam's letter 'MPs should make time for Budget debate' (ST, March 2).<br><br>I would like to assure Mr Teo that PAP MPs take Parliament sittings very seriously. They have to seek the Speaker's permission to be absent from a sitting. They also have to inform the Government Whip if they are unable to attend Parliament on time or have to leave earlier.<br><br>During the Budget debate and Committee of Supply, Parliament sits from 12 noon to 7pm.<br><br>While PAP MPs are expected to be in Parliament throughout the sitting, they may not be able to be in the chamber for the full seven hours.<br><br>They will have to leave the chamber from time to time for lunch, do research for their speeches, revise their speeches according to the flow of the debate, respond to urgent calls or even attend brief urgent meetings which they cannot reschedule. So even if they are not in the chamber, it does not mean that they are not in Parliament or not contributing to the business of Parliament.<br><br>As we had explained previously, PAP MPs should not be judged by how long they remain seated in the chamber but by their participation in debates and the quality of their speeches and how well they serve their constituents.<br><br>PAP MPs do more than attend Parliament. They also have to discharge their duties in their constituencies, town councils, parliamentary committees, GPCs and many other similar duties.<br><br>Lim Swee Say<br>Deputy Government Whip<br><br>I am very disappointed that for the Budget 2006 on not rewarding the various MPs that were too busy to attend the Budget Debate as explained by the Mr whip.<br><br>They have taken "taken the Budget Debate" so seriously that they have decided to sit out for the discussion.<br><br>That is why they are not happy that the "slave-driven and cheap" singaporeans that slogged day and night were rewarded instead of themselves.<br><br>Maybe Mr Whip should inform the MPs to attend some time management course to determine what is the priority of the task.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anything that is scheduled for debate in Parliament has already been decided beforehand.
