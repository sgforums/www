              <p>Speaking about their religious beliefs is freedom of speech, no? Salman Rushdie made disparaging remarks about prophet Muhammed...some call that his basic freedom of speech. The Danish cartoonist call;ed the prophet a terrorist...many call that basic freedom of speech. The anti-semitic book 'Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion' is a hoax but some argue that it should not be banned because everyone is entitled to free speech, no matter how obnoxious.</p>
              <p>What is basic freedom of speech? Who draws the line at the limits? Society does. And those who would live in Singapore must respect the boundaries that Singaporeans have decided for ourselves.</p>

              <p>First of all, I want to start off by saying I am also a member
              of an evengelist church in Singapore and I am
              absolutely disgusted at the way some members of the church
              hold youth evengelistic events in the name of the church.</p>
              <p>1 - conducted like an MLM event, using people's greed, peer
              pressure, guilt to force people to join. visitors contact
              information recorded, conduct background checks on visitors, hold
              planning sessions to discuss strategies on how to get a
              person to convert, specific stategies for each individual
              person based on the results of the background checks and the
              person's personality, rehersals to make sure each converting
              attempt is done without mistakes</p>
              <p>2 - bad mouthing other religions/beliefs</p>
              <p>3 - giving cash (to Muslims converting to Christianity)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really hope these people rot in hell, choosing a belief is a
              choice. I am fine at preaching and trying to convince others
              that Christianity is the way to go but when people resort to all
              these low down methods, it really pisses me off</p>

              <p>I agree with you that its freaking disgusting to see these people forcing others to convert. On the other hand, take a look at Mother Theresa. She was able to convert many through her kindness and love. She did not force people to convert to her religion too.</p>
              <p>Now again, look at the way these people convert. Forcing and condemn people who are not of their religions. You know now who is the saint and who is not.</p>

              <p>If freedom has a boundary, then can it truly be freedom? Can you be free when you are tied up at the same time? Very contradictory.</p>
              <p>Freedom of speech applies when you speak of something that applies to yourself, and affects yourself.</p>
              <p>When you say something that affects others, its something beyond just freedom of speech, it couples the power to influence.  That power unfortunately, is not given to everyone.  There is a very big difference between freedom and power.</p>

              <p>I agree with you Wilson....Christianity is all about faith, hope and love. Mother Teresa convert by actions - doing what Jesus asked his believers to do. Her actions converted many and she need no rock concert and pep talks to thousands.....</p>
              <p>Sadly, many Christians think they are envagelising by doing stupid things in God's name and instead of converting, they turn more people away from Christ.</p>
              <p>They do leave many non-believers with the wrong impression of the faith - which is kind of sad.....</p>
