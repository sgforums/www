              <p>A Singaporean couple has been charged with sedition
              after allegedly distributing evangelistic material deemed offensive to
              Muslims, a newspaper said Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Ong Kian Cheong and his wife Dorothy Chan Hien Leng are accused of
              handing out a publication that cast the Prophet Muhammad in a "negative
              light," The Straits Times newspaper said, without giving details.</p>
              <p>They each face charges under the Sedition Act and the Undesirable Publications Act, it said..........</p>

              <p>If one is to pass by certain religion places of worship say on Friday one will no doubt come across very often rampant illegal parking outside such places of worship with no actions taken by the traffic police.</p>
              <p>On the other hand very often illegal parking outside other religious places are not excused and many similar illegal parking are summoned with traffic fines. An MP to my knowledge even approach one of the religious place to counsel its members not to park illegally along the certain residential areas.</p>
              <p>Given such unequal treatments among religions one wonder in the event say insults were made the other way by the extreme religion against certain meeker religions' prophet will the extremist religion's members be taken to court.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is fair to treat religions on equal footing and not be over-protective of any particular religions. Judging by the way illegal parking was allowed for certain religion and not others certainly there is a concern among citizens that the government does not appear to act fairly so far unless it is a case of citizens being ill informed or mistaken.</p>

              <p>First of all, I want to start off by saying I am also a member of an evengelist church in Singapore and I am absolutely disgusted at the way some members of the church hold youth evengelistic events in the name of the church.</p>
              <p>1 - conducted like an MLM event, using people's greed, peer pressure, guilt to force people to join. visitors contact information recorded, conduct background checks on visitors, hold planning sessions to discuss strategies on how to get a person to convert, specific stategies for each individual person based on the results of the background checks and the person's personality, rehersals to make sure each converting attempt is done without mistakes</p>
              <p>2 - bad mouthing other religions/beliefs</p>
              <p>3 - giving cash (to Muslims converting to Christianity)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really hope these people rot in hell, choosing a belief is a choice. I am fine at preaching and trying to convince others that Christianity is the way to go but when people resort to all these low down methods, it really pisses me off</p>

              <p>I really hope these people rot in hell, choosing a belief is a
              choice. I am fine at preaching and trying to convince others
              that Christianity is the way to go but when people resort to all
              these low down methods, it really pisses me off</p>

              <p>The attendees are all church members and their friends. Would you report a friend and get them into trouble?</p>
              <p>If you are still in your teens and a friend ask you to join their service or cell/care group session, tag along and see what happens. The strategy mentioned is targeted on youth/teen group as this age group is shown to be easily influnenced.</p>
