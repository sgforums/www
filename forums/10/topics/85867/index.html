What have we gained so far from LHL's visit?<br><br>To LHL, it is better to visit Taiwan before he became PM, but on the other side, Taiwan, China and US are conducting major war games in the area, is that a good time to visit Taiwan, the US 7th fleet commander or China?? If you know two ganster parties are preparing for war in Geylang like before (just example), do you want to take a bus there, just to show you have the right of Singaporean to visit any part of Singapore??<br><br>Of course Singapore is a sovereign country but does LHL think he should also visit Yasser Arafat in the west bank before he becomes PM?<br><br>What exactly is the interest of Singapore in this instance? I would agree if Teo Chee Hian went to talk about the Starlight operation, but since when LHL has any friends in Taiwan?</div>
