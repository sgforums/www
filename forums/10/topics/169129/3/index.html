Nowadays the opposition candidates not strong, not like when in 1998, Francis Seow staged a rally in Eunos GRC, wah the crowd was fantastic, all the roads were congested, but TV news, and newspapers did not report, and the result came out to be 47% something, and Francis Seow was the NCMP bur the Goverment had the parliament renovated and Francis Seow lost the chance to enter parliement and after that he was convicted of not paying income tax.<br>I followed the GE alomost 20 years and every opposition rallies, i certainly attended, among them were the rallies of JBJ,Tang Liang Hong, Francis SEow, Chiam See Tong, Lee Siow Cho, Chee Soon Juan, Low Thia Kiang, Chia THye Poh, those are the heavyweight, the not so famous were Wong Hong Toy, Ling How Dong, Jufrie Mahmood, Kahlid Baboo, P.D Nair, Yip Yew Weng, etc. I think only Francis Seow can fight with Lee Kuan Yew, u see the debate, for the amendment to the Law Society Act which were telecast live, LKY looked not stable when debate with Francis Seow. But one thing he does not like politics. that is true, PAP found out he is a womaniser, so PAP will dig out all the past if the opposition is strong, e g Dr Tan Bin Seng case. so that is no end.....</div>

It's just as simple as one who thinks highly of himself or self-important. Quote "......dismisses others as idioits.." It's exaggerated.<br><br>While you commented on GMS's writing on shouting, exclamation mark, capitals, etc, do read your own posting first, yeah? Stop calling others "loose cannon" and you odd to know that any names other than your own name (or nicks), they are insulting.<br><br>Still don't get it?</div></blockquote>Archidoron,<br><br>I don't wish to talk about this in this thread any more after this.<br><br>1) As is always said, the devil is in the details: how do you determine whether someone is thinking too highly of himself without misunderstanding the entire situation?<br><br>2) *sigh* When I write my posts, I ensure that the language and content are as calm, cool and objective as possible. Look at my post around this forum. Except for a few instances where some people - I hope it will not include you soon - drove me to the end of my wits, my posts are generally topic-focused and informative to the best of my ability. I performed a linguistic analysis/ critique on GMS's post; I didn't merely accuse him of "poor grammar" or "poor English" or something like that.<br><br>As for the "loose canon" phrase which you find  extremely insulting, I'll inform you politely that I chose the least insulting term to describe such a behaviour. Kindly compare "loose canon" with "purile" or with any other of your comments on GMS and Cindyfeh. For your convenience, I shall list them:-<br><br>a. "just trying to hit and run"<br><br>b. "untactful" Compared with Chia Li Tik, I can see that GMS is much more diplomatic and tactful.<br><br>c. "any quality in you"<br><br>d. "you are doing more damages than good for the opposition camp"<br><br>e. "roll in the mud and dirty yourself"<br><br>f. "If you can't sweet-talk, you can forget about being in politics" FYI, friend, many famous historical leaders were straight-talkers e.g. Napoleon Bonaparte, Hitler, Churchill, Caesar, Pope John Paul II... For those that were voted in, it is because the strength of their convictions resonated in their voters. For eg, Churchill was respected for his tough line against Germany; he didn't float presents down London Chimneys.<br><br>g. "you can drown yourself in your own poo"<br><br>h. "plain stupidity ... go stick your nose in others' arses."<br><br>i. "brave heroes" - if you're not going to contest, at least respect those who are. Whatever their shortfalls, at least they show more courage than you.<br><br>Please mark out which of these nine comments is less insulting than "loose canon". Enough said.<br><br>3) I suspect you don't get it. Seriously, you are beginning to remind me of CAROLINE1021 from Sintercom. And tt's no good.<br><br>Cheers<br>and<br>may the spirit of the new year remove your grouchiness,<br><br>the (festive &amp; democratic) pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Why is the updated Worker's Party Manifesto not published online?</span></span></strong><br><br>Thanks to PAP, now the WorkerÂ’s Party Manifesto has captured the headlines in the local news.  However, I bet that the majority of Singaporeans have not read the manifesto yet, but only the reduced interpretation of it. PAP has played its cards well, selecting the weakest points to launch their attack. Aided by the media, the campaign to discredit the strongest opposition party is on.<br><br>If WP chooses to fight on the ground chosen by PAP, it is at a serious disadvantage since few have read the manifesto and draw their interpretations through the press. WP should get people to see the forest instead of the trees. I suggest that WP take advantage of this unsolicited marketing and release the WP 2006 manifesto online so that Singaporeans can learn about their other objectives, since it is a hot topic now.<br><br>It may dent sales of printed copies of the manifesto, but it will raise WPÂ’s publicity and allow the people to decide.  Anyway, i think people tend to buy the manifesto more as a show of support  than as a "for value" buy.<br></div>
