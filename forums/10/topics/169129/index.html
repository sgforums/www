            <div class='col-md body'>Other than contesting as an opposition or casting your vote wisely, there is another thing that a singaporean can do<br><br>- Educate others, especially people over 40 yrs old with little education.<br><br>1.<br>She should educate her parents and elderly relatives and friends that they are NEVER the owner of their HDB flats. Tell them the fact is that they or their children or grandchildren will LOSE ALL their monies "invested" in their HDB flats.<br><br>2.<br>Bring the elderlies to hawker centres and show them how other elderlies are working hard to survive. Show them newspapers articles that elderlies in Switzerland are retiring nicely.<br><br>3.<br>If the elderlies do not want to listen to you, treat them to a coffee with some elderly <strong>taxi drivers</strong>. Elderlies tend to believe in their own group of people.<br><br>Point 3 should be the most effective. When you are out visiting relatives during Chinese/Malay new year with your parents, talk to the taxi drivers. The drivers should be able to educate your parents well.<br><br>Remember, don't argue too much with your parents, else it will achieve an opposite effect. Educate them base on their love for you and their grandchildren.<br><br>In short, just tell them "for the sake of your children and grandchildren, vote wisely".</div>

There are indeed many people who are as qualified as you are who think the same way. I also mean it when I say you are a person who are socially and politically conscious, else you will not be writing in forums like this one. I empathize with you very much basically because I was just like you before I joined WP.... an armchair critic on the net. When I sounded harsh to you, I am actually being harsh to my old self and it serves a strong reminder why I am in WP and what am I fighting for. I also mean it when I say "you have the loser mindset", these don't contradict.<br><br>You may be highly educated, most probably have higher qualifications than I do but you are deprived of the real feel on the ground basically because you lack the exposure and experience in participating in the process itself. Qualified you may be, but igonrance that you are, in terms of<br>"opposition politics". No pune intended, it is not entirely your fault but the lack of experiences and exposures.<br><br>I would say that I reserve my sarcasm to the ruling party, not a layman like you.
