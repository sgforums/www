Put it this way, all of us must learn to accept the fact that we might just be proven wrong sometime. As I have explained, my reply is pretty down to earth and straight forward. No need to put flowery words in it. But at the same time, there isn't any "emotional" element in it; at least when I write them, I do not have any bit of bad emotions in doing so.<br><br>It would be better for you to listen to me DIRECTLY instead of just reading the words as text. Plain text could mean very differently when spoken with different tone.<br><br>Well, you could be angry with me, that's alright. But the fact is that you have little to rebut me on my hard cruel points.

It is easy for people to make suggestion without making due considerations.<br><br>I have NEVER DENY that AT THIS VERY MOMENT, alternative or non-PAP parties ARE VERY VERY WEAK; thus, we need more people like you with a good social-political consciousness to JOIN or help out, not merely standing on the sideline to make suggestions and comments.<br><br>We may not LOSE every deposits, not even losing ANY deposits but the fact is, YOU NEED THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY FIRST right before you could enter into the field! This is the NECESSARY conditions to be met first! Put it another way, if you have $1 million would you want to lend it to us in the very place? We will return it to you if we did not lose any deposits, deal? How many people in Singapore would lend us that kind of money?<br><br>We are prepared BOTH to win and/or lose. This should be the correct mindset. Even so, we still need the "entry fee" of $1million!<br><br>If you are talking about long term, then you would not be asking us to field all seats! We could find the ALL the candidates  we wamt but of what quality? If most people of quality like you shy away from participation, then naturally there will only be "lousy" candidates left!<br><br>I would say you have the loser mindset, not me. At least I chose to fight on, get dirty in the mud but you have no committal to help in any ways but resigned to spoil your vote!<br><br>We have long term strategy, but a very REALISTIC one. PAP didn't field all seats when they first started. They are being realistic. At this moment, we are starting from scratch, all over again. Thus, we could only do our best to field as many good candidates we have but the cruel truth is, there are many people out there like you, prefer not to do anything except spoiling your votes. Thus, it is not possible for us to field all seats right now and WE as a nation have to live with it, you included.<br><br>This is chicken and egg thing. If you are not prepared to help or join us, then please don't complain "opposition is weak".

Rational people wouldn't have to shout, tt is type words in Caps. If you are angry, you are expressing emotion.<br><br>1) The word "hard" itself shows that you are imposing your views on the person you're talking to, i.e. Archidoron. That's not being cool and polite.<br><br>2) if you wish to be more calm, you can drop modifiers:  "very very", "never", "very", "merely". The last sentence fragment shows a looking-down on other people (i.e. Archidoron). And if I may add - to no intended offence - that last sentence is exactly what the PAP says when it is alleged as not listening to public feedback.<br><br>3) Scrap the first sentence. In fact, cut the entire paragraph. An entire paragraph of presumptions is not the staple of rational discourse.<br><br>4) Cut the exclamation mark.<br><br>5) Cut the exclamation mark, "all" and "shy away".<br><br>6) No need to stress "realistic"; if your argument is strong enough, people will naturally see the main point. No need to stress the "We" either.
