            <div class='col-md body'>A keen eye on GE bloggers, but touch gets lighter<br>Loh Chee Kong<br>cheekong@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>NOT a single blogger faces any Government action for postings during the recent General Election and yes, even the Minister for Information, Communications and The Arts enjoyed the popular podcast that spoofed the James Gomez saga.<br>.<br>In fact the Government, which placed restrictions on online political content, will review its policies and could adopt "a lighter touch" during the next election, said Dr Lee Boon Yang. Nonetheless, he felt that policing of new media such as podcasts was necessary "to keep the electoral process on an even keel".<br>.<br>At the annual PR Academy conference yesterday, Dr Lee told reporters: "We have no cause to take any action on anybody Â… You don't go around with a heavy hammer knocking everybody, just for the slightest infringement. We look at the consequences and we look at the intent."<br>.<br>Conceding that the jury is still out on whether the Government was right in its cautious approach, Dr Lee said: "While podcasts and videocasts for political advertisements were disallowed during the election period, political parties were able to make their presence felt in cyberspace by making good use of their websites to publicise their programmes. This was on top of the ample coverage given by the mainstream media."<br>.<br>He said that during his campaigning, a friend sent him the podcast created by bloggers mr brown and Mr Miyagi that poked fun at the James Gomez incident. "I enjoyed it too and had a good laugh," said Dr Lee.<br>.<br>Calling it symptomatic of the Internet, he added: "I must congratulate mr brown Â… for his funny and clever work Â… (but) while podcasts can be very entertaining, it would be dangerous if important decisions such as electing representatives to Parliament were based on which side can make the most funny video or podcast." While he accepted the argument that a free flow of information would allow people to form their own opinion, Dr Lee said it was valid only if the information was reliable and accurate.<br>.<br>"I think those of you who are familiar with the Internet would agree that there are many people who use their websites and blogs to put out malicious and false information in order to further their own agendas. It may not be easy to sort out the enlightening from the confusing which ought to be destined for the trash can."<br>.<br>Among the malicious postings there were those that claimed that Mr Zaqy Mohamad was selected as a new People's Action Party candidate only because he was a nephew of the Speaker of Parliament Abdullah Tarmugi. In fact, the two are not related.<br>.<br>Said Dr Lee: "Such stories might be completely untrue but how do we rebut it on the Internet and get a correction carried on hundreds of blogs, bulletins and chatrooms which rapidly propagated such lies?"<br>.<br>Nonetheless, Dr Lee said the Government fully understood the mood among the youth who see blogging as their right.<br>.<br>"We have adopted a light touch approach in dealing with the everyday use of the Internet. We will continue to do so and accept that the Internet and new media will remain largely a free-for-all. However during the election period when such free-for-all may result in undesirable situations, we cannot take a completely hands-off approach."<br>.<br>During the recent GE, the Singapore Democratic Party was the only one served a notice to take down a podcast. No action was taken against anyone else. But while there may be a loosening on the political front, no one who causes racial tension will be spared.<br>.<br>"The Government will not compromise its position," said Dr Lee. "We will not risk the precious racial and religious harmony which underpins Singapore's stability and progress."<br></div>
