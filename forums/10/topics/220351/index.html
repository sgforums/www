            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>OFFERS of upgrading in opposition wards were part of a slew of policies proposed by People's Action Party candidates during the General Election, National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said yesterday.<br><br>But as voters rejected the PAP's candidates, it was 'naive' of Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir) and Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang) to now expect the Government to give them the funds for upgrading, he added.<br><br>The issue of upgrading in the two wards turned into a protracted debate after Mr Chiam asked for the release of 45 per cent of the $80 million upgrading carrot promised to Potong Pasir residents by the PAP at the election.<br><br>He said that as 45 per cent of voters chose the PAP, the ward should get 45 per cent of what was promised had the PAP's Sitoh Yih Pin won.<br><br>During the hustings, Mr Sitoh offered Potong Pasir voters an $80 million upgrading plan. PAP Hougang candidate Eric Low had a $100 million plan.<br><br>They would have to get the funds for the plan if they were elected.<br><br>Mr Mah and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong - who was an adviser to the two PAP men - backed their proposals.<br><br>Yesterday, Minister of State (National Development) Grace Fu, who responded first to Mr Chiam's request, said she was puzzled by his logic of equating 45 per cent of the funds to the percentage of votes the PAP garnered there.<br><br>Going by this logic, should not Mr Chiam then share 45 per cent of his MP's allowance and his seat in Parliament with Mr Sitoh, she asked.<br><br>She also made the point - reiterated by Mr Mah - that the PAP's upgrading offer was part of a larger package of policies which the ruling party offered to voters.<br><br>'The electorate in Potong Pasir has obviously not supported that and therefore they should not stand to benefit from any surpluses that are generated from that suite of policies,' she said.<br><br>Ms Fu recalled that Mr Chiam told voters he could provide upgrading without assistance. So he should work now on fulfilling that promise.<br><br>Mr Chiam said Ms Fu was trying to 'divert' the discussion, and asked how it was that the PAP could use taxpayers' money to support its candidate: 'We are concentrating a huge sum of money in the coffers of the Government which can be released to an individual candidate. Under whose authority? Taxpayers' money is taken out of government funds, and the candidate says, 'Give it to me so I can win the elections'. This sounds very irregular,' he said.<br><br>Joining the debate, Mr Low said the surpluses that Ms Fu referred to were not generated by the PAP alone: 'Are the surpluses generated by the PAP, and the people have no part in it? Don't forget, whether people are in Potong Pasir or in Hougang, they pay taxes and GST. So your logic and justification is a selfish one (made) on a partisan basis.'<br><br>Mr Low said he applied to the National Development Ministry for $140 million for upgrading works in Hougang, but his application had been rejected.<br><br>Weighing in on the debate, Mr Mah said Mr Chiam and Mr Low had 'selective hearing'.<br><br>'What the PAP candidate said was that, 'I will approach the Government...with a certain plan, with a certain package, for my residents. And if I'm elected, I will fulfil that promise',' Mr Mah said.<br><br>Mr Chiam and Mr Low had recalled the sum involved - but forgot about the part which said 'if the PAP candidate is elected'.<br><br>'The PAP candidate was not elected, so how is he going to get that package?' he asked.<br><br>When voters opted for a PAP candidate, Mr Mah said they were also voting for other aspects of what the party offered, including prudent fiscal, tax and other policies.<br><br>It was also 'naive' of the two MPs to think they could receive funds from the Government when they did not support its other policies, he added.<br><br><strong>Extracted from STI, Nov 15 2006</strong><br></blockquote>Now feel free to insult the "white scums"</div>

As Singapore's population ages, many would be too old to think properly. Many would either still be 'living the years back then' or easily brainwashed by MIW.<br><br>But the real 'loophole' in this is that they have probably forgotten that the economy is not likely to be driven by those people...

            <div class='col-md body'>One People One Nation. Just becuz PAP lost in hougang n potong pasir means people there are nt gonna be granted for upgrading? Just becuz that area in SINGAPORE doesnt belong to PAP? So are people in PAP trying to force people to vote for you if they want a better facilities in their area?<br><br>It sound to me that the finance part in SG is being monitored by PAP. So what if Mr Chiam is in charge of PP . Maybe he can do a much better job then Sitoh. $80 million in the hands of Sitoh and Chiam, each can make good use of it im sure. But who can make BETTER use is another thing.<br><br>PAP, stop being a loser and restrict opposition party to their plan by not releasing the money to them. NOT YOUR MONEY ANYWAY!!<br><br>Looks who whining about stuff now beside us..</div>
