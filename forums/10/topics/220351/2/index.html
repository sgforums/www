            <div class='col-md body'>I reckon what the opposition MPs should do are to continuously ask for the HDB upgrade fun in the next 5 years. Remind voters that the opposition wards residents are viewed as non-equal to PAP wards residents.<br><br>I would suggest the following actions and arguments:<br><br>1. Suggest the rhetorical questions that non-PAP wards member pay less income tax as they do not receive the same among of privileges as the PAP-ward residents in parliament.<br><br>2.  Do more research of what has been said in the last election about treatment to residents of non PAP wards and raise points and counter points in the parliament.<br><br>3. Raise the various statements of being "inclusive, compasionate, yada yada yada" made by the PM and ask why these are only shown to PAP ward residents and not in the non-PAP ward residents.<br><br>4. Remind all Singaporean that PAP view itself as Singapore. So Singapore=PAP?<br><br>5. Remind the Minsters Mah that the funds for upgrading comes from the tax-payers till the next election.  Get him to explain why Singapore is being ran like George Orwell's Animal farm where "Some animals are more equal than other animals".<br><br>6. Ask Eric Sitoh where is his commitment to the ward? So only when selected, he is willing to work for the resident, not selected means no care, indifferent to their plights caused by his own party....  So his service to people are conditional, selfishly motivated?<br><br>etc</div>

Rather the 66.6 per cent are like the 30 odd per cent placed in a situation. I do not agree with the criticisms that these individuals are callous bootlickers or what not, rather like all of us, we are enfixed upon a archiac social mechanism which transcends and influences our own personality traits. I guess to truely uncover what is beyond the myrth of cobwebs, one has to take it upon themselves and question our realities, rather than just taking everything for what it is. This is the essence of our human existence, as Jean Paul Satre siad 'Existence precedes  essence' - for in everything there is always an origin. Where does this search for this origin begin?</div>
