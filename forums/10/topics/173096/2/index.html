Although creativity cannot be taught, creativity can be  fostered in an environment whereby a student is allowed to think out of a box. Sadly, the environment in our school today fails to foster creativity. Often, creativity manifests itself as challenging authority at an early stage before it can be developed into something substantial. In order to think out of the box, one must understand/know the boundary of the box.

The education system in Singapore has been producing students to think within the box because all these year, what we were taught essentially, is the box. We were not given opportunities to challenge ourselves in the various "what-if" out-of-the-box scenarios. When students seek or create such opportunities, they are often ridiculed or scruntinised because these actions are not initiated by our teachers/lecturers. It all make it seems that only teachers should initiate any learning processes because the teacher is perceived to have the authority to do so, and not the student. Does this not agree with the MOE statement that creativity can be taught? This does not make our education system a meritocracy. It makes our education system a technocracy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SilverPal:</div><div class="quote_body">In USA or SOME other countries, students are encounraged to speak up during class, challenge the status quo and really "learn".<br><br>In sg, students are told to shut up in class and memorize everything the teacher teaches.<br><br>You may think that the sg system allows sg students to score well in all our exams but think again, are they being taught to "learn"? Do locals learn to "learn"? Do we question what we have and ask, "how can I make it better?"<br><br>I am studying a IT related course in a major university in sg. In year 1, most of my friends have a passion for a certain aspect of IT. Some love programming, others enjoy electronics. Many like to assemble computers or set up really good wireless networks.<br><br>By the time they graduate, most do not want to enter the IT line because they are so sick of computers and IT! Some hate IT with a passion!<br><br>Is this the kind of passino for learning sg gives its students? Is this the quality of professionals that are being churned out by the local education system?<br><br>While I'm not slamming the local educational system as I feel a lot of effort and brilliance have gone into setting up the system, I am questioning, are the authorities serious about producing quality, highly skilled populace who can innovate (I think that might include questioning the norm) and give sg her competitive edge? Or are we happier churning out robots who can do nothing other than following orders and recite rules and regulations?<br><br>While the govt blames the peasents (the category that I fall into) for being too stupid to get a head and too reliant on the govt (expecting a nanny state), the ppl blame the govt for doing nothing even though they are paid million dollar salary...<br><br>The children of ministars are being sent overseas for education where SOME of them eventually become quitters.<br><br>If sg education is so flawless, why do ministars send their children overseas for education?</div></blockquote>i can understand your frustrations with our university education.  i went through it and fully appreciate its futility.<br><br>i accept that we need to learn basic theories and concepts at primary or secondary levels but by the time we reach university, when we're preparing for the workforce, the least we're interested in are theories.  number 1 we need skills that would make us marketable, that would give us jobs.  number 2 we want to play around with things a bit more, tinker with more sophisticated toys or work on meaningful projects that can bring out our ingenuity.  perhaps this is where we lag behind ...<br><br>as for speaking up, it depends on context.  imprecise subjects like humanities, business or economics yes there's a lot of room for debate and exchange but for scientific concepts or engineering principles there isn't a lot to argue over.  yes we can have discussions to probe deeper into the subject matter but there isn't as much room for judgement.</div>
