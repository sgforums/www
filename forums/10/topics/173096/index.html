American kids test much worse but do better in the real world. Why?</strong><br><span class="small">By Fareed Zakaria<br>Newsweek<br>Jan. 9, 2006 issue</span> -<br><br>Last week India was hit by a terror attack that unsettled the country. A gunman entered the main conference hall of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, tossed four grenades into the audience and, when the explosives failed, fired his AK-47 at the crowd. One man, a retired professor of mathematics from one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, was killed.<br><br>What has worried some about this attack is not its scope or planning or effectÂ—all unimpressiveÂ—but the target. The terrorists went after what is increasingly seen as India's core strategic asset for the 21st century: its scientific and technological brain trust. If that becomes insecure, what will become of India's future?<br><br>This small event says a lot about global competition. Traveling around Asia for most of the past month, I have been struck by the relentless focus on education. It makes sense. Many of these countries have no natural resources, other than their people; making them smarter is the only path for development.<br><br>China, as always, appears to be moving fastest. When officials there talk about their plans for future growth, they point out that they have increased spending on colleges and universities almost tenfold in the past 10 years. Yale's president, Richard Levin, notes that <strong>Peking University's two state-of-the-art semiconductor fabrication linesÂ—each employing a different technologyÂ—outshine anything in the United States.</strong><br><br>East Asian countries top virtually every global ranking of students in science and mathematics.<br><br>But one thing puzzles me about these oft-made comparisons. <strong>I talked to Tharman Shanmugaratnam to understand it better. </strong>He's the minister of Education of Singapore, the country that is No. 1 in the global science and math rankings for schoolchildren. <strong>I asked the minister how to explain the fact that even though Singapore's students do so brilliantly on these tests, <span style="color: red;">when you look at these same students 10 or 20 years later, few of them are worldbeaters anymore.</span> Singapore has few truly top-ranked scientists, entrepreneurs, inventors, business executives or academics.</strong><br><br><strong>American kids, by contrast, test much worse in the fourth and eighth grades but seem to do better later in life and in the real world. Why?</strong><br><br><strong>"We both have meritocracies," </strong>Shanmugaratnam said. <strong>"Yours is a talent meritocracy, ours is an exam meritocracy. There are some parts of the intellect that we are not able to test wellÂ—like creativity, curiosity, a sense of adventure, ambition. Most of all, America has a culture of learning that challenges conventional wisdom, <span style="color: red;">even if it means challenging authority</span>. These are the areas where Singapore must learn from America."</strong><br><br>Shanmugaratnam also pointed out that American universities are unrivaled globallyÂ—and are getting better. "You have created a public-private partnership in tertiary education that is amazingly successful. The government provides massive funding, and private and public colleges compete, raising everyone's standards."<br><br>Shanmugaratnam highlighted in particular the role that American foundations play. "Someone in society has to be focused on the long term, on maintaining excellence, on raising quality. You have this array of foundationsÂ—in fact, a whole tradition of civic-minded volunteerismÂ—that fulfills this role. For example, you could not imagine American advances in biomedical sciences without the Howard Hughes Foundation."<br><br>Singapore is now emphasizing factors other than raw testing skills when selecting its top students. But cultures are hard to change. A Singaporean friend recently brought his children back from America and put them in his country's much-heralded schools. He described the difference. "In the American school, when my son would speak up, he was applauded and encouraged. In Singapore, he's seen as pushy and weird. <strong>The culture of making learning something to love and engage in with gusto is totally absent.</strong> Here it is a chore. Work hard, memorize and test well." He took his child out of the Singapore state school and put him into a private, Western-style one.<br><br>Despite all the praise Shanmugaratnam showered on the States, he said that the <strong>U.S. educational system "as a whole has failed." "Unless you are comfortably middle class or richer," he explained, "you get an education that is truly second-rate by any standards.</strong><br><br>Apart from issues of fairness, what this means is that you never really access the talent of poor, bright kids. They don't go to good schools and, because of teaching methods that focus on bringing everyone along, the bright ones are never pushed. In Singapore we get the poor kid who is very bright and very hungry, and that's crucial to our success.<br><br>"From where I sit, it's not a flat world," Shanmugaratnam concluded. "It's one of peaks and valleys. The good news for America is that the peaks are getting higher. But the valleys are getting deeper, and many of them are also in the United States."<br><br><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10663340/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10663340/site/newsweek/</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can get good result by either having the brain for it or by through hard work or combination of both. School certificate is only a piece of paper which just give us a better head start in the beginning but the rest will be based on our own ability in both mentalilty and intelligent to climb further up the corporate ladder. But Singapore are too "paper" oriented especially in the goverment sector simply because if you belong to the elite, your career path for the next 10-20 years is more or less determine when you just begin work.<br><br>Due to this trend, nowadays kids are so stress up due to parent and peer pressure to learn this and that and to do well in the school. This result in having the ability to study but not the ability to survive outside when competition from people in other countries came in. Note: There is some exception case also but generally it the "to be elite" system that causes this problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>To change the thinking of elitism is very hard now as currently many school are practising it and worst parents are leading the ways as in making their child take up different courses, tonnes of tuitions etc just to make sure their children are among the top.<br><br>With all this pressure, even if the goverment would like to implement thinking outside the box, it is very hard to attain success. And as we all know, in goverment sector, first thing that they look at is the academic result and only the top ppl will get short listed rather then giving all the ppl a chance and choose from among them one that is really good through different test such as thoughts and solution to some real life situation which they will encounter etc.<br><br>Unless goverment are willing to take the lead in changing the way they employ ppl, there no way that we can remove or reduce the current level of elitism in Singapore. And most importantly, acadamically smart people don't always equate to smart and competent people.</div>

Even now we have the whole system skewed to show favor to academic grades and results forgetting to nurture and develop broad-based applications of critical knowledge in all relevant fields.<br><br>So when a student goes into the big wide world he is lost and does not know what to give to society of what he has learned except the grades he had scored in the colleges and universities.<br><br>Good students are not those with good academic results but those who are ready to start a project or produce something or apply some skills for his future employers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think to do well in the real world, you must be flexible and ready to adapt to any change in circumstances. This is one area of training where the Singapore educational institutions don't stack up against many western universities and schools. Where schools here put emphasis on the grade and final mark, overseas schools put emphasis on the journey at which you arrived at your result. Personally I think it's the journey, and not the destination that counts in preparing you for the real life.</div>
