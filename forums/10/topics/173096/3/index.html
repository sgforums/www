Do locals learn to "learn"? Do we question what we have and ask, "how can I make it better?"<br><br>I am studying a IT related course in a major university in sg. In year 1, most of my friends have a passion for a certain aspect of IT. Some love programming, others enjoy electronics. Many like to assemble computers or set up really good wireless networks.<br><br>By the time they graduate, most do not want to enter the IT line because they are so sick of computers and IT! Some hate IT with a passion!<br><br>Is this the kind of passino for learning sg gives its students? Is this the quality of professionals that are being churned out by the local education system?<br><br>While I'm not slamming the local educational system as I feel a lot of effort and brilliance have gone into setting up the system, I am questioning, are the authorities serious about producing quality, highly skilled populace who can innovate (I think that might include questioning the norm) and give sg her competitive edge? Or are we happier churning out robots who can do nothing other than following orders and recite rules and regulations?<br><br>While the govt blames the peasents (the category that I fall into) for being too stupid to get a head and too reliant on the govt (expecting a nanny state), the ppl blame the govt for doing nothing even though they are paid million dollar salary...<br><br>The children of ministars are being sent overseas for education where SOME of them eventually become quitters.<br><br>If sg education is so flawless, why do ministars send their children overseas for education?</div></blockquote>I can't help but agree with what you said. However, I am glad that Republic Polytechnic is set up. The learning there is really something that I want, challenge the status quo of teachers. If we don't really agree, we will argue it out. Perhaps, we have misunderstood some points and the teachers will correct us. But if we are correct, the teachers will say that another point is brought up and we should consider this point.<br><br>My passion of IT is still there, because of this learning style.</div>

Certification is not cheap in the IT field. And most of these certifications need you to be experienced. If we have to take short networking courses, then work as network administrator, then take a network certification course, it is very long and waste a lot of money as well. The short courses aren't cheap either.</div>

Abstract digital and electronics knowledge may have no use now, but you will find it of use someday.<br><br>By the way, where you study? Studying IT in Singapore universities doesn't really appeal to me. I feel that the specializations that Singapore universities offer for IT is really not that good. The reason is because of India and China. They can do the same thing for a lower cost. Even polytechnic's specializations are better. They have networking, security, multimedia. What the universities offer are more towards software side, which I think benefit India and China more. </div></blockquote>I'm studying Computer Engineering in NTU.

What we need is to go into specialization, like what is done in US, UK and Australia. They also cram some subjects into one subject so the student will be well-rounded, but the student will know a particular IT field well. Not just generally.</div>
