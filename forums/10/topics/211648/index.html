            <div class='col-md body'>Citizens' monies are hard earned and should be invested wisely in accountable and transparent manner which can be scrutinized by a panel of experts with citizens' inputs.<br><br>Many feedbacks have been given in the past to GIC and Temasek to avoid wasting monies on politically sensitive investments but apparently these advices were not heeded at all as seen in the latest losses in Shin Corp investments.<br><br>Why must GIC/Temasek cause such losses when such surpluses can be invested more wisely to benefit many who have lost their jobs and lower costs of doing business within Singapore.<br><br>Surely after Souzhou, Optus, PWWC and Shin Corp, lessons have been learned and we will hear from GIC/Temasek what will be their future investment strategy to avoid similar huge losses of people's hard earned monies.<br><br>Is it wise to invest our citizens' hard earned monies in politically sensitive stocks which would would even cause back lash against Singapore.<br><br>As posted many times in the past GIC/Temasek should invest surpluses of citizens in a more objective manner as follows:-<br><br>(1) Divide national surpluses and reserves into categories i.e. Retirement/Medical Welfare fund, Venture capital fund, Secured Blue-Chip Fund.<br><br>(2) Allocate a percentage of total surplus to first category fund for investment in safe haven bonds and stocks. Use the returns from this category to create endowment funds which will be used to lower costs of lving and provide for retirements and medical welfare of citizens.<br><br>(3) Lock up gains from the last category of fund - venture capital at a certain ratio into the first category fund and reinvest them in bonds and secured guarantees which will bring returns to the people for retirements and medical needs.<br><br>(4) Invest into strategic shares and stocks only after inputs from those regularly exposed to and knowledgeable about trends in technologies and inner industry knowledge about risks within particular industries.<br><br>(5) Total foreign investments overseas should be capped so that our own surpluses will be invested in worthwhile mport-substitution projects and technology start-ups to upgrade our economic competitiveness.<br><br>(6) An Economic Master Plan should be put up internally to secure implementation of long-term plan taking advantage of our IR, educated manpower and strategic locations and other resources e.g. empty lands, vacant factories to greater advantages.<br><br>(7) Deploy a heavy-weight result-oriented minister of the calibre of Dr. Goh Keng Swee to convert with the fullest support of all resources the existing pro-foreign pro-GLC policy-conceptual model into pro-knowledge application mass participation model.<br><br>The only way for Singapore to upgrade to value-adding economy it to upgrade the whole of policies and incentive packages to promote technology and knowledge-driven value-adding new model ministers have been talking about from one recession to another for ages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just saw this in another forum,haiz Temasek made paper lost of 820 million in a matter of half a year? Or prehaps even real lost should they proceed to sell of a portion of the shares next year to get in line with regulations.<br><br><blockquote>Shin Corp losses hit Temasek after coup<br><br>By John Burton in Singapore<br><br>Published: September 22 2006 12:51 | Last updated: September 22 2006 12:51<br><br>Temasek Holdings, the Singapore state investment company, on Friday faced the threat of further losses on its $1.9bn investment in Shin Corp, which it bought in January from the family of Thaksin Shinawatra, the Thai prime minister who was overthrown in a coup this week.<br><br>For a second day in a row, the share price of Shin Corp and its affiliates fell sharply as the Bangkok stock market reacted to reports that the new Thai government would launch a probe into alleged corruption involving Mr Thaksin and his family, including the tax-free sale of Shin Corp.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Shin Corp's share price has fallen 43 per cent since January, resulting in a paper loss of nearly $820m on Temasek's 49 per cent stake in Shin Corp, a telecoms and media group.<br><br>Regulators have focused on whether Temasek breached a 49 per cent limit on foreign holdings in strategic industries. A consortium led by Temasek acquired 96 per cent of Shin Corp in March after TemasekÂ’s initial investment triggered a mandatory offer for the remaining stakes.<br><br>Regulators are investigating whether some of the consortium companies served as proxies for Temasek to gain control of Shin Corp. Temasek said it complied fully with Thai law. Other foreign companies have been suspected of using similar methods to take over Thai companies.<br><br>The Thai commerce ministry said it might forward the results of its investigation to the police.<br><br>Most analysts believe that it is unlikely that Thailand will nullify Temasek's takeover of Shin Corp, but Temasek could be forced to sell excess shares at a potential loss if it is found to be in breach in the foreign shareholding limits.<br><br>"There is the potential for a backlash against Temasek, although the Thais are a pragmatic people. Going after Temasek could harm the climate for other foreign investors in Thailand," said Hugh Young, head of Aberdeen Asset Management in Asia. He also predicted a period of uncertainty ahead for Shin Corp.<br><br>The Temasek-led consortium also could suffer potential losses if it proceeds with a plan to sell at least 11.3 per cent of its stake in Shin Corp next year to retain the group's listing status by increasing its free-float to 15 per cent as required by Bangkok stock exchange rules.<br><br>Advanced Info Services, Thailand's biggest mobile operator and Shin Corp's main asset, has suffered less in the recent market slide than its parent. Temasek-owned Singapore Telecommunications also has a 21 per cent stake in AIS.<br><br>Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2006 </blockquote></div>

So far the regional countries have snubbed Temasek's foray into their national assets as has happened in Optus, PCCW, Qantas, Global Crossing...<br><br>With so many bad experiences why did Temasek refuse to accept that there would be serious repercussions in trying to acquire politically sensitive assets.<br><br>If lessens have been learned previously, there should have been evaluations into the political situation surrounding Thaksin and what he was trying to do at that material time. Could Thaksin have overcome his own political crisis.<br><br>All these surrounding issues should have been studied before Temasek launched the acquistion of Shin Corp.

Beside, how good is the existing technology versus new technology like the VOIP.<br><br>It looks like competitions against Optus was so strong that it's stock has been dropping but our inept Singtel simply went for it hook-line-and-sinker and swallowed a big dose of poison which it could hardly digest.<br><br>So the moral of the story from these past acquisitions is :<br><br>"do not just envy a stock for its size but look at it in a big picture. Has Singtel got the VOIP technology edge to turn around declining telecom market due to the onset of VOIP.<br><br>Have we got the shrwd and technology-savvy CEOs to play that kind of local politics to run it and overcome problems. From the start it should have been clear that it was a different cup of tea to acquire and run Shin Corp.
