              <p>This is what I mean when I say some of the opposition supporters live in a dichotomy world, if someone says something remotely positive about the PAP, he/she must be a PAP supporter and the PAP must have paid him/her to spread propaganda. How about the times when I said something positive about Silvia Lim too? Was I taking money from the opposition too?</p>
              <p>"I don't see anything wrong with it" is a very personal statement, a mere expression of my personal view and conclusions of events. If it causes you to instantly label me with a name and imply that what I am saying must be lies, then I must question, as I have in many other occasions, how much different are you from the "oppressive" PAP that you claim you are protesting against? I have witnessed many online protesters showing very little tolerance towards views that differ from theirs.</p>

              <p>Certainly, that's one of the objective of a forum, but what exchanges and faciliating are you talking about if you are engaging with someone whose mind is fixed with no room for flexibility.</p>
              <p>In the 1st rule of engagement between humans, learn and understand your opposite first, if not, mostly likely, you are wasting your effort and getting heated up for nothing, and in a business context, you are losing profit ya</p>
