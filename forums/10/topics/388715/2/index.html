              <p>I don't understand.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the people in that forum , many of them are kind of uncouth.     I used to visit there and realise that both kojakbt and the forum owner, ficklebug are not being fair in treating some forumers.     I am not for too much vulgarity used.   But I have to say, they have the interests of Singaporeans at heart.</p>

              <p>Well its not like people like Kojakbt used kind words too. Very often, I see similarities between some of Singapore dissidents and Taiwan's DDP. Both would often provoke their opponents and then cut and paste the exact frame when their opponents strike back as evidence that their opponents lack in morality. How often do we as viewers demand to see the whole episode, to see how the incident evolved?</p>
              <p>At the same time I do not appreciate such opposition as their sole purpose appears to be to bring down their political opponents with somewhat childish and gangster-like tactics. The political discussions I had in mind involve more proper discussions, more academic researches and certainly a lot more mutual respect than this.</p>
              <p>Certainly not all Singapore dissidents fall along the same line. There are certainly promising candidates from various opposition parties. However, the ones that tend to create the loudest noise tend to be these trolls that simply gave another reason to why many Singaporeans have little respect for the majority of our oppositions. </p>

              <p>U must understand as a member of YPAP and as son of a politician. U shall know how to react better in a orderly manner.</p>
              <p>For example, if some fellow American scold Obama as Blackies. Shall Obama go up and bash that person up? Shall a President of a country act as some thugs even other purposely spike u?  Public are looking at you. The politician shall used more of the brain than his emotion to handle things. Don't forget, you are paid millions.</p>

                  in treating some forumers.     I am not for too
                  much vulgarity used.   But I have to say, they have the

              <p>Many opposition members and politicians do have Singaporean interests at heart. Some of their supporters however, appear to be just getting the kick out of being anti-PAP. I personally question if these people are really caring for the welfare of the people they claim to represent, or simply hijack the unfortunate as their bullets against some group of people that they don't like.</p>
