              <p>You are so fond of making sweeping statement, mind you I

              <p>I want to say it again, not all are blind to what you are up

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">here has any relevance with the

              <p>When did I do name calling to you, quote me examples from this
              thread?   Your motive here is clear with some of us and
              we are just stating it that is all and nothing to do with
              accusation.  In fact, it is the other way round - you
              accuse me.    Just admit that you are not happy with
              us for exposing you instead of going round and round ranting, point
              fingers.</p>
              <p>Like I said, if you are so very unhappy with the people here, go
              surf websites that will make you happy 100%.   We are not
              here to please you so don't keep attacking us in your sneaky,
              subtle manner.</p>

              <p>Your replies are getting too long and diverse for me to answer everyone of them, so I will just lump some of your questions together.</p>
              <p>Examples of you calling me names: you called me a wolf in sheep's clothing.</p>
              <p>Who care about my job: Just explaining why I am able to reply to your post during office hours.</p>
              <p>You being opposition supporter: Fine, I will take that back. How about the term dissident then?</p>
              <p>Technically, I have only been conversing with you in this topic, so when did "we" and "us" come in? You appear to be claiming to represent people that do not appeared to have given you their consent to be represented.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; color: #333333;"><strong>Like I said, if you are so very unhappy with the people here, go surf websites that will make you happy 100%.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Isn't this statement similar to asking people who are not happy with PAP's rule to just leave Singapore and go to places they are happy with? Obviously that would not be the right thing to do. We are Singaporeans, if we are not happy with the way the country is being run, we discuss, we participate and we sought to change. At the same time, we respect majority. For example, if it so happens my views are not acceptable, I do not need to change my views, but we can adopt a live and let live attitude. We simply agree to disagree. It is the same for the forums, I may not agree with a lot of the views presented here, but it doesn't mean I boot out. I just say what I think and people judge what they judge. If at the end of the day, we still cannot agree with each other, then we don't. A forum will be a very boring place if everybody sing to the same tune, doesn't matter if the tune is pro or anti PAP. Similarly, a country without diversity is boring and dangerous.</p>

              <p>Your replies are getting too long and diverse for me to answer everyone of them, so I will just lump some of your questions together.</p>
              <p>Examples of you calling me names: you called me a wolf in sheep's clothing.</p>
              <p>Who care about my job: Just explaining why I am able to reply to your post during office hours.</p>
              <p>You being opposition supporter: Fine, I will take that back. How about the term dissident then?</p>
              <p>Technically, I have only been conversing with you in this topic, so when did "we" and "us" come in? You appear to be claiming to represent people that do not appeared to have given you their consent to be represented.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Like I said, if you are so very unhappy with the people here, go surf websites that will make you happy 100%.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Isn't this statement similar to asking people who are not happy with PAP's rule to just leave Singapore and go to places they are happy with? Obviously that would not be the right thing to do. We are Singaporeans, if we are not happy with the way the country is being run, we discuss, we participate and we sought to change. At the same time, we respect majority. For example, if it so happens my views are not acceptable, I do not need to change my views, but we can adopt a live and let live attitude. We simply agree to disagree. It is the same for the forums, I may not agree with a lot of the views presented here, but it doesn't mean I boot out. I just say what I think and people judge what they judge. If at the end of the day, we still cannot agree with each other, then we don't. A forum will be a very boring place if everybody sing to the same tune, doesn't matter if the tune is pro or anti PAP. Similarly, a country without diversity is boring and dangerous.</p>

              <p>No, it is not a contradiction. Living in a dichotomy world means being partisan in which there can only be Pro or Anti-PAP. There is a middle area in which many people can be in and people can also switch based on the particular issue. I do not mind people being pro or anti PAP, but the ones in those camp should not be too quick to label each other and argue solely on the basis of camp alignment. I am simply saying that arguments should revolve around topics and issues, not alignment. </p>

              <p>That is the exact problem. Many people online are just arguing for the sake of arguing, treating forums as an emotional outlet rather than a platform of intelligent exchange. Come to think of it, maybe it is not such a bad idea to utilise it as an emotional outlet, but at least the forum shouldn't go by the name of speaker's corner then. I am still hoping that internet exchanges can be geared towards being more "civilised" and matured.</p>
