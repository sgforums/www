All of us are poor, dirty and hungry. The elites are profiteering from the poor and we are squeezed dry by taxes?  That we have not a single cent to spend and better our lives?<br><br>It is easy to always blame the rich that they keep the wealth for themselves.  Heck, i'm poor myself but i dont say:" HUH?  Why people get to live along bukit Timah, their Kids can Drive a car worth more than my salary?  You know plainly that the money isnt the childrens!"  It's not like Wealth is built overnight.  If everyone can become a millionaire what's the value of money? You mean the elites get rich because the government fund them?  Do you not accept the fact that all these "elites" have forefathers that were poor once?<br><br>Dont be saying that the "Ruling Party" is making a fool from ourselves. We at least show our stance if consistent! Which government doesnt make political errors? Would you rather support CSJ who runs to Australia to gain THEIR political support on our ineptness?<br><br>------<br><br>Yes, Malaysia has a Bumiputra Policy that was PUBLICLY MADE KNOWN, and which unfortunately discriminate the other ethnic groups in all spheres of their national life from its very inception.<br><br>In Singapore, although there are no such public policy that favor ANY ethnic group in particular, are you certain that such unseen under current of selective 'discrimination' do not exist in the Singapore way of doing things ?<br><br>In the Singapore way, do we need to be so explicit as the Malaysians ?<br><br>The Singaporean way is more sophisticatedly subtle, we use more 'ELITIST' way to 'filter out' those whom we see as 'doubtful'; and if they ever become an ELITE, we use the Language hurdle as a filter, and how many more other creative ways of discriminating besides using the HDB Ethnic Quota Allocation to disperse the political influence of a gathering of minority in a sea of the majority ?<br><br>In any case, what does it matter to you if I do or do not decide to join the Opposition ?<br><br>Why are you so agitated to my position ?<br><br>------<br><br>Are you telling me that just because the bumiputra policy is good because it's made the law?  The policy itself is a FARCE and insult to non-muslims.  What HUMAN RIGHT is there to declare one citizen should gain at the expense of others? Do you support the oppression of females simply because it's made legal?<br><br>Discrimination exist in all nations in all countries.  Are you saying that because it exist, we are wrong?  Can you prevent the existence of such discrimination by choice of each individual? What kind of government declares it's stance that we are discriminatory instead of stating we abhor it? It's one thing that it exists in the nation because it is inevitable but it's another if you declare and show as A NATION we approve it and spport it.<br><br>As for language  to be an "Elitist barrier"  Its not official, it's the choice of those owners who are making an economic decision.  If their products target a group whom speaks a certain language, why shouldnt Language be a criteria?  There's no rule saying that a child MUST STUDY and ONLY study a language of his race.  It's a choice that parents can actively choose.  Is it any better that we insist that all Citizens must learn Chinese, English and your own mother tongue?  Would that be a fair statement? Furthermore, are we stopping our call centres in India from growing because of language?  If they speak English and well, they are equal in ability and better in terms of cost than a call centre here. It's not a langugage barrier but a reality.  Each individual can make that difference to his life.<br><br>As for the Ethinic Quota Allocation.  Would you rather that Singapore be divided to where they live according to their race?  What will it be like?  The Chinese in the N and C; Malays in the E; Indians in the W; FT in the S?  DO you think any individual will chose to move to a part of Singapore that is of a different race by themselves?  Would an Indian try to find work in the other parts of Singapore? There would be even more segregation.  Look at European Countries:  the choice for them to live where they live has resulted in the Muslims being overlooked / ignored in France plans.  A riot has resulted that cause loss of property. It is human nature to seek similar friends but not to live with strangers.<br>It's totally different from the British government letting the formation of Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Bras Basar. Why are there racial Riots and how did it take place?  The Chinese invaded Kampong Glam and caused deaths!  Would you like this sort of riot occuring on a national scale? Given the numbers of the Chinese, they will develop faster.  Would this "betterment" of that race not create racial discontentment? Can you foresee the problems if An area of Singapore is better off than another base purely on race?  What kind of result can you provide should there be a disagreement between races in terms of political/ legal ruling?<br><br>Why joining the opposition speaks volumes!  It shows whether you are really interested in changing and bettering the lives of others around you or just bashing the government for whatever injustice you feel it being laid upon us.  And the lack of credility of Opposition is also due to lack of talent!  If you are so convince that your views are acceptable by the average Singaporean, the campaign WILL be a turning point.  If you win, are you not on your first steps of creating a state that you so believe is much better?<br><br>I am of course very concern about your views!  You seem to be keen on self-interests than that of everyone else in the picture!<br><br>------<br>QUOTE:<br><br>Either you are dumb, or you think that I am dumber ? .<br><br>Surely you have the capacity to learn from the experience of others, or perhaps the years of spoon feeding and over dependence on the POWER OF ONE has stopped your ability to judge independently by yourself ?<br><br>There are many alternative ways to exercise our Rights when those opportunities are not available to us. .<br><br>Be patient and wait on, you will learn how a tree grow to be able to withstand the worse storm.<br><br>-----<br><br>Well, not standing up for yourself but waiting for the time to come? When will that time come?  And why would it?  Simply because there's someone else who initiates this new"time" to come! You would rather wait until someone else makes his stance against the government before you get vocal?  The government has taught you to challenge only when others are doing so?  If you are SO strongly against the governemental policy, challenge them! Write to the newspaper forums!  You can choose to ignore the replies of offical people but you can read the opinions of other citizens in return to gauge whether there are others like minded like you.  Which i believe there is.  Are you waiting for the time of a revolution? Are you prepared to changed your life much differently from the way it is now? What happens if there is a change but not the way you think it should be? To be in charge of changes, you need to lead. Are you growing a forest to hold the storm at bay?  Or are you proclaiming that you, one tree is all that matters?<br><br>------<br>QUOTE:<br><br>Yes, SIA is part of our company, but how much do the 'Changi Airport Aunties/Uncles' get from the work that they are doing ?<br><br>While SIA bring in the big spenders, and the Government Owned and Privately Owned Companies make the big bucks, what do Singaporeans get from their short term employment contracts, flexible wages that float differently from each calendar quarter, and cuts to our reduced flexible wages to a CPF that cannot be totally or usefully seen until we are near death.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry will reap the profits generated by SIA and all the other GLCs, and take control of the surplus from our taxes paid through GST and Income Tax, and control our locked up CPF for the purpose of using as Capital for the Foreign Adventures of Temasek and GIC.<br>-------<br><br>Are you saying that because big companies get the big bucks we lose out?  It's an economic decision. Of course each company will be be operating at cost.  Those are called Non-profit Organisations and those serve a different service!   Who will invest in a company that doesnt grow?  If a company doesnt grow how will be be able to hire more people?  You are blaming the companies for not sharing the profits but at the same time, by not sharing the profits now, it can be pumped into growth and ensure there are at least a portion of jobs that locals can be hired.  You look as if one extra measly appointment for a citizen is nothing.  It means that a person can feed his family!  Its the little bits that count to make up a greater whole!<br><br>As for CPF, that is the way Singaporeans have to buy their homes.  Why do houses cost money? and why do they rise all the time?  Our land is limited and corporations(local/government/foreign) all compete to turn this land into something more valuable and lucrative.  We already have such a huge Debt problem amongst citizens because we spend more than we earn.  It's unavoidable whether there's CPF.Would you die poor?  Or at least have a paltry sum to sustain your remaining years.<br>Which person will REALLY save that much money to think of the future if not forced?  It isnt any different had you have the full income and spending it all.<br><br>Stop saying taxes like it's a dirty word.  TO you, tax is everything from income tax to GST. Income tax affects those who EARNS more than 1.5k per month. It is income bracket based.  The main thing is that we ensure that the RICH stays here. The RICH are those who have mobility to move from country to country. We do not.  If they are here, they spend money here.  That goes to the fastfood restaurant staff, the petrol station staff, the cleaners.<br><br>If the nation does not have reserves that build year on year, the actualy amount of reserve per person decreases as inflation and larger population rise overtime.  This reserve shows our Economic power and stability all in all is to attract more investments here to grow.  So what if we dont have handouts from this monstrous sums of cash?  It's human greed and we will not appreciate it any longer than until we have spent it.  Then would we demand for more? When would we stop? Until this piggy bank is broken and empty?<br><br>You blame the government that Privately owned companies are paying low wages. If we set wage minimums, how would that affect our overall ecconomi activity?  Companies will pull out to exploit other countries without such legal protectionism. It is still an acceptable wage in comparision to having nothing at all should these companies leave Singapore! I do not believe that it is fair to have such low wages especially fot manual labour but we are fish fry in the ocean.  This is the same EVERYWHERE in the world.  Or would you rather support the CAP programme in France?<br><br>----<br>QUOTE:<br><br>Is it not great that you remembered to show some concern to the Changi Airport Aunties/Uncles ?<br><br>Do you realise that these Changi Airport Aunties/Uncles must continue to work to support themselves in their old age ?<br><br>Did you not realise that those Aunties/Uncles of the same age as the ones working at Changi Airport are coming from the Other First World ?<br><br>They are travelling on their savings to visit Singapore, while our Airport Aunties/Uncles are washing the toilets and serving those Foreign Aunties and Uncles.<br><br>Is there something wrong with our Singapore being a member of the First World Community ?<br><br>----<br><br>That's SO MYOPIC!  For everyone Uncle and Auntie from overseas that can travel here, there must be 1000 or more times that of those that REMAIN back in their "first world" simply because they too are unable to afford it!  You are comparing citizens who can afford to travel to those who cant!  We make sure that THOSE who can spend, spend it here.  For every bit of additional demand we have here, there is someone hired to do the job.  Ask anyone would they rather have a job that pays little than no job at all because the pay is too little?  Do you think there's no poor in other First world Countries?  You cant see them until you go there. And you cannot go there until you are rich.  And if you are rich, would you go to help the poor, the homeless of other First world countries when there are those you can help at your doorstep?  It's the problem and choice of the rich individuals whether they want to help. Are you suggesting the government, whom you detest, to have a welfare system?  Esthablish countries First World, are ALL having problems due to welfare but they CANNOT pull it out for fear of political losses.  Are you willing to be taxed even more than now to help provide welfare to an unseen stranger with unknown intent? Would you gladly give money to the unemployed without knowing WHY they are unemployed in the first place?  Have you read of the young british guy who have 1k pounds  of welfare due to his unemployed and numerous children status ?  Would you benefit such people?<br><br>Check this out http://www.ncpa.org/pi/welfare/wel46.htm<br><br>I'm really enjoying this debate with you!</div>

All of us are poor, dirty and hungry. The elites are profiteering from the poor and we are squeezed dry by taxes?  That we have not a single cent to spend and better our lives?<br><br>It is easy to always blame the rich that they keep the wealth for themselves.  Heck, i'm poor myself but i dont say:" HUH?  Why people get to live along bukit Timah, their Kids can Drive a car worth more than my salary?  You know plainly that the money isnt the childrens!"  It's not like Wealth is built overnight.  If everyone can become a millionaire what's the value of money? You mean the elites get rich because the government fund them?  Do you not accept the fact that all these "elites" have forefathers that were poor once?<br><br>Dont be saying that the "Ruling Party" is making a fool from ourselves. We at least show our stance if consistent! Which government doesnt make political errors? Would you rather support CSJ who runs to Australia to gain THEIR political support on our ineptness?  </blockquote>Did my post blame the RICH for the predicament of the POOR, DIRTY and HUNGRY ?<br><br>The Ruling Elite Â– not any Singaporean Elite Â– are certainly PROFITEERING from the poor - and those soon to be poor from the middle-income groups Â– by taxing Singaporeans from any and every creative angle.<br><br>Just look at the ERP along Orchard Road Â– when one enters Orchard Road at the CKTang entrance, our CashCard is deducted; further down Orchard Road at Dhoby Ghaut another ERP gantry will deduct your CashCard for traveling all the way down Orchard Road to Bras Basah. If you should make a return trip from downtown City Hall back to Sommerset Road, you will get hit by a return ERP gantry outside the YMCA vicinity.<br><br>When Mah Bow Tan was the Communications Minister, he spoke comforting words that Vehicle Tax will be back to Square ONE as in the 1970s-1980s rate when the ERP System is fully in place. Has Road Tax been reduced beyond FIFTY PERCENT after having been increased by over THREE HUNDRED PERCENT since the road tax charged in the 1970s ?<br><br>This is only a short description on FISCAL MEASURES imposed on vehicles and its usage that is allowing the Government to count its cash input each minute a Singaporean Car passes any ERP gantry. All these payments are on top of the C.O.E prices that are artificially fixed at a HIGH MINIMUM sum for bidding to start.<br><br>What about the other essential services that Singaporeans need and are all entirely dependent on the Government in providing, but which the Government has privatized by allowing Â“ PRIVATE Â“ companies to operate these services; and with these Â‘PRIVATEÂ’ companies being Government Linked Companies, with Paid-Up Capital provided by the Singapore Government.<br><br>Is the Singapore Government not making a fool of ourselves by claiming to be a member of the FIRST WORLD Â– when no one believe that Singapore is anywhere near to their Standards of  Social Morales, Social Governance, Political Transparency, and the observation of the FULL Rights of Individual Citizens ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>Original Post by Atobe :<br>Yes, Malaysia has a Bumiputra Policy that was PUBLICLY MADE KNOWN, and which unfortunately discriminate the other ethnic groups in all spheres of their national life from its very inception.<br><br>In Singapore, although there are no such public policy that favor ANY ethnic group in particular, are you certain that such unseen under current of selective 'discrimination' do not exist in the Singapore way of doing things ?<br><br>In the Singapore way, do we need to be so explicit as the Malaysians ?<br><br>The Singaporean way is more sophisticatedly subtle, we use more 'ELITIST' way to 'filter out' those whom we see as 'doubtful'; and if they ever become an ELITE, we use the Language hurdle as a filter, and how many more other creative ways of discriminating besides using the HDB Ethnic Quota Allocation to disperse the political influence of a gathering of minority in a sea of the majority ?<br><br>In any case, what does it matter to you if I do or do not decide to join the Opposition ?<br><br>Why are you so agitated to my position ?<br>[quote]Response by sgal2k+ </strong>:<br>Are you telling me that just because the bumiputra policy is good because it's made the law?  The policy itself is a FARCE and insult to non-muslims.  What HUMAN RIGHT is there to declare one citizen should gain at the expense of others? Do you support the oppression of females simply because it's made legal? </blockquote>Is it surprising that you have a stupendous ability to read more to a statement then what is actually written ?<br><br>Where have you learnt your skill in reading simple English ?<br><br>Did my response mention that the " bumiputra policy is good " ?<br><br>I am not sure if we are even approaching this topic with the same subject being discussed or debated.<br><br>So what if the policy itself is FARCE, or if it Â‘insult to non-muslimsÂ’ ? Was Human Rights affected by the Â‘bumiputra policyÂ’ ?<br><br>What about the Human Rights of the Singapore ethnic minority Â– with their Rights restricted by the HDB Quota System to the place that they can stay, the buyers whom they can resell their HDB to ?<br><blockquote>Continuing response by sgal2k+ [/b]:<br>Discrimination exist in all nations in all countries.  Are you saying that because it exist, we are wrong?  Can you prevent the existence of such discrimination by choice of each individual? What kind of government declares it's stance that we are discriminatory instead of stating we abhor it? It's one thing that it exists in the nation because it is inevitable but it's another if you declare and show as A NATION we approve it and spport it. </blockquote>Will you accept the term Â‘HYPOCRITICALÂ’ for your creative double standard in denouncing MalaysiaÂ’s Â‘bumiputra policyÂ’ but seem to accommodate that Â“It's one thing that it exists in the nation <strong>because it is inevitable</strong> but it's another <strong>if you declare and show as A NATION we approve it and spport it</strong> Â“ ?<br><br>Why should Â‘DiscriminationÂ’ be acceptable to you in one country because it is inevitable, but unacceptable when it is openly declared and supported by the Nation ?<br><blockquote>Continuing response by sgal2k+ [/b]:<br>As for language  to be an "Elitist barrier"  Its not official, it's the choice of those owners who are making an economic decision.  If their products target a group whom speaks a certain language, why shouldnt Language be a criteria?  There's no rule saying that a child MUST STUDY and ONLY study a language of his race.  It's a choice that parents can actively choose.  Is it any better that we insist that all Citizens must learn Chinese, English and your own mother tongue?  Would that be a fair statement? Furthermore, are we stopping our call centres in India from growing because of language?  If they speak English and well, they are equal in ability and better in terms of cost than a call centre here. It's not a langugage barrier but a reality.  Each individual can make that difference to his life. </blockquote>You seem to be wonderfully skillful in confusing your mind with concepts that are creatively wound and rewound in different contortions to fit your own perverse interpretation of my statements.<br><br>Do you not believe that Education is about the organization of the experiences and lessons in Life that is written into text to be read and remembered, and with exams being conducted to ensure that those experiences and lessons are well learnt ?<br><br>Who do you think have been assigned the responsibility to organize those experiences and lessons in Life, to write into text, and prepare the exam papers that will make simple experiences and lesson in Life into some complex text that taxes the learnersÂ’ memory in order to pass the exam hurdle to join a select group of Elites ?<br><br>Is it not a fact that all Elitists will jealously guard their exclusive status, and will limit their numbers so as to make their position even more rarefied in Singapore, so as to justify their claim that Talent is Short in Singapore ?<br></div>
