There is no point continuing inconsequential battles if there is no light at the end of the tunnel. </strong></blockquote>Your observation is exactly the course that I believe CSJ has taken.<br><br>He is currently exposing to the Global Community - the sham democracy that the Ruling Political Party is practising in Singapore, suppressing and keeping Singaporeans enslave to the political and economic systems that perpetuate the rule of the POWER OF ONE.<br><blockquote><strong><br>In your choice of R.A Butler, it is interesting to note that in Chee's case, because of massive character assassination by our ruling party and through his own self-styled beliefs, it is not the 'rest of the pack' that is turning on him, but the very people he sought to champion. </strong></blockquote>Actually those people whom he sought to champion IS the 'rest of the pack' .<br><br>The 'rest of the pack' prefer to remain blind to the abuse of the Political Rights that Singaporeans are entitled, and prefer to be cowed by the strong sense of insecurity that the Ruling Political Party has allowed to perpetuate to benefit the Ruling Party and the POWER OF ONE.<br><br>Is it any surprise that the 'rest of the pack' find it safer to wait at the side of the table of the POWER OF ONE, and wait for crumbs to fall from the table at the pleasure of the POWER OF ONE ?<br><br>It is unfortunate that CSJ's delivery lack polish, seemingly crude, impolite, and brash despite his tertiary professional qualification as a Psychologist.<br><br>This unpolished manner could actually be taken as sheer honesty, compared to the guile propaganda speeches made with a glib tongue by the Ruling Political Party.<br><br>Is CSJ the only one who began a political career in this manner ?<br><br>LKY was exactly like CSJ in the 1950s, and was disliked by the largely Chinese educated population towards a fellow Chinese - who behave arrogantly brash, and could not speak a word of Chinese dialect or even Mandarin.<br><br></div>
