            <div class='col-md body'>You could choose to see the posting on SDP's website as (a) support of the boycott or (b) denouncement of the use of the law to curb peaceful demonstrations and protests.  Seeing how there are other articles posted on SDP's website on the latter topic, I would think that (b) is the more rational conclusion to reach.</div>

As you have alredy pointed out, the whole idea is to stand up to scrutiny. There is no lamenting, no accusations. There is merely arguments and counter-arguments.
