            <div class='col-md body'>Just read The Great COE Scam by Lotus999, you will realize how much money has been taken away by the govt when an average middle income couple buying a car for their daily usage. How about the high petrol tax, GST besides the high COE,ERP, ARF,PARF,insurance,car park charges?What has left for the average citizen to spend on other items in Singapore when  most of their incomes are "sapu" by one source-the government? No wonder you see even the hawkers are struggling for survival because average Singaporeans are left with little cash after spending on this one essential item, or may be the instalment for the overhead shelter and the ever increasing PUB bill! For those without  owning a car, they are no better off after spending about $5-$10 on the  transport alone. For those taking taxi, they have to fork out even more and some even have to tighten their belt literally to make their ends meet. To the government, the economy is doing very well because they have taken more than 90% share of the pie and leaving another 10% or less for the majority of its population! This 10% will not generate much multiplier effects for the economy. The retails are dead, the hawkers are struggling, the taxi drivers are hunting for the last remaining passenger, the average Singaporeans are saving hard for the rainy days and on the ground, the economy is dead!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's not difficult to see the difficult times we are in and the potential economic benefits that the casino can bring.  the problem is, for as long as anyone can remember, we have been told one thing only to find out that it actually means another.  cultural representation in the GRC sense turns out to be a buy one get three free scheme.  honesty in leadership costs us millions every month.  so i'm not sure when they claim to be bringing in the whale for us, they are not actually feeding off us small shrimps.<br><br>in any case, i think our situation can be likened to that of a highly paid technician whose boss has decided to employ someone cheaper.  one way is to enhance our skillsets and productivity so that we justify our higher pay.  but there's a fundamental limit of how much we can set ourselves apart from the rest of the field because if you look at our competitors, we're essentially of the same stock - same strengths so to speak.<br><br>the other way is to become bosses ourselves.  if we have the technical know-how (which we don't), we can develop and market our own products and and employ our competitors instead, thus turning a competitive disadvantage into a competitive advantage.<br><br>the problem is we have not reached that level to become bosses ourselves and i feel this is the real jump we must make now in order to reach the next rung that the developed world currently sits.  most of the developed nations are there because they have the technology / branding to create premium products well sought after all over the world.<br><br>there's a lot of hope directed at our young ones who will supposedly become more creative and achieve what we couldn't.  however, regardless of how much idealism we inject into them, when they step into the reality of society, they would still be faced with the same bureaucratic inertia that is preventing dreams from being realised.  ultimately, a pragmatic society like ours have little place for dreams and whatever hopes we may cherish or talents we possess are to be constrained within the limits of the choices available to us.</div>

The government should admit it so that the whole nation can unite and work together as one just like the good old times during the SARS crisis.<br><br>Sad to say, instead of doing so, they are trying to project a image of economy recovery. This greatly diversified the interest of the nation. Companies took advantage of this virtual economy recovery to increase profits while poor citizens struggled just to have their belts tightened. This move by the government had obviously unchained and loosened the bonding and unity of the nation. Therefore instead of being united to achieve a common objective, we are like what the Chinese say "Yi Pan San Sha" (A plate of scattered sand).<br><br>Whose fault ?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
