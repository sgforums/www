            <div class='col-md body'>To all Clowns - Fake opposition Definition<br>As a guide, fake opposition locally speaking means any opposition party that is led a leader who believes in so called "mild manners" which redundant or manners are endorsed and cultured by the corrupt PAP over the years as "acceptable behaviour" or "pro-Singapore" behaviour.<br><br>For example fake oppositions will be extremely quiet or not doing anything about the most important issues any real opposition will tackle vociferously and consistently = like taking the pap to task over the cheng san 200m violation issue, that if they had succeeded would have meant pap losing that 5 seats to wp team led by vocal, charismatic tang liang hong, jbj. Incomprehensibly, brutal means were used thereafter to cause the victims to flee and country and fake oppositions kept absolutely quiet of their bullying found no where else in the democratic, civilised world...............Failure to take the pap to task for using the supremely powrful, disgracefully compliant mass media and judiciary to systematically discredit, defame, bankrupt the charismatic, heavyweight defenseless oppositions rendering other heavyweights or potentials scared of joining opposition thus weakening the opposition Everlastingly............Failure to take the pap to task for their colossal failures and ultra greed in paying themselves 4-5 times the president of the united states' salary which ultra ultimate greed resulting in very high cost of living, eroding economic fundamentals, culminating in huge social problems for the country now and in time to come........Failure to protest vehemently against their inability to reach the masses via the most powerful instrument controlled 100% by the PAP the MASS MEDIA..........the very thing ensuring their long term demise.<br><br>What's the use of being an opposition when you can't reach the people? And by being unable to reach the people means ZERO CHANCE of making any impact at the sham erections. Now you all answer this most important most fundamental point honestly n intelligently.<br><br>So, fake oppositions are All except SDP. James Gomez may not have been the fake type but he is powerless after joining WP. Extremely quiet now versus those times when he was ThinkCentre leader doing some excellent work there. PAP 100% successful deceptive scheme - plant fake oppositions make them popular. Make real oppositions unpopular setting fakes as "role model" for "success" to con. Use the powerful mass media to do the brainwashing to ensure long term overall opposition demise.<br><br>To all arrogant clowns out there - to climb out of your tiny shell, to understand what is fake opposition or fake opposition behaviour, see how usa, britain, taiwan, japan, south korea oppositions behave and how corresponding ruling party behaves as a result of opposition actions and behaviour. Compare this to pap's archaic, disgraceful brutal, outrageous, corrupt behaviour to be sure what you born yesterdays/ clowns are talking about.<br><br>Still unsure, go back and analyze the last landmark erection results and the context of that erection, ie, held during the most favourable time in history for oppositions. And what kind of results was obtained ? Why was that so? How could that be possible ? What was wrong?.........are the pertinent questions all clowns have failed to ask. Clowns are clowns.<br></div>

Trying to buy time to avoid facing the reality.<br>Fact - if the pap feels the pressure they might just increase the nos of fake oppositions from 3 to 5 in next sham corrupt erection and clown like you will come here and boast of success.<br><br>then at the next next bring back to 3 seats. alternate between 3 to 5, 5 to 3 until ends of tiems. easy con job over clowns just like you.)<br>========<br><br></div>

I think you must get your perspective right. Many people talk and talk about how PAP is unwilling to admit their mistakes, putting up "honest mistakes" excuses etc etc; but hey, look at it this way, SDP isn't the ruling party yet and it already cutting down people to size just because CSJ is being criticise for his mistakes?<br><br>Are you suggesting that SDP is inherently more tyranic than PAP itself? No criticism is allowed? Can only sing praises for CSJ but not criticism? Alamek! You are just acting like PAP!<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>
