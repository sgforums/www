            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Enterpris5,<br>Opposition did coordinate their fight in the last election to avoid three corners fights!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> What types of alliance do you want?<br><br>SDA is formed, as admitted by Steve Chia in discuss-Singapore, just as a convenient election platform for the small parties to pull their limited resources together to run for GRCs. I doubt there is any converging political idealism or ideology. No meaningful Alliance has emerged yet.<br><br>As far as I am concerned, I do not agree to SDP or particularly, Dr. Chee's way of "struggle", but I could tolerate such diversity if <strong>he persist to persue his mindless ways.</strong> Technically speaking, I think SDP has a more "stable" structure than SDA but alas, it was mismanaged. At the very least, they know how to market their party via the simple colour identification (RED), just like PAP selling itself as "white". SDA, sad to say, doesn't even try hard enough to sell its brandname. Each component parties are selling their own parties' name which in the end of the day, during the elections, would not be used at all!<br><br>Unity could be seen at very different level. Unity should not compromise diversity, but yet, should provide a real political platform in terms of common visions, idealism and idealogy. There are two options. One, in terms of an Alliance; Secondly, one of the political party grow bigger and others just merge with it.<br><br>At what level of unity do we want, or could we get?<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br>You think you very smart is it ?

Hence, the result in favour of papee was inevitable. ***<br><br>(Dead wrong. two erections ago or at the 2nd last erection, dr chee did not shout but he finished amongst the bottom amongst all opposition candidates. BUT at the last GE, despite the shouting chee finished surprisingly top five........reflecting maturity of electorate. chiam, low, chia's votes (declined across the board) were saved by the PAP's last minute's powerful endorsements in the most powerful TV, newspapers just, yes, only just, saving their seats. Poh Lee Guan was initially endorsed but later mildly criticised when they became unsure of him. Dr Chee lost only to the aforesaid four............THAT'S THE REALITY - some maturity there in that huge Jurong GRC despite the NSS hugely successful scam. Two erections, ago, no shouting at market, Dr Chee's relative performance was among the deep bottom.)<br><br>===========================<br><br>The bit on JBJ, TLH and FS was very informative and I agree with your arguments to a large degree. Thanks. But I note that you explicitly left out CSJ in your rebutal. The public does not want ANY outspoken no holds barred opposition politicians. They had a chance to vote CSJ in but they didn't. It speaks volumes of his ability to win votes.<br><br>(As usual you guys are extremely naive unable to see the issue in the right context..<br><br>The fact is the public likes outspoken heavyweight oppositions like tang, seow, chee, jbj..........as correctly highlighted by Surebet500..<br><br>Now the context is this.........unlike Dr Chee.........seow, tang joined oppositions suddenly and stood almost immediately for elections. The PAP have no chance to destroy them till they announced they would stand for election. Then came the incessant, brutal attacks by the corrupt PAP using the monopolized powerful mass media and the compliant corrupt judiciary. Both strong candidates were called all sorts of names immediately like womaniser, playboy, income tax cheat, anti christian, chinese chauvinist antisingapore, western lackeys, etc etc........then sent fleeing the country.<br><br>Dr Chee's case is different. He announced he would join SDP - the first PhD to do so worrying the brutal highhanded hypocritical corrupt govt. Then Chee was called all sorts of names and brutally destroyed with zero chance to defend himself. The Chiam resignation saga was blown out of context and names like student ousting master rubbish, ungrateful brat, etc were called - powerful concepts in Asian society cooked up leading to intense hatred for the man destroyed even before he could begin. The worst thing is he had no chance to defend himself or to launch the counter attack against the lies hurled by the pap and the powerful mass media against him. In such case, it is only natural that he would be soundly defeated in each erection unless one is born yesterday. (To those clowns who really want to know about the truths about the so called "Chiam's ouster", hunger strike, taxi fares claims, etc, go to the thread "What is a Credible Opposition in Singapore" and see my rebuttals to BookWurm the first 120 postings or so.)<br><br>But having said that, one surprise observation as I have highlighted is in the last election = Dr Chee's performance has actually improved in the last GE versus the 2nd last, finishing in top 5th spot amongst All oppositions reflecting some maturity of citizens there - probably more younger voters having have net access are now in that GRC living in newer estates at the west. In the 2nd last erection, Dr Chee and the SDP had fared very badly Relatively as compared with all oppositions. This time round, his better performance had indeed been surprising given the shouting at the market and the media's disgraceful one sided vehement destruction attempt at him and his party. The is the correct context of things........ladies and gentleemnt.<br><br>Despite the smear campaign against Seow, Tang, both had still been able to procure huge nos of votes and lost only very very marginally (no one knows however, in a corrupt dictatorship, if the PAP had rigged the results - there have been allegations by Tang who said he saw stacks of voting papers from the box appearing bundled together, tied up or something.)...................reflecting public loves the outspoken, charimastic, intellectual oppositions. Of course after tang and seow sorry episodes, no new heavy weight outspoken types have dared to join the oppositions..........an area REAL, TRUE OPPOSITION MUST TACKLE ESPECIALLY THE POPULAR ONES. But PIGS CAN FLY if FAKE oppositions will take up the issue and solve it izzen it......meaning fighting for MEDIA ACCESS, the most important level playing field.)<br><br>oooooooooooooooooooooooo<br><br>"They are around bcos they have not been persecuted probably due to the fact that they are not movers and shakers who have the ability to effect any real siginificant change to the political scene." what you said on my comment on CST and LTK<br><br>(These are fake oppositions or papa plants or endorsed oppositions handpicked by the PAP to enter the sham papaliment to deceive the world there is democracy or something. 2nd tier to ensure cheating success (to realize greed) = the ncmps.)<br><br>oooooooooooooooooooooo<br><br>Your disdain of CST's and LTK's moderate political stance is harsh and unnecessarily absolute. They are around because they know how to work around the MIW system, realistically discerning which political battles they can win and avoiding any MIW nonsense of lawsuits all the while. They have a foot in the door strategy that is working.<br><br>(You are cleary blind or too stubborn or absolutely Dishonest not to accept the truth lay before you. The FACT is - both would have been easily wiped out in the last erection (power of the nss bribery) if not for PAP's last minute rescue.<br><br>As to their ability to bring success using their styles described by you.........:<br><br>This theory has been clearly debunked in no uncertain terms in the last LANDMARK erection as described umpteen times here.<br><br>Before the last erection, I have actually given these fake oppositions the benefit of the doubt that their mild style their way is The Way, but no more.<br><br>Once again - THE PAP DECIDES HOW MANY FAKE OPPOSITIONS THEY WILL ALLOW INTO PAPALIMENT. For the other CLONES of lowchiachiam, the pap decides how many to endorse or not to at all as shown in the last erection - using a simple technique = MEDIA GAG. All highly educated mild mannered candidates fielded as decribed umpteen times were comprehensively, supremely easily wiped out = the PhDs, masters degree, double degree well meaning souls...........all mild characters, clones of the three, or papa approved types. After Chiam's retirement at the next sham corrupt erection, Sylvia Lim is likely to be the next PAP darling girl to be endorsed into the sham papaliment........just watch. (For clowns out there who dont know, the pap had had kind words for the new wp chairwoman over the years, and the latter had also appeared in cheongsan alongside other female pap mps in last year national day write up in the controlled press.)<br></div>

This time round however, SDP's results were Relatively better than those of the other parties comparing the past 2 erections head to head suggesting the swing of votes from fake oppositions to Real, serious oppositions. Some maturity of voters seen here. (despite the shouting incident involving Dr Chee and the power abuser/s.)<br><br>3<br>Despite the name calling the vicious one sided character assassinations and attempted destruction of Dr Chee by the powerful press, TV (most powerful chinese 6.30pm, 10pm news watched by the majority citizens) unrelentlessly, following the shouting at the market, Dr Chee-GRC finished amongst the top amongst all oppositions losers. I had expected 10%-13% but they managed to procure some 20% which was amazing given what had happened and the power of the NSS bribery effects.<br><br>4<br>the popular fake oppositions or pap darlings chiam low chia nearly lost their seats at he last ge held during very bad economic times (which meant MOST FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS FOR OPPOSITIONS IN HISTORY hence LANDMARK ERECTION to test the notion Fake Opposition ways are the way), but were saved at the last minute by the PAP, and its bootlicking columnists who praised the fakes profusely as "good opposition" over 2 days or so in the powerful mass media after realizing the super super power and successes of the NSS bribery effect (of using people's money to buy vote shamlessly saying it was pap's money) over a naive, unquestioning, gullible population.<br><br>5<br>the very highly educated (before that some fielded were some not so well educated taxi drivers, secretary, supervisor type candidates) mild candidates or clones of chiam low chia fielded across the board were comprehensively wiped out Across the Board without a chance notwithstanding they are of "acceptable behaviour" to the PAP, suggesting fake opposition's Behaviour is now of no more use. To the naive, please note - PAP DECIDES HOW MANY FAKES THEY WILL ALLOW INTO PAPALIMENT AND WHICH OF THE FAKES THEY WILL ENDORSE. In contrast, "where is our money" real opposition dr chee was surprisingly not embarrassed badly at the poll but incomprehensibly did well relatively as analysed above.<br><br>Every one must be humble and get the context right in order not to sound silly or outdated fools.<br><br>Make no mistake..........ladies and gentlement........<br><br>=====================================<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To all Clowns - Fake opposition Definition<br><br>As a guide, fake opposition locally speaking means any opposition party that is led a leader who believes in so called "mild manners" which redundant or manners are endorsed and cultured by the corrupt PAP over the years as "acceptable behaviour" or "pro-Singapore" behaviour.<br><br>For example fake oppositions will be extremely quiet or not doing anything about the most important issues any real opposition will tackle vociferously and consistently = like taking the pap to task over the cheng san 200m violation issue, that if they had succeeded would have meant pap losing that 5 seats to wp team led by vocal, charismatic tang liang hong, jbj. Incomprehensibly, brutal means were used thereafter to cause the victims to flee and country and fake oppositions kept absolutely quiet of their bullying found no where else in the democratic, civilised world...............Failure to take the pap to task for using the supremely powrful, disgracefully compliant mass media and judiciary to systematically discredit, defame, bankrupt the charismatic, heavyweight defenseless oppositions rendering other heavyweights or potentials scared of joining opposition thus weakening the opposition Everlastingly............Failure to take the pap to task for their colossal failures and ultra greed in paying themselves 4-5 times the president of the united states' salary which ultra ultimate greed resulting in very high cost of living, eroding economic fundamentals, culminating in huge social problems for the country now and in time to come........Failure to protest vehemently against their inability to reach the masses via the most powerful instrument controlled 100% by the PAP the MASS MEDIA..........the very thing ensuring their long term demise.<br><br>What's the use of being an opposition when you can't reach the people? And by being unable to reach the people means ZERO CHANCE of making any impact at the sham erections. Now you all answer this most important most fundamental point honestly n intelligently.<br><br>So, fake oppositions are All except SDP. James Gomez may not have been the fake type but he is powerless after joining WP. Extremely quiet now versus those times when he was ThinkCentre leader doing some excellent work there. PAP 100% successful deceptive scheme - plant fake oppositions make them popular. Make real oppositions unpopular setting fakes as "role model" for "success" to con. Use the powerful mass media to do the brainwashing to ensure long term overall opposition demise.<br><br>To all arrogant clowns out there - to climb out of your tiny shell, to understand what is fake opposition or fake opposition behaviour, see how usa, britain, taiwan, japan, south korea oppositions behave and how corresponding ruling party behaves as a result of opposition actions and behaviour. Compare this to pap's archaic, disgraceful brutal, outrageous, corrupt behaviour to be sure what you born yesterdays/ clowns are talking about.<br><br>Still unsure, go back and analyze the last landmark erection results and the context of that erection, ie, held during the most favourable time in history for oppositions. And what kind of results was obtained ? Why was that so? How could that be possible ? What was wrong?.........are the pertinent questions all clowns have failed to ask. Clowns are clowns.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;I think you must re-learn your reading. My Thread reads "Who says WP, SDA are "Fake Opposition"? The answers are. QXP and Opinn007!<br>I did not put my thread as "WP and SDA are NOT "FAKE Opposition"! &lt;&lt;<br><br>I hv already dealt with what u say above in my msg 58007.120 which is reproduce below:<br><br>&gt;What kind of challenge did you put out in THIS THREAD?<br><br>You come here hoping to DISPROVE that WP &amp; SDA are "Fake Opposition" but you have FAILED to do so.<br><br>You are asked to list out some of your WP's achievements in effecting political changes or any significant contribution to/criticisms of govt. policies but you have FAILED to do so.&lt;<br><br>&gt;&gt;Hey, so it seems that the resident "intellectual" guy, QXP couldn't even read and understand the thread title at all?<br><br>Thus, after identifying yourself as the one who claim WP, SDA are "FAKE Opposition", then it is up to you to prove it! The onus of prove is on you, not me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">&lt;&lt;<br><br>My basis has nothing whatsoever to do with how people voted in Hougang or Potong Pasir.<br><br>I hv said that both depend on the goodwill of degenerate Scum Lee Kuan Yew to be where they are and the fact that neither has the guts to criticise govt policies esp those which directly affects degenerate Scum Lee Kuan Yew and his family's interest are evidence that they are phoney.<br><br>And by the way, what right have you got to speak for the SDA and of which I had debunked SPP's Goh Beng Yeow.<br><br>You are just being shameless and beneath contempt to repeat your same lies and deceit that it is me who should show that the WP is not phoney.<br><br>&gt;&gt;You talk as if your "REAL Opposition" could possibly "change" the political system in Singapore....but wait, where are your SDP right now?&lt;&lt;<br><br>My SDP?<br><br>Since when did I EVER say that I'm from the SDP, when I hv said many times that I don't belong to any political party?<br><br>Just another beneath contempt cheap SMEAR again from you who are obviosly in cahoot with the degenerate shameless beneath contempt running dog Scums who I see have come to your rescue.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Totally marginalized! How could a "BELOW AVERAGE", totally marginalized political party (as you termed it as "REAL") could possibly effect any changes to the status quo at all?&lt;&lt;<br><br>That why you are the half baked bag of hot air in cahoot with the running dog Scums which makes you and the WP phoney.<br><br>We are talking about WP being phoney not about being marginalised, which is not the issue.<br><br>Your statement that SDP is marginalised only strengthens the fact that WP is phoney, for the reason that I hv said above.<br><br>Where is Chia Thye Poh, Lim Chin Siong, JBJ, Francis Seow now?<br><br>Have they been marginalised and for what reasons?<br><br>My answer is that they are NOT phoney and posed a real threat to degenerate Scum Lee Kuan Yew or were/are not prepared to be his bootlickers unlike Low and especially Chiam.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The battle, is on the ground, not on some loofty dreams! If you want change, win the election, get 75% of the seats and start to become the govt; then you could talk about effective change!&lt;&lt;<br><br>That is NOT the issue here as to whether the WP &amp; SDA are "Fake Opposition".<br><br>&gt;&gt;If you couldn't even convince the voters of your vision or anything to win even one single seat, hey, please lah, stop talking big with such a big ego!&lt;&lt;<br><br>Again, That is NOT the issue here as to whether the WP &amp; SDA are "Fake Opposition".<br><br>&gt;&gt;And it is surprising that you mention that only the "FAKE Opposition" disappears, the "REAL" could take charge!So you are saying that your "REAL" opposition has no ability to compete at all? It could only prosper when others die? It could only have "monopoly" of opposition political discourse before it could do something great? You must be dreaming! And it is dangerous for people like you to take charge! It seems that you are not interested in Democracy at all, wanting to have monopoly over the political front!&lt;&lt;<br><br>Why don't you prove that I have said what you have just claimed that I had said.<br><br>Looks like you are another LIAR.<br><br>&gt;&gt;I am here, to show how you contradict yourself with your incoherent argument, just to show that you don't even know what you are talking about most of the time. REAL fighters, are not afraid of competition; in fact, they grow and evolve out of competitive environment!&lt;&lt;<br><br>Oh yeah, and you can claim all the success you want.<br><br>The fact that degenerate Scum Lee Kuan Yew thro his degenerate shameless evil beneath contempt running dog Scums have been trying to tell me to shut up for uttering my "incoherent argument, just to show that (I) don't even know what (I am)talking about most of the time."<br><br>I think people reading this should know WHO does NOT what he is talking in this thread and whether he is even coherent........incidentally you never say that I was incoherent before until I had used the word 'incoherent' on you. And you should have claimed that since you claimed that I "don't even know what (I am) talking about MOST OF THE TIME".<br><br>&gt;&gt;If you keep contradicting yourself, most probably your assertions of WP and SDA being "FAKE" don't even worth a pinch of salt at all. &lt;&lt;<br><br>Again I just need to repeat:<br><br>I think people reading this should know WHO does NOT what he is talking in this thread and whether he is even coherent........incidentally you never say that I was incoherent before until I had used the word 'incoherent' on you. And you should have claimed that since you claimed that I "don't even know what (I am) talking about MOST OF THE TIME".<br><br>Like I said, you are just another FRAUD and LIAR who relyon SMEAR and baseless accusations.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;I think you are just too arrogant to say all these below: .................and you claim "People" here "People" there, as if you represent them! &lt;&lt;<br>You can say whatever you want; but I can see many forumers here agree with me.<br><br>&gt;&gt;You don't even dare to stand for election and get votes, see how many people agree with you, and you claim "People" here "People" there, as if you represent them!<br><br>If the "Below Average" party could "represent" "PEOPLE" (one, two or three persons?), then I say, you are really anti-Democracy! &lt;&lt;<br><br>Whether I stand or don't stand has nothing to do with this thread as to whether WP &amp; SDA are "Fake Opposition".<br><br>Like I said, you are just another FRAUD and LIAR who relyon SMEAR and baseless accusations who needs to divert attention with your phoney cahoot role when you cannot disprove the notion that WP &amp; SDA are "Fake Opposition" or what I would term phoney.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ladies and gentlement.....<br><br>Fake Oppositions<br><br>During each erection, the pap will hail the fake bastards as good oppositions while the real, vocal, heavyweight ones as anti singapore oppositons thus sowing DISUNITY - the premise for long term demise of real oppositions growth.<br><br>As long as those bastards outdated fake oppositions chiamlowchia continue to be made use of by the PAP, oppositions have no hope. These 3 bastards and their parties have been doing absolutely nothing to fight for mass media access and to fight for level playing field - the chief determinants of real success at the polls.<br><br>To hell with good for nothing redundant fake oppositions betraying the trust of the nation. All they do is to keep silent and sleep in papaliment joyfully collecting ten thousand dollars per month. Lucrative conmanship stuff.<br><br>Paradoxically it is thus better to have pap winning one hundred percent than all except 3 given waste of time seats to distract public. Then only people will question and fake oppositions wake up their bloody naive ideas and reform = and unite with real oppos and the powerful international community to press for fair play and change for good - the prerequisite for any anticipated drastic oppo success at the polls.<br><br>Assholes chiamlowchia should just resign in shame for failure to seize this precious opportunity to stand behind dr chee and the international community to press for change. Their naive, silly "strategy", "tactics" have been proven total failure in the last Landmark erection.<br><br>The next PAP trick could be, facing mounting pressure from the international community over the Chee bullying, destruction saga, to let these fake oppos have two more seats bringing the total to five seats. Then ultra naive, ultra infantile, ultra silly population and forumers here will next hail the result as Success or "improvement" falling right into PAP's well designed scheme. Then by the next next erection, the PAP will take back two seats to give three. Alternate between 3 to 5, 5 to 3, 3 to 5, 5 to 3 and these silly asshole masses will be unable to detect the real problem - ie, Fucking outdated, redundant fake oppositions being made use of by the PAP not fighting for mass media access and level playing field. Result = Permanent PAP rule with easy earthquake victories at will and continuation of ULTRA GREED milking the people/system to the hilt until the ends of times.<br><br>Make no mistake........ladies and gentlement........<br></div>
