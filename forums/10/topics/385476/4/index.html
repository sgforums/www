              <h1 id="story_title">Singapore raises school fees for foreigners</h1>
              <div id="story_content"><br>
              <p>JOHOR BARU: Malaysians whose children are studying in Singapore have been caught by surprise by an announcement that school fees for permanent residents (PR) and non-PR students in the republic will be raised in 2011.</p>
              <p>Housewife Dalillah Yusof, 46, whose three children with PR are currently studying in Singapore, is shocked to hear about the development.</p>
              <p>“I am currently paying S$180 (RM440) per year for my son in secondary school and S$144 (RM352) each for my son and daughter in primary school.</p>
              <p>“If the Singapore Government increases the fees substantially, I may have to review my decision to send my children to schools there,” she said.</p>
              <p>Singapore Education Minister Ng Eng Hen recently announced the plan to increase the school fees for foreign students as part of a move to draw a distinction between Singaporeans and non-citizens.</p>
              <p>A businesswoman, who wished to be known as Hiu, 50, said she might have to consider other options should her non-PR daughter’s primary school fees be increased to triple the current amount.</p>
              <p>“She has been following the Singapore’s school syllabus for the whole of primary school.</p>
              <p>“It will be very difficult to take her out from the school as the syllabus is different from Malaysia,” she said.</p>
              <p>She however was thankful that the Singapore Government had given a year’s notice on the proposed hike.</p>
              <p>Currently, about 8% of students in national schools in the republic are PRs, and 4% are international students.</p>
              <p>The increase will be substantial, with fees for PRs to increase by more than three-fold by 2012. For instance, a PR in secondary school now pays S$264 (RM647) a year against a Singaporean’s S$252 (RM618).</p>
              <p>In 2012, the fees for PRs will go up to S$852 (RM2,084). For non-PR foreign students in secondary school, it could go up to as high as S$5,832 (RM14,267).</p>

              <p>The truth of the matter is that all these foreign talent(s) or foreigners being given pr status and citizenship is to <strong>garner votes for the incumbent party so as to stay in power.</strong> The PAP knows that it is losing ground so they came up with this dim-witted idea of foreign talent n immigration and so on so forth. <br>As to the argument that they are creating jobs - utter rubbish. <br>If Singaporeans are relatively expensive to hire - why dont the the incumbent party recruit and replace the present ministers for 1/3 of the salaries.

                              <p>The truth of the matter is that all these foreign talent(s) or
              foreigners being given pr status and citizenship is to
              <strong>garner votes for the incumbent party so as to stay in
              power.</strong> The PAP knows that it is losing ground so they came
              up with this dim-witted idea of foreign talent n immigration and so
              on so forth.<br>
              As to the argument that they are creating jobs - utter
              rubbish.<br>
              If Singaporeans are relatively expensive to hire - why dont the the
              incumbent party recruit and replace the present ministers for 1/3
              of the salaries. I m sure there are takers abound in the world.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the local media is utterly useless and rather lop-sided
              in its analysis/views/opinions and TR (Temasek Review) is a
              boon/beneditiction to the citizens.</p>
              <p>Vote this party out - and vote in new for changes!</p>
              <p>PS _ As for the often quoted and cliched views of respecting
              our Leaders; the so-called Asian ways n culture - utter crap
              and an insult. <strong>Read closely and scrutinize and one will see

              Yes, you are right.  After the election, PR and foreigners are to be worshipped as gods again.  Whether there will be any changes to the policies.  Remember this, any policies changed can be unchange.

              <p>The solution is to vote wisely and not be swayed by short term gains (monetary or otherwise) and see the situation NOW as it is and see where the country is heading for.</p>
              <p>What has been done in the past - which the ruling party seems to be falling back on and constantly inundating the citizenzry with veil threats of  non-support or low priority is a bluff.</p>
              <p>I do hope that thinking and intelligence would prevail and most of (in my opinion) things and .... can only change thru voting</p>
              <p>An analogy to exemplify what i mean by change - let them have the gun - the bullets (the ammunition) let the opposition have it.</p>
              <p>We ignored the perils of one-party rule and look at the predicament we are faced with.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, Singaporeans as a whole are going to continue to suffer at the hands of a few who seem to assume that they and only they have answers.</p>

              <h1>New citizen condemns suggestion to tweat P1 balloting rules to differentiate new citizens from old</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 29, 2009</span></p>
              <p>A former Malaysian and new Singapore citizen by the name of Chong Kok Kean had written a letter to AsiaOne yesterday condemning Mr Edmund Lin’s earlier letter to the Straits Times Forum urging the government to tweak Primary One balloting rules to give old citizens an advantage over the new citizens.</p>
              <p>Obviously sounding peeved and distraught, Mr Chong wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“As one of the new citizens, I condemn this practice emphatically as this rule is going to split the nation among the citizens……Mr Edmund Lin is trying to call for our Singapore Government to implement some sort of racist politics alike here but in another forms to split the old citizens from the new ones.”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Chong boasted that though new citizens do not serve National Service, they “contribute” to Singapore by bringing in investments:</p>
              <p><em>“While you can serve National Service (NS) because you are born Singaporean, some new citizens bring in millions of dollars of investment to Singapore after their conversion by transferring their entire wealth from overseas to Singapore.”‘</em></p>
              <p>Though it is true that some new citizens help add value to Singapore’s economy by bringing their wealth over, not all of them are as rich as Mr Chong.</p>
              <p>The Sunday Times reported last week of a China construction worker Mr Chen whose son just passed out as a SAF Officer from OCS. He got his Singapore citizenship within 12 years.</p>
              <p>With due respect to Mr Chen, how much “wealth” is he able to transfer from China to Singapore? Besides construction workers, cleaners, masseurs and beauticians are given Singapore PRs and citizenships easily too.</p>
              <p>According to the Home Affairs Ministry, two out of every three PR applicants are successful, an astonishing high success rate considering the fact that there is no minimum period of residency imposed here in Singapore before a foreigner can even qualify to apply for PR.</p>
              <p>Mr Chong appeared to be eager to have a “taste” of National Service:</p>
              <p><em>“We could equally serve the NS if we were born here; we are willing to trigger the gun shot to fight our enemies even though we are not trained in NS.”</em></p>
              <p>Perhaps Mr Chong would like to walk his talk by enlisting himself for National Service at the MINDEF Manpower branch at Depot Road. He should have a feel of how it is like to waste the two most precious and productive years of a man’s life “rotting away” in the SAF.</p>
              <p>Mr Chong ended his letter with an impassioned plea that he does not want Singapore to end up becoming another racist country.</p>
              <p>Singapore was really never a racist country like Malaysia, except that in Singapore, some people think they are a class above the rest just because they belong to a particular political party.</p>
