              <p>I sincerely think it will happen, especially if we does mass demostration, which would probably only happen when we have a catastrophic event (mass starvation cause by influx of FT?)</p>

              <p>Extra ballot for children of Singapore citizens to apply for places in primary schools</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 20, 2009</span></p>
              <p>In another sign that elections will be called anytime soon next year, the ruling party has allocated one additional ballot for Singaporeans to apply for places in primary schools for their children to “sweeten” the ground.</p>
              <p>The new rule will take effect from 2010. As of now, Signaporeans and PRs both have one chance to ballot which had caused considerable unhappiness among some Singapore citizens whose children are unable to get into the primary school of their choice.</p>
              <p>Balloting is done when the number of applications is more than the available vacancies. In popular schools, Singapore citizens often have to compete with PRs for a place which led many to vent their frustration on the government for not looking after the interests of citizens first.</p>
              <p>The issue sparked an outcry in August this year when a Mr Eduard Tay wrote in to the Straits Times Forum complaining about his son’s unsuccessful application for a place in a neighborhood school as he has to vie with children registered under Phase 1A, 2A1, 2A2, 2B and first-generation permanent residents’ (PRs) children under Phase 2C.</p>
              <p>His letter prompted an almost immediate response from an Indian PR Mrs Sweta Agarwal who justified the equal chance given to PRs because they “pay taxes and abide by Singapore’s laws”.  She also issued a veiled threat that PRs may consider leaving Singapore if their children cannot get into the schools of their choice.</p>
              <p>Mrs Agarwal’s insensitive letter triggered a massive furore among Singaporeans. Mr Jimmy Loke replied a day letter castigating Mrs Agarwal for not taking up citizenship after a lengthy six years as a PR.</p>
              <p><em>“Mrs Agarwal has the option of returning to her country to find a good school for her daughter. Mr Tay’s child does not enjoy that luxury. As a Singaporean, Mr Tay served national service for 21/2 years and spent 13 more years as a reservist. Should any government not take care of its citizens first?”,</em> he added.</p>
              <p>The deluge of letters published in the Straits Times Forum showed that the equal chance enjoyed by PRs in primary school application is becoming a point of contention among Singaporeans, especially those from the middle class.</p>
              <p>Besides having two chances to ballot, school fees for PRs and foreign students will also be increased by between $36.50 and $73 per month and between $100 and $400 per month respectively from 2011, while school fees for Singaporeans will remain unchanged.</p>
              <p>According to the state media, “these changes were announced by Minister of Education Ng Eng Hen on Sunday during a community visit and is part of the Government’s move to sharpen differentiation between Singaporeans and non-citizens.”</p>
              <p>With more and more foreigners and PRs working and living in Singapore, the additional ballot does not increase the chances of Singaporeans getting their children into a preferred school since they now have to compete with a larger pool of applicants.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the token increase in school fees is of scant consolation to Singaporeans since foreigners and PRs who are able to enrol their children in Singapore schools should be pretty well to do in the first place.</p>
              <p>Despite widespread resentment and anger at the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy, it continues to insist that immigration is “essential” for Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a recent speech, MM Lee Kuan Yew ticked off Japanese leaders publicly for not “adopting” Singapore’s open-door policy to replenish its declining population via immigration.</p>
              <p>Unless the ruling party makes wholesale changes to its current policy and limit the influx of foreigners into Singapore, even two or three ballots may not be sufficient for Singaporeans in the future.</p>

              <p>Not so easy this time because many Singaporeans lost their jobs and the government allows so many foreigners who take away the rice bowls of Singaporean workers.</p>
              <p>These unemployed Singaporean workers cannot find jobs that cover their cost of living. They are almost sure to vote for the opposition and there are thousands and thousands of these unemployed workers.</p>
