              <p>Extra ballot for children of Singapore citizens to apply for places in primary schools</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 20, 2009</span></p>
              <p>In another sign that elections will be called anytime soon next year, the ruling party has allocated one additional ballot for Singaporeans to apply for places in primary schools for their children to “sweeten” the ground.</p>
              <p>The new rule will take effect from 2010. As of now, Signaporeans and PRs both have one chance to ballot which had caused considerable unhappiness among some Singapore citizens whose children are unable to get into the primary school of their choice.</p>
              <p>Balloting is done when the number of applications is more than the available vacancies. In popular schools, Singapore citizens often have to compete with PRs for a place which led many to vent their frustration on the government for not looking after the interests of citizens first.</p>
              <p>The issue sparked an outcry in August this year when a Mr Eduard Tay wrote in to the Straits Times Forum complaining about his son’s unsuccessful application for a place in a neighborhood school as he has to vie with children registered under Phase 1A, 2A1, 2A2, 2B and first-generation permanent residents’ (PRs) children under Phase 2C.</p>
              <p>His letter prompted an almost immediate response from an Indian PR Mrs Sweta Agarwal who justified the equal chance given to PRs because they “pay taxes and abide by Singapore’s laws”.  She also issued a veiled threat that PRs may consider leaving Singapore if their children cannot get into the schools of their choice.</p>
              <p>Mrs Agarwal’s insensitive letter triggered a massive furore among Singaporeans. Mr Jimmy Loke replied a day letter castigating Mrs Agarwal for not taking up citizenship after a lengthy six years as a PR.</p>
              <p><em>“Mrs Agarwal has the option of returning to her country to find a good school for her daughter. Mr Tay’s child does not enjoy that luxury. As a Singaporean, Mr Tay served national service for 21/2 years and spent 13 more years as a reservist. Should any government not take care of its citizens first?”,</em> he added.</p>
              <p>The deluge of letters published in the Straits Times Forum showed that the equal chance enjoyed by PRs in primary school application is becoming a point of contention among Singaporeans, especially those from the middle class.</p>
              <p>Besides having two chances to ballot, school fees for PRs and foreign students will also be increased by between $36.50 and $73 per month and between $100 and $400 per month respectively from 2011, while school fees for Singaporeans will remain unchanged.</p>
              <p>According to the state media, “these changes were announced by Minister of Education Ng Eng Hen on Sunday during a community visit and is part of the Government’s move to sharpen differentiation between Singaporeans and non-citizens.”</p>
              <p>With more and more foreigners and PRs working and living in Singapore, the additional ballot does not increase the chances of Singaporeans getting their children into a preferred school since they now have to compete with a larger pool of applicants.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the token increase in school fees is of scant consolation to Singaporeans since foreigners and PRs who are able to enrol their children in Singapore schools should be pretty well to do in the first place.</p>
              <p>Despite widespread resentment and anger at the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy, it continues to insist that immigration is “essential” for Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a recent speech, MM Lee Kuan Yew ticked off Japanese leaders publicly for not “adopting” Singapore’s open-door policy to replenish its declining population via immigration.</p>
              <p>Unless the ruling party makes wholesale changes to its current policy and limit the influx of foreigners into Singapore, even two or three ballots may not be sufficient for Singaporeans in the future.</p>

              <p>Netizens unimpressed by “half-hearted” measure in school fee change to “enhance” privileges of being a citizen</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 21, 2009</span></p>
              <p>The recent move announced by Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen to give an additional ballot to children of Singaporeans applying for places in primary schools was greeted with scepticism by the online community.</p>
              <p>The balloting edge will be implemented next year. School fees will also be raised for PRs and foreigners in 2011 while fees for Singaporeans will remain unchanged.</p>
              <p>A PR in secondary school now pays only $264 a year or $14 more than a Singaporean. It will go up to $852 in 2010.</p>
              <p>As expected, the state media has applauded the government’s move to make a “clearer distinction” between citizens and PRs without asking the key question on why it was not introduced in the first place and only now with the elections around the corner.</p>
              <p>Netizens are equally unimpressed and some pointed out that it is probably another ploy to “sweeten” the ground ahead of the election due by 2011.</p>
              <p><strong>goaheadbingostan</strong> wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“Election coming – expect more nice things throughout 2010 under the guise of improving economy.”</em></p>
              <p>His views were echoed by <strong>bohliao:</strong></p>
              <p><em>“The signs are on the wall…The machineries have started, the groundwork is being laid, the barrage of propaganda is gaining pace churning out ‘goodies’ after ‘goodies’…Time is at hand. Even the very ‘discerned’ shall be deceived… be thou faithful and look beyond what’s material and consider the sufferings of many. Chang</em>e is nigh, the tide must not be turned. We have the power to change…”</p>
              <p><strong>Moondance</strong> felt that Singaporeans should get the priority in everything from education to jobs:</p>
              <p><em>“Let’s just keep it simple – Singaporeans will be first choice in everything from NS to jobs and in this thread, EDUCATION. Singaporeans FIRST. Only after Singaporeans are done with the process then, PRs and the rest. To be very fair to all, PRs or Foreigners, you too, WILL GET FIRST CHOICE as any Singaporeans when you are a SINGAPOREAN (citizen) With this in place, there will no longer be any arguments relating / pertaining to issues such as this. Last but but least, STOP !!! don’t treat naturalised Singaporeans as IDIOTS &amp; FOOLS.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>Kampongkid</strong> thinks that the change will only encourage more PRs to volunteer in grassroots organizations which will nullify the additional ballot for citizens:</p>
              <p><em>“A half-hearted measure!!! Why not simply separate PRs to another phase??? What’s the point of giving sgreans 2 ballot slips??? When you’re ‘sway’ (luckless), you’ll sure to be ‘swayer’ than the one Lady Luck smiles at. Give you 10 more slips, his / her only 1 slip will still be the one being picked.</em></p>
              <p><em>And will we be seeing more PRs as grassroots volunteers soon??? As volunteers, they’ll also be getting more than one chance, isn’t it??? Better still, it’s in a different phase, nei!!!”</em></p>
              <p>Grassroots leaders are given priorities in application for public housing and primary schools.</p>
              <p>Minister of Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan revealed lately that there are currently 4,500 new citizens serving as grassroots leaders in various constituencies in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The number of PRs who are grassroots leaders are unknown though there is a 15 per cent cap on their numbers.</p>
              <p>The issue of PRs enjoying equal chance in primary school application came to a head in August this year with a furious exchange of letters between Singaporeans and an Indian PR by the name of Sweta Agarwal who insisted that PRs should enjoy equal rights as citizens as they “pay taxes and obey the laws” of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>Of the 64 per cent who are citizens, the actual percentage of local-born and bred Singaporeans is not known.</p>
              <p>Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng told parliament last month that there were over 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens last year of whom some are construction workers, cleaners and masseurs.</p>
              <p>At this rate the ruling party is “giving” Singapore citizenship away to foreigners, true blue Singaporeans may soon find themselves in the minority one day.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be hoodwinked by this latest gimmick from the ruling party to appease them.</p>
              <p>Without denying the PAP its traditional two-thirds majority in parliament to pass legislation and policies as and when it wishes, Singaporeans are forever at its mercy.</p>
              <p>The cosmetic changes it is introducing now to win their votes can easily be reversed after the next election and they will be completely helpless to do anything about it.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Prime Minister Lee had reiterated that there would not be any major changes to the government’s immigration policies except some minor “tweaks”.</p>
              <p>“Tweaks” like offering one more ballot chance for Singaporeans will become insignificant when they find themselves competing against a larger pool of PRs and foreigners.</p>
              <p>The tide of immigration must be controlled and slowed down before it turns into a flood “drowning” out our voices.</p>

              <p>The measures are not punishment, so there is nothing to say if they deserve it.</p>
              <p>The message is that it costs so much to provide education in Singapore and it doesn't make sense anymore for Singaporean to subsidise PR. If you want Singapore education, you have to pay.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, it is the singaporean who should not take things for granted. Some other singaporeans are subsidizing your education!</p>

              <p>with ref to Pri 1 thingy, I think what's done is overdue and half-measured. Why do singaporeans still have to fight with PR for a place? so now we get 2 slips, if we complains, will we get more? All singapaporeans should get the slots, then the PRs ballot for the remainder..else, what's the point of the pink IC?</p>
              <p>yes, to some PRs, this seems bloody unfair, but then why not get the citizenship?why continue to be treated as 2nd class citizens?</p>
              <p>another issue, some "new" singaporeans may be finding gaps in the Pri school registrations, as we can see a sudden "interest" in this "new" singaporeans volunteering their time for all RC or etc activities. Once they serve their 1yr, and get the letter from the chairman, and registered their kids, it seems their schedules would suddenly be super full..</p>
              <p>Hnece, I think, that they should extend the minimum to 3 yrs, meaning, U want to move house, can, u need to stay 3 yrs before U are allowed to register ur kids under a better grading, U need to serve at least 3yrs in the RC or etc to get the letter. maybe it would help.</p>
