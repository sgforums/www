            <div class='col-md body'>Our education is an elitist education system...every kid is forced to be good at a topic or subject that maybe at that time...(or anytime for that matter) they aren't good in<br><br>I sometimes view our schools as something like manufacturing plants...<br><br>Kids go in...<br>gets psychoed that they need to succeed...<br>gets psychoed also to be someone useful...<br>Must look like people who succeed...(hence the hair cuts and discipline)<br>Once they're old enough, they go out and become what they're programmed to be.<br><br>Sounds robotic doesn't it?<br><br>But i believe kids cannot be forced into that kind of mould all the time..<br><br>As we get more and more exposed to the different kinds of people outside, their success stories, Kids realise that most of these successful people have a common thing...<br><br>1) They either don't go to school or don't finish school<br>2) Some dont have a good education...(aka degree with 1st class honours that kind of shit)<br><br>Kids realise that schools are not teaching them what it takes to succeed outside. Rather we're being taught to be good singaporeans...<br>With little forsight of our full potential...<br><br>Maybe knowing that schools cannot provide this opportunity, <strong>their indiscipline become more pronounced. Even kids realise, that they're just getting a piece of paper as more of a stepping stone to a higher level, also knowing that the next level could not help them achieve their dreams. Hence they don't see the need to be disciplined...</strong><br><br>That said, i think haircut is just a small factor...But hey, doesn't mean got long colour hair the kid is bad right?<br><br>It has to be noted though,<br>Those people who succeed also has one more important factor to their success...<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AND THAT IS DISCIPLINE</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you know our system is seriously fcuked when this country of ours claims to be "developed" but deprives our children of the carefree, liberal, devil-may-care childhood/teenage years that other developed nations offer their children. hypocrisy indeed. now i look back and lament how my youth was wasted in our crappy primary and secondary schools with uniforms, short hair and all those redundant rules. self-righteous disciplinary rule-obsessed fanatics can go live in north korea or china if they like everything to be so tightly regulated and restrained  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
