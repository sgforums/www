              <p>It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore’s rules and institutions.<br>Many of Singapore’s most prominent Chinese have baba backgrounds.<br>Lee Kuan Yew, who incidentally became prime minister of Singapore when<br>aged just 35, is the most obvious example.

He married a Semarang-born Chinese.<br>His maternal grandfather was a Hokkien from Malacca. His maternal<br>grandmother was a Pontianak-born Chinese who spoke Hakka and Malay.<br>They were a wealthy Straits family. Their daughter – Lee’s mother – was<br>married in 1922 at the age of 15. Lee says in his autobiography that part of<br>her dowry included a little slave girl whose duty it was to help bathe and<br>dress her.<br><br>And when Lee himself married, he chose a local nonya woman,<br>Kwa Geok Choo, whose father was a Java-born Chinese and mother was a<br>Straits-born Chinese, ‘like my own mother’, says Lee.<br><br>Lee’s mother, Lee Chin Koon, was a highly respected authority on<br>nonya/baba cuisine. She wrote a book on the subject, Mrs Lee’s Cookbook<br>first published in 1974.<br><br>It was edited by her Hawaiian-born<br>daughter-in-law Pamelia Lee, who married Lee Kuan Yew’s brother Lee<br>Suan Yew. The preface was written by Wee Kim Wee, another baba, and<br>in fact, her cousin. Wee served as the high commissioner to Malaysia<br>(1973–80) and in 1985 was appointed president of Singapore.

He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China,<br>but as a baba who looked to England. His language, food and culture were<br>not that of a Chinese. And he followed the conventional career path of a<br>baba. Not for him shopkeeping or trading. He went to London to study<br>law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam<br>College, Cambridge.

His cousin, also a Malacca baba, was Tan<br>Siew Sin, who became Malaysia’s first finance minister.<br>Goh attended the Anglo-Chinese School and Raffles College in Singapore<br>– standard schooling for a baba son. He then joined the colonial Civil<br>Service in Singapore. After the war he decided to study in London and so<br>it was to the London School of Economics that he went.

He was<br>appointed executive chairman of Singapore Press Holdings in 1988 and<br>then became chairman of Singapore’s Presidential Board of Advisors.<br>Long-term PAP chairman Toh Chin Chye is another of the old guard<br>with a baba background. His first language was not Hokkien, Teochiu or<br>Hakka, but English. With Goh, Lee and Sinnathamby Rajaratnam, Toh<br>formed the inner core that ran Singapore from 1959 until about the mid1970s<br>when his influence waned.<br><br>And so this is the coterie that designed<br>and ran Singapore – three babas and a Jaffna Tamil.<br>Current Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Tony Tan is a<br>prominent second generation politician with a baba background.

              <p>“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into
                  politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the
                  benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today’s generation
                  has no culture</strong></span> and averse to taking political risk. Really, an interest
                  in politics is very necessary for the future. But I cannot blame the
                  present generations, because they see the heavy-handed response by the
                  government to dissenting views, even though they know that these
                  matters involve their daily lives.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So the result is that we have
                  produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very
                  calculating. They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative.
                  It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics
                  and business. </strong></span>Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like,
                  can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul
                  and what we need in Singapore is soul. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Because it is soul that makes
                  society.”</strong></span></p>

              married<br> a local Hakka girl. His paternal grandfather was locally born.
              Lee<br> describes him as an ‘Anglophile’. He married a Semarang-born

              to<br> Singapore, then returned to the LSE to complete a PhD and then went
              back<br> to Singapore to resume a life in public service. He was
              instrumental in<br> setting up many of Singapore’s most well-known government bodies:

              Estate.<br> It was all about development – but development that proceeded
              along<br> structured and paternalistic lines.<br> <br> It was also Goh’s Victorian attitudes on savings and frugal
              government<br> spending that has given Singapore the huge external reserves that
              it has<br> today. And it was at Goh’s instigation that the Singapore
              Symphony<br> Orchestra was established. No noisy, clanging Chinese opera for

              Singapore<br> Totaliser Board in 1994. As he entered the room with an
              outstretched hand,<br> my immediate impression was that he looked more Malay than
              Chinese.<br> He was charming and welcoming, his voice was deep and his

              Goh<br> was not a fan. ‘A lot of Singaporeans will lose their shirts in
              China’, he’d<br> said. China was messy, its legal system too poor and the going

              seen<br> to that.<br> <br> Another influential baba was Lim Kim San. He was born to a
              wealthy<br> local family and as a fourth generation Straits-born Chinese did
              not speak<br> <br> Chinese at home but Malay. In 1960, he became chairman of the

              and<br> then became chairman of Singapore’s Presidential Board of
              Advisors.<br> Long-term PAP chairman Toh Chin Chye is another of the old
              guard<br> with a baba background. His first language was not Hokkien, Teochiu
              or<br> Hakka, but English. With Goh, Lee and Sinnathamby Rajaratnam,
              Toh<br> formed the inner core that ran Singapore from 1959 until about the
              mid1970s<br> when his influence waned.<br> <br> And so this is the coterie that designed<br> and ran Singapore – three babas and a Jaffna Tamil.<br> Current Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Tony Tan is
              a<br> prominent second generation politician with a baba background. The
              other<br> deputy prime minister is of course Lee Hsien Loong, Lee Kuan Yew’s

              <p>“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today’s generation has no culture</strong></span> and averse to taking political risk. Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future. But I cannot blame the present generations, because they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So the result is that we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating. They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative. It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business.</strong></span> Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and what we need in Singapore is soul. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Because it is soul that makes society.”</strong></span></p>

              <p>Why should i care about his opinion? Whether i want to know my dialect and know my ancestors is my own bloody choice, i don't need nor want the government to do anything about it.  </p>
              <p>English and Mandarin  are practical languages to learn, even my grandfather knew that. He made all his children attend Chinese schools in the morning, and English in the afternoon. Singapore wasn't even independent then.</p>
