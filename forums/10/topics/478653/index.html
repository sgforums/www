            <div class='col-md body'>From the world history perspective, most people probably agree with the war will never end. A city state with massive wealth like Singapore can be targeted by many big nations with strong military power in future. What's the plan when Singapore is attacked by a strong military power (Letâ€™s say any nation)? Please don't tell me the USA will fly here to save Singapore like Georgian people thought during the war against Russia. I would encourage the government to either merger with big nations in south Asia like India, Thailand, since Chinese-Singaporean Chinese relative already messed up and White majority nations will treat Singapore like a colonial state.  And no Malaysia, since they prejudice on Singaporean and Malaysian Chinese. I'm just curious what you guys think. It seems like Singaporean people just live for today and has no foresight or concern about being a colonial or subordinate state in future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with SG have too few long term setbacks. I don't understand why we don't want the ties with Chinese people, since our ancestors are Chinese and you can find Chinese values in all Singaporean Chinese families. SG probably doesnâ€™t want to merger with China like hongkong, which an advanced city suddenly became responsible for mainlandâ€™s economy, but at least donâ€™t lose the relative with China. Wait and see how they doing with their economy after few decades. Like Lee Kuan Yew said, speak English publicly and Chinese at home, so we can keep the strong tie with China. I see too many people here prejudice on China. Would we all be prejudiced one day to be forced to merger with Malay? How can one guarantee the world will always remain as peaceful?</div>

              I think Singapore will remain neutral in the event of any conflict/war near this region just like Switzerland and Thailand during WW2. Singapore will not be attack for our wealth because we don't have precious mineral resources. However, Singapore is a strategic area for sea lane and I see Singapore being attack if only that war monger country plans to conquer the world together with their allies in the western region of the world like the Axis countries during WW2. Other than that I see Singapore is neutral and no threats except terrorists attack. 
              
              I see Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Brunei, Sabah, Sarawak, Indonesia (Kalimantan) and the Philippines are under threats.

              You can't compare Sg to Switzerland and Thailand. Sg is almost same size with their capital cities. According to warfare econ. theory, nations are interesting in capitals even for short term finance. Plus, like you said, sg is a naval strategic location. About comparing to Indonesia? haha, we are not even on the top 20 national power list. For sg to stay in netural is like to put two feet on two boats, not a smat plan.

              <p>Singapore came under external control 3 times.</p>
              <p>First by the Brit, through colonization. We became independent through civil means.</p>
              <p>Second
               by the Jap, through military occupation. We got out of it because of 2 
              atom bombs, and of course, the lives of the many allied countries 
              (Thailand wasn't one of them) who fought all over asia against the Jap.</p>
              <p>Finally, we went to bed with Malaysia but got kicked out when they realized we didn't submit to their wishes.</p>
              <p>The Brit came from half way round the world, the Jap came from the region, and of course the neighbour next door.</p>
              <p>Countries
               take sides for their own benefits, or national interest, or allow us to
               take their side if it suits their interest. If their interest comes in 
              conflict with ours, they will want to sacrifice us. Japan and America 
              were at war with each others, but went to bed when they had the common 
              foe, the communist China, who are now friend to many countries due to 
              their economic influence. America was strong ally of ROC but turned 
              against them when they needed to go to bed with PRC.</p>
              <p>so who are our friends? there is none in the long term!</p>
              <p>Maintain
               our identity and neutrality, to ensure our long term survivality and 
              sovereinty. Being a city state is an advantage, easy to manage, some 
              people said; also a disadvantage, so small, not easy to manage, other 
              people said.</p>

                                  <p>Singapore came under external control 3 times.</p>
                  <p>First by the Brit, through colonization. We became independent
                  through civil means.</p>
                  <p>Second by the Jap, through military occupation. We got out of it
                  because of 2 atom bombs, and of course, the lives of the many
                  allied countries (Thailand wasn't one of them) who fought all over
                  asia against the Jap.</p>
                  <p>Finally, we went to bed with Malaysia but got kicked out when
                  they realized we didn't submit to their wishes.</p>
                  <p>The Brit came from half way round the world, the Jap came from
                  the region, and of course the neighbour next door.</p>
                  <p>Countries take sides for their own benefits, or national
                  interest, or allow us to take their side if it suits their
                  interest. If their interest comes in conflict with ours, they will
                  want to sacrifice us. Japan and America were at war with each
                  others, but went to bed when they had the common foe, the communist
                  China, who are now friend to many countries due to their economic
                  influence. America was strong ally of ROC but turned against them
                  when they needed to go to bed with PRC.</p>
                  <p>so who are our friends? there is none in the long term!</p>
                  <p>Maintain our identity and neutrality, to ensure our long term
                  survivality and sovereinty. Being a city state is an advantage,
                  easy to manage, some people said; also a disadvantage, so small,
                  not easy to manage, other people said.</p>
