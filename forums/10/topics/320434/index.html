                                    defamation</em><br> <strong>David vs Goliath </strong><br> Necessary laws of course, but if excessively done can backfire 
                                    with long-term negative impact for 21st Century Singapore. 
                                    By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com.<br> Jun 7, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>"BETWEEN 
                                    being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli 
                                    was right. If nobody is afraid of me, I’m meaningless,”</em> said Lee Kuan Yew on Oct 6, 1997.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Today, 
                                    in a changed Singapore, the Minister Mentor has not lost 
                                    sight of this tough maxim to instil fear in his political 
                                    foes when he feels threatened or if his integrity is impugned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Yet 
                                    again, the 84-year-old founding leader last week resorted 
                                    to the republic’s controversial defamation (and libel) 
                                    laws – among the developed world’s harshest 
                                    – against an outspoken activist.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On the 
                                    receiving end – one more time – was Dr Chee 
                                    Soon Juan, secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic 
                                    Party, who is already a bankrupt following an unpaid S$400,000 
                                    libel award in 2001.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    US-trained neuro-psychologist is a relative political non-entity, 
                                    who is not regarded as a threat to the powerful Minister 
                                    Mentor or his son Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">(In 
                                    the 2006 election, Chee’s only team battled hard but 
                                    won only 20% of the votes, the worst of the opposition showings.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">That 
                                    the towering Lee decided to move against a political small 
                                    fry and risk his own stature surprised many Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Referring 
                                    to troublemakers four years ago, Lee had said: “If 
                                    we considered them serious political figures we would not 
                                    have kept them politically alive for so long. We could have 
                                    made them bankrupt earlier.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">What 
                                    was more amazing is that he and the Prime Minister had agreed 
                                    to be grilled by Chee in open court, which the latter made 
                                    much capital of.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Last 
                                    week’s hearing was to decide damages since defamation 
                                    had already been summarily decided.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">During 
                                    the confrontation, which was played down by the mainstream 
                                    media, Chee fired a series of embarrassing questions that 
                                    were cut off by Lee’s counsel as “irrelevant”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Dr Chee 
                                    may be hit by punitive damages. But in the court of public 
                                    opinion, neither side came out winners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    opposition leader, however, has emerged with an improved 
                                    standing among Singaporeans who hanker for a stronger opposition. 
                                    Coffeeshop critics talk of “bullying”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A number 
                                    of people who had long disliked his loud method of street 
                                    confrontations say they now understand him better. Websites 
                                    had carried his emotional court statement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“After 
                                    so many years of watching how Dr Chee has been treated, 
                                    my hatred for him has turned into empathy,” said one 
                                    online message. “Now, I simply hope that Singapore 
                                    would be able to have more of him.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    majority of conservative Singaporeans, however, still keep 
                                    the trust for their leaders and regard Dr Chee’s political 
                                    manners with some disdain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But 
                                    in many ways, this defamation action has been a catalyst 
                                    of sorts. For one thing, it is different from the past when 
                                    the public also had a lop-sided view of the proceedings 
                                    from the pro-government media.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This 
                                    time, however, the Internet carried transcripts of the court 
                                    exchanges and the opposition views that were ignored by 
                                    the press as well as statements from Dr Chee’s party. 
                                    They offered a more balanced picture.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">What 
                                    followed was an online buzz with some people saying the 
                                    frequent use of the court to bankrupt politicians has a 
                                    wider impact on society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    one reason why so many Singaporeans with talent had migrated 
                                    to “freer” countries, said Bernise Ang.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A writer, 
                                    identified only as Bender, said Lee’s action had indirectly 
                                    bred “a culture of defamation” here among Singaporeans 
                                    to resort to suing each other at the slightest reason.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“It 
                                    favours the rich and powerful since the poor – even 
                                    if they’re right – cannot afford lawyers,” 
                                    said another critic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">More 
                                    importantly, it raised the question whether Lee’s 
                                    longstanding use of defamation (or libel) laws really serves 
                                    the nation’s long-term interests.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Between 
                                    1979 and 2005, his government had instituted 17 such cases 
                                    against opposition figures – all of them successfully 
                                    – in Singapore courts, according to records.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    awards totalled some S$6.9mil and the amounts had been steadily 
                                    creeping upwards over the past 15 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">They 
                                    do not include libel cases against the foreign media nor 
                                    those against politicians, which were settled out of court.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Lee 
                                    has said that these laws and their strict implementation 
                                    are important to protect the integrity of the government, 
                                    its leaders and the system, and to maintain stability.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Whatever 
                                    the benefits, the culture of suing people has a big negative. 
                                    It may have also created a largely compliant population, 
                                    which is too fearful to discuss, let alone take part in, 
                                    politics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“When 
                                    a person can be charged for defamation just for saying that 
                                    joining the ruling People’s Action Party is the best 
                                    career move, who wants to stand for election and risk bankruptcy?” 
                                    asked a critic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Opposition 
                                    parties usually fail to field enough candidates to stand 
                                    for even half the contested seats in Singapore’s elections.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    result is a democracy in which half the voters play no part. 
                                    In some areas, some have lived for decades without casting 
                                    a vote, an ideal scenario to breed apathy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    ruling party attributes this to a weak opposition but part 
                                    of the reason is a fear of being sued for making a marginal 
                                    comment. Few are prepared to spend so much money on a defence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                                    are many moderate voices to support Lee to say that the 
                                    existence of defamation laws are crucial to safeguard the 
                                    rights of individuals from being maligned or slandered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But 
                                    they say these should be used only against malicious and 
                                    reckless accusers, not in marginal instances.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Our 
                                    leaders urge people to speak up. They should walk the talk 
                                    if they really want the people to grow,” said ‘Witness’ 
                                    online.</span></p>
              <p><em>our leaders always like to claim that we're now first world nation but their behaviour show that they have yet to step over the threshold of a 3rd world nation.</em></p>

              <p>So LKY has admitted that he will only bankrupt those whom he feel will threaten him and his political party - could his concentrated efforts at bankrupting CSJ be indication that he see CSJ as a real threat ?</p>
              <p>Understanding his statement will give us the basis for concluding that CSJ was being cut down to make sure that no other qualified persons will enter the political arena on the side of the Alternative Parties.</p>
              <p>This will also explain the remarks made by retired Senior Civil Servant - Mr Ngiam Tong Dow - who asked - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/58178">“Singapore ‘Bigger than PAP – shouldn’it be”. </a>?</p>
