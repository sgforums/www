              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Thai traditional massage, I used to go everyday until my body became so well massaged all my aches and pains disappeared (about S$10 for two hours.)</span><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">One Singapore chap said that in Bangkok, he never bathes himself... different girls bathe him everyday because they have bath houses there and it cost only about S$20.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporeans in Singapore are just stupid to let the government take their money with direct and indirect taxes and take their money by making everything so expensive... (Thai traditional massage in Singapore, the cheapest is also around S$25 for about 1/2 hours)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">All because when the despots persecute opposition and dissidents like Dr Chee Soon Juan, they pretend they dont see. Singaporeans pay for doing that, ignoring the evil. Singaporeans deserve it.</span></span></p>

              <p>this is a win-win situation. which filipino grad would want to graduate from nus/ntu and head back to metro manila for a US$500 job (if one is lucky) when you can get 3x of it here? and better prospect too.</p>
              <p>the singapore gahmen realized this `lobang' long time already. having said that, it is not 100% enforced. in the last crisis, my NUS fren who is a civil engineer was ok'd to leave without fulfilling the 3 year requirement becos the civil engineering field here were depleted. he went back to malaysia and joined his father's firm which build roads for the gahmen. of cos, he was lucky in that sense.</p>

              <p>Be honest with yourself: are you leaving because there are specific pull factors (a more developed sector for your job, for instance), or because you're running away from your perceived hardship here?</p>
              <p>Emigration is never easy; if you want to escape from problems, you'll find new ones elsewhere to continue making your life miserable until you learn to be satisfied with what you have. You might be surprised by how people everywhere are unhappy with their own politicians and bureaucracy.</p>
              <p>And contrary to your belief, Orientals are not despised by the majority. You don't need that imagined baggage to add to your woes.</p>
              <p>Be aware of the hypocrisy of citing the arrival of FTs as a reason for moving out, because it makes you one of them too.</p>
