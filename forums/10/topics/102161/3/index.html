            <div class='col-md body'>From Lefleche:<br><br>From what I read so far on the threads on education and other social issues, i believe that theres a certain percentage of reasonable pple here. wanna just bring<br>up some issues to hear the views of those who are not within the education service. i guess insiders like us need some outside perspectives while outsiders need<br>some inside information in order to come to a balance understanding of an issue. pardon the casual english, its late at night.<br><br>in my 4 yrs of teaching, it is becoming increasingly troublingto me to notice that the general trend of education is not to educate but to please. it starts with<br>a very troubling (to me at least) assumption: our students and their parents are our customers, therefore the customer is always rite. implicit is when a child<br>joins a school, the school 'owes' the child something.<br><br>this is advocated by MOE, hence the common complaint that MOE always side parents over schools. now i wonder, is this good for the long term good of the country.<br>granted, some schools are run by psychopaths and they deserved to be complained, but nowadays, parents complaint but everything even when it is clear as day that<br>their kid is at fault. for example:<br><br>1. kid fails in exam and has to be retained. parents threatened school with a complaint to MOE/MP. said it was because school did not teach properly. when shown<br>the kid's wkbook which was empty, parent say, why teacher never tell parent. my question is:<br><br>a. where does personal responsibility play a part in the education we want to impart? if teacher nvr teach, why only that boy failed and the whole class passed?<br><br>more troubling is,<br><br>a. why did the parent even get the idea that he can complain and get his way,since it is so obvious that his son is at fault?<br><br>now although MOE always bounce the issue back to teh school to resolve, i wonder should they even entertain such parents in the first place n give them 'clout'.<br>should MPs, who are not even involved or possibly aware of the matter be given an intervening voice too?<br><br>the fear for the principal to get into trouble with MOE is real. an incident in my school went as such,<br><br>student, over some comflict with a teacher (student caught smoking) wanted to use a fire extinguisher to assault the teacher. school tries to cover-up, persuade<br>teacher not to make police report, gives in to parent's request not to use the word "threaten" and "assault" in report because the boy is still "young". (Boy is<br>almost 1.5 times the size of the teacher) principal seemed more afraid parents would complain to MOE that the teacher involved scolded the student for smoking<br>than the fact that his teacher was almost smashed with a fire extinguisher.<br><br>this is not the first time an assault on a teacher has been covered up, either in my school or others.<br><br>my question is: why are schools so afraid to do what is right? isn't discipline a form of education too? what has stripped our school system of its ability and<br>willingness to act with dignity?<br><br>the emphasis is on pleasing the customer, so our lessons have to be interesting lest the students fail, of which is the teacher's fault no matter what the<br>student's attitude was. we cannot shout at them otherwise it hurts their self-esteem, we cannot answer back at unreasonable parents, who curse teachers and<br>insult their professionalism. and of course, we cannot hit them even when they threaten us, we must walk away and let them 'win', so that when they cool down, we<br>can 'counsel' them. basically, we can only talk to them when they are in a good mood. also, a discipline report to a parent is unpleasant for the 'client', so it<br>must be done in a way that is 'palatable'. who advocated that schools should look impressive with the latest programs to impress clients but have no moral guts<br>to call a spade a spade?<br><br>where is the importance of intellectual rigour?<br>where is the respect for elders and for learning?<br>where is the sense of personal responsibility?<br>where is the importance of instiling a healthy fear of consequences for one's actions?<br><br>should education be a service instead of a commodity?<br>should teachers be trusted by MOE to do the right thing?<br>should teachers be protected?<br><br>should teachers educate or should they please?<br><br>when teachers lose their dignity, its not long before society feels the impact. and where do you think MOE and their policies fit into all these?<br><br>enough rambling....comments if you please, ladies n gentlemen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a teacher isnÂ’t easy. We may know how to DO something very well, but how to teach it well is very much different. The other forumites have all made good points.<br><br>Its much more stressful to teach now than in the past. Anyone remember the incident in which the principal resigned because he hit a girl with a book? Its ridiculous really.<br><br>The teachers are getting more pay. Why? Compare it to simple Demand and Supply. When Demand is high and Supply is low, the cost will be greater. This means that we donÂ’t have enough teachers. And I agree that it is a thankless job(Most of the time).<br><br>But we forget that they shape our childrenÂ’s future. They shape OUR future.<br><br>Teachers teaching for money is a sad thing though, but it canÂ’t be helped.<br><br>In Singapore where money means everything, ideals can only rank highest at second.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To quote Greengoblin,<br><br>I think parents have more power now. Not to mention more freedom of press than before.<br><br>If there's a problem in school, and the result is not satisfying to the parent, what can the parent do?<br><br>1: Complain to MOE.<br>2: Write in to the many newspapers we have: NewPaper, Today, Streats, Straits Times, etc.<br><br>If people use the second option, the reputation of the school will take a drop.<br>Sometimes, a reputation built up over a time span of 30 years can be easily smashed with one bad student.<br><br>That's why i think the principals, MOE, tries to cover up. They don't want to waste the effort and time spent in creating a good reputation.<br><br>HOWEVER, i think sometimes they bring it to extremes. Treating a kid as a client/Vip is stupid.<br><br>You do something wrong, you get caned. After all, the school is a place for learning and discipline, isn't it?<br><br>The parents expect too much from their children, and yet they want to school to do everything, that is a source of concern.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Another issue that i find linked to this:</span><br>There are fewer children now than before. Most people only have one child, and hence they will be more protective of them. Its a human trait, and it can't be helped. They want them to BE the best, to HAVE the best. (Probably because they didn't, when they were young).<br><br>I don't think this situation is going to get better though. So we just have to live with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is indeed heartening to see many people standing up for teachers especially current teachers.. yes i do agree.. education has somewhat lost its true purpose..i lament the time not too long when i was studying how my teachers actually gave me good education back then no nonsense such as ISO, WITS....competitions..etc etc etc...they really TEACH &amp; be involved in the total development of a child......in discipline.. my teachers slapped me when i made mistakes.. did this kill me?..of course not.. i am not advocating corporal punishment..but to a rebel kid like me..it worked &amp; end result.. a teacher earning a decent living now.. but watabout the kids today? spoilt brats no respect for authorities..scold a bit complain.. we are producing a generation of weaklings and  complainers...<br><br>the problem is many fold- the people on top -the policies makers in MOE HQ.. they implement policies like no body's business. we the teachers suffer at the tail end..second NIE.. they are taught by so called "professors",many who are not school teachers themselves &amp; hence they have no idea wat is happening in schools..wat NIE teaches is full of crap.. does NIE prepare a graduate teacher wat to expect when he graduate? in terms of pedagogy yes but in terms of other things like doing wits, iso, competitions,doing endless projects...they never mention anything, it doesn't take long for a new teacher to get a culture shock...when they are potsd to schools..even in discipline ..nie teaches theory of how to deal with problem kids..this theory tat theory..does it work..? to me full of shit.. i use my own way.. &amp; it works..not some forms of theories and some steps...as listed in the text books..<br><br>the principals.. not all are bad..but there are a few who are terrors.. i know of one xiao on principal who made teachers come back on sundays to work.. &amp; lucky for the 5 day work implementation to stop her nonsense.. for the climate survey (staff morale survey)..this principal was damn pissed off with the first result (cos many teachers expressed their displeasure how the school was run)..she made her staff sit in front of her to do a second time...this is kelong ..!!! someone should report to MOE...<br><br>it is time education minister looks into the welfare of teachers ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha... i think many people the private sector are biased la. in the way that they think that everyday they spend is challenging and hard. not like the teachers who are believed to spend 'ez life in ivory tusk'. just becoz of the incentives, e general perception of their jobscope, many are judgemental of them.<br><br>i can bring forward cases which teacher leaves the job becoz of the workload.<br>for all the cases i know i shall highlight two.. coz it saves trouble.. haha.<br><br>there was this doctorate holder who teaches in this jc becoz of his passion for teaching. but he was pushed so hard by the admin work that he needed to consult a psychiatrist.<br>he then went for a few months of treatment while putting all his work aside. he is in australia now.. as an associate. prof. in a university. the cause of his high stress which hints him to quit his job is the <strong>admin work</strong>. have you ever wondered just how much of admin work do they need to do?<br><br>consider again, there is this 1st class honour again teaching as a ordinary teacher because of her passion for teaching. what hints her to quit and went into the private sector ? the bloody admin work! if you have friends who worked as teacher, you can ask them about it.<br><br>so, just stop being egoistic that by being in private sector, you are in the toughiest sector of all. all sector has their tale to tell. in fact, i think the admin work in teaching alone, hell load compared to private sector. so STOP being cranky or whatever about teachers complaining. if you don't understand, don't assume. when you don't assume, you will shut up and won't make a big joke out of yourself.<br></div>

You probably face the same students once a week.<br><br>I surely hope that you are not tutoring english because your spelling alone is laughable. Your logic and comprehension are too flawed , which can prove to be detrimental even in mathematics.<br><br>Your words are rather self absorbed and self righteous. Your words seem so childlike in communication. Your words also gave me the subjective perception of a girl (meaning : you) who thinks she knows the real world and how it is like. Well , honey, wake up and smell the sh.it because there is plenty in the real world and stop living in the pansy fancy fantasy of yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all teachers here,<br><br>I suspect all those "students are our clients", WIT, ISO, etc, etc come from the schools ranking system.

Many people tend to have the misconception that scholars have it easy which isn't true.<br><br>The problem, I believe, lies in policies that have not fully comprehended feedback from those who are in the field. Hence, unrealistic results tend to be set and this miscommunication of what the ministry perceives student needs and what actually can be done will never be resolved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with green goblin.....these scholars spent relatively a short time at ground level, then they are being transfer to MOE to make policies...for example, the SEM school excellence model aka ISO) they tell u wat they want..like to" determine optimized use of resources" but they never guide you how to do.. even till now.. many of us dun know what is happening &amp; collect data &amp; do meaningless surveys after surveys...in the first place i question the need of an ISO for school...we are providing education not some comercial products, so wat a school is ISO certified? received the SQC &amp; SQA..???? at the end of the day, it is still retainig good teachers who can teach well that counts..tat y all these admin are killing teachers &amp; how about collecting money..i have for many occasion wasted manty periods in collecting forms, money....the feeling isjust sickening.. teachers or administrators?<br><br>i was given a chance to teach a good class but i rather teach the EM3, these are the people that need us most, the scholars can fend for themselves...so legal justice..dun ever say we are spineless just becos u only hear from your students, be objective, talk to teachers &amp; dun form your own judgement as I said again..<br><br>WHEN ARE U GOING TO NIE??????????
