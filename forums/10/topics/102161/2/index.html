            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share some thoughts on this topic...<br><br>My gf is a teacher.. in quite a well known primary sch..<br><br>I can frankly say that after seeing what she gone through. It really isn't as simple as what the original post mentioned about having an easier time. ITS NOT!<br><br>When students go on holidays, the really get called back for meetings and coordination for the next sch yr or term. And then got CCA's and remedial classes. And she being a mother tongue teacher is even worse, cos there are so few of them around for every sch and every time assignments come back to her, she can burn the entire weekends and I have to end up helping her to mark cos its simply too many.<br><br>And also you should look at the parents these days and thinking their kids are so good and dun need remedials and then ask the teachers why their kids perform so bad when they did not approve sending in their kids for remedial. And then you have another group whom you try to convince that their kids are ok but they die die pressure the teachers to give the kids more homework even sending them in for "voluntary remedial".<br><br>Principals and vice principals also dun stand in line with the teachers sometimes. I hear that teachers are told that "students are like their clients so cannot offend them"<br><br>Even the BOSS (MOE) sometimes dun make things easier for teachers to do their jobs. Especially in matters dealing with "problem kids" Disciplinary standards has declined in general and the task of an educator has just taken on a totally new dimension now compared to the past. So please be fair to the teachers, they are really the ones who will shape the future generation.<br><br>We shud give them some help and support from time to time instead of trampling on them. They have to face pressure from parents, principals, and kids themselves, the last they need is to know that society is also viewing them in a negative light.</div>

Quite a number of my relatives are teachers.  Like all professions there are the bad apples. The dedicated teachers spend "after school" hours grading papers, preparing the next day's lessons and worksheets, planning lesson notes for the next term, etc. Not only do they have extra curriculum activities to deal with, they have meet the parents sessions (younger kids) which require co-ordinating with parents of 30 to 40 students. They have to attend enrichment classes, plan funfairs, sports days,  collect school fees, etc. They don't just teach, go home and relax.  Tuition teachers deal with a handful of students, very often individuals. Teachers deal with many more students and they have many classes to teach.<br><br>Many young teachers don't have the dedication of the older, more experienced teachers but S'pore being what it is rewards those with paper qualification.  Many young folks choose to go into teaching thinking it's a bed of roses - short hours, tons of holidays, good pay.  Many quit after they realise it's not as easy as they'd initially thought.<br><br>It's sad to see people diss teachers when they haven't a clue what teaching is really all about.   And parents these days ... geez ... some of their kids just need a good spanking is all I can say. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

If they have the interest in teaching and the desire to teach well, we should support and encourage them. They can take the easy way out, teach to make the money, wait for the long holiday, then it will be the parents who cry and the students who suffer.<br><br></div>

After thinking awhile, I felt that why these teachers are complaining, isn't that part of their jobs? <strong>After all, what more do they want, they get one of the highest pay in the civil service, teach real trivial stuff and practically just go through each day baby sitting teenagers who can listen to instructions. </strong>Futhermore they have <strong>one of the longest holidays given to anyone in Singapore</strong>. How, with the advent of the <strong>5 day week system</strong>, they are really having it good. Teachers, please stop complaining and see how the others in the private sector are working. What you all are doing is really trivial to what they all go through. I believe the only bad thing teaching has done to you all is to make you all myopic about the world.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oi u better wake up .... u only experience teaching kids tuition<br><br><strong>Tuition not equal to teaching !!! </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Have u ever wondered whether some of these tuition kids are not like how they behave during normal school time ?? I dare 2 say because i was a tutor in a tuition centre and a contract teacher !!<br><br>Have u experienced teaching a class of 40 normal tech students ??!! Most  are like  'monkeys' (sorry 2 say tat) running around, talking, throwing things etc.... most are not interested 2 learn, and only a handful are interested. U watch the news, the STU president justified tat a teacer spend 60% class managing and the rest trying to teach ... see how difficult it is.<br><br>Easy for u 2 say, sign up 2 be a relief or contract teacher ... and i dare u 2 sign on the dotted line and be bonded !!!!<br><br>Kids nowdays are not like last time, u can scold them for their mistakes and they obey u .... now u scold they talk back and some even dare to challenge 2 to a fight !! My friend quitted contract because a student wanted to pick a fight with him and the school didnt take action .... cos they are afraid of the boy's parents ... who sided him .... he is walking around in school untouchable !! i know people have passion 2 teach but once they realise kids are no longer as well behaved compared to during thier time .... they decided not 2 sign up !!!<br><br>The teachers' pay are justified ... cos the govn knows wat teachers are going through, they are not so stupid 2 pay someone so much if they are not contrbuting. Besides teaching, teachers have CCAs, meetings, organise this and tat ... the list goes on. Not forgetting they have to always be innovative to outshine other schools or they be in deep shit.<br><br>There are difference between SAP and neighbourhood school teacher .... they experience diffirent kind of stress. For one thing SAP school teachers dont experience as bad overall discipline like wat neighbourhood sch teachers do. However they are stress to get gd results every yr.<br><br>I can go on and on about the teaching profession, giving examples of my experiences and my friends who are still teaching with PASSION!!! They are not in for the money. SO justicelegal WAKE UP YR IDEA !!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good evening,<br><br>I used to teach in a SAP school and am currently teaching at an international school in Shanghai.<br><br>The biggest killer of a teacher's passion is not the pupils themselves. It's the support from above. When you have a principal and head that backs you and gives you the freedom to discipline the pupils and teach in the way you deem best, it really makes life a whole lot easier.<br><br>The second biggest killer of a teacher's passion is the system. Many of us teachers who believe in education found ourselves becoming factory supervisors turning out a standard quality product for the workforce instead. Each child is different and nobody should be treated as a 'product'.<br><br>Many teachers who believe in what we are doing do not mind the extra hours we spend, the money we take out of our own pockets for the little gifts that motivate our pupils and so on. But as a head of department (both in Singapore and here in Shanghai), I've seen my fair share of teachers who really should have no business teaching.<br><br>Sigh...I suspect those who dish the work of teachers tend to be problem parents themselves. I've seen so many cases in my short teaching career (less than 6 years).</div>
