            <div class='col-md body'>Majoity of teachers are doing their best to be innovative and trying to engage teachers. MOE are pushing them hard for them to be innovative. TEACH LESS LEARN MORE<br><br>Every yr principals are evaluating teachers on their performance, base on their class results, training etc. Teachers who are not doing well are given D grade. there goes their bonuses and promotio chances. so teachers who are not putting in effort deserve it. However there are those who put in effort but are not appreaciated by their superiors cos they are marked ! some are marked because they dare to voice out ....<br><br>Majority of teachers are outting in effort, but the problem lies in PARENTS nowdays ! They pamper their kids too much. Kids end up been rude in sch and refuses to do work etc. when parents are contacted, they side their kids instead. But in the other hand they want their kids to do well !!<br><br>At my freind's sch, the DM is afraid of a boy. he is untouchable, to an extend tat they let the boy dye his hair, and numerous quarrels( near fights) with teachers end up go unreported. Its because the boy's parents are those uncooperative parents who always side their child. School so scared the parents will report all the wy 2 MOE.<br><br>Seriously there are many factors to consider a child's performance, and dont blame the teachers TOTALLY ! we teachers are not GOD !!!<br><br>AS I SAID MANY TIMES JUSTICELEGAL BE A TEACHER AND THEN U KNOW WHY TEACHERS PAY ARE JUSTIFIED, AND STOP PICKING ON THE PAY !! FACING KIDS WHO DARE TO CHALLENGE U 2 A FIGHT, ARGUEMENTS ETC ... DO U HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO FACE IT ?!!<br><br>COS TEACHERS EARN MORE THAN YOU TATS WHY U ARE JEALOUS, DEAR PRIVATE TUTOR !<br><br>SINCE U ANTI TEACHERS SO MUCH, I AM NOT SURPRISE U WILL BE ONE OF THOSE UGLY SPORE PARENTS WHO COMPLAINT COMPLAINT WHEN THEIR CHILD DONT DO WELL IN SCH !<br><br>THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY A CHILD MIGHT BE LIKE TAT, ONE MIGHT B COS THE PARENT SUCX, ........

Teachers, nurses and other workers are paid low wages for the so called low taxes ...in the end the citizen is responsible for himself/herself plus family thrown in . You pay taxes to gain some benefits like health, social support etc but the healthcare system back home reminds me of the american HMO system in its beginnings . Frankly social support of aging parents are thrust upon a child  - so what social support? Unions? WHAT UNIONS? NTUC union card is better as a shopping/chalet discount card than a union that looks after the workers' welfare.<br>Yeah we should all get real and look at what kind of pay the top level have compared to the rockbottom minions.</div>
