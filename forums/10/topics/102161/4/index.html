            <div class='col-md body'>This is yet another secondary school teacher's post,<br><br>To justicelegal :<br><br>i would just like to point out that teaching tuition is very different from teaching in a real class of 40 which have been sitting in the classroom from 730am till 2pm. (btw, classrooms are not air-conditioned)<br><br>many students in my Normal(technical) classes are people which have never had the privilege of entering a tuition class.  I feel more than happy if some of my students could actually come to school regularly as they have all kinds of family problems that prevent them from doing so.<br><br>Students who attend tuition classes are either those which already have an interest to learn OR they have a family which strongly supports or encourages learning.  These students are different from most neighbourhood secondary schools.<br><br>To give a analogy, you are a 400m-running coach training perhaps 5-10 runners <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which paid for your services and sought your services</span>.  We teachers are like PTIs in SAF tasked to turn 40 recruits from all walks of life into top all-round athletes in several events(teachers teaches at least 2 subjects and many others like Project work, PCCG etc. as well as CCA )<br><br>LAstly, i hoped that you would seek to understand why so many of my fellow teacher here feels rather strongly about you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am really grateful for what all my teachers have done for me while I was in the schooling system. They provided me with an excellent shelter from the real world outside, and given me a chance to lean and discover myself - all the while managing all that enormous bulk of administrative work. I can still remember when I was in Secondary one, I would stay in the Media Resource Library to play after school, and the teachers were still writing furiously away at their desks after 7 pm (when I finally had to leave the place because the attendant was closing the floor off).<br><br>To those who think teaching is easy, try doing relief teaching for one day, and you will realise that many students have no interest in study, and look forward to play time after the examinations more than getting the excellent grade that will push them towards professional jobs. You have to sort out bullies who pick on others, give a listening ear to your charges facing emotional problems (raging hormones and all...), write out lesson plans (which I think are useful only for inspection, because the schedule gets knocked out of whack anyway), maintain discipline in the class, mark papers, set examination questions, conduct remedial lessons, go for CCA meetings, and more! In addition to that, you do not just take three or four classes for one subject, you have a form class, of which you have to take charge for their overall welfare.<br><br>All these can only be fulfilled by a person with passion for teaching, and a love for young people (I've met many teachers with that, [rant] and really felt sorry they had to deal with spoilt brats who loved to throw 5 cent coins at  other people [end rant]).<br><br>The fact that students greet teachers before every lesson is testimonial to their personal sacrifices they give to these students. No other profession can match the personal development these teachers do to their charges. Being in contact with these young people for almost half the day, they are the ones who truly shape the thinking of the next generation.</div>
