It is a teacher to several kids (30-40 during my time in school)- some interested in learning , or some interested in troublemaking (like teenage me). Teachers have to be involved with the kids they teach - they see them in school on weekdays . Tutors are just not that involved since they only probably see them twice a week and one hr each?<br><br>I can comment that not all teachers are good but not all teachers are bad. Looking back at my teenage days - I gave all my teachers alot of problems. I was also  good, as a teenager,  at making tutors quit within a month - a record unbroken.<br><br>You cannot generalise one lousy teacher to other teachers. There are teachers who make an impact , like one of mine who thought I got more potential than the other teachers. She was patient with me and I respected her alot.<br><br>Teachers are also human.Employee welfare in singapore is not as good as other developed nations. All our unions are controlled by the government , not by the profession itself.  Teachers have the right to make themselves heard , just like everyone else.<br><br>Let's face it , little princess, you have a right to complain about that one you know but not all teachers. Wait til you go to university - a lecturer will tell you to check the answers and get back to her. Why don't you work as an actual teacher for a year and find out how it feels like?<br><br>Anything else you want to complain about ?<br><br>My advice : Just don't go near the healthcare professions because the healthcare professions have plenty to vent about.<br></div>

The holidays and pay should not be viewed as incentives.</div></blockquote>Teaching tuitions, especially one-to-one, is not enough to understand the problems faced by teachers. At home, some students guai guai one (like me) but go out to school like become another person liao (all vulgarities come out). And what students do outside of school hours, the school still have to settle the problem, parents seldom know what their child do outside.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JusticeLegal:</div><div class="quote_body">I was reading the S.T today and there is one section stating that teachers are pressured by the parent's expectations. After thinking awhile, I felt that why these teachers are complaining, isn't that part of their jobs? After all, what more do they want, they get one of the highest pay in the civil service, teach real trivial stuff and practically just go through each day baby sitting teenagers who can listen to instructions. Futhermore they have one of the longest holidays given to anyone in Singapore. How, with the advent of the 5 day week system, they are really having it good. Teachers, please stop complaining and see how the others in the private sector are working. What you all are doing is really trivial to what they all go through. I believe the only bad thing teaching has done to you all is to make you all myopic about the world. Please do read up more and learn more about the world before complaining so much.</div></blockquote>I can agree with you only partially. Teachers teaching in those top high schools who took in the best of the best in PSLE should have easy job teaching, but the admin works is no less than those outside, and mostly meaningless.<br><br>But teachers in most schools do not have good students made for them. All students 'CAN' listen to instructions but they do no necessarily 'carry out' the instructions. The toughest job of a teacher is to gain the acceptance and rapport of their students, and if there is understanding and cooperation, i.e. students learn what is taught, do what is told, then both will find happiness, even if the exam results are not so good, because both have tried their best.<br><br>With your remarks here about your teachers, little girl, I feel sad for the teachers who have taught you, and I worry for the teachers who are teaching you.</div>
