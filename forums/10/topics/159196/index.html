            <div class='col-md body'>days have changed...nowadays, nurses are like "high-class maids", they are being ordered around to attend to needs, demanding request to be see to immediately, otherwise, PRS ( public relation service ) will give a ring to say, there's a patient in bedXX who came here to complain about blah blah blah.....<br>local nurses are on the decreasing trend, but why?? anybody out there bother to find out??<br>and for example, when the families of a certain patient wanted to speak to doctors, of course they will contact and inform them, but they are busy seeing other new patients or tight-up in other wards, when these messages were conveyed to them, their facial expressions changed almost immediately, and they will argued, how long do we have to wait??..and thereafter, they will start to pester and even shout at the poor nurses who are busy attending to other paitents..these are verbal abuse, but nobody do anything, and when the doctors finally arrived, those hypocrites will be as quiet as mice..listened to whatever the doctors said, and left, not even a simple 'thank you' to the nurses..<br>and there are some even unreasonable people, they cannot seems to wait/hold on for a while, once they requested, they want it immediately, it's worse in those subsidized wards, it's not as if they are only nursing 2 or 3 patients or the nurses are sitting around shaking legs doing nothing, 1 nurse is to see to 10 or 15 the most patients, how can they cope?? is it the manpower problem or the unreasonable request??<br>i feel that those people are really not being appreciative to what the nurses have done, i really hope that the number of local nurses will really drop to a certain extend that there will be shortage of local nurses, and let those foreign nurses take care of those unreasonable people~!! then there will be many language barriers and can't even attend to your simple basic needs~!!<br>so YOU people better respect, appreciate and take care of local nurses before they are gone~!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nurse,<br><br>I can understand your frustrations, because during my father's days of going in and out of hospitals, I've come to SEE how overworked you nurses are.<br><br>From what I have seen, it isn't that people or patience's family members are unreasonable. It is just that they have waited around too long too often, just like I have. But I didn't lose my cool or take it out on nurses.<br><br>I know that nurses are doing whatever they can to the best of their abilities &amp; knowledge, in keeping with POLICIES and RULES set within each hospital. If there's anyone or anything to blame, I'd say you should blame it on the SYSTEM that nurses in hospitals work under.<br><br>I know through experience that there exists a lot of red tapes &amp; politics, such that nurses come and go, never staying long in one hospital. There is a lot of pettiness going on.<br><br>So to this topic, I'd say it is best to attack this issue at its root; the SYSTEM within which your NURSES, work under.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>part of the reason of this must blame the super high medical expenses.<br><br>Think on the side of the "customers" (should be patient), we pay so much in the hospital, that's why we "customers" expect service that's worth what we pay for. And the hospital doesnt give u salary high enuff to give that kind of standard that we expect(if we can pay less, we wont expect so much).<br><br>You wont expect 5-star hotel service when u are in a 3-star hotel and paying 3-star hotel rate, right??But when u are in are 5-star hotel and paying 5-star hotel rate, then the service is like 3-star, of cos u shout at them and complain, right?<br><br>The situation now is:<br>customer is paying 5-star service, while they are getting only 3 star service.<br>The nurse is paid to give 3-star service, but the customer expects 5 stars service.<br><br>Either cut down the medical fees, so that the patient wont expect so much cos they dun pay that much.<br>Or give the nurse increase in salary, to compensate for the extra things they have to do. Extra work= Extra salary.<br><br>i do respect the nurses, when i was in hosp for an operation, i try not to make their job difficult, i dun expect too much from them. But i expect a good operation done, and good hospital environment cos it's the doctors and the hosp getting my $$$$$$.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah I totally agree with you. Many people treat nurse like as if they are maid. And you know it not only happen to nurse. Those people who work in polyclinic labs who are lab technicians also suffered the same fate. Patients simply cannot wait.. and complain and pester you why so long, when you are so busy and even when you are attending to other patients they also pester you. Then in the end, they only care about themselves, they don't want to wait and they rather pester you rather than to let you work in peace..They rather you get frustrated and distracted than to wait loh. Actually they can see you are so busy already but they still behave like that.. then when their turn, they also don't say thank you one loh. They really treat you like maid.. I know how you feel.<br><br>I think this is the nature of service line. They have no idea what nurses are doing. Take these in your stride loh. If you don't have a good tolerance level can imagine you will stress out easily.. Or you can follow other nurses are doing, faster migrate to another country, at least over there, nurses are respected and you will earn better and find more job satisfaction. At least on a positive note, not all people so selfish..once a blue moon can see considerate pple around..<br><br>Good Luck !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nurse cant be expecting to perform to people expectations, no matter how much they pay.<br><br>Some forumers who are nurse or been to hospital, relate some disgusting stories about how people treat nurses. For example, if someone goes into a frenzy and tries to bite himself, the nurses have to tie him up to prevent him from doing so. The patients family complained. When there is a big number of patients needing consultation in the specialist clinic, by logic its going to take some time to process all patients, no matter how fast the nurse can go. Some people just dont understand and demand instant service.<br><br>Seriously, healthcare should never be measured with value or price.

            <div class='col-md body'>why is it people like to shun one based on their profession. its not like they are uber classy or something. For example waiters, security guards, cleaners, hawkers. They are human too. we should accord them with respect and treat them like every other person. I think that if in the first place if a person cannot bring himself to treat all professions equally, professionally and in a gracious and dignified manner, then that person deserves no more respect than what he is willing to give.</div>
