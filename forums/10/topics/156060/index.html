            <div class='col-md body'>I found this from some links and would like to share it with you people. To tell u the truth I agree with what this person says about this empty vessel. Let's take a good look: -<br><br><blockquote>Li Au is notorious for his randomly bite character. So he is so called a "Mad Dog". This time during his visit to China, Li exposed again his "Random Bite" character.<br><br>I have many reasons to believe that Li in his genuine mind was to cater some people and the CCP, but this time his mouth is not so well-controlled by his<br>Mind. I have overviewed several significant mistakes he made during his visit to Mainland China:<br><br>(1) Li Au was too self-conceited and self-centered.<br>Li always thinks he is eloquent in speech. Just as he bragged wherever he addressed he used no drafting beforehand. Because of this, he makes mistakes all the time. People can find contradictions in his speech.<br>To the practice of Western people, a speaker must prepare a draft for his speaking no matter how long or short the speech is. Without a prepared draft, the speaker will be considered "Recklessness". Li mistook his deficiency for efficiency. That is the reason why Li made a messy speech in addressing to the Peiking University!<br><br>(2) Li Au, by any reasons should not blemish Lien Zhen. Lienn, even though is not a remarkable politician, Lien is an honest person. He treats his followers nice and his colleagues kind and royal to the KMT party. I cannot find any reasons that Li Au should berated Lien. In talking about personal characters, Li Au is far behind Lien.<br><br>(3) "Writers Are Mostly corruptive in Conducts"(Wen2 Ren2 Wu2 Xing4), can be very well described on Li Au. No matter how glorious his writings and talkings may be, his personal characters and morality is below average level. Judging from his affairs with more than a dozen women, we should just ignore person like him!</blockquote>I'm still surprise that such a cheap womanizer like him still dares to criticize the Chinese government to the point by saying that it is doomed! Wow! Who does he think he is? GOD? ERh hEm.. excuse me manz...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
