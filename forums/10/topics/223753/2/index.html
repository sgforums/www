We may not acheive concrete change overnight, but if we do not speak our mind, can you tell your kids in their face that "I'm sorry, Daddy didn't do enough, or contributed in his little way when he could?"<br><br>It's worth thinking. The minute those of us who are comfortable, lapse into apathy, then it's the death knell of an alternative voice in Singaporean society.<br><br></div></blockquote>Let me tell you what I dream of:<br><br>1. I dream of a Singapore which has its own culture, traditions and language, contributed from our ancestors, but distinct from the other nations. I dream that our culture and language can flourish and create its own art and applications.<br><br>2. I dream of a Singapore with a strong national identity that transcends race or partisan views. Where Singaporeans are proud of their common heritage and are willing to stand for fellow Singaporeans rather than foreign nationals of their own race.<br><br>3. I dream of a Singapore with a sustainable economy that doesn't have constantly run on a race to benchmark itself with huge Western nations, but with small rich-poor gap that is the envy of the world.<br><br>4. I dream of a Singapore that values individual creativity and freedoms and a society more tolerant of bizarre ideas, because the most desperately creative agents that bring about world leading changes are necessarily individuals. That one day someone would say "who made this crazy device/provocative play? Only in Singapore of course."<br><br>I have these dreams - the dreams of a loser. For an individual who is always a nobody and whose ideas are always whiny complaints can never make a difference.<br><br>Only society as a whole, powerful people and organizations can make a difference, but why should they fix something that isn't broken? Singaporeans themselves are happy with the way things are - people who see any different are definitely losers, because they have no support of the people.<br><br>Winners will determine the future; dreamers like me are just passing gas in the footnote of history.<br><br></div>

I dream of a Singapore which has its own culture, traditions and language, contributed from our ancestors, but distinct from the other nations. I dream that our culture and language can flourish and create its own art and applications.<br><br>2. I dream of a Singapore with a strong national identity that transcends race or partisan views. Where Singaporeans are proud of their common heritage and are willing to stand for fellow Singaporeans rather than foreign nationals of their own race.<br><br>3. I dream of a Singapore with a sustainable economy that doesn't have constantly run on a race to benchmark itself with huge Western nations, but with small rich-poor gap that is the envy of the world.<br><br>4. I dream of a Singapore that values individual creativity and freedoms and a society more tolerant of bizarre ideas, because the most desperately creative agents that bring about world leading changes are necessarily individuals. That one day someone would say "who made this crazy device/provocative play? Only in Singapore of course."<br><br>I have these dreams - the dreams of a loser. For an individual who is always a nobody and whose ideas are always whiny complaints can never make a difference.<br><br>Only society as a whole, powerful people and organizations can make a difference, but why should they fix something that isn't broken? Singaporeans themselves are happy with the way things are - people who see any different are definitely losers, because they have no support of the people.<br><br>Winners will determine the future; dreamers like me are just passing gas in the footnote of history.<br><br></div></blockquote>These kind of changes takes years, 10, 20 maybe 50 years. It takes generations and generations of people to effect the change and consistently apply it. The changes might bring good, but might bring along another set of issues. You cannot control the fact that we had also external influences to deal with and influx of foreigners who bring their own culture,expectations and etc.<br><br>If you expect changes quickly, or that anything you do to have any impact right now, then you will always be disappointed.<br>A tree that sprout out from the ground today does not change the environment. It takes 10-50 years of constant growth to become a large tree to be able to affect the environment.  So you need to be realistic. If you trace the history of Singapore, if you carefully observe the people you meet from Primary school till today... you will see things change but you also see other things. Not every thing is bad, not everything is good. So be realistic. You think there will be a Sg identity - we already have - just how much and what needs to be seen then you will think we have identity. But are all these benchmark realistic? You see other country singing about their identity - is it real or just a show?<br><br>If you think that what you do does not impact anyone. Then see it this way, what people do not do also impact everyone.<br>ie: the case where I b!tch about Jalan Eunos.<br>1. I can happily whine and let my anger out.<br>2. Do nothing like all those people who Kow-Tow to the TP and walk off feeling sh!t thinking this is the system and I have to accept. I can also not mention anything in this forum and let other people get sam-bang like me.<br>3. I can also and had report the stupid road design to LTA and now I have a reply from LTA that they had planned to upgrade that stupid road and add the pedestrian crossing there.<br>Now I did numbber 1 and 3. Did it impact anyone? I don 't know. But I know that perhaps people who think that nothing can be done with bad road design might think twice in future. If I did not care like all these apathic singaaporean, then I will take option 2.<br><br>You must remeber, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br>Now I cannot say Physics law apply to everything but this is a true fact. Only thing is the Reaction. It does not have to be immediate. It does not have to have a physical impact (could be mental or societal). It can also deviate from what you expect.<br><br>Now let me put this to you. You take this forum now as it is for granted. This is not by coincidence that the forum has members and people behaving in this manner. This is through constant action of the mods, and the unconscious actions of other members to enforce socially accepted norms here. But everyone would claim they did nothing of that sort... But they did. That's social engineering for you..<br><br>Its not always true the rich, powerful people control everything. They do because they have more resources and perhaps it gets published on papers. But look at the ordinary people and the actions but its unknown to lots of people. Like the nurses who go that extra mile. Or the poor man who jumped into the MRT tracks leaving his kids and handicapped wife.  The rich and powerful makes an impact. But if you think so, you are wrong but if you feel they do, you can work towards that goal one step at a time and become rich and powerful and see what statement you make. If you are unhappy now, chances are you will be unhappy, rich and powerful.<br><br>So the question is do you seek to do deeds so that lots of people see it and "glorify" you with road named after you or statues build in your honour? Or dso you seek to do deeds because it is the right thing to do and you keep doing it because you believe. If you do not believe in yourself and think of yourself as a dreamer and loser. You lost your battle with yourself. Negative thought is poisonous.<br><br>Anyways, its just a down time for you. Take it easy.<br><br></div>
