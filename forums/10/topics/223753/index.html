Just got me more work at the same position. People who suck arse and curried like no tomorrow won the day.<br><br>Now, I just live day by day. Perhaps come by SGF to gripe a bit. Perhaps to throw a curve ball, be wicked, or maybe advice a bit and reminiscence about the past. But then, I decided to be happy with myself and to be happy with what I have. But still there are things that make me mad and feel hopeless. For example:  The rest of Singapore still feels tat the current power is doing a great job. I would argue that if mice were constantly set on the wheel to earn their next meal, there would most certainly be no creativity.<br><br>But there is nothing I can do but accept that life it what it is. I had been reminded of that constantly because my MIL is a very short term view person bordering on somewhat illogical sometimes. But I stay with her and she cooks my meals so I have to accept that nothing is perfect. Life is beautiful because of imperfection and tradegy.</div>

We may not acheive concrete change overnight, but if we do not speak our mind, can you tell your kids in their face that "I'm sorry, Daddy didn't do enough, or contributed in his little way when he could?"<br><br>It's worth thinking.
