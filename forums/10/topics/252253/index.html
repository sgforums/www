            <div class='col-md body'>Why remove hospital subsidy from middle class when rich don't pay tax?<br><br>Facts:<br>Inordinate Estate tax exemption: "Property owners have additional $9M tax exemption":<br><a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/others/estate/estate+duty-estate+duty+exemption.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/others/estate/estate+duty-estate+duty+exemption.asp</a> ; So given that the upper limit of estate duty is 10% (<a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/others/estate/eatate+duty-tax+rates+and+interest+on+estate+duty.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/others/estate/eatate+duty-tax+rates+and+interest+on+estate+duty.asp</a>), a well to-do family would have 'evaded' $900K in taxes. They could also further benefit from the fact that "CPF balances, regardless of the amount, are exempted from estate duty" (<a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/others/estate/estate+duty-faq_cpf.asp#Estate%20duty-FAQ_CPF_Q1" rel="nofollow">http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/others/estate/estate+duty-faq_cpf.asp#Estate%20duty-FAQ_CPF_Q1</a>). I may not be an expert on estate duty but sth tells me that the tax exemption could easily be &gt;$1M/ incident leading to much govt tax losses. [Inordinate exemptions also increase property prices btw].<br><br>Multiple problems are foreseeable with means testing.<br>1) What are the income benchmarks to work by? For instance: the $500 'per capita family income' (PCFI) is too low, not when medical bills in SG can be astronomical in 'unforeseen circumstances' . . .  (PCFI&lt;$500 to downgrade: <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/182916.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/182916.asp</a> ). Will the criteria be transparent or shrouded in secrecy-  like I find the new NKF guidelines: e.g. "Patients who show their motivation, desire to improve their circumstances will be further assisted, . . . we also review . . . the children's academic progress. . .  patients under extenuating circumstances can be considered on a case-by-case basis"; (<a href="http://www.nkfs.org/subsidies.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nkfs.org/subsidies.php </a>- any how thats a different story). Helping everyone, especially those whose PCFI falls below the 50% in society: (PCFI 2005 was approx $1035- $1459 if ave is used) should be the priority of a progressive society, can the gov publish it's bench marks before implementation?<br>2) How would 'assets' be considered:<br>i . What is the median PCFA (assets) and how is this derived.<br>ii . Does staying in pte property automatically fail one in the means test? Who values the property? (Some patients may reside in cheap pte properties/ with distant family, themselves unable to afford even HDB).<br>iii . What about a property owner pending bankruptcy proceedings. (similar= high income earner in the same predicament)<br>iv . What would happen if family members are too busy working/ refuse to meet the means test staff?<br>v . Who administers the means testing: trained accounts or 'information counter' clerks, would they all be as confused as the possible guidelines are?<br>3) Currently those seeking 'downgrading' consult the medical social worker (MSW) for an assessment (http://www.todayonline.com/articles/182916.asp ) would MSWs get overworked with administration as they currently also have the following duties:<br>i . Counseling the newly diagnosed cancer patient who is suicidal?<br>ii . Advising aged patient's overwhelmed relatives about nearby aged homes?<br>iii . Finding out more about the social background of: a child who has been admitted with suspicious bruises/ pregnant teen?<br>iv . Will more be counselors be hired to provide counseling svcs/ to advise.<br>Finally, I feel that SG gov [as a defender of unity and a moderator of progress (PAP manifesto: see below)] should make the welfare to SGporeans (and not the bottom-line) its priority.<br><br>Finally, finally, if all else fails, then maybe the 66.6% of voters in the 2006 SG elections will realise the need to have balanced debate viz more 'opposition' members in parliament viz a correction of the unfair GRC system of elections:  75.2% of SG people are Chinese (2006): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore</a>  - so to ensure 25% minority rep in Parliament (at least 20 out of 81 elected MPs must be non-Chinese): then have 20 GRCs of 3 candidates each (one must be non Chinese) and 21 Single seat constituencies (any race qualifies): NO MORE  to this nonsense, illogical, and dishonest 6 person GRCs that allow PAP favoritism and monopoly power. -&gt; More single seats (= keener competition) to elect first class candidates. ( ref: <a href="http://www.singaporeangle.com/2006/06/why-make-grcs-easy-route-to-parliament.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporeangle.com/2006/06/why-make-grcs-easy-route-to-parliament.html</a>  )<br><br>The PAP election 2006 manifesto: http://www.pap.org.sg/uploads/ap/587/documents/papmanifesto06_english.pdf , "do more for lower income SGporeans", "helps its weaker members to succeed . . . keep SG a safe, stable and harmonious society". . .<br>Actually: the Only Way Fwd in Gov is thus to Benchmark Welfare to the Median.<br><br></div>
