It was virtually impossible for them to avoid accusations of hypocricy.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I've heard that as citizens of the Commonwealth, we can vote in UK elections?Is that true?Kinda ironic that I cannot vote in somewhere like Ang Mo Kio but I can vote in Milton Keynes etc.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Lazer, are you a fan of Milton Keynes Dons FC (formerly Wimbledon FC)?</div>

All politicians in any country are so full of shit you could run a sewage works of them so they would all be suing each other.<br><br>Singapore seems to be opening up more and more, ever in the three years i have been here we have seen the bungee, bar top dancing etc, however i cant see that happening for a few years, or at least untill most of the 'old crew' of the government move on and are replaced by younger people</div>
