            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I got that SMS much later (like middle of March, during the school holidays)<br><br>I felt it very funny and laughed at the desperation that some people will go to in order to be "patriotic"<br><br>A Singapore PR holder from Malaysia will definately ignore that message, as they are going back to visit family. So that message was aimed squarley at working class parents who want a cheap holiday during break.<br><br>So I don't know if the planned boycott was successful or not. However, let me just remind the forum-members of the dangers of boycotting shopping in Malaysia.<br><br>I recently have bought some baby wipes from Robinsons. Mega Sale on, special offer. Tollyjoy brand mega wipes. Made in Singapore (or at least, Singapore owned brand) .. so I thought .. Majulah Singapura .. lets buy it. So the SPECIAL offer was for S$9.90 for pack of 300 wipes.(usual price is like S$14.90) Great deal I thought. So being kiasu, I bought like 5 packs ..  Anakku, the Malaysian brand was the same price S$9.90 for 300 wipes .. so I did the patriotic thing and supported Singapore!<br><br>I took some packs to Malaysia to give my relatives. Wanted them to use the "better" product, instead of the "rubbish" that Anakku is .. After giving them the wipes, we went to Midvalley to cool off, watch movie etc. I walked into their supermarket and just wanted to check out the wipes. To my horror, they were selling the wipes there as well. Tollyjoy. 200 wipes for RM9.90. LIST PRICE. No discount allowed. For anakku, it was RM8.90 for 200. (Singapore product "better so more expensive) .. to me wiping the kids ass is the same regardless of the brand, but what the heck, Singapore product HAS to be BETTER than Malaysia product<br><br>So, in Singapore you paid like S$0.033 per wipe (after discount). While in Malaysia, the EXACT same product is RM0.049 (that is S$0.022) .. 33% cheaper .. (list price)<br><br>And we are not comparing Malaysian stuff to Singapore stuff. .. both were Singapore made stuff. This means that<br><br>a) Singapore is dumping its products (illegal under WTO) in Malaysia<br>b) We are being screwed by the government.<br><br>Tollyjoy is offering its products at 33% less cost in Malaysia. However, Anakku is offering its products at 100% more cost over in Singapore .. end of the day, who is the winner? Tollyjoy, Annaku,  Malaysian consumers and Singaporeans who go over to shop. Who are the losers? Singaporeans who got fooled by "patriotism" and didn't go over to shop.<br><br>This is also the main reason why birthrates in Singapore are so low amongst the citizentry. We screw the new parents with expensive luxury items. We are doomed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nismo,<br><br>The list price of the product is S$14.90 per 300 wipes. This is S$0.05 per wipe. In Malaysia, the same product is being sold at RM9.90 per 200 wipe. That is RM0.05 .. so at the current exchange rate of RM2.2 to S$1.0, that is like S$0.023 per wipe. That means that it is 54% cheaper in Malaysia. After discount, it becomes 33%.<br><br>If storage, labour and transport costs can cause a 33%-54% higher cost in Singapore, for the SAME PRODUCT, which is MADE in SINGAPORE or even OVERSEAS, we are totally not competitve. Hence we are doomed.<br><br>We now must investigate how come storage, labour and transport costs are so prohibititve?<br><br>Who is the fault? Why is it so high? Can we survive in the future if our costs are so high? What are we doing to reduce the costs?<br><br>All so many unanswered questions. But its an underlying factor to the decline of birth rates in Singapore. That basic living costs is so prohibitive that we can not afford many kids.<br><br>Solve the cost of living in Singapore, we solve the declining birth rates, and will solve our lack of talent and will solve our foreign talent issue. Its that simple.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are facing threats from Malaysia on all fronts. Economically, they are improving. Diplomatically, they have new friends in the third world and also old Europe. Militarily, we have discussed it to the death in the MILITARY NUTS forum.<br><br>This latest one is Social competition. Its most likely the straw that will break the camel's back. As our society progresses from lower income to middle income, the majority of the population will demand the rights and priveledges that other middle income earners have in other countries. Especially with increased globalization, we long for what "they" have. Middle class in developed countries have<br><br>a) Votes<br>b) Cars<br>c) Houses<br>d) Stability in Jobs<br>e) Social activism<br>f) Increase in recreational activities<br><br>While we are not yet a first world country, we have huge portions of our population who do long for the trappings of middle class. Sadly, do to land contraint and a dictatorian government, we are unable to achieve their wants ever. The urge to migrate to first world countries who do offer middle class "utopia" is present in most of the population. Those are considered lucky.<br><br>However, the social problem that will happen soon is that developing third world countries such as Malaysia will be able to offer that kind of middle class living that will forever be denied to relatively richer Singaporeans. Hence the danger. There is so much "kiasu" in our attitudes that we compare our lifestyle against the HKies, our military against the whole region. That at one point, we will lose out in our social comparisons. And things wont get better.<br><br>At that stage, will the government face the greatest threat to the stability of Singapore, when a developing country NEXT DOOR will offer better quality of overall living that what we can EVER offer. Thats when things will unravel. The rich are fine. But the new poor will revolt (either vocally or quietly) at conditions.<br><br>Thats the danger we face. Not economic, military or diplomatically. Its when our people just want a middle class lifestyle and the government can't deliver.<br><br>A possible solution exists .. but we aren't ready to embrace that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nismo<br><br>I understand your view point. In fact, I experienced some of the road conditions that you mention. Especially when in some of the kampung areas where I go and look for toddy.<br><br>And I don't want to belittle your experience, nor take away your valid points. However, you have to understand that Malaysia is 500x bigger than Singapore in terms of land area alone. How the heck can any country create an atmosphere or condition like Singapore in a country that size?<br><br>When I go to USA, we were told to avoid the Bronx and South Central LA. So even developed countries have areas that are lesser developed.<br><br>My whole point in this thread is to say how much better we Singaporeans have if we go to Malaysia. For example, if we were to stay in the island forever, our car can only go up to 90km/h legally. In Malaysia, we can very soon go up to 120. And the petrol is cheaper. So we can really enjoy more over there than we can ever over here. Ditto for food, entertainment and lifestyle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Legally, we can go up to 120km .. I am only focusing on what we can do legally there. And legally, we can have an additional 30km.<br><br>And over there, petrol is at RM1.35 per litre .. thats like half of what we pay. Same for groceries, food and other services (like haircuts, massage, golf, movie .. the legal type)<br><br>So for a person earning a meagre salary in Singapore, going over there is the only way to stretch our buck. So hence my posting to warn those who "out of patriotism" wish to avoid Malaysia. It may be ok for patroitism, but will ultimately hurt your own buck.</div>
