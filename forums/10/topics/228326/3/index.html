            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by CM06:<br>[b]Actually one solution to alleviate the shortage is to bring in the nurses and/or pharmacists to be the front line of medical diagnostics.  Most countries face a shortage of doctors hence the change of this system.[b]<br><br>Pharmacists at Guardian pharmacy etc are currently able to give medical advice and sell you medicine for minor ailments as they do in western countries. The reason why patients don't use them often is because they want MCs and the cost of medication is much higher at private pharmacises.<br><br>If doctors do not sell medication and all patients are required to get their drugs from the pharmacy, it will not affect doctors much but the adverse effect on patients will be great. GPs will still keep their fees at the current level but patients will have to pay more at the private pharmacies. On weekends and at night, patients may have to travel far to find a pharmacy that's open and complains will increase.<br><br>You have to think carefully about the implications. Unlike you, I am in the medical profession although I do not have a personal interest in this since I am not a GP.<br><br>One solution to the problem is to require patients to make appointments to see the doctor at polyclinic. Whether it is the UK or Australia, you have to make an appointment to see your doctor. Singapore has been too kind to patients to allow our patients to just walk in. As a result, the morning is overcrowded whilst the clinic is usually rather empty at about 2pm (I have worked in a polyclinc for a year and that's my experience). A strictly appointment system will regulate the patient load and allow the administration to deploy doctors more efficiently. If you want to just walk in to see a doctor, go to a private GP.<br><br>In addition, we can bring in more foreign doctors. They are cheap and can be sent back when we do not need them anymore. Patients complain about language problems in communication, perhaps more doctors from PRC will do. Their qualifications may not be recognized but they can handle minor medical conditions since many forumners think that nurses will do anyway.<br><br></div>

That's the problem of opposition parties who dare not make unpopular but essential decisions. Now that the election is over, the ruling party may use the uproar about waiting time to bring about this change. Means testing is a big change in policy and must not be rushed through. But come about it must, and when that happens, means testing will be applied to more than just medical subsidies but other benefits like the Progress Package etc.<br><br><blockquote>My earlier suggestion regarding 2nd tier students getting into doctoring was based on the fact that straight 'As' get knocked out at the interview phase while those with worse off grades get through because they can TALK. They can sell themselves and 'convince' the panel they deserve that slot. </blockquote>Your ideas of the selection system is far too simplistic. It takes alot more than just talking...many medical students are selected because they are down to earth and can do the job. We take a dim view of those who can just talk..Those with straight 'A's and speak well are more likely redirected to the law faculty.<br><br><blockquote>They have a glaring shortage of doctors, but they insist on fixing the intake. </blockquote>You obviously haven't read my post. I contend that there is no shortage of doctors in Singapore. Whilst polyclinic doctors may see 100 patients a day, not many GPs are fortunate enough to have 50 patients a day. We have a severe shortage of doctors in the public sector because the salary differential between the public and private sectors is too high. Increasing the intake will not stop the migration towards the private sector. The solution is to increase doctors in the public sector by increasing their pay (which is not popular) or by hiring foreign doctors who are then given a limited license to practise only in the public sector.<br></div>

A worker who does not take any MC at all will get an extra 7 days' pay as bonus per year. Those who used up all their MC entitlement taht year will get nothing.</div>
