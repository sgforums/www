Should never make or provide flawed solutions like the decades old Polyclinic!<br>The problem with the long wait isn't the length of time the docs takes to examine a patient, it is the lack of doctors WILLING to work in Polyclinics! Why is there a lack of doctors in Polyclinics?? Our glorious gov should bluddy well know why! They made it such that very few docs wants to work there! They can improve circumstances so that docs will work there, but they either can't be bothered or too busy inflating their revenues to over-pay their own ministers!!!<br><br>People who go there to fake a sick leave to obtain MC; if many succeeded in obtaining MCs, then there are just too many UNQUALIFIED doctors who can't even tell a fake patient from a genuine one, let alone accurately daignose and remedy illnesses!!!!! WTF?!?!<br><br>Setting up a Polyclinic is considered considerate??<br><br>NO! It's their FARKING DUTY of a government the people voted for!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually one solution to alleviate the shortage is to bring in the nurses and/or pharmacists to be the front line of medical diagnostics.  Most countries face a shortage of doctors hence the change of this system.<br><br>Frankly, if you are sick and just want medication, head down to your nearest pharmacy.  All of our pharmacists are qualified to diagnose problems. It is just the common believe that only doctors know anything about health problems.<br><br>From personal experience, during my army days i got foot-rot from sharing showering facilities...(yeah i know my fault for not wearin slippers). i went to see my old gp... family doctor of dunno how many years...he gave me a steroid cream.  1 small container 30g, $32!  The itching stopped...but heck the foot-rot play hide and seek with me for half a year.  I got fed up with having to pay so much ( i bought 3 bottles over that period actually) that I walked into my nearest pharmacy, and tried to look for alternative and asked for advice from the lady at the counter. I recommended one "local" brand..mycoban...and now my foot rot problem solved(in 1 month)!<br><br>In another case i found out Panadol, or it's common name paracetomol cost only 3 CENTS PER tablet if you are willing to buy generic products....I never buy Panadol brand medication again after finding out i got cheated for over 10 years.<br><br>And dont look down on nurses.  What they can observe/have in knowledge is comparable to a doctor with similar years of experience because they(nurses) work hand in hand with the doctors in addition to looking after the patients.  In hospital, i dare say i put more trust in an experienced nurse say privately against what a newbie doctor anyday.<br><br>After this, i concluded<br><br>If you want MC/surgery then you have to queue at the polyclinic, otherwise a pharmacist is more than sufficient to look after your usual sickness IE you want to just get well.<br><br>Perhaps if the Medical COUNCIL is willing to open the health industry in this way then life will be better for us citizens. Cause for your information, the medical council is run by Docs(majority). In my personal opinion, they are in a way , unwilling to admit to the fact that they are not the only source of health information/treatment in the area of general ailments as it would lower prestige of the profession of "Doctors".<br><br>When you know friends who are pharmacists, nurses and talk to them about what they know vs what doctors know, you will understand their "plight" of being squeezed and looked down by "professionals"<br><br>EDIT: No i'm not involved in anyway medical profession myself...but after hearing whether my reservists buddies(pharmacists &amp; nurse Yeah male nurse! I know, he's quite a nice guy actually <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) have to say, i feel i should speak up for them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow!! You guys raise many points.<br><br>1. Polyclinic ----&gt; government subsidizes. If you can afford you should not be there. Currently we don't have means testing so all subsidies are blunt, ie. if you are driving a mercedes (fully paid-up), live in a fully paid-up bungalow, have a thriving million dollar business, don't declare GST, and underdeclare income - you still get subsidies. And some still complain about healthcare costs.<br><br>2. Pharmacists have some knowledge of treating common ailments. But currently, Singapore Drs prescribe and dispense in the same clinic setting. This is convenient to patients but a second step of professional check for complex patients using many medications (polypharmacy) is not there. The pharmacists have for years been trying to get the government to stop this practice but unsuccessfully. If implemented -healthcare costs will triple. Reason - Docs in Singapore do not charge economic consultation charges (ie. about $100 to $200 for a 15-min consult) - so they make their money from selling the medications they prescribe (total package) - $25 to $30 for a 5-min cough and cold visit. Real docs elsewhere will have you strip down into exam gowns, the visit is 15-minutes. The clinic nurse weighs you, takes your BP, and temperature. What you pay is what you get.<br><br>3. By the way, you should even need to see docs for simple cough and colds - just get meds over the counter and call in sick. The problem is that some companies have a "policy" of only accepting government clinic issued MCs which is actually discriminatory - so far no one has brought such a charge towards these companies. A Singapore Medical Council registered Dr is the same and all MCs are and should be equal and legitimate, but companies actions are incomprehensible and increases healthcare costs - if you have cough and cold, and take medications, you are a danger to yourself and others (drowsy from meds, fever -?SARS/Bird flu). Just call in sick and stay at home for a couple of days - if not better, then see Dr. Straight away save $200 from having to see a doctor un-necessarily.<br><br>4. Common cough and colds are due to viruses - taking antibiotics do not help. All current clinical guidelines discourage the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection. Because antiobiotics are priced too cheaply in Singapore - there is blatant abuse without adequate diagnostics. The commonest bacterial throat infection is Strep throat and you can get a quick throat swab but the kit costs as much as the antibiotics if not more - so Dr prescribe antibiotics when the patient wants it because they get "lambasted" for being "expensive", ordering "un-necessary" tests. So Singapore medicine gets set back to the stone age of rampant un-necessary antibiotic use and creation of super-bugs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from today's TODAY.<br><br>Patients should not get upset if they have to wait<br><br>Letter from JEFFREY LAW LEE BENG<br><br>TODAY'S Singaporeans are becoming increasingly impatient and irrational; they are fastidious about services and facilities at public polyclinics and hospitals.<br><br>During the old days, nobody dared raise a whimper about poor service, long waiting times and other bugbears because they regarded the healthcare staff and doctors as special professionals who should not be doubted or questioned. Waiting patiently for half a day then to consult the doctor was commonplace.<br><br>These days, patients tend to feel upset and obnoxious when they wait for about an hour or so before consultation time. Perhaps they are better educated and aware of their rights and expectations. Also, various avenues of filing complaints are open at all times.<br><br>Due to the vast improvement in service and amenities, our polyclinics will continue to attract more people seeking medical treatment. Waiting for a few hours is really not too much, especially when you are in air-conditioned premises with medical literature and newspapers to while away your time.<br><br>Seeing the doctor is not a daily or weekly affair; we do so as and when the need arises, sometimes in three or four months. A little patience will go a long way towards making that trip to the clinic a worthwhile one.<br><br>After all, it is common for people to wait for hours to catch a glimpse of their favourite actors or camp overnight for a National Day Parade ticket, not to mention the two-hour queue for that famous barbecued pork come Chinese New Year.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Do you know how many patients a polyclinic doctor gets to see in a day? I have worked in a polyclinic before and my record was 120 patients, but I don't think I hold the all-time record.<br><br>And it was horrible..even if I had no breaks for toilet and if patients mysteriously apparate one after another in my office, all I had was just 4 mins for each patient in an 8-hour day. If one patient needs more time because he has a complicated medical problem, if you need to do a minor surgical procedure etc, you have even less time for the other patients.<br><br>Obviously the examination was far from detailed and I could not allow patients the time to talk about their problems. Patients had to be hurried through their history, a rapid check through the case notes, a quick physical examination and then a quick prescription before pushing them out for the next patient. Totally unsatisfactory for both doctor and patient....but I could clear the crowd. Patients did not have to wait hours to see me but the quality suffers. I have tried the other alternative and gave patients the time and attention they required. But then patients would have to wait for hours..<br><br>Many polyclinic doctors left to start their own clinics. If we are going to work so hard for the modest salary we were getting, we might as well work hard for more money in our own clinics. Patients were ungrateful and angry over the long waiting time, despite the fact that doctors were struggling to keep up and do their best. Eventually, leaving the service becomes a very attractive option. With fewer and a high turnover of doctors, polyclinics suffer from a chronic shortage of doctors. The problem is compounded by the increasing number of junior doctors who decide to specialize instead of doing general practice.<br><br>There are only two solutions: retain local doctors by increasing remuneration for polyclinic doctors but that is politically disastrous. The public will refuse to understand the problem and will castigate the government for raising salaries for doctors and increasing healthcare costs. The only other solution is to bring in more cheap, foreign doctors into the polyclinics. The government has already taken in doctors from India, Pakistan and Myanmar. But patients complain about communication problems...perhaps it is time to bring in doctors from China as well.<br><br>Singaporeans want high quality healthcare quickly and cheaply. There is a streak of gangsterism in their demand...'I want good healthcare and I want it now and I want it cheap. You cannot find anyone to offer such a service? That's your problem 'cos you are the government.'<br><br>Since Singaporeans will not pay more and yet want shorter waiting times at the polyclinics, the way forward is to bring in more foreign doctors, particularly from PRC to deal with the non-English educated population.<br></div></blockquote>There is a definite shortage of doctors in all areas of the govt service.<br><br>What could possibly be the reason for that? Perhaps the overly stringent requirements, coupled by multiple interviews and character assessment is beginning to show its limitations?<br><br>How many 'experts' sitting in front of the panel can truly assess whether an interviewee will indeed follow up on his/her promise and take the hypocritical oath with soleumn sincerity? What is the percentage of bond-breakers within the medical profession?<br><br>And for those that break bond, how many others are denied a place in their desired profession? It's a simple demand and supply. Singapore youths are not devoid of talent; it's merely the limitation of the system in place that denies them a chance.<br><br>The system must be tweaked to best meet the current constraints. We have people who join the medical industry because of peer pressure, because of parental pressure, because of namesake, because of string-pulling and because of behind-the-scene 'players' who dictate who gets the slots and who doesn't.<br><br>While i agree we need considerable character to meet the demands of being a doctor, shouldn't we also review the entry criteria for those aspiring to be doctors?<br><br>Not every problem has a solution but this one does. Why are the powers-that-be ignoring the obvious?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
