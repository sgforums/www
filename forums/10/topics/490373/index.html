              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAP will have to change as it adapts to new environment: PM Lee<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The People's Action Party will have to change as it adapts to a new environment and evolving society, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But he added the party must continue to be an inclusive national movement, looking after the interests of a broad range of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lee noted that the country has just had an "important" General Election, with Singaporeans having to decide who they wanted to form the government, which team should secure the country's future and the direction Singapore should progress in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP secured about 70 per cent of the vote, and Mr Lee stressed such a decisive result could only have happened with support from all groups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lee was speaking on Sunday (Oct 18) at the launch of a 124-page commemorative book, "PAP Pioneers: 50 Ordinary Stories", showcasing the experiences of 50 pioneer PAP activists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the country enters the next chapter of the Singapore Story, Mr Lee added the PAP Seniors Group (PAP.SG) will represent the seniors, especially as the country's population ages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lee noted the group will be able to understand the needs of seniors, champion policies that benefit them, while understanding the need to be fair to all groups, balance their interests and "do what is best for Singapore".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP.SG was launched by the party in 2013, and there are now 47 chapters across Singapore. Mr Lee noted the group has already made an impact in providing help to seniors, as well as contributing to the party's thinking and policy making. These include in Government initiatives like MediShield Life and the Pioneer Generation Package.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP.SG can also help Singaporeans remember where the country came from.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lee noted that the pioneer PAP activists grew up in very different times compared to what Singaporeans enjoy today. He pointed out that the younger generation did not live through the country's difficult and tumultuous years, when Singapore's survival as a nation was uncertain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Mr Lee also said it is through books like the one launched on Sunday, that will allow younger Singaporeans to better understand the journey travelled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They've now passed the baton to a younger generation," said Mr Lee. "We now have to build on what they have done, as we enter a new phase." </p>
