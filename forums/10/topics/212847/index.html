            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">New evidence has surfaced that confirms Mahathir's blatant interference in asking his Chief Justice to step down, failing which he will be sacked. Following the dismissal of the Chief Justice, two other Chief Justices of Sabah and Sarawak were also sacked, including five other High Court Judges that form the Court of Appeals were also summarily dismissed.<br></span><br><br><blockquote><br><a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/9/27/nation/15553793&amp;sec=nation" rel="nofollow">The Star, 28 September 2006</a><br><br><strong><span class="large">Salleh reveals new facts</span></strong><br><br>KUALA LUMPUR: Tun Salleh Abas has expressed his thanks to Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz for agreeing to a review of the 1988 Judicial Crisis should Â“new and important factsÂ” emerge.<br><br>And to fulfil this condition set by the Minister in the Prime MinisterÂ’s Department, the former Lord President issued a five-page statement yesterday, Â“touching on five incidents only in general termsÂ”, which saw his dismissal and that of two other Supreme Court judges.<br><br>Among the five incidents were that he had been asked to step down by former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad during a meeting on May 27, 1988 after being accused of being biased in the discharge of his judicial duties.<br><br><img src="http://thestar.com.my/archives/2006/9/27/nation/n_p26salleh.jpg"><br><br><span class="small">Salleh: Â‘I hope the truth will be uncoveredÂ’ </span><br><br>Salleh claimed he had strongly denied the accusation and refused to resign but Dr Mahathir threatened to have him removed by instituting a tribunal under the Constitution.<br><br>During the 1988 Judicial Crisis, Salleh was sacked from his post as Lord President after a tribunal had tried him.<br><br>Another tribunal sacked Tan Sri Wan Sulaiman Pawanteh and Datuk George Seah, two of five Supreme Court judges who had ordered a halt to the proceedings against Salleh.<br><br>Salleh claimed a Â“very important officer of the GovernmentÂ” had also paid him a visit on the same day as the meeting.<br><br>He said the officer tried to persuade him to resign by promising him a lucrative job in Jeddah as a director of an Islamic bank with Â“a high salary I could never have dreamed of, coupled with unlimited entertainment and travelling allowances.Â”<br><br>Salleh said the officer, who told him he had been authorised to pass the message to him by a Â“very important ministerÂ”, also threatened him with dismissal and Â“the ignominy of having to face a tribunalÂ” after he declined the offer.<br><br>Apart from the incidents mentioned in his statement, Salleh said there were also other incidents that would emerge if the review were held.<br><br>Â“I hope Nazri will present the proposal to the Cabinet for a review of the 1988 Judicial Crisis so that the truth of this important episode in our nationÂ’s history is uncovered,Â” Salleh said.<br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The incorrigible Mahathir had the audacity to confirm that he had actually performed the evil deed, although the details of the private meeting he had with his Chief Justice is somewhat murky.</span><br><br><blockquote><br><a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/9/27/nation/15555447&amp;sec=nation"

had personally asked Tun Salleh Abas to resign from his post as Lord President in 1988 as he thought it was the best move.<br><br>He said Salleh had first agreed to step down but a few days later refused to do so, which prompted the Government to take the necessary action to remove him.<br><br>Â“He agreed first, then later on, I donÂ’t know how many days later, he decided that he should not step down.<br><br>Â“Then of course the Government was forced to take action,Â” he said, adding that Salleh did not give reasons as to why he had decided against stepping down.<br><br>Dr Mahathir was responding to a statement by Salleh yesterday, where he claimed he was asked to resign by the former premier.<br><br>Salleh also claimed he was offered a high paying job as a director of an Islamic bank in Jeddah if he resigned.<br><br>When asked about the job offer, Dr Mahathir said since Salleh had refused to resign, it meant he did not want to take up the job.<br><br>When asked if there was indeed such a job offer, Dr Mahathir said he could not remember what he had exactly offered.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t remember exactly what I offered him but I did ask him to step down so as to prevent any scandal or necessity to take action (against him),Â” he said, adding that he later started the necessary process to remove Salleh as the Lord President.<br><br>Â“Removal of a judge requires a decision by his peers as required by the Constitution, so we have to abide by the Constitution.<br><br>Â“The Agong thought that it was just a matter of dismissal by me.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t have the power to dismiss anybody, any judge,Â” he said.<br><br>Dr Mahathir, who is the new president of Perkim, was speaking to reporters here after breaking fast with Perkim members at the Perdana Leadership Foundation here yesterday.<br><br>At the event, 40 converts also received cash aid and goodies.<br></blockquote></div>

Malaysians expect the judiciary to take public concerns into account, like any other branch of government.<br><br>However, there are limits to discussing the conduct of judges, who have the power to take action for contempt when anyone has insulted the court or judicial system, refused to obey an order of the court or interfered with the process of justice. When to take contempt action and what penalties to impose are up to the judgeÂ’s discretion.<br><br>In MalaysiaÂ’s legal history, what constitutes an insult to a judge has yet to be spelled out. At first, contempt proceedings were used sparingly. But the 1990s saw a spate of such cases, with custodial sentences against lawyers, journalists and litigants. The Malaysian Bar set up volunteer "fire-fighting" teams in all the states to defend lawyers who had been ordered to show cause. Lawyers have argued that they should not be cited for doing their job and have pointed out that contempt action slows down court proceedings. In 2000, they proposed a Contempt of Court Act. When Tun Mohd Dzaiddin Abdullah was sworn in as chief justice in December that year, he said part of his agenda would be to reduce the numerous citations for contempt.<br><br>The number of such cases has dropped dramatically since, but there is still a need to establish clear guidelines on what constitutes contempt of court, its procedures and penalties. WednesdayÂ’s comment by Court of Appeal judge Datuk Gopal Sri Ram is a further sign that judges are moving away from over-reliance on contempt of court proceedings. In setting aside a fine imposed by a lower court for contempt, the judge said that such action should only be taken in the rarest of cases as judges were not beyond criticism.<br><br>Sri RamÂ’s remarks are an indication that judges are now less sensitive and will only use contempt proceedings in cases where they are meant to be used. His comments can be called on as a precedent for the future. Sri Ram also said that if the court were to act on erroneous affidavits, there would be a flood of contempt of court cases. <span style="color: red;">Contempt jurisdiction aims to protect the judiciary and the legal system, maintaining public respect. <strong>Employed frivolously, it would erode that respect, instilling instead an undemocratic notion that the Bench answers to no one but itself.</strong></span><span style="color: green;"><br></span></blockquote></span><br></div>

(p. 360)<br><br>Describing it as Â“the biggest scandal that Malaysia has thus faced in the context of the executive wanting to assert supremacyÂ”, Rais said that Â“the whole episode of removing the Lord President was based on the desire of the executive to have untrammelled say in the direction the judiciary should take in the futureÂ”.<br><br>Rais should not be ashamed or apologetic for his thesis but should be proud not only for the authorship but the correctness of his analysis of the 1988 judicial crisis.<br><br>As a direct consequence of the 1988 judiciary crisis, for over a decade, the Malaysian system of justice became a national and international joke and scandal because it was seen as an engine of oppression and denial of the rights of the people to justice.<br><br>The Malaysian judiciary was the constant subject of a series of adverse criticisms by the international legal and judicial community, from the 1989 report entitled Â“Malaysia: Assault on the JudiciaryÂ” by the the LawyersÂ’ Committee for Human Rights to the Â“Justice in Jeopardy: Malaysia 2000Â”, a joint report of International Bar Association, the Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, the Commonwealth LawyersÂ’ Association and the International LawyersÂ’ Union in April 2000.<br><br>As I have said often in the past five years, although the rot in the system of justice had been stopped, we have yet to see a full restoration of the system of justice with a truly independent judiciary and a just rule of law.<br>For this to be effected, far-reaching judicial reform to uphold judicial accountability, independence, impartiality and integrity Â– whether in reform of the JudgesÂ’ Codes of Ethics or a fair and transparent system of making judicial appointments Â– is called for.<br><br>Even an examination of the Malaysian Constitution is necessary if there is to be a full restoration of public confidence in the judiciary.<br><br>There should, for instance, be amendment of Article 121(1) of the Constitution to restore the inherent judicial powers and jurisdiction of the courts.<br><br>Rais said in Â“Freedom under Executive Power in MalaysiaÂ” that the removal of the Â“judicial power of the FederationÂ” from the High Courts after the 1988 judicial crisis Â“endangeredÂ” the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers.<br><br>Rais described the removal of the courtÂ’s judicial power as Â“death strokes to judicial independenceÂ”, saying that it was Â“a direct reaction by the executive to the attitude of the courts in certain decisions that went against the government, particularly during the two years preceding the amendmentÂ”.<br><br>It is time that the Cabinet effect a dual restoration Â– to restore the honour of the victimized judges and to restore the inherent judicial powers of the courts by reinstating the original provision in Article 121(1) before the 1988 constitutional amendment.<br></span></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
