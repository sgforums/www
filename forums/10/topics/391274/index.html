              <p><strong>By Hurr Riyahi</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>After the release of the ESC’s findings, I notice a big sigh of relief on the faces of the 66% of Singaporeans, the group that votes of PAP without fail. I hear them speak about how the government has put Singapore into a firm position to ride the post-financial crisis storm. They proudly claim the ESC has charted new directions that will take Singapore out of uncertain economic waters. How good will life be for Singaporeans if only that is real and true.</p>
              <p>During the post 1959, PAP had an economic vision for Singapore. They wanted to transform Singapore to become a manufacturing hub from one that was purely a services hub. They wanted to achieve this by luring foreign direct investments using cheap labour resources. That was a clear economic vision as the agenda clearly showed the type and number of jobs that can be created, the kind of investments that can be attracted and the type of economic transformation that Singapore will go through.</p>
              <p>By 1980s the vision started to crack. The PAP government swung into a new direction which was to develop its services and going into high value added manufacturing. Things started to get more tricky but this vision too has become too uncertain in recent times.</p>
              <p>The question now is what is the economic vision of Singapore. Are we going to be a services hub or manufacturing hub or both? What services and manufactuing industries are we going to focus on? Well propaganda machinese, arm chair bureacrats and sexy ST journalists may say we aleady have everything mapped out for the next 50 years. However what is clear is that Singapore does not have a long term economic vision.</p>
              <p>A couple of years ago, it was growing the country using immigration. That cant be a long term economic vision. Already it has failed even as a strategy as conceded by the government backed economists themselves. Currently the vision seems to be casino, pharmaceuticals, petrochemical and finance. That is more like strategies than economic vision. What is clear is that PAP is no longer able to come up with a long term economic vision. Singaporeans have to accept that.</p>
              <p>Part of the requirements of an economic vision is that it must show where are the newly created jobs in the longer term going to be. The kind of strategies for Singapore only shows some industries and its not something that all Singaporeans can rush into.</p>
              <p>Part of the requirements of an economic vision also includes a clear identification of how incomes are going to be generated. With many of the newly created jobs going to foreigners and lack of areas for Singaporeans to seek opportunities in, its very unclear how are all Singapore families going to generate income in long term. What is clear is only for some segment population and labour force. LKY claimed that income gap can be rectified if jobs are created. But there are jobs already being created currently and income gap only has widened. Going forth this gap will only widen further.</p>
              <p>What the PAP has instead of a longer term economic vision is a series of short term economic strategies stringed one onto another to make it appear its a long term vision. 66% of Singaporeans are naively watching this stringed rope of strategies with great relief and continued confidence as a rope that which they can hold on to. Its definitely a noose which offers no promise or security. In an era where we are seeing neighbouring economies such as Vietnam rapidly expanding, Singapore can be rest assured that it will one day become a case study of a rich country that started ahead but finished last with nothing.</p>

              <p><br>Is he slapping his own face?? PAP is the one who is encouraging low wage and more wage.  They even have a training session to brainwash people on this low wage more work and claim it is the trend these days.    The word "trend" should be "exploitation" instead.</p>

              <p>to be fair, i think the PAP has tried hard to come up wit an effective strategy. and they alone consists of the biggest pool of brains and experience in dealing with economic challenges. this is not something you can discredit them for.</p>
              <p>however, it's not lost upon us that the new ESC report is a lot of fluff. maybe they're confused themselves. the world economy is indeed getting more dynamic, and it is indeed constantly getting harder to fit into the puzzle.</p>
              <p>for singaporeans, i think the most important thing is not to be cynical. once you are, nothing will work, however good the strategy is.</p>
