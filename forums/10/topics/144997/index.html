India, in its own geo-strategic calculation, has decided to keep its side gate to Myanmar open," Yeo said at a news conference.<br><br>"So it must be in the interest of ASEAN to keep our side gate open whatever happens in Myanmar.<br><br>Nonetheless, "Myanmar has decided from very early that it would rather be a part of Southeast Asia than be a part of South Asia and we welcome that," he said.<br><br>Yeo was speaking after foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) announced that Myanmar had taken the unprecedented decision to skip the chairmanship of the grouping next year.<br><br>Myanmar said the decision, which came after months of pressure from the United States and European Union, was to enable it to concentrate on its "democratisation process".<br>----<br><br>Views ?Do you think Burma is willing and sincere to walk the path of democracy? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

This has benefited both Singapore and Myanmar.<br><br>Our Singapore Government position is that it is in Singapore's best interest for Myanmar to remain a stable country ruled by the Military, and has quietly persuaded and guided the Military Junta to soften its image - much as our Ruling Party a.k.a the Singapore Government has done to spruce up their own Public Image for domestic and overseas consumption.<br><br></div>
