I remember many people from Selangor (the 1st Mrs Lee's home state) blamed LKY for her suicide back in the 1980s. Anyway, this whole affair was neatly covered up. Rumour has it that her father-in-law blamed her for having a disabled 1st son.</div>

News to the MP's, they're not perfect or as smart as they think they are.<br><br>Someone needs to stand up in that government and say it.  "You are wrong here and here.  That's it, live with it and move on."  It's so silly to not admit when you make a mistake.  It's the lose face thing.  Someone's may heard of why the nicoll highway construction crashed. The cover ups and refusal to admit mistakes lost many people their lives.<br><br>The government is too scared of being challenged and knows that the people may just voted against them.  I don't know why that is?  I think they should be pretty confident the way the country is run today.  Personally, I think they've got no reason to be so paranoid.  They should let their accomplishments do the talking instead of pulling all these non-democratic (borderline dictatorship) stunts.</div>
