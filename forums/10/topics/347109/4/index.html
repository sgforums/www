              <p> </p>
              <p>how can we do so? (i stop typing for 5 mins) i think the PAP should start losing more sit. Dear bro and sis please let our vote count, if you wish to suffer in silence please by all mean to vote who you be voting for in the pass. if you wish for a change for a better future help to balance the power of singapore.</p>

              <p>over here i would like to quote what the Lee's have say:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, June 26, 2008 (AFP) - The Singapore opposition would ruin the wealthy city-state's achievements in five years if they ever gained power, the country's founding father Lee Kuan Yew said.</p>
              <p>Lee, 84, warned Singapore voters against putting the opposition at the helm of government "in a moment of fickleness or just sheer madness" when they get "bored" at some point in the future.<br>Should this happen, "I think all bets are off because in five years they (opposition) can ruin this place," he told delegates at an international forum late Wednesday.</p>
              <p>i think what he say is right if we were to give the opposition the helm of the country they might ruin in five year or even lesser :P</p>
              <p>on the other hand like what Mr Lee say every one can learn, we should give the opposition a chance to learn. Please give the opposition a change to learn and we might find that the singapore tomorrow might be bighter and better then today.</p>

              <p>there is quite a number of acquaints of mine that have migrated out of singapore, and a bunch of them have lost their original jobs as engineers/managers in mfg plants and now tried their hands at jobs like taxi drivers, property agents etc... many of them aare around the age of 40-50+ worried sick about losing their jobs and sank into some form of depression. Cant help but to feel pity for them.</p>
              <p>yea, i will visit these folks one of these days. i got many relatives and friends left in sg but self-preservation comes 1st. mud buddha crossing the river.</p>
