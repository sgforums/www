              <p>Well its been a while since i've pondered on this and it kinda makes me really stressed out at times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Its tough with the recession and all but u know its just a lil bit ridiculous at how many jobs i mean well mediocre jobs are being held by FT's. When you think of calling yourself a citizen don't you think it should carry some pride? Some weight to certain extent. Government cares for you helps you, and remember the government works for us not the other way round like here. So anyway like the few people suffering jobless like myself i just feel the pinch, i call starhub, FT, i go pizza hut FT, everywhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its only common sense the government in these harsh times get rid of the FT's so we singaporeans can at least make a decent living and put some food on our tables. I know some of you might say "Why complain go better yourself" Yes i am i'm going through my diploma after a year of looking for a job i decided dammit i should improve myself and i am. But think of this, what if i have a diploma and an FT has one which one would the employer pick? Slowly sit down and think this through logically your a citizen but what do i get? GST money? That small 1% after they suck from u 99% of your money with ridiculous bills?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its tough but please lets keep this a peaceful thread ok, I'm not young, and not too old. I have to admit no country in the world is like singapore its great here home is where the heart will ALWAYS be. But i mean, i just wish our words mean something.</p>
              <p>Feel free to express your feelings.</p>

              <p>Time out for reality check.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is nothing to fear except fear itself. A famous man once said. Your fears are self driven, sad to say. I can understand your fears. When it is talk and banded about so easiy, everyone believe in it and it becomes true, when there is not a shred of truth in it.</p>
              <p>The fact is, for every foreigner hired, a company would have to hire a few more Singaporeans. Not only that, there are other costs involved that drive up the company costings in hiring such foreigners.</p>
              <p>Therefore, in truth, think of it this way - each foreigner hired means another few more citizens get hired as well.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, in such trouble times, it is better to invite more confident companies here to set up shop, give them the option to hire cheap foreign labour, and our citizens move into managerial and supervisory positions.</p>
              <p>At least, in this manner, there will be jobs created.</p>
              <p>If you see foreigners working in starhub, mac, etc, its because we citizens dont want such jobs nor paid enough for it. But you can be assured that PMET positions are held by singaporeans in the head and branch offices.</p>
              <p>So don't worry too much about it. Just get your diploma, and get a job and gain working experience. It may be smaller than expected salary, but do remember - this is only temporary. The greedy nature of mankind will not allow themselves to remain as they are and watch their savings dwindle. Investments are the only option to watch their money grow. Once money circulates, we are back in the game.</p>
              <p>It is one thing to hate the ruling party, but quite another thing to spread or compound half truths to put fear and hatred into fellow citizens. I have no interest in politics. My concern is only for my fellow citizens. Whomever gets elected or gain power, hell, i still have to pay taxes. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Jobs Credit Scheme was introduced with Budget 2009 and sparked a great debate over it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Is the Jobs Credit Scheme workable?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Before answering this question, you will need to answer another question first:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Is this Jobs Credit Scheme a big wayang or is it the real thing?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">WAYANG</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Assuming that this Jobs Credit Scheme is a big wayang, we need to ask ourselves this question:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Why did the extraordinary government do it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">It is of course an attempt to provide a ‘cover’ for other issues!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">For example, when the ministers gave themselves a huge pay hike, they also give salary increments to civil servants and MPs. They do this because Singaporeans are stupid and of inferior stock- as described by Mr Li Ao! Thus, instead of venting their angers towards the ministers, Singaporeans are targeting civil servants and MPs!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Then, what are the issues that the extraordinary government is desperately trying to ‘cover’?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from the detention centre on 27 February 2008.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Up to now, the extraordinary government doesn’t seem to have any concrete plan for the eventual recapturing of Mas Selamat Kastari.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">What is Temasek Holdings famous for?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">It is famous for its ‘hide- behind- honest- mistakes’ management!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">So far, Temasek Holdings did not manage to post capital gains for its investments- Shin Corp (since 2006), Barclays (since 2007), ABC Learning (since 2007) and Merrill (now Bank of America).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Thus, there is nothing to rejoice about when Temasek Holdings announce pay cuts for its management!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">What is there to rejoice about when the forfeits are their heads!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">In the end, there is nothing that Singaporeans could do as we choose the wrong team ourselves!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">As LKY has previously mentioned, Singaporeans have chosen the wrong team and thus will have to suffer for the next few years!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">If the selection of the team for Temasek Holdings is based entirely on merit, then obviously, the selection of an ex- minister for PSA Corp is not based entirely on merit!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Thus, the ex- minister was asked to leave by PSA Corp when he committed a honest mistake while the ‘hide- behind- honest- mistakes’ management of Temasek Holdings was allowed to stay on despite committing numerous honest mistakes!</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">This saga begun when Lta Li Hongyi went to Ministry of Defence- bypassing the chain of command in the process- and filed a complaint against Lta X.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">As a result, Lta X was fined S$2500.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">When the NKF scandal broke out, the extraordinary government sent two people to serve as chairman and lawyer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">The ‘chairman’ is seconded from NCSS- a government- linked organization and the lawyer- currently the Law Minister- was at that time a PAP MP.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">At that time, there is widespread anger over the NKF scandal thus the first task to be done was to make preparation for the filing of a civil lawsuit!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Thus, these two men are sent there to help influence the decision- making process:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Who should be ‘put to the sword’ and who should be ‘spared’?</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">After the decision- making process, some were sued while some- for example, the former NKF vice chairman, Mr <span style="color: #333333;">Alwyn Lim- were ‘spared’!</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: small;">It is reported recently that F &amp; N decided not to appoint a group CEO after months of searching.  The reason given was that the necessary skill sets required for F &amp; B and properties might not be found in an individual. Instead, CEOs will be appointed for its divisions and they will report to the non- executive chairman, <span class="yshortcuts">Mr Lee Hsien Yang</span>. By doing so, F &amp; N is making Mr Lee Hsien Yang the unofficial group CEO. Unfortunately, Mr Lee, while performing well as SingTel CEO previously, also do not possess the necessary skill sets required for F &amp; B and properties!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

This would be rather unfair as all Singaporeans have witnessed his performance at SingTel. By just simply using his common sense, he managed to build SingTel into a regional giant! He doesn’t have to use ‘honest mistakes’ as a shield! This is done by adopting the GE strategy and makes some modifications. For GE, it is no 1 or 2 on a global basis. For SingTel, it is on a country basis! If the management of Temasek Holdings were to use their common senses, Temasek Holdings won’t be making an investment on the 4<sup>th</sup> largest bank- Barclays- in Great Britain ! </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: small;">  </span></span></p>

If she didn’t happen to be at the right place, right time and right position, she won’t be able to become the CEO! For example, if she were to be a staff of Temasek Holdings, until the day she died, she might not have the chance to become CEO! Mr Lee Hsien Yang might have made some mistakes while being SingTel CEO- not necessarily work- related! </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">As all Singaporeans know, the salaries that the ministers are commanding are huge and undeserving.</span></p>

He went forthwith to assure himself of the truth of the report and observe the new position. A level plain lay at his feet, whereon he saw something short of ten thousand Shu troops, the greater part of whom appeared invalids. On the banner of their leader he read the name Van Leader Hu Ban.</span></p>

After King Tang's death, Yi Yin served his sons and grandson. Soon after Tai Jia, King Tang's grandson, ascended the throne, he committed many faults, and Yi Yin, acting as regent, exiled Tai Jia to Tong Palace ---the burial place of King Tang. After three years Yi Yin returned him the throne. Tai Jia eventually became an enlightened emperor. Shang Dynasty lasted for 650 years (BC 1700-1050). It was this act of Yi Yin rather than his services in building up an empire that has made him immortal. Whether he did right in temporarily dethroning the king was open to question, until a final verdict was rendered by Mencius who thought that his ends amply justified his means. This historical event attests the extent of the power exercised by a prime minister in those days. </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://us.mc300.mail.yahoo.com/Local%20Settings/Temp/Temporary%20Directory%203%20for%20rotk.zip/terms.htm#yi_yin"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.....</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p>Time out for reality check.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is nothing to fear except fear itself. A famous man once
              said. Your fears are self driven, sad to say. I can understand your
              fears. When it is talk and banded about so easiy, everyone believe
              in it and it becomes true, when there is not a shred of truth in
              it.</p>
              <p>The fact is, for every foreigner hired, a company would have to
              hire a few more Singaporeans. Not only that, there are other costs
              involved that drive up the company costings in hiring such
              foreigners.</p>
              <p>Therefore, in truth, think of it this way - each foreigner hired
              means another few more citizens get hired as well.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, in such trouble times, it is better to invite more
              confident companies here to set up shop, give them the option to
              hire cheap foreign labour, and our citizens move into managerial
              and supervisory positions.</p>
              <p>At least, in this manner, there will be jobs
              created.</p>
              <p>If you see foreigners working in starhub, mac, etc, its because
              we citizens dont want such jobs nor paid enough for it. But you can
              be assured that PMET positions are held by singaporeans in the head
              and branch offices.</p>
              <p>So don't worry too much about it. Just get your diploma, and get
              a job and gain working experience. It may be smaller than expected
              salary, but do remember - this is only temporary. The greedy nature
              of mankind will not allow themselves to remain as they are and
              watch their savings dwindle. Investments are the only option to
              watch their money grow. Once money circulates, we are back in the
              game.</p>
              <p>It is one thing to hate the ruling party, but quite another
              thing to spread or compound half truths to put fear and hatred
              into fellow citizens. I have no interest in politics. My
              concern is only for my fellow citizens. Whomever gets elected or
              gain power, hell, i still have to pay taxes. </p>

              <p>I agree.  The scenario of a basic but respectable job is a fair one, especially in these hard times.  Why employ FT for a job that a local will work at for a fair rate?  Because the FT can afford to work for less.  It's a total disadvantage to locals.  Surely Pizza Hut and Starhub can afford a reasonable local wage?  If so then why do they employ FTs?  It can only benefit the company for further profits.</p>
              <p>As for FTs creating local jobs.  Tell me, how many local jobs do you get from one FT working a menial but respectable job?  Not many.</p>

              <p><br>I agree with you that the rich can take care of themselves and the poor will be taken care of by our society. It is the middle class that will bear the brunt and full force of the tsunamic crisis, with the issue of FTs being one of the impacts faced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, are we already throwing our hands up in defeat and be swept away? Think critically, they are not as fearsome as many assumed them to be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They may be young, highly educated or more experienced and cheaper than us. BUT they are not Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, in this crisis, taxpayers had sacrificed and offered billions to companies in companies in Singapore to survive. These companies that accepts our funds OWES an obligation to hire citizens instead of FTs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Experience is the only justification for use of FTs, as the bottomline counts and they need the best. The companies must succeed or our funds would have been wasted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FWs( foreign Workers ) are a different matter altogether, because those are jobs Singaporeans do not want. Companies cannot afford to pay Singaporean wages and hope to survive. They will either fold or pack up to our neighbouring countries, which will be our loss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our non-PMETs, whom are entreprenuers or in the service sector, would rather have these FWs around than to take over their jobs. Their spendings amount to a conservative est $2billion annually!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which is why a macik selling simple nasi lemak daily to them could afford a 5rm flat than to work as a factory operator earning hardly enough to rent a 1rm flat!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, any working adult PMET will tell you life is no bed of roses. The competition in their jobscope is tough even amongst fellow citizens. Make a mistake and you will be closer to the exit door.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We Singaporeans are competitive enough, with homeground advantage. How do you think FTs gonna measure up against us?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think again if you presume Sporeans are wimps, unless you are the kind that believes PMETs' job is just sitting around doing nothing or little, and earning fat pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such lifestyle is possible only amongst the rich, which anyone in Spore in the middle class can aspire to. But it comes with great risk. Make it good and you are set for life. Make a mistake and you will only end up queing in CDCs for $360 a mth!. These are risks the middle class are never prepared to take and accepts the status qou.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps our elected representatives might want to close up the loop hole on companies favouring young pretty educated FTs instead of our older but experienced PMETs, incases whereby experience is not critical. The middle class, afterall is the bedrock of stability in any civilised society and deserve better treatment, more so our own fellow citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The middle classes are descendants of hardy peasants and had been armed with knowledge and training over the years by our meritous society to withstand and triumph against adversity as their predecessors had.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This tsunami will be a test if we are found worthy to deserve Singapore - only a piece of rock but built thru humiliation, sweat, toil and blood by our forefathers we call home, in a world filled with trubulence and turmoil.</p>

              <p><br>OMgosh! cool guys, there is a free lunch in this world, upgrading oneself is good, but is need alot of sacrification to your normal life. The time, the studies and the stress is really very stressful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then, we are afterall, looking for some cash to change for foods and our daily expenses. Like it or not, the situation is like this already, you dun work, someone will work, you dun upgrade, someone will upgrade. It is a challenging world out there, but just be cool about it, take a step at a time. You alone cannot change the world to suit you, you are trained to adjust yourself to suit the world. So rather than shooting at each other that yield no result, why not cool down and concentrate on what we are doing and hopefully we can be somebody somewhere, be inspired and blessed.</p>
