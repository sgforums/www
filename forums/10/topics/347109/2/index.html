              <p>I agree.  The scenario of a basic but respectable job is a fair one, especially in these hard times.  Why employ FT for a job that a local will work at for a fair rate?  Because the FT can afford to work for less.  It's a total disadvantage to locals.  Surely Pizza Hut and Starhub can afford a reasonable local wage?  If so then why do they employ FTs?  It can only benefit the company for further profits.</p>
              <p>As for FTs creating local jobs.  Tell me, how many local jobs do you get from one FT working a menial but respectable job?  Not many.</p>

              <p><br>of course the companies can afford better wages for their employees. but the point is plain and simple; greed. and the govt support this by allowing the businesses to exploit the workers; ranging from suppressing wages to employing hordes of foreigners.</p>

              <p>This is very grey.</p>
              <p>For the FT, they think that they should have the benefits because they contributed the country.</p>
              <p>For the citizens, they think that Singapore is owned by them.</p>
              <p>For the government I guess, they just implement policies that benefit Singapore.</p>
              <p>I agreed on TS thoughts on "When you think of calling yourself a citizen don't you think it should carry some pride?"</p>
              <p>The government should look into ways to inject these "pride" into Singapore citizens. As a multi racial and multi religion society, this is very important. But, in order hand, this is a very difficult task. A task that needed talent that the government lack of.</p>

              <p>Let me tell you the truth, without the FTs or FLs here, we can kiss goodbye to years of economy progress and without mentioning about the current recession, we may be out of jobs long ago already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We must look at FT and FL as one of the pillar in our national economy progression, without them, companies may move out and we ended with no job too. Protectionsim is not viable in a globlised and open economy that we adhered. It is of good fortune that our neighbouring countries are not doing so well, so industrialised and open as us, therefore, we get to bring their talents and workforces into our society. In a marco view, we absorbed their brains and physical strengths to help us build our economy. To thanks them or not is not a problem, cos they get a good paid here in comparing to their homeland whereby they may not even find a job. But nevetheless, it is a win win situation for us and them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agreed that Our local talents do face a competitive edge with FTs, so are our local labours, but instead of keep complaining, it is time to upgrade oneself and be nimble about the real facts  rather then thinking that as a singaporeans you are nos 1, and the silver plate must be serve infront of you. Gone are the days where you command high paid with a iron rice bowl career but doing nothing productively. We should take FTs pressence as a wake up call that we hv to stay relevant, work hard and be flexible at all times. It is no more a spoonfeeding society, we are free to roam. Airport open 24/7. The choice is yours.</p>
