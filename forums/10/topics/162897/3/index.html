Obey rules" (Nov 14).<br><br>With due respect to his experience in the Police Force, he voices what is probably the official view, and the law, that "regardless of the severity of the offence, an accused person should be handcuffed".<br><br>Although there have been rare cases of "an accused person who escapes", his days of freedom can be limited at best.<br><br>Mr de Souza does not seem to feel much empathy for the common people who view the "mata-mata" with a sense of dread, even if they have done no wrong or have no cause to fear the police.<br><br>Any individual's hard-built reputation can be shattered if he or she is led away by the police, even without the mandatory handcuffs. Even a subsequent verdict of innocence is unlikely to wipe away the stigma entirely.<br><br>I recall my similar experience with Singapore Customs more than 10 years ago. Then, the rule called for half a tank of petrol, which I ran short of for the first time.<br><br>A customs officer led me to the administration office where I waited for 45 minutes on a couch while my wife and children waited in my car, wondering what was happening.<br><br>Two customs officers handling my case were chit-chatting instead of working. When I finally lost my patience, I stood up and started reading some papers pinned on a notice board Â— but was told by one officer to sit still and "behave" myself.<br><br>I count myself lucky that I had accepted to pay the $50 fine outright.<br><br>The law seems to reflect that our system does not have the patience and time to deal with petty offences committed, deliberately or not, by ordinary Singaporeans.<br><br>It seems like anyone who is reluctant to accept a composition penalty and wants to appeal may be strongly discouraged with the prospect of being handcuffed and locked up.<br><br>Possibly, such measures exist to ensure that the police and the courts are not unnecessarily bothered.<br><br>Mr de Souza's rationale that it is safer to handcuff everyone accused of committing a minor offence "in case he is guilty of a serious crime" is absurd.<br><br>The treatment an accused person receives must be commensurate with the severity of the alleged offence.<br><br>We don't go around castrating all Singapore men just to prevent the rise in rape cases!<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/84352print.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/84352print.asp</a><br></div>

Any person who brings in 2 cartons or more cigs without permit and no declaration is consider smuggling and it can be a court case.<br><br>For common folks like us, if we bring in 2 packets of cigs without declaring, it can be considered hiding.  Customs will offer a fine for this instance.  If the offender refuse to pay the fine, it can be a court case. It is similar to the 3/4 tank rule.  The person is trying to evade duty, regardless of cigs or petrol.</div>

Most big companies doing very well especially oil and shipping and banking related.<br><br>same as the benefits of share options or profit sharing.  Share rally, give share options, share down, give profit sharing.  These big bosses, will alternate between the two to maximise their rewards.<br><br>Our gov operates the same way, money first, and cut tax of high paying executives, and Impose 5% GST  to all, including those income too low or no income to pay tax.<br><br>Anyway half tank really cannot save much, maybe $25 per trip, with 3/4 maybe $20 per trip for avearge person who take the trouble to save.  unless very big cc cars.    Anyway its only those stay close to north or west will benefit.<br><br></div>

They are on the assumption that when supplies delivered and accept by them its 100% correct.  If any shortfall, they will penalise the supplier or make police report.  They don;t even do 10% check for quantities.  Its expected to be 100% and in good order.<br><br></div>

If such public sector economy which took over the private sector keep paying for costs of employments of CEOs and highly paid staff without producing any practical entrepreneurship in them, we are risking killing off the private sector economy in Singapore.<br><br>Many years down the road we will only keep paying high salaries to sustain public employees without creating entrepreneurship or vibrancy as these public employees will be sitting on opportunities without corresponding competitiveness that thrive in private sector competitions.<br><br>I have serious doubts that any of our civil servants could replace or outperform private enterprises. They are only at most able to create higher costs which at the end have to be subsidized by government or charge citizens higher and higher fees to sustain their high costs and loss of competitiveness.</div>
