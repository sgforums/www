            <div class='col-md body'>All of you missed the point : He was offered  to pay a fine, but he turned down the offer !!! That means the case would be fought in Court, and he would be an Accused Person Vs the State.<br><br>The Accused would need be charged in Court, and his fingerprints/ photos taken and would be registered with the Criminal Records Office.<br><br>If he is subsequently convicted by the Court, the conviction  would be a Criminal Record, even if the offence was a traffic offence.<br><br>So, please pay your traffic fines........even if you feel wronged. It is better to pay and  following this, write in to explain. If you ignore a traffic summons, you can be ARRESTED, HANDCUFFED and treated as a CRIMINAL if the Court issues a Warrant-of -Arrest against you for not paying your fine and not turning up in court.</div>

Everyday, so many Singapore vehicles go to Malaysia Â– if all donÂ’t obey the law you know how many millions the petrol companies in Singapore are going to lose? Wait until they reveal you the Sadistic of how many millions will be lost Â– you see, fare cheats deprive Singapore bus companies of $9 million a year.<br><br>Since the majority of Singapore citizens donÂ’t earn the salary of our incorruptible ministers, it is therefore highly possible that 99% of Singapore citizens are morally corrupted. As such, they must be treated like criminal mah, especially since you have been found to break the law  -- you are already a criminal, no longer just a suspect, understand bo?<br><br>Singapore legal system is world class one lah. For example, Ah How, convicted killer of Huang Na, can get across to Malaysia because that time he is only a murder suspect, not convicted yet. Mr Lawrence, you are confirmed to have broken the law what, so how to compare with him? That is why you must be handcuffed. If Ah How escaped, at most one life lost without explanation only what Â– no money lost. Skali you escaped, who will compensate for the lost of revenue?

            <div class='col-md body'>and that reminds me of the seriousness and extreme penalty of weekend car cheats.  Save $20 can get into real jailed time if repeated.  And yet judge talking about probation and no jailed time for four footballers caught for statuatary gang rape of underage girl.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is something very wrong in the whole system of government with no one among the judges, prosecutors or ministers being able to understand that for minor offence citizens should not be hand-cuffed.<br><br>Why treat the ordinary citizens like criminals for something like not topping up petrol which in the first place is a highly doubtful law as it is clearly unconstitutional to stop people from purchasing petrol using his own monies at any place he likes. This shows that the government has lost touch with all the basics of good government. Government is elected by people to look after them and protect them against the criminals not to behave like intimidators against the people.<br><br>This case can be regarded as abuse of power as hand-cuffing is most uncalled for minor offence as other remedies are available to the state in dealing with an offender. Law is made by people to regulate society and punishment is meted out only to those who are wilful or incorrigible in breaching serious offences against aws and orders.<br><br>Why use the laws to show off authority or intimidating the citizens. Even if an offender escape custody there are many ways he can be dealt with such as summons which is normally meted out even to serious traffic offenders like speeding. Have you come across speeding motorists being hand-cuffed for refusing to pay fine on the spot.</div>
