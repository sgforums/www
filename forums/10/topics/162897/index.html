            <div class='col-md body'>Friday Â• November 11, 2005<br><br>Letter from Lawrence Seow Kuan Yong<br><br>Did you know that if you run afoul of the three-quarter tank petrol rule when crossing the causeway into Johor, and refuse to pay the $50 composition fine offered to first-time offenders because you want to appeal your case in court, you may be treated like a criminal?<br><br>The officers make you wait a long while before they explain the charge. Photographs of your car and fuel tank gauge are taken. You are handcuffed and escorted to Clementi Police Station, where your DNA sample, photograph and fingerprints are taken.<br><br>If the $5,000 bail is made, you are permitted to go home; otherwise, you will spend the night in jail. Either way, you will appear in court the following day. All this, for not filling up your fuel tank to the three-quarter mark.<br><br>This happened to me last month. I am a first-time offender and I do not deny my mistake. The authorities could have simply asked the first-time offender to appear in court the following day, without the indignity of going through all the above. They already had all my details. There was no way for a person in my situation to run.<br><br>I wrote to Singapore Customs, and was informed that under the law, if an offender chooses not to accept the offer of a composition (an out of court settlement), then procedurally, he must be charged in court. This would involve arrest, statements, handcuffs, a visit to the police station, etc.<br><br>But my question is: Why treat a citizen like a criminal for such a minor offence?<br><br>Source:<br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/83645print.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/83645print.asp</a></div>
