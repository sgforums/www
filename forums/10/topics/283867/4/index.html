Thai Gen provide a good example of less killing transition. by taking off their uniform.<br><br>Asean common value i believe you just answer your own question as indicated below.<br><br><strong>Unfortunately, the Myanmar Junta continue to take all the necessary steps to tighten their grip on Myanmar society, by closing its borders, and as much as it appear on the surface to have tone down its militancy, the midnight raids and arrests continue as news begin to leak out of Myanmar.<br><br>Such ASEAN countries will include Singapore, Vietnam, and Laos - where the supremacy of a domineering Single Political Party in each country continue to exist through ensuring its own political survival, by preventing the Citizens from having meaningful alternative political options</strong><br><br>Why would NK suddenly agreed to give up Nuke other than exchange of economics aids?  Bush drop the policy of "regime change"  in plain English open a door for him to walk out and save a face.<br><br><strong>Can ASEAN afford to disengage itself by kicking Myanmar out of this regional organisation </strong>?<br><br>Since when is Asean confrontational?<br><br><strong>Can ASEAN afford to cut all lines of communication and all possible leverage that it may have in continuing to engage the Myanmar Military Junta </strong>?<br><br>if you cut all lines of communication at the political level that means you reach the end of the line. Unless you willing to serve SAF and have a few tour in Myanmar if not i suggest you keep the phone line open.<br><br><strong>The pulls in the different direction by the various Political Leaders of all the ASEAN member countries will result in ASEAN being largely an ineffective organisation to handle the problems in one their own member state.<br><br>Can they even agree on any solution to help the Myanmar Citizens to achieve a more open society that allow the Citizens to take charge of their own lives ?</strong><br>ASEAN seek peaceful stabilities co-exist not confronting and War in this region. It is willing to accept an authoritarin regime so long as it does not distablized the region. It believe that no leader is going to stay there for ever.<br>but everyone arms to the teeth. so the minute 1 country pull out a knife the neighbour country pull out its M16, the next pull out its SU and follow by F-15...Than follow by SS missile.<br><br>So the answer lies in more trade and increase income level of its citizen, better educate its people so generation to come it transform the society and gov.<br><br><strong>Any such positive development in Myanmar will backfire and have repercussions on the imagination of citizens having similar governments that suppress their Citizens in a closed political society.<br><br>The next step in ASEAN evolution will be to establish an ASEAN Regional Court of Justice - similar to the International Court of Justice in Europe - in which rogue governments can be taken to task by the Citizens.</strong><br><br>that will take another Tsunami to evole n that would not be in our life time.<br>it took them so long to talk about Human right charter.
