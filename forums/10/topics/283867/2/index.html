Do not for one moment think that the British was so nice as to hand independence to India, Burma, Straits Settlements, Borneo and the likes. If you read history books by British historians, you will never get to read this piece of truth. When Britain left East India, it did not prepare those countries it granted independence a proper political system. It was left to the leaders of independence 'movements'. So, some leaders are wise, some are otherwise. Right now, in retrospect, we all on hindsight are like Atobe thinking we know better what irks countries like Myanmar.</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Again, which history text have you been referrring to in making such simplistic conclusions - that seems to have you twisting historical facts to suit your own preferred views of what your history is ?<br><br>After the defeat of the Japanese in WW-2, Lord Mountbatten returned to Burma and soon realised that the Burmese were already politically awaken by the Japanese, who had promised Burmese total independence from British Colonial Rule.<br><br>Given this awakening that the Imperial Power can be defeated by a small Asian Power - as proven by the Japanese, the entire Colonial System was already untenable as exposed by events of that period.<br><br>Britain had little choice but to offfer independence to all its colonies, or to spend more money to fight the spreading fire-fights of independence wars that are sprouting all across the globe, from Africa, to the sub-Asian Continent, and across the Asian landmass.<br><br>Did the British simply pull out and abandon the colonies, or did they take their time to handover these territories ?<br><br>Which History Text have you been using to generate a bigger <span style="font-style: italic;">'pile of crap'</span> ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Atobe said SG and Myanmar have many similarities.

George Yeo is right that we understand the political situation there far better than ranting western liberals who are in no mood themselves to send their soldiers into another military conflict in Myanmar.    Regime change has not worked...just look at Iraq.

Falling into my pile of crap had made him a very angry man. I feel sorry for all his rantings.  That man needs some help.  While he had been quite diligent in digging pile of materials including foreign ones, pictures, quotations, speeches, history books, newspaper clippings, etc., his rantings can be unintelligent and incoherent, with many unconnected linkages here and there.  It is a pity we do not know exactly what irks him but there seemed to be a lot of underlying hatred or unspoken dissatisfactions that we do not really know.  I can feel his sufferings but I am not sure whether my pile of crap is any help!</div>
