In fact, ASEAN has consistently pressed the Burmese junta to mend its way but it remained recalcitrant now it has reached intolerable level n Spore govt has voiced out its harsh opinion on the junta. Look at the report, head of the junta can also differ in its method with his deputy over the shooting of the monk.</div>

I think it is more of Burma is making use of ASEAN's policy of non-intereference to<br><br>its benefit. I guessed it is mutual benefit considering the fact Burma is full of natural resources for ASEAN to invest in oh my goodness, has the investment reached to the people? Thing will worse for Burma but not ASEAN.

Have anyone thought about the outcome impact all these elements.<br><br>Report has shown the drug trades has decrease from these region.<br><br>Asean created a segment to allow alternative negociation with Myanmar rather than allowing PRC direct influence at the security council. The inclusion of so many countries into Asean was to counter the balance of PRC influence.<br>Let's hope that LHL can delivered.<br><br>It took Asean so many years to come up Human Right Charter I believe it derseve a chance to let it work and not kill it. certainly the HR will be by its own standard and evolved slowly rather than fullfill western country "Feel good objective.<br><br>lastly i think SG Gov is at odd with its past policy so i do believe some adjustment will be made in view of its role in Asean.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Myanmar issue cannot be resolved without participation of the military. Such vigorous show of opposition and public protests against the military junta only serves to put the military on the defensive and will result in greater restriction of civil liberties and human rights. George Yeo is right that we understand the political situation there far better than ranting western liberals who are in no mood themselves to send their soldiers into another military conflict in Myanmar.    Regime change has not worked...just look at Iraq. It is not in our own political or economic interests to have instability in Myanmar, and economic sanctions for the past decades have not worked an iota.<br><br>The way forward is for greater diplomatic dialogue and to persuade the Myanmese military that their interests would be better served by less oppressive rule.</div>

Uganda tried to do that under the military lunacy of Idi Amin who wanted to change Uganda to <strong>Uganda Idi</strong> but was stopped from doing so by his 'wise' lieutenants who asked: What would the people of Uganda Idi be called?<br>Thank you for your discourse on Burmese history. What you mentioned I alreadi knew. But what you do not know:<br>The British granted independence in haste after suffering losses in wars with Germany and Japan. Do not for one moment think that the British was so nice as to hand independence to India, Burma, Straits Settlements, Borneo and the likes. If you read history books by British historians, you will never get to read this piece of truth. When Britain left East India, it did not prepare those countries it granted independence a proper political system. It was left to the leaders of independence 'movements'. So, some leaders are wise, some are otherwise. Right now, in retrospect, we all on hindsight are like Atobe thinking we know better what irks countries like Myanmar.<br>Atobe said SG and Myanmar have many similarities. If you believed what Atobe claimed, then logically, SG should be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even poorer</span> than Myanmar.<br>As for his other claims, I can only said they hold no water but the rhetorics are interesting vibes for entertaining the Burmese whom if Atobe has a chance to speak at the many forums held recently to express indignation at what the junta is doing, will greatly lift their repressed spirits!</div>
