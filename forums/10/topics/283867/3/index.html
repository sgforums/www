            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Just because the global media are now focusing on Myanmar, the latter has now become another platform for the sheep in this forum to use some white manÂ’s opinion to criticize our government as if they (the whites) are naturally smarter than their own ancestor of different skin colors, and they have now become the most caring community in Singapore. OR should I say NATO community in Singapore??<br><br>The problem that the Burmese are facing today is nothing new, those who have traveled to Yangon or Mandalay for business or holiday would have already know that people there are extremely poor and they are deprived of many things in life for many many years. And suppose if Singapore/Asean government or companies didnt provide "aid" or investment to Myanmar, the Burmese will still be living in a world without internet, mobile phone, computers etc and communication with the outside world would be cut off.<br><br>After reading so much comments from the wannabe politicians (aka arm chair critics) in this forum, none of these people have actually highlighted the importance of Myanmar to Singapore and the ASEAN region and all they can think about is what the white people are saying about us and speculating that Singapore government is supporting Junta against their own people.<br><br>If you havenÂ’t already know, Myanmar is the only ASEAN country that links SE-Asia to the India continent and they are geographically connect to India, Bangladesh, China, Laos and Thailand. If Singapore or ASEAN would to isolate Myanmar like North Korea, this will create a lot of instability in the region and it will become a huge trade barrier bAsean and India continent.<br><br>Mr. Texas BUSH, Puppet Blair and PM Coward have already made huge mistake in their approach in dealing with Arabs in the Middle East, do you have reasons to believe that white people are more capable than Asians to deal with Asians? Plus have the sheep ever ask themselves how much investment these white countries have in Iraq and Iran prior to the WAR?<br><br>To all those white di.ck suckers out there, please stop disgracing Singaporeans!!<br></div></blockquote>Of all the information that I have sifted through, only your 3rd last para made the most sense. Well, of course bits and pieces here and there too.<br><br>Sentences like the last one are one of the major reasons why it is difficult for you to hold a meaningful debate.<br><br>In my opinion, the whites, namely the US, European countries and Australia have always been champions of democracy, therefore the extremely negative stance towards the junta's repression.<br><br>With regard to your second para, you sound almost as if Singapore is doing charity work. Hard to fathom considering Singapore Inc's profit oriented inclination. Singapore simply jumped on the bandwagon as ASEAN's leader. Why leave the lion's share of the military business pie to Russia, China and Israel?<br><br>Back to your third para, I agree with your claim on political instability should Myanmar be isolated. However, I can't say the same for the country being a vital link between east and west.<br><br>How much of the trade between ASEAN and India is by land through Myanmar? Surely with the advent of air and sea travel, the impact of adverse land trade conditions would be very much mitigated.<br><br>Of course, one cannot totally fault the Singapore govt for taking an indecisive stance. After all, it does not want to offend China. Being business oriented, the arms sales business is difficult to forsake too. However, being a staunch ally of the US and other major white countries, it has to make a tough stance towards the junta too.<br><br>If many here are suckers of wh.te dic.ks as you claim, then you surely must be the equivalent with regards to Kwan Yew's d.ick or Hsien Loong's co.ck too.</div>

Who cares about quality and hygiene anway? I'm sure they also have Sushi Tei that commensurates with their wages. Why don't you and I move over to Myanmar? We will live like kings over there.

The Singaporeans today are definitely struggling as compared to those days in the 1950s. Did those families in the 1950s struggle at all? Of course not.

Anyone who asks me for proof is a downright donkey.<br><br>Of course, nevermind that today we no longer live in kampongs and have swimming pools in every estate, nevermind that we have an efficient public transport system, nevermind that we have drinking water straight from the tap and nevermind that we have cars, handphones, computers and broadband connections.
