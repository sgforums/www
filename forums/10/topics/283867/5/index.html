Come election time, I vote with my head. I chose the best of the lot. I do not surcumb to peer perssure.<br>I am not happy with the PAP presently, because I am twice retrenched, and a third is comming up. I like Goh Chok Tong, because I see him as a PM for the people, but not Lee Hsien Loong, because is a PM for the corporations. But the real reason is, in GCT shift, I was uplifted high economically, in LHL shift, I was sacrificed as an economic fodder.<br><br>As for government policies and actions.<br>I am like a judge in a singing contest.<br>I appraise the song sung. Not the singer. Should the song be sung well, it will have my applause, if not my criticism. I am not so prejudiced against the person such that no matter what is sung, how it is sung, I give my condemnation.<br>So for government policies and actions, I support, I critise, I make fun of, I laugh at, I defend, I deride, I comment, accordingly, to my own assessment of them. I have no need to be affiliated to any side, or procure the approval of any group.<br><br></div>
