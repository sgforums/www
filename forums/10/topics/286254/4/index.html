Since he loves to talk about other countries, he should be fair to allow other country to talk about his lee family as well.   He is just so paranoid.  He thinks by letting the media apologise to him and his two despicable family members he is telling the whole world he and his family are not to be bullied, then I think that is unnecessary, as by doing so he is giving more and more bad publicity to himself and his family.   There are so many foreigners who say that he practises nepotism and it is LEe dynasty in Singapore, so is he going to tell all these people to apologise to him and he will sue them.
