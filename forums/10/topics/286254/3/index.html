            <div class='col-md body'>Should the International Bar Association take note? There are other newspapers that have produced the excerpts of the FT artilce for their readers to draw their own conclusion if it is libelous. In fact, the apology by FT backfires on the Lee family as more people become aware of the fact that one family runs the countryÂ’s enormous wealth funds.<br><br>Here's the offending passage from the FT article:<br><br>On the subject of sovereign wealth funds, there seems to be a whole lot of lovin' going on within the Temasek family.<br>DBS Bank, whose biggest shareholder is Temasek, this week surprised many by announcing that US-born Jackson Tai would step down towards the end of the year. Mr Tai was said to be keen to "spend more time with his family".<br>Last week Jimmy Phoon, Temasek's chief investment officer, announced he was leaving "to take a break and spend some time with the family".<br>Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised at the reasons. Singapore, after all, is built on strong family values. Lee Kuan Yew, founding father of the city-state, must be proud to see Lee Hsien Loong, his son, occupy the role of prime minister.<br>Mr Lee (Jnr) himself will be pleased Ho Ching, his wife, has helped turn round the performance of Temasek after being appointed chief executive in 2002.<br>The rumour mill now suggests Lee Hsien Yang, the younger brother, could replace Mr Tai at DBS. The younger Mr Lee earned his spurs as chief executive of SingTel, also part of the Temasek firmament.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean..the Australian journalists attacks John Howard in the press too, so to attack LHY or LKY is nothing. So question is, why isn't there demonstrations against LHL and LKY from organisations affiliated to Chee ? If they can't do anything then what is their existence for ? Can they influence their government to impose sanctions on us ? Robert Mugabe is banned from entering Europe. We are still very good friends with the world.</div>
