I'm very impressed with Sylvia Lim on her assertion that Singaporeans can solve our own problems internally and we do not require external interference. We have our problems and we don't see eye to eye but internationally we should stand as one.<br><br>The first thing Singaporeans need to do is to change their mindset. Clear out all conspiracy theories in their heads and think rationally. If you support WP vote WP and likewise for other parties. Do not think that your vote is being monitored and bad things will happen if you vote for the opposition etc.<br><br>WP has improved along the years under the stewardship of Low Thia Kiang. Today they have engaged professionals to join their ranks. It is a slow process but if Singaporeans change their mindsets, it'll probably fasten the pace.<br><br>If they can grow, they can take on more GRCs, SMCs whatever. If Singaporeans are truly fed up with PAP, perhaps then more seats will go to the opposition. As Sylvia said, respect the elections.</div>

I didn't think signing the FTA is a big deal too. What i'm highlighting is that the U.S president came out to sign the FTA with our prime minister and thats rare. Most likely its due to Singapore siding with U.S in the "war against terror" anyway. You are on the internet if there is any demonstrations against Singapore, you'll get to know about it. Whether any countries give a damn about Singapore, i leave that for you to judge. My point is that no country is giving a damn about Chee Soon Juan.</div>

Mr. Prime Minister and Ms. Lee, thank you very much for your gracious hospitality. Laura and I are thrilled to be back here. I'm always amazed when I think about Singapore, a country that wasn't supposed to be; a part of the world where people basically said there's no chance for the good folks to survive and thrive. I'm amazed at your successes, and I appreciate the values on which your successes rest.<br><br>I congratulate the people of Singapore for being such a vivid example of enterprise and markets and hard work. I congratulate the government for being visionary in its leadership. And I am thrilled that you allowed me to give a speech at one of your fine universities, talking about the importance of the Far East to the future of the United States.<br><br>I thank you very much for serving that meat. (Laughter and applause.) It was so good, it had to be from Texas. (Laughter.)<br><br>The Prime Minister and I have had a lot of discussions about a variety of issues, and I shared with them one of my chief concerns, that our country would become -- could possibly become isolationist and protectionist. In my speech today to the university, Mr. Prime Minister, I assured the listeners that it is in our interest to remain engaged in the world. It's in our economic interests and it's in our national interests that the United States work with strong friends and allies such as Singapore to spread prosperity and hope, and to work to lay the foundations for peace.<br><br>Mr. Prime Minister, I appreciate your clear vision of the threats that we face. I appreciate the fact that you see the ideological struggle before us. I cannot think of a more steadfast leader in you, and your willingness to make the hard steps necessary to deal with this challenge today so that our children won't have to deal with it in more severe terms tomorrow.<br><br>I'm proud to call you friend. Laura and I are proud to be in your presence. May God bless you and your important country. (Applause.)<br><br></div>

Criticism is bound to occur as even a paper loss of 2 billion is substantial. It won't be a loss eventually if we can recover that paper loss. The problem was that at that point point of time, Thailand seemed to want to wipe out the entire investment and make us realise that loss immediately.<br><br>So you make an investment, you buy from A and A takes the money. The value of your investment halves. What have you lost ? You lose if you try to sell your investment today, else your investment is still there.
