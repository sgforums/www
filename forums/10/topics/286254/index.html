However, why has there been no worldwide demonstrations against us if these international organisations are aware of the "atrocities" happening in Singapore ? Why has there been no demonstrations against LHL and LKY when they go overseas ? Best thing is LKY get invited to talks, receive honorary degrees etc George Bush personally sign FTA with GCT...weird isn't it ?</div>
