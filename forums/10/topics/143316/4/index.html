Give us, the dimwits, your alternatives.</div></blockquote>Actually I think I can do a better job than the current PM. I also think we don't need the SM position and the MM position- because it's a waste of space, time and money.<br><br>A PM just needs a DPM or a Finance minister(who knows not just finance, but about other issues too) for help and knowledge when needed. For example, Tony Blair has Gordon Brown as back-up. Brown is smart, if not smarter than Blair.<br><br>When Bill Clinton was President, Al Gore was his back-up and was equally smart as Clinton.<br><br>Back to topic, I do think I can do a better job, in spite of my inexperience and for a cheaper price. No, you don't need to pay US$1.6m annually to me as PM. I will be happy with just US$100k per year- or even less than that.<br><br>And you still save US$1.5m annually if u hire me as PM.</div>

Give us, the dimwits, your alternatives.</div></blockquote>You call us dimwits just because we managed to counter your arguments? I'd say that's pretty pathetic on your part. If you lose an argument, then it wud be better to admit that you lost it. No point in calling people names- it just degrades your sense of maturity and how people view about u from now onwards.<br><br>And as for ministers' sky-high wages? I definately believe it's too high and bears too much of a burden to the taxpayers. In many other countries, it has been proved that public servants and govt ministers doesn't need to be paid US$1m onwards to be effective and efficient.<br><br>In fact, the opposite is always true- for two reasons.<br><br>1) Excessive money tends to tell people on both sides, two things: for the ordinary people, it means govt ministers, although how  <span style="font-style: italic;">inefficient</span> and how <span style="font-style: italic;">ineffective</span> he can be, he's still able to make a lot more money than those who only work for less than peanuts.<br><br>From the govt. ministers' point of view, they will view it as a god-given right to get high wages for the so little stuff that they do. Inevitably, some if not all will believe they deserve it so much that they don't even want to consider a wage cut in times of recession and depressions. High wages also encourages inefficiency and ineffectiveness because it will make them believe that as long as a govt. scheme has only 10% effectiveness, it's better than nothing and therefore they still deserve the high pay- which is quite untrue.<br><br>2) In public service, wages are always drawn on taxpayers' money annually, whether through direct income taxes or indirect taxes. Such as it is, it is different from the private sector- which the money comes from the spending of consumers, customers who either wants the product and/or the service.<br><br>So even though the taxpayers' money will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, the amount of cash the private sector can draw annually is still much, much higher than the public sector. For example, Microsoft is a company that has billions of dollars of financial turnover annually. It's governed by corporate laws and guidances. It's also a public limited company, so if Bill Gates get paid by the billions, he deserves it.<br><br>On the other hand, public servants- being a employee of the public(due to the fact the public actually pays his salary through their tax contributions) cannot and shouldn't draw an extremely stupidly high salary at the expense of the people who pays his salary through taxes. Public sector servants and ministers should never ever peg their salary to the private sector because public sector servants serve the public- they do not serve the <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">shareholders</span></strong>.<br><br>They are being paid a good reasonable salary to serve the public- and to run the adminstration on behalf of the people. So if you give the reason on why PAP should peg their salaries to the private sector, I tell you that it's a huge financial burden on the general public.<br><br>Already the PAP ministers have demonstrated time and time again that most of them are incomptence and ineffective. And yet they continue to draw huge amounts of wages, in spite of their rubbish performances over the last 3 to 5 years. That creates resentment among the ordinary people and that only increases the bad blood between the people and the govt. It also increases the rich-poor gap in Singapore directly and indirectly and it also can affect the performance of the economy in an indirect but obvious manner too.<br><br>So my view is this, in order to get the government to be effective again, in order to get it to be more efficient, to get it to reduce the tons of red tape that it has created itself for its own benefit, we must recognize that govt. ministers are being overpaid, overfed till the point they have become as lazy as Garfield.<br><br>In fact make that a whole lot of Garfields.<br><br>Govt. sky high salaries must be reduced to a point that is comparable to those in UK, US or Australia- or even lower as our country is smaller and population, also smaller. In addition, the size of government must be reduced and layers of red tape massively reduced. A smaller government with a smaller civil service can be more effective and efficient as it draws less money to run it and also it just makes everyone(who has survived the downsizing of govt and civil service) work harder as they need to cover more ground.</div>

Whilst you will tell them to be prudent and save for the rainy day, you will also in the same breadth encourage them to aim for the sky and take on the challenges of life.<br><br>For the young, buying a property should be viewed as one of the most exiting challenges in life. This is especially so in a city state like land-scarce Singapore where owning a property is viewed as a prize. Winning this prize should give them a sense of achievement and satisfaction, having to go through the trials and tribulations, the pain and agony, the tears and joy, and the fun and games to win it.<br><br>I notice that when the young people play computer games, they prefer the most challenging ones. They are so delighted when they win a Virtual Prize. But they are afraid to face the real challenging game of Life in Singapore. They want out.  Too competitive, they say. No confidence to win the Real Prize. They dive for cover because the game is too challenging for them. They indulge in negativism and pessimism to hide their fear for hardship and pain, pointing to greener pastures elsewhere.<br><br>Yes, there seems to be contradictions for example when you express the fear to your child that he might drown if he is allowed to swim but at the same time you send him to swimming lessons with the intention of allowing him to swim eventually. So there is no contradictions in the government's policies.<br><br>I appeal to the young people to face up to the challenges and put their  chests forward. The greener pastures which you dream of may not be that green when you arrive there.

            <div class='col-md body'>To be frank, Singapore needs to ride the China Dragon and America Eagle for a double engine growth for our future. But to do this, we have to know the US and China work differently. Our tradition singapore working model has been previously fine-tuned to american ways, are totally incomparable to China system. It is sometimes ironic to compare the success rate of singaporean company vs the ang mo MNCs in the China business deals.<br><br>We need to be more flexible. Mr Mah is right to liberate the terms and condition that regulate the property market. I am sure there will be critics to say this no good, that no good.

Lower end condo and 4/5 room HDB will see the biggest surge in demand, and property prices in that segment will go up. Price of smaller HDB will soften as existing owners will upgrade to bigger units.<br><br>I dont think there is any issue on the supply at the moment. Market has been very soft over the past 6 to 7 years and private developers with holding power have been quitely building up their land reserve and waiting for the right time to off load them. Since demand has picked up, developers will try to push up the price for new launches and make a gain out of it.<br><br>HDB on the other hand, has alot unsold 4 and 5 rooms HDB to off load and I am sure over the next few weeks, we will see alot of activities there.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I support Bros TwilightZone for his love for Sinagpore.<br><br>Singapore is at a cross road now. Our situation is totally different from 1958. In the 1950s, the Free World Capitalist and Red Communists are trying their best to westle Singapore into their camp. Our leaders made a wise choice of following a path that lead to free world, and we have ripped the fruit of success for the last 4 decades of extraordinary high GDP growth annulaised at about 8% growth per year.<br><br>Today, Singapore is at the cross road again. Now we face a very challenging task - how to compete in globalization?? Our think tank has came out with effective solution like working on high valued added industrial activities, knowledge economy and biomedical sector (IP very critical). These strageries are drawn upon our strengths and experiences from our years of experiences.<br><br>- we are small but flexible<br>- we are trustworth and obey IP laws<br>- we are hardworking<br><br>All these moves are very good, but all have their shortcomings.<br><br>1) A good bulk of our workforces are not fully prepared for the new booming industries. Retraining is not really effective for most of the workers. Employers would prefer to get young fresh and dynamic workforce at a lower price tag on the salary slips. Older workers could not compete with that type of lower salary because of their family burdens. Keep in mind that majority of the people had to pay for flats, transportation, electrical bills, medical bills. We can find that it is common that our copany medical benefits are dwindle.<br><br>New foreign talents are brought into Singapore, many attracted by high salary and benefits. These group of people has helped to jump start the new technologies &amp; banking sectors in many instances. But their arrival is critical for us to play catch up in R&amp;D and Finance sectors, but it also create some uneasiness amoung the local talents (elites) and workforce. People are worry that they might be replace.<br><br>Even if the local workforce begins to emulate the vietnamese hunger for knowledge as mentioned by SM Goh, we are willing to start for night schools for our part time degree courses, PGD, Master programmes. The local would still need to know:<br>a) what type of courses to attend?<br><br>b) is the courses affecting his work performance?<br><br>c) is the course expensive or company recognise this course?<br><br>d) a lot of degree holders wanted to take a master course and found that they are not able to meet the minimum requirment for these part time master courses. Should we treat education in a more gentle tone, and allow people who would want to learn new knowledge to have a chance at least to prove themselves? Or should we just allow elites only policy to continue in our education? I would prefer that every singaporean would be given a equal chance to upgrade, not only base on his A* only.<br><br>The recent effort by the gov to get the foreign talent into our local singapore social system is applausable. But we need to be careful in the minor details to intergrate these much needed people into our country, they really help to inject new elements and ways of life to our country. Their ideaology and values will help to refine our systems and culture.<br><br>2) Local R&amp;D effort are still behind the world reknown insitution in primary researches. We are focusing on application reserach for industrial applications. These has helped in certain extend in attracting oversea investment. But this is far from enough, if we want to attract the best companies and talents to settle / invest in sinagpore. We need to be orignal and it means we have dare to challenge ourselves for undertaking ground-breaking R&amp;D into advance sciences, to produce our Nobal prize winner. This is really critical for a small country, afterall, we are banking all our hopes on knowledge economy. Singapore needs to tell the world her role and capability that is unique to the world economy system, in order to survive the globalization onslaught. We can hide behind excuses that we are small and limited resources for our limited R&amp;D technological success. We must follow the model of other small countries like Sweden, Finland &amp; Denmark, are capable to produce scientists doing cutting-edge research in aerospace, medical and other sectors.<br><br>3) To be true, the small physcial size of the country and lack of resources has been a real constrainting factors for our devlopement. No matter how hard you work, you only have 24 hours a day and 1 pair of hands. Singaporean must learn to synerise with one another. But in truth, The never ending rat race to the top has transformed singaporean into very isolated, self-centred, negative and greedy (in some cases) people. The heavy burden on their backs and never ending + rising expectation has been fuelling the process for this ugly transformation. Sometimes, I wake up at night and still thinking why I am still lacking behind my classmates, friends and even sildings in this material chase. Am I a loser?<br><br>I think not. At least, I am still aware that a happy person is a satisfied man. Learn to love and cherish what you have.</div>
