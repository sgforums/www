Water never flows uphill even though it is extremely challenging. When water(river) meets an obstacle downhill, it meanders around it and continue its way. Some rivers either because of luck or because they didn't choose the right path, ends up as a lake. The ones who know their way, eventually make it to the ocean. Now, it depends on what is your ambition. Is it trying to flow uphill (Singapore) or empty into a lake or the ocean (Australia, US, whereever better)?<br><br>Another example. This time it is from my grandparents. They were not from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen or the big cities. They were rural farmers. If they were to stay in China in the 50s and aimed to be the best farmers... I think I will still be farming today or bet, I will be one of the millions of graduates fighting to get a living account in the big cities, earning RMB 1800. Life is indeed better in Singapore for me rather than I being a farmer's daughter. Why is life better? Because my grandparents believed that life in China won't be getting any better in their and their children lifetime and decided to make the switch to Singapore.<br><br>My gloomy prediction of Singapore future might be wrong. Singapore might really achieve US$50,000 per capital GDPand Singaporeans will only work 8 hrs a day in the future 50 years time. In that case, I only have myself to blame for making the decision to migrate. But we are in 2005 now, whether Singapore will prosper or whither, only time will tell.</div>

If so this seems to be a trait and a pass time even for those Adults - who were once young themselves - and yet Singapore is what it is TODAY, despite all the gripes; as all the gripes and pessimism is by itself a driving force to succeed against the odds that the Government has stacked against us - INCREASING our COST of Living, and TAKING AWAY our PERSONAL WEALTH with the big SOAK UP strategies from all the GLCs that provide all the essential services to Singaporeans.<br><br>"Greener pastures elsewhere" is not a sin, as even LKY has always dreamed about being in the FIRST WORLD, and GCT about the SWISS.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Yes, there seems to be contradictions for example when you express the fear to your child that he might drown if he is allowed to swim but at the same time you send him to swimming lessons with the intention of allowing him to swim eventually.

But I disagree that there is no contradiction in the government policy. This 90% loan and 5% cash down payment policy is basically targeting at those people from the average and low income family and these are the same group of people that run the highest risk of losing job if there is going to be another major recession.<br><br>As many here have already mentioned about the challenges ahead for singapore, therefore dont you think that it is important to establish a career for yourself before making the plunge into buying private property?<br><br>If you look at the way young couple are spending on their home, you will definitely agree with me that most have already over stretched their finances. Take for example, it is very common these days for young married couple to take up 50 to 100K renovation loan just to make their HDB look private, and this is on top of the housing mortgage take have already taken from the bank or CPF.<br><br>It is good to have dream, but I would rather think of how to make money first before thinking of spending it.<br><br></div>

A 1,700 sq. ft. Waterside Apartment was going at S$900,000!!!!)<br><br>COmapred to COst of Living at HDB Estates:<br>1970's: HDB open carpark was S$15 pm.<br>2004: HDB open carpark at S$75 pm???<br><br>That was after Dhanabalan's sppech in Parliament that HDB cannot afford to continue subsidising public amenities and conservancies services and should "price to the value of the actual land cost".<br>hence, the exponential increase in HDB carpark charges.<br><br>Toa Payoh Coffeeshop:<br>- 60's &amp; early 70's: F&amp;B drink: S$0.25.<br>= 2004: S$1.10......an increase of 4.4 times.<br><br>- a plate of hor fun or nasi padang: S$0.50<br>- 2004: S$3.50......an increase of 7 times.<br><br>Our Salary:<br>- 1971: Skilled Shipyard fitter - S$210 pm.<br>- 2004: Skilled foreigner worker - S$670 pm.<br>------- a salary increase of 3 to 4 times.<br><br>- 1971: Poly diploma holder - S$450.00<br>- 1971: Nantah graduate S$450 (police inspector)<br>- 2004: Poly diploma holder - S$1,200.00 to S$1,500.00<br>------- a salary increase of 2.67 to 3.3 times<br><br>- 1971: University of SIngapore graduate - S$900.00<br>- 2005: SMU graduate - S$2,200 to S$3,000????<br>------- a salary increase of 2.4 to 3.3 times.<br><br>Therefore, for an average SIngaporean families, with salary increase of average 2.4 to 3.3 times over a 30-year span,....and with "affordable" HDB flats ncreases by almose 10 times (3-room), how can you said we are better off as compared to those who benefitted the most in the early 80's?<br><br>When we talk about "affordable" public housing and subsidised level, on what basis and quantum level we are basing on?<br><br>The highly inflated land and housing pricing started in the early 80's?<br><br>Or the actual subsidised pricing level in the 60's and early 70's?<br><br>That is, basing on our salary increase, 3-room HDB flats should price at about S$23,400 to S$31,200 basing on the average 30-year span salary increase of 3 to 4 times, starting in 1971.<br><br>Then, I will bow my head to PM Lee Regime and said:<br>It is true. Public housing is heavily subsidised for the hoi polloi.<br><br>When launching this "Public Private Partnership", the private condo "price to sell" policies is cery telling to the future pricing level of this PPP Scheme.<br><br>That is, there is always a pricing differential of S$100,000 between "bigger" units built by HDB Corp and those by private developers.<br><br>It is based on the rationale you have to pay for "better private architect's design" to get away from the homogenuous "HDB look" and the perceived expectation that "private developers" meant "better quality" fitting-outs, furnishings and finishes.<br><br>By 2008, at the end of the 5-year moratorium at first refusal to "design and build" HDB housing estates, HDB Corp becomes a full-fledged "private developer".<br><br>Perish that thought as the differences between HDB Corp and "Private Developers" are best summed up by ol' Daisy at the conclusion of "Animal Farm":<br><br>- "Looking thru' the window with her old and blurred vision, she cannot distinguish the difference between pigs and men."<br></div>

Whilst you will tell them to be prudent and save for the rainy day, you will also in the same breadth encourage them to aim for the sky and take on the challenges of life.<br><br>For the young, buying a property should be viewed as one of the most exiting challenges in life. This is especially so in a city state like land-scarce Singapore where owning a property is viewed as a prize. Winning this prize should give them a sense of achievement and satisfaction, having to go through the trials and tribulations, the pain and agony, the tears and joy, and the fun and games to win it.<br><br>I notice that when the young people play computer games, they prefer the most challenging ones. They are so delighted when they win a Virtual Prize. But they are afraid to face the real challenging game of Life in Singapore. They want out.  Too competitive, they say. No confidence to win the Real Prize. They dive for cover because the game is too challenging for them. They indulge in negativism and pessimism to hide their fear for hardship and pain, pointing to greener pastures elsewhere.<br><br>Yes, there seems to be contradictions for example when you express the fear to your child that he might drown if he is allowed to swim but at the same time you send him to swimming lessons with the intention of allowing him to swim eventually. So there is no contradictions in the government's policies.<br><br>I appeal to the young people to face up to the challenges and put their  chests forward. The greener pastures which you dream of may not be that green when you arrive there. There is nothing like home where you are brought up and where you are with your own people.<br></div></blockquote>Everybody young or old got to face up to the challenges and put thier chest forward. I fully agree with what u say.<br><br>The question is are we fighting a war that dont concern us at all or are we fighting other peoples war blindly.<br><br>Lets take a look at the recent O level results, most foreign students from China top the class with many As and their parents always tell them to stay low profile as Singaporean students and parents dont like this to happen. These are reported in the newspaper recently.<br><br>I spoke to some local kids that is good in certain areas like art, music and some even into ornamental fish breeding. They say its no use to be good in what they do, the Chinese students score so many As, they will take up all the top and good jobs. I just dont understand what is meant by this. The only thing I know is that the current generation already into fighting other peoples's war. Have these local kids check with the top chinese students, can they play piano or violin well, can they breed ornamantal fish, ie put a pair of fishes together, let them lay eggs, hatch the eggs n later bring them up and go on and produce the next n subsequent generations, hopefully new strains of fishes can produce. Basically they r not focus n again they r into "things that dont make money, dont touch". Most of the local top students are seeing this FT as threats and they want to beat them and see them as targets. Something wrong with the system somewhere. Nowadays, eveywhere u go, u are sure to bump into these chinese and indians, so where can u hide, stay focus in what u do and excel in it. Establish your platform or create your own opportunity elsewhere if u cannot find a platform here.<br><br><strong>There is no trap at all. Dont trap yourselves in your pessimism and negativism. Ladies and Gentlement, prices will never be the same again in future, especially now that the HDB is bringing in private developers into the game.</strong><br><br>Now back to the property problem, u mentioned before from your previous threads that property price will never be the same again in future. If its like what u say, most probably a lot of people will start buying for fear of falling behind, knowing that most of us are holding a <strong>Temporary Permanent Job</strong>.<br><br>Stay focus, think carefully before u decide to fight the war. The choice is yours.</div>

This is very true as my parents bought their flats in 1988 for $60,000 and now it cost $200,000 for the same flat -&gt; a 3x price increase. Yet their salaries remained pretty stagnant since 1988. They are blue collar workers by the way and yet they managed to pay off the flat by end 1990s, raised 2 kids to university and bought some insurance. No cars. Do you think now it is possible even for university grad to pay off the flat within 15 years? Hardly right?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear Twlight Zone,<br><br>U dun seem to get the point. After even explaining a zillion times to you and pointing out fact after fact, you still don't seem to get it. It's like I'm getting this gut feeling that you either simply can't understand what are we talking about or that you are being ignorant.<br><br>My reply to you will be short, simple and sweet. And if you still demonstrate your 'ability' of being an egghead, then really you need to see more things and demonstrate more intelligence and maturity.<br><br>Here we go:<br><br>It's not a matter on how our parents lived in the 70s or whatever. In the 70s, things were cheap. Inflation wasn't so high and stuff wasn't so expensive. People could live within their means. Even a normal HDB flat wouldn't be so expensive that people needed to take out <span style="font-style: italic;"> excessive and unafforable</span> bank loans and bank mortgages to put down the deposit for the flat.<br><br>As long as people could live within their means, everyone was happy at that time to do so.<br><br>But now its different. Now people cannot even live within their means. They cannot even break even in terms of their family finances. More often than not, people spend more than they earn- and they don't spend it on luxurious items, they spend it on everyday stuff- like food in the food courts and hawker centre, clothes, raw, fresh and frozen food from the supermarket and wet markets. Prices have been going up faster than wages can ever do so.<br><br>So if families already have more liabilities than assets, should they go and spend some more money which they don't have at the first place? Owing one flat is one thing, but having little or no money is another. Worse still if you have outstanding bank loan repayments still.<br><br>And in case u didn't know, Singaporeans are already becoming 2nd class citizens. Chinese and Indian nationals are coming over and they are replacing Singaporeans in almost every single job. It's not that I'm against them from coming but I do understand that some of these 'talents' are actually not talented.<br><br>The preferential treatment of western expats in Singapore by the govt has also<br>gave locals bad feelings about westerners in general. You say we should be proud of Singapore and if anything, we should establish ourselves here before going overseas.<br><br>That's true- but only if you weren't born here. Americans are able to establish themselves in America because the society and govt gives them the freedom to do so. They are also respected by the govt and society. They are not 2nd class citizens in their own country.<br><br>Here, we are even below foreigners- whether chinese from China, Indians from India or expats from the usual suspect of western countries.</div>
