Our property prices are way below their true value. I just returned from Hong Kong. A 350 sq ft apartment (50-year lease) without a carpark space is going for HK$2,400,000 or about S$520,000. In the prime district, the same sized apartment is going for HK$6,000,000 or about S$1.300,000. They have to pay separately for a carpark. I visited 2 apartments and find that the kitchen has only standing space, the room is the size of our storeroom, and you can touch both walls with your outstreched hands. So we are really cheap for living in a prime city - for the moment. Our limited land space will guarantee sky high property prices in the future. So young men, dont miss out and lament to your children when you are 55 years old. </div></blockquote>I dont see how you can make money from investing in SG property if you have to take up to 90% loan and stretch it over 35 years.<br></div>

Maybe for property agent, but for first time home buyer or young couples, they will suffer.<br>The catch here is that the left over stock are all big units and many first time buyers just couldnt afford it.

We r already worry about loosing jobs to china, india etc. Increasing property prices here will only make u more difficulty to compete. The property prices should not increase any more. As can be seen the china garmen cool down their property in Beijing n Shanghai recently as most of their people cannot afford. So it will take even longer for them to catch up with us. That make us even more difficult to compete. Not forgetting china's 2nd line city like Jiangmen etc in Guangdong, their private property price is about RMB1500-2000/m2 or RMB200,000 (abt SGD$40,000) for 100m2. And also go further inland, the western part like Szezhuan, another big play ground for investors. BTW, they r not only into mass produce but also into Hi tech R&amp;D.<br><br>2. When property price here go up, newly start up entreprenuer will have problem. The commercial market may get affected. See how Hong Kong famous egg tart shop closed down due to recent property market price increase, as they cannot afford to pay for the rental. So, our job here already threatened n want to start business but restrict by high shop rental. U will be squeezed until nowhere to go n more people may be forced to start somewhere else cheaper. Better dont increase, u r killing yourself.<br><br>Dont have such a big head, dont put on such a big hat. Correct me if Im wrong.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend, the point is this: this is only a stimulus package to simulate a fading property market. If you try to simulate the market by increasing the options in a good booming economy, it's all very fine and dandy.<br><br>The point is, as I have stated it time and time again, is that Singaporeans are already one of the highest when comes to the amount of public debt- debts and liabilites that each person has in comparsion to his current assets and cash in the bank.<br><br>People don't earn enough to cover their expenses, their taxes and their bank loans and mortgages. So, now you increase the options- which mean they can borrow more. In the end, if u borrow more, you end up paying more interest. You also have to worry about the loan repayement itself.<br><br>It's a classic vicious financial cycle all again:<br><br>You realise you don't have enough money to buy a flat for your marriage--&gt; Then you realise that by using CPF and bank loans, you can set aside money to buy that flat--&gt; So you read all the forms that the banks and CPF board have gave you.--&gt; and even if you realise that the interest rate on the bank loan is higher than you expected, and by thinking that the CPF will take care of itself eventually, you decide you can manage. So you sign it.--&gt; First year of marriage, interest payments are high. You already have a son on the way. Your wife is 6 months pregnant. You are barely supporting the family- so your wife has to work.--&gt; For a while it works, but your wife is facing great difficulty, not just from going to and fro with a huge belly to work but also from the workplace, where family friendly policies are almost non-existent.<br><br><strong>2nd part</strong>:<br><br>In the end, her boss sacks her because she's going to have your baby. The compensation package is barely enough to last one or two months when the baby is due.--&gt; So you become the sole breadwinner. You will feel even more financially squeezed--&gt; the bank repayment statement comes--&gt; it's still $500 per month but as it is, the importance of that $500, which looked so small just a year ago, has a significant importance in the surivial of your small family.--&gt; In the end, you only pay $50 to $100 for the monthly interest. You have not repaid part of the loan because you cannot afford to. The bank will accept this but they know they now technically owe part of your flat.<br><br><strong>3rd part</strong>:<br><br>Expenses get higher as taxes on normal goods get higher. --&gt;Cars and vehicles are also becoming expensive due to increasing oil prices and COE. Normal income taxes are now applied to those low income and middle class incomes- hereby increasing the burden on the breadwinner, that's you. --&gt; In the end, in order to make ends meet, you either downsize the car or you sell your car and start using your father's car--&gt; The baby comes, and with it a huge, huge financial burden. You now cannot afford it. The interest payments from the bank is still coming, you aren't earning enough and the new taxes imposed by the PAP are starting to squeeze even the last few cents that you still have.<br><br>The economy is still sluggish and MNCs are still shunning Singapore--&gt; Overall, the Singapore economy cannot seem to flow properly because of obselete govt. economic policies--&gt; Inflation is also making things more expensive each year--&gt;Now your CPF monthly rate is cut again by the govt- which means your retirement pension which is to be used 20-30 years down the road- has an extremely low amount.--&gt;You know you cannot afford to retire with the present amount. And yet the CPF rate has been cut and so you cannot raise the amount in your CPF fast enough.<br><br>You acculmate debt- lots of it--&gt; And beside you, many of your friends also are going through the same thing.

You curse and swear and ask "why must this happen to you and your friends" to your God.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Now consider this scenario and read the last passage</span>:<br><br>Let me put it in this way: is it what you want?  If this scenario happens to the people who decided to gamble- even when they know they aren't exactly in good financial health- what will happen to the families who form the basis of this country? The country will also get affected because of this. If this is the scenario that happens 5-10 years down the road, then Singapore and its economy will be suffering hugely- and you, not the govt will be paying the results of the reckless policy thinking by MBT and the PAP now and in the future.[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the great post above.<br><br>I always say I want to migrate and encourage others to migrate. Now I want to share some economic reasons why ALL should migrate.<br><br>Look at Singapore. An island with about 700 km sq of land, absolutely no natural resources other than the deep harbour and may be a good strategic location.<br><br>How long will the advantage of deep harbour last? I think with today's technology, digging a deep harbour is easy feat. Tanjong Pelabus is just next door and what are they lacking? Efficiency. One day they will catch up with PSA for efficiency. If you are a business graduate, you will know that efficiency is not a long term competitive advantage (only Wal-Mart achieved any significant CA). One day our neighbour will wake up from their kampong ideas and work hard and efficient. On that day, I hope PSA will RIP.<br><br>I think good strategic location is fast becoming a fallacy. Jumbo jets are becomming bigger every year and they can skip Singapore if they want. Also same problem with the ports, if our neighbours picked up their acts, their airports can take away our Changi Airport business.<br><br>The very fact that Singaporeans are working longer and longer working hours is an indirect prove that the economic value of the harbor and strategic location resources is dwining. Singaporeans have to compensate by working 12, 14, 18 hrs. But there is only 24 hrs a day and how many more hours can we work? If our neighbours wake up their ideas and work the same hours. What else are we different or better than them? NOTHING.<br><br>Ever wonder why our closest neighbour with their relax-lah, kampong attitude can have the same standard of living as us and yet work only 8 hrs a day? It is because they have FREE natural resources like agriculture land, tourism areas, minerals, oil, etc. Look further away at Brunei, do you think they work harder there? Yet, everyone of them has a house and a car. Yes, it is all supported by oil.<br><br>The government talks about Swiss-Standard of Living. I agree with other forumites that it is never achievable. My reasoning is based on the above paragraph of Singapore has no FREE natural resources. Switzerland has timber and tourism (the Alps) as natural resources which Singapore don't have. In tourism, Switzerland earned about S$16 billion in 2003 compared to about S$10 billion of Singapore. Which is more fun? Sking or going to sentosa?<br><br>It was a pity that Christmas island was sold to Australia in 1958, else Christmas island will at least supply us with some free tourism resource and phosphate. The PAP came into power in 1959.<br><br>In a nutshell, I want to migrate to Australia because she has tons of FREE natural resources to support a truely Swiss standard of living.<br><br>Amen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its nice to see everything go up. But your boss will not like that to happen especially when talking abt your salary increment other than overheads like rental. See how the Port Authority tighten their belt u will know.<br><br>So when u buy property today, u wait for at least 30 mths b4 u can sell it. Everybody is buying n price, interest etc. go up. Your boss will start to worry how mI going to pay my guys as the cost of living go up. At the same time the cheaper neighbouring country also calling for investors. Your boss may get cheap deal like 2 or 3 persons to do your job at half or 70% of your salary n also cheaper rental else where. Very attractive, your boss decide to take the bite. As I previously mentioned abt the Hong Kong famous egg tart shop close down, if Im not wrong, it only takes them less than 6mths after the property recovery beginning of this year, they decide to close down. So for your boss may be 12 mths or 18 mths after u bought the property n starts to pull out. U will have to find another job at that time. Most probably the bosses of other competitor company also think alike n starts to pull out. It makes you more difficult to find job you previously done before. So u will have to force yourself to do anything that comes along the way(which the garmen had always encouraged us to do so), most likely at 1/2-2/3 of your previous salary drawn as beggers r not choosers. Now u have another 12 mths b4 u can sell your property, good luck to u. Hopefully property price is not dropping at that time, otherwise.....<br><br>Once again, its nice to see everything go up. To buy or not to buy property also decide by individuals. For those that never buy, they may also be one of the victims if the above scenario happens, die for nothing, N bottom 20% becomes bottom 50%.<br><br>Only buy it if u really really need it n get something that u are comfortable in paying.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I respect and appreciate whoever done to this nation in the pass. But times  and things changes now, e.g. last time got no internet but now have, got to live in today's days.<br><br>Its not about diving for cover or no confident or negative or pessimistic about the future.<br><br>1. Its about we r loosing competitiveness n thats a clear cut signal given to all SG people from top to bottom. Last time when our ancestors got nothing to eat back in home town and some forced to travel here looking for food n work, what do u call them? Negativism? Take cover?<br><br>2. Its about able to let everyone do what they feel they can do best and not affected by the economic worth of what the individual wants to do, ie things that dont earn money here, better dont touch. In short, just want to find a place that we can do what we like to do n can best perform and still able to put three meals on the dinner table. We SG people spend almost 12-16hrs/day related to work. 1st thing is to do what u like to do n enjoy talking the most, otherwise would be boring, boring n boring as complained by most SG people. The rest like bar-top dancing, IR, reverse bungee are secondary to me n they r more for attracting the tourist I feel.<br>In other bigger country, u can travel to other province to find what u want to do if the place u r borned dont require your expertise.  Here, if Pasir Ris cannot find, can we find it in Woodlands or Jurong? Im sure those that is out of job now, some may have this difficulty also. Its about INTEREST n PASSION into the job n this could be one of the reasons they do not want to anyhow take up  jobs that comes along the way. Even for those that r currently working, the psychiatry will ask u to pay them a small fee, so that they can counsel u as n when u need it. This is in the newspapers few months ago. Got job also feel stress, so dont blame those still looking for jobs, find out the real problem first. If we continue to be like this, it will be difficult for the country to react n deploy the manpower as the economy requirement change very fast. Its better to invest broadly into our country's people talent rather then telling them to forget about what they like to do if it dont earn money now n here, thats very obvious n can be seen in some of our parents here. U wont know when u need this talents. By the time u need this expert, u couldnt find here as u previously never nurture them or turn them down, u would have to turn to the so call foreign talent. Thats the problem that we face now and during the pass few years, as we r not able to steer our economy fast enough to meet the worlds requirement due to narrow choice of local business/work trade. Some of the above are the reports/views from those business experts I have read.<br><br>Just happen that u like n enjoy what u do now n still be able to find work n food here doesnt mean that your future generations can be that lucky. The problem will surface when they fall into the None of the Above category as u never know what they r thinking n what they want.<br><br>Now come back to the property problem. So if u think that the future is very bright here created by artificial ways, I presume that u also considered the cost of living will increase as well. If happen that way, those that want to create their own opportunity as there is a limited choice here to keep them alive, they will find it very difficult to start here. So dont blame people run far far to start somewhere else. In actual fact, they r POSITIVE enough to go thru the very hard way to find a foreign place that can accomodate them, we should salute them rather then laughing at them for taking cover.<br><br>Once u r not contributing, u become a liability. Or only contribute half-heartedly like zombies (as your interest lies somewhere else which cannot be fulfilled here or in your current job) also not healthy for the nation's economy. To prevent these from happening, better think early n in todays sentiment.<br><br>We r emphasizing on knowledge-based economy, pay more attention to peoples mental needs first, I guess.<br></div>
