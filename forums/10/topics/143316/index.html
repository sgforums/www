Instead of paying the downpayment, if you can invest that 5% elsewhere, where the returns are higher than the interest rates, then extra 0.x% u save on the interest rates will go a long way..<br><br>But nonetheless, responsibility should still be on the home owners to judge how they invest, and they should exercise prudence. The Gov is lowering the downpayment, doesn't mean that home owners MUST take it..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Government is telling u - time to buy. Our property prices are way below their true value. I just returned from Hong Kong. A 350 sq ft apartment (50-year lease) without a carpark space is going for HK$2,400,000 or about S$520,000. In the prime district, the same sized apartment is going for HK$6,000,000 or about S$1.300,000. They have to pay separately for a carpark. I visited 2 apartments and find that the kitchen has only standing space, the room is the size of our storeroom, and you can touch both walls with your outstreched hands. So we are really cheap for living in a prime city - for the moment. Our limited land space will guarantee sky high property prices in the future. So young men, dont miss out and lament to your children when you are 55 years old.</div>

But I'm not in a position to exploit other people's foolishness- because I'm not a property agent or someone from a big property development company.<br><br><strong>To above poster</strong>: Land and property prices here may be "cheap" as compared to HK but our prices are one of the pricest around ASEAN itself. Also most of the HDB flats' prices are already overinflated by the govt. While property market prices in HK are dictated by pure market demand and supply, the govt here has a huge say on how much a normal 3 room flat(on average) will cost for each Singaporean.<br><br>So in a way, when we compare the HK market wif ours, it's like comparing apples with oranges.<br><br>And here's an article from Financial Times.co.uk about the matter..<br><br><a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/44568da4-f8af-11d9-8fc8-00000e2511c8.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.ft.com/cms/s/44568da4-f8af-11d9-8fc8-00000e2511c8.html</a></div>

Better go stock up on my popcorns and see how many people go bankrupt in 2 years time. </strong><br><br>The Singapore index of property shares yesterday rose by 7.4 per cent its biggest gain since late 2001 while bank shares alsoperformed well on expec-tations of increased lending.<br><br>The measures appear to be intended to increasepurchases in public housing estates, where most Singaporeans own homes.<br><br>Cash downpayments will be cut to 10 per cent from20 per cent, with buyers allowed to use more of their state pension funds to buy property.<br><br>Foreigners can now buy any unit in an apartment block, except for upscale condominium units, instead of being limited to buildings that are six or more floors high. But restrictions remain on buying houses because of the small size of Singapore.<br><br>This is not the first time the government has intervened in Singapore's property market.<br><br>Property prices climbed sharply in the early 1990s before the government introduced restrictions to curb speculation, such as imposing heavy taxes on profits from units that were bought and quickly sold. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 further depressed the market.<br><br>The burden has fallen heaviest on those living in public housing estates.<br><br>The fall in property prices has meant that few have been willing to sell apartments that were bought during the property boom. Perversely, this has helped to create an oversupply of housing as new private apartments have been built to meet demand from new buyers.<br><br>Limits on allowing single people to buy public housing units and a falling birth rate have curbed demand.<br><br>Singapore has relied increasingly on foreigners to bolster the property market in recent years. Indonesians, worried about instability at home, have been among the biggest property buyers in recent years, accounting for up to 70 per cent of condominium units sold.<br><br>Singaporeans have been encouraged by the government to buy homes to produce a Â“stakeholderÂ” society. But since most of thepurchases have been partly financed by an individual's state pension, it has resulted in a population that is Â“asset rich but cash poorÂ”, according to economists.<br><br><strong>Note: Economists are not the smartest with their money. It should be liability rich and cash poor. Owning only 1 property which you have to live in is never an asset. Refer to Rich Dad Poor Dad.</strong><br><br>With the population aging, a pensions crisis could loom unless the government finds ways to revive property sales and enable owners to recover some of their investments.<br><br></div>
