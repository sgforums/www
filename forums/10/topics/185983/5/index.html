Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia<br>[/b]<br><br>SINGAPORE : "Staying Together, Moving Ahead" - that's the election slogan of Singapore's governing People's Action Party (PAP) for the coming polls.<br><br>Announcing this in the party's manifesto on Saturday, PAP Secretary General and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong left no doubt the nation's unity remains a top priority as Singapore forges ahead.<br><br>He called on the people to vote for the party that delivers and the team they can trust to realise the vision of a better life for all.<br><br>In his message in the manifesto, Mr Lee says when he became Prime Minister in 2004, he had promised to make Singapore a land of opportunity where everyone belongs.<br><br>But there are major challenges even as opportunities are opening up in the world.<br><br>He is concerned about less-skilled Singaporeans whose jobs and wages are under pressure - and also for older Singaporeans living on their own, and taking care of their own medical and daily expenses.<br><br>The Prime Minister says he was also troubled that a terrorist attack will sow suspicion and discord among Singaporeans.<br><br>He urged Singaporeans to respond boldly and creatively to opportunities and challenges.<br><br>He feels the young must be imbued with the same can-do, never-say-die Singapore spirit that has brought the nation where it is today.<br><br>So, while he is confident Singapore will move ahead, he says the people must also stay together.<br><br>This means even as each person strives for himself, all must care for one another.<br><br>As Prime Minister, Mr Lee says he will devote all his energy to this effort but he cannot succeed alone.<br><br>He needs the full support of the people and a strong team of Ministers and MPs to help him.<br><br>Hence his call to Singaporeans to give him and his team the strong mandate to:<br><br>* create opportunities for Singaporeans;<br>* give the young the best start;<br>* encourage every citizen to play a role;<br>* do more for lower income Singaporeans;<br>* help older Singaporeans to lead full and active lives; and<br>* provide affordable healthcare for all.<br><br>- CNA/de<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the 1st place, it would be stupid to think that a person could be single-handedly doing all the survey work alone himself... And hence argued that ONLY 40 people were interviewed is a childish act... Did the PAP did a 100% survey to ask ALL CITIZENS that they would have given the mandate to PAP? Not to mention that the election doesn't even reflect the nation's free will...<br><br>MM even openly admitted that he is not giving a 'fair' ground for the oppositions.. That could be GOOD for the future of Singapore...? Isn't UNFAIR PLAYINGs the GROUND of FRAUD PLAYs...? Is that also indirectly suggesting SUCH is ACCEPTED or perhaps even ENCOURAGED within Singapore...? And if that is so, is that also an indirect way form of encouraging CHAOs and CORRUPTIONs...?<br><br>Not giving Singapore more choices for ideas and diversions, and depriving Singaporeans of their rights (by unfairly depriving oppositions of their chance to go for elections) is for the GOOD of Singapore's future...?<br><br>There were also mentioned that there ain't bribery and corruptions within the gahment... 2 points to note...<br><br>1. Given the kind of salary they're drawing, might 'corruption' even be necessary...?<br><br>2. As mentioned, there're no checks on the gahment....<br><br>And despite the fact that there have been constant mentions of what the gahment have done for the people and what the oppositions have not done for the people... Not recognising the fact that the oppositions have been deprived of the fair chance to do good for their consitutents because the ruling party wishes to hold on to a strong gahment at the expense of the citizen's deserved priviledges...? Even if those people have not voted for them, I must say must fairly that they've also contributed to the wellness of the country....<br><br>If no opposition is given a fair play, and a possible chance of governing... HOw do we know they can't possibly be doing a better job...? We don't even do a compare... How do we even know that the ruling party is really 'good'...? Or a 'better' choice...? Not knowing so, what makes the ruling party thinks that voting would be 'meaningful'...?<br><br>The ASSUMPTION that if no one wants to come forward to vote for election means that they're HAPPY and SATISFIED...<br><br>So can we PRESUME that if a child does not talk to his / her parents or make complaints, then he / she is having a HAPPY LIFE...??<br><br>How can a gahment be checked and fair if not EXTERNAL (foreign) nor INTERNAL (local) parties can intervene and do enough questionings and 'diggings'...?<br><br>And there were constant mentions of "pls give evidence for what you say...." May I know how can there be 'evidence' when there is a system where no one can check on the gahment...?<br><br>Note also how MM tends to STOP a person's chance of speaking up even very much before they start... INDEED very TOPICAL of a LAWYER.....<br></div>
