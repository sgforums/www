            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Snow Leopard,<br>I am not too quick to directly linking a single party (the PAP) to destruction of a country. Suppose an opposition party wins this election and "completely wipe out" the PAP in the next and maintains a " complete stranglehold". Will that be good? Will you then champion the PAP? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I sincerely apologies if I belittle anyone in the post, it was not meant to be. I merely want to draw a distinction between having fun and doing something serious. Posting in this forum is fun, chosing a leader is serious.<br><br>I like again, to state my point, that save a few, opposition parties' candidates have no track record (at least the ones that show face so far). In my opinion, as an underdog, opposition candidates should have started preparing the ground for this election as far as five years ago. Never mind if he has no CEO post, he should build up grassroots work and champion those who cannot fight for themselves. Bring good to the needy and be examplary in conduct. Then, stand next to a PAP candidate during this election and win.<br><br>Side track hor.... i think bringing up minister salaries and high cost of living is a lost cause. We have one of the highest standards of living, a low rate of cost increase and a bunch of damn good ministers. If Winston Churchill is alive today and we can pay to employ him, I would say, use the reserves. Money can only buy so much..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

I agree that oppositions need not be there to replace the ruling party, but somehow the gap cannot be too gap between the ruling party and the oppositions... And we need an adequate 'force' around so that things could be questioned and stay in check... Not just to watch a 'fight' as MM has suggested... We could very well be watching 'fights' elsewhere...</div>

One of the GRC MPs at AMK with a big party came to my door, and I warmly shook his hands, and after that the plain cloth police officer  hand me a crime prevention flyer as an excuse asking for my telephone numbers. I check with my neighbours and none were asked for their telephone numbers!<br>I am never afraid of going to court, police station or jail or wahtever but just asking would you have any courage to stand against all these liars in the garmen?<br><br>goto see<a href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Political_white_lie" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Political_white_lie</a><br><br><a href="http://This%20is%20an%20election%20to%20speak%20out%20and%20stand%20for%20the%20people's%20right!" rel="nofollow">This is an election to speak out and stand for the people's right!</a><br>The next general election will be years away!
