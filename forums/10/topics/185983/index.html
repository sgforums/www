            <div class='col-md body'>the group of youngsters are much better than the usual rigged interviews...now we know who's never going to be an editor with the straits times....<br><br>some earlier questions did stump lky, some replies were lame while those he couldn't get away, he tried to do technicals like how many? you spoke to all? and scare tactics. when asked why need 5 or 6 man grc, i didn't understand what he was mumbling about populations shifts...shift so what, you can still have 3 man grc....<br><br>at the end, the programme tried to show the softer side of things...typical..<br><br>given the aggression level, i think that's why no other pap folks dared to come out and face the real singaporeans..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(as posted in reply to Lee Dynasty at Feedback Unit on 12.4.2006)<br><br>I think MM Lee did achieve great deeds for Singapore up to the 1970s.<br><br>After 1970s, he had tried to improve and upgrade the economy and did not quite make it.<br><br>Today, due to his persistent autocratic rule, he was not able to motivate and mobilise the masses or create social or economic vibrancy to take Singapore higher to reach the Swiss standards which was promised.<br><br>The costs of living went up but the wages of masses dropped since the 1980s. If not for the fact that the world finally recovered strongly in 2005. MM Lee today would not even be able to claim anything.<br><br>Now he is essentially relying on external circumstances to reassert some old shine which was already diminishing as compared with other Asian tigers.<br><br>On his lecturing the young voters in the TV forum over CNA tonight, he had failed to answer many questions such as why was the costs of living going up while the wages of masses are dropping and why is the government still double-charging and triple-charging on fees and expenses which were already paid by the people by taxation.<br><br>No matter how MM Lee explains it, his GRC gerrymandering is most undesirable and will not benefit Singapore or lead to its ongoing progress.<br><br>One-man-one-vote system allows the best individuals to come forward to stand for election with no hindrance whatsoever.<br><br>Racial balance could easily be conceived through party manifesto, leadership ability and a host of other measures including good incentive scheme such as reserving of certain top ministerial posts for such minority candidates.<br><br>With GRC, the individual best candidates will be decimated and checked as many of them will be hindered by the obstacle of having to convince fellow minority candidates to stand together with him which reduces our chance of finding or empowering the best candidates to serve.<br><br>MM Lee was stumped when asked why he must increase the size of GRC which clearly showed that he was unable to justify it except for perpetuating his party's interest at the expense of one-man-one-vote which serves the best interest of the nation.<br><br>MM Lee also did not explain well why he needs so much controls since PAP was not in danger of losing. He was not convincing in trying to say that he needs to consider the interest of the minority who will have problem in getting voted in by the majority-Chinese voters.<br><br>When he was told that in earlier elections, a number of minority PAP candidates did get in, he said that that was when PAP was still strongly supported by the people.<br><br>Therefore MM Lee by his own admission has revealed that GRC has been conceived to boost the PAP at that time when PAP was losing support.<br><br>Conclusion: MM Lee could not answer the problems created by his past policies which were not working.<br><br>He could not answer to the journalists' question on why he needs GRC which was not good for the country but only for PAP's own interest.<br><br>Singaporeans will have to rethink the GRC and seek their own answers to all these unanswered questions avoided in this forum.<br><br>Singaporeans should not be led by rhetorics or argumentations but should ceaselessly seek objective and original answers to issues of life and jobs which is what politics is all about (MM Lee parting shot). To do so, they must return to the one-man-one-vote election system and rebut the one-man-one-block group voting which prevents best people from coming forward to serve.<br><br></div>
