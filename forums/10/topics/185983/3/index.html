            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ecxentrique:</div><div class="quote_body">i think lets face it.. no one in PAP or any single party govt is going to make concessions by making level playing field for the opposition..<br><br>i think all the more it falls on us, the voters, to make that field more equal.<br><br></div></blockquote>I agree. MM Lee has made it very clear that there is no such thing as level playing field. So people have been wasting time for years to reason and reason with a mind that has long decided not to listen or level the playing field for the good of the country.<br><br>It is useless to reason with someone who only wants to control and control and never give up right or wrong, in the interest of people or not.<br><br>What these young journalists said to me make sense but although they are right and their views are in the interest of all citizens and Singapore will progress with changes made to past control-based system, they have no way to argue with someone who will keep denying their good views with "take me in election if you can", "beat me in my GRC if you can", as there will be no level playing field to anyone as long as he is in charge.<br><br>Journalists are right in saying that PAP needs not be paranoid about enlarging GRCs or have more control over the blogs or internet but MM Lee just dismissed their points preferring to laugh it off. His reason to set up the GRC to provide for seats for the minority or enlarge it to test the capability of opposition does not hold water. He did not appear to be able to bear scrutiny by the journalist on his GRC rationale. This is blatantly untrue there must be GRC to ensure minority will be represented as there are many other more acceptable ways for fair representations even better than NMP schemes. Proportional representation can be introduced to grant minority candidate receiving the highest votes to come in without cornering the whole election system to serve the ruling party's control of the whole election process.<br><br>MM Lee has considered everything on his party and his own interest and not the overall interests of citizens or a more level playing field - as simple as that.<br><br>It looks like there is no point having debates or rationale discussions with MM Lee for he had made up his mind he would not accept good views or proactive views to solve our current problems.<br><br>He is only concerned with winning the cornered elections. He is going to win and win and win and he knows that no body is going to stop him from practising the GRC grip on the electorate.<br><br>In Singapore, politics is not about right any more but about who is in control of the electorate and election process legally and legalistically done to outsmart all.<br><br>To the journalise I will say this: there is no point trying to put up any views or suggestions on how to improve or upgrade the country. Nothing is going to change as long as MM Lee is of this frame of mind - take me on if you can.</div>

I think this interaction with the LKY thingy just shows one thing, the alternative medias and more liberal, independent thinking youngsters are becoming more of a threat to the incubent.

I think all this is to create an overall impression that the govt is opening up, and more willingly to accept ideas.
