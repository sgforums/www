            <div class='col-md body'>Has it occured to anyone that all of a sudden we have Mr. LKY on television taking on questions from journalist in a 'no holds barred debate'. i dont recall him or any of his Ministers taking on questions on a weekly basis from members of the public in front of cameras before. In other words we pay Mr LKY more than a million dollars a year to help market the PAP and its policies, during elections time. I guess the leadership knows that there are many burning questions among singapreans that have been swept under the carpet. LKY has lost touch with the generation for sure based on his answers. He keeps playing the violin that Singapore will sink without the Lee family or the PAP in power.<br><br>At the moment I cant help laughing to see how on the nightly news we have Ministers walking around and cameras pointing at all their silly littles moves, smiles and rubbing shoulders with the Uncles and Aunties. Its so hypocritical.<br><br>Someone should have asked Mr. LKY directly how does it justify having all the juicy appointments in the cabinet controlled by his family members?? Is he saying that there is nobody else in Singapore intelligent enough to run Temasek, The Ministry of Finance, GIC chairmanships, Singtel etc.?<br><br>i bet you the elections will be held immediately in the days after the cash is handed out on the Progress Package on May 1.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These are just reflex answers. and if these are the 'best' we can get, downfall is imminent. Just hate it when some must hang on so long...till kingdom cum? Time's up for past legacy to dictate the future. Its no longer about the commies and cold war. Authoritarian management will not solve the complex problems of globalization,  terrorism, rich/poor class etc. and 800 bucks certainly won't shut people's mouth for good. Well, doesn't matter if the opposition are not 'up to the mark'; but the relish of a good (bad) choice one can make rather than no choice!<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by dariusmean:<br><strong>What an interesting exchange indeed. The journalists fielded some quality questions.<br>But of course, like most shows on local politics, we never really got the answers to the questions, did we? There was talk about the past  and the success and the past and the success and the pastÂ…. (did anyone count the number of times 1950s was mentioned when a question about [b]current  politics </strong>was posed?).  Instead, we took away some interesting insights<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Mr Lee, people are afraid of voting against the PAP, soÂ…..<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: (interrupting) Are you afraid to vote against the PAP?<br><strong>Darius</strong>: No lah, why would I be afraid? After all, if I do not vote for the PAP, my estate will not be upgraded. My Town Council will be last in queue for the funds and like Potong PasirÂ’s residents; IÂ’ll just wait for more than a decade for any housing upgrading. Aiyah, nothing much what.<br><br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Do you think that my son needs me to tell him what to do?  Do I need to whisper in his ear and tell him how to answer? (Reads: I am not pulling the strings from behind)<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Oh yeah? I guess someone else said this like 15 mins ago huh? Â“There are things that I can do, and the Prime Minister and Senior Minister know it, that NO ONE else can do. They all know that.Â”<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Why do we need GRCs around?<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Because there are innate, visceral biases those are natural...... Because when you run out of curry, you go next door.<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Eh hellow, you forgot that Chinese voters voted for JBJ when he won Anson? And Anson wasnÂ’t exactly your upp-tty class estate to begin with. Heartlanders voted for an Indian. Oh waitÂ…Â… didnÂ’t Rajaratnam also get voted in so many times before the GRC came into place? Or was that because he spoke Hokkien??? HummmphhhÂ….<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: If voter turnout was 30%, would you see that as people being a political?<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: No I would see that to mean that people are satisfied and happy with their lives.<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Wait a secÂ…Â…. Apolitical = Happy &amp; satisfied people?<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: So if only 30% voted, would you still see that as a mandate?<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Yes of course I would see it as a mandate.<br><strong>Darius</strong>:  Heya Big Daddy, 30% of the people voted and you got in because they love you Â– Wow, thatÂ’s POPULAR MANDATE indeed. You legitimate son.<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Mr Lee there isnÂ’t an equal playing field for the opposition, so how canÂ….<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: (interrupting) Does any government help the opposition to install itself? No!<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Uh-oh, so there is an Unequal playing fieldÂ…..<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Taking the scenario that only 30% have voted, what if there is no one voting, would there still be a mandate<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Yes! I remind you, that I have not been contested for 3 elections. That is because the opposition know that they cannot displace me.<br>Darius: You know what is scenario or not? Scenario got you meh?<br><br>Well folks, we sure did get our answers<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</blockquote></div>

That's okay, entertainment value and so on, it's a young generation they want issues to be connected. So as outsiders you look at it and laugh, its entertainment value. But the moment Singaporeans start making jokes, things which are not true about MM, PM Lee or about myself are you sure you are doing something right?<br><br>Mr Khaw says politicians who're honest and serious about their responsibilities, should be treated with respect and not ridicule.<br><br>Yes once in a while you want some excitement but at the end of the day you have to go back to how do bring food to the table, do my kids continue to remain uneducated? Then how do you fight the competition? In a modern world today if you have uneducated and low skills, then how do you compete? There're hundreds and millions of such people in China and India waiting to come up.<br><br>Mr Khaw says ensuring Singapore's continued prosperity should be a joint effort between the government and the people.<br><br>He likened the cooperation to the way everyone here worked together to battle SARS.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(as posted in reply to Lai CF at <a href="http://www.findsingapore.net/forum" rel="nofollow">www.findsingapore.net/forum</a> on 14.4.2006)<br><br>This is as to be expected. Everything GCT has done was to follow MM Lee wishes. GCT's opening up and relaxation of some of the past controls was a moderation of some sort that saved MM Lee from his heaviest criticism of his iron rule for some years. The warming of seat by GCT has resuscitated MM Lee who now sort recovered and now made a real comeback.<br><br>Therefore as to be expected, every move to open up will be temporary and for show. From Feedback Unit to TV dialogue with Ministers and MM Lee all are not real but are part of the control freak and are stage-managed. If you read our past posts to Feedback Unit, sufficient complaints with facts and arguments have been presented to the ministers and yet after a few years nothing much has changed.<br><br>The common saying is the leopard never changes its spots so after his resuscitation by GCT intervening seat warming stand-in the real MM Lee comes back in the same way and utter the same old past policies without change. Whatever GCT has done is now being reversed and folded back and controls are now increased.<br><br>His mind seems to work like this : "I am legitimately elected being through political baptism of fire and no one has the right to talk equal with me". "The newspapers cannot set agenda". "I will debunk anyone for disagreeing with what I am doing"<br><br>This is the concepts of his government. So no matter what people have said or suggested and whatever problems have been fed back he will not admit them as problems and he would explain them away until and unless bigger forces from outside stop him like the Souzhou or PSA/SIA got internationally exposed as stupid acts of inefficiencies and cut too deep into his scheme of desisting argumentations.<br><br>Even the MPs have no right to question his IR decision for he himself wants to decide. His strong rhetoric not to grant level playing field stems from the same legalistic mindset that as founding father and elected leader he is going to create unlevel to stay in control and no body will have the standis to question his doing and arrogance because people cannot do anything as he was elected and nothing can change that fact.<br><br>His conceptualisation is based on power that he has received and he intends to use that power legalistically to the fullest and charging all fees and HDB prices to the fullest market prices even if there are some flaws here and there. His view that GRC is good to perpetuate control has given him much pleasure as he has the whole electorate under his mercy and no body can change that.<br><br>Under such circumstance, the citizens are totally cornered and controlled and no one can save the situation. He will put increase his own or ministers' salaries as he likes, he would put Singaporeans monies in any foreign or Shin Corp investments he likes, because to him he is popularly elected even under GRC walkover. Such legalistic power play is unique in modern history as it is totally unaccountable to parliament and the electorate. He could even revoke citizenships or change the voting system to one-man-two-votes for his preferred citizen groups if he likes. GRC is considered a concession to date. He could always do more than GRCs may be by declaring the country as a Temasek Republic. The blog and internet is giving too much views to be of help so one day Sedition may be redefined so as to stop people from being too free with their views.<br><br>Right or wrong, accountable or not is not important as there is nothing anyone can do to stop him from what he is doing. The journalists do not understand his control-oriented mind and always seems to ask unnecessary questions which do not worry him at all as he will reply that "if you are not happy, you can displace me if you like" This may be called legalistic hitlerism in my other post.<br></div>
