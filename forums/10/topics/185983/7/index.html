Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia<br>[/b]<br><br>SINGAPORE : "Staying Together, Moving Ahead" - that's the election slogan of Singapore's governing People's Action Party (PAP) for the coming polls.<br><br>Announcing this in the party's manifesto on Saturday, PAP Secretary General and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong left no doubt the nation's unity remains a top priority as Singapore forges ahead.<br><br>He called on the people to vote for the party that delivers and the team they can trust to realise the vision of a better life for all.<br><br>In his message in the manifesto, Mr Lee says when he became Prime Minister in 2004, he had promised to make Singapore a land of opportunity where everyone belongs.<br><br>But there are major challenges even as opportunities are opening up in the world.<br><br>He is concerned about less-skilled Singaporeans whose jobs and wages are under pressure - and also for older Singaporeans living on their own, and taking care of their own medical and daily expenses.<br><br>The Prime Minister says he was also troubled that a terrorist attack will sow suspicion and discord among Singaporeans.<br><br>He urged Singaporeans to respond boldly and creatively to opportunities and challenges.<br><br>He feels the young must be imbued with the same can-do, never-say-die Singapore spirit that has brought the nation where it is today.<br><br>So, while he is confident Singapore will move ahead, he says the people must also stay together.<br><br>This means even as each person strives for himself, all must care for one another.<br><br>As Prime Minister, Mr Lee says he will devote all his energy to this effort but he cannot succeed alone.<br><br>He needs the full support of the people and a strong team of Ministers and MPs to help him.<br><br>Hence his call to Singaporeans to give him and his team the strong mandate to:<br><br>* create opportunities for Singaporeans;<br>* give the young the best start;<br>* encourage every citizen to play a role;<br>* do more for lower income Singaporeans;<br>* help older Singaporeans to lead full and active lives; and<br>* provide affordable healthcare for all.<br><br>- CNA/de<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>HAHA, their "manifesto" looks more like election advertising...

It is natural human nature to live next to people of the same skin colour, same ethnic group, speak the same dialect etc. But the downside is it eventually degrades into hotspots for trouble and more racial segregation. The moment we start living within our own race, we tend to lose focus with the goals of racial acceptance and become less tolerant of other races and their culture. So in this aspect, i agree with Lee Senior that the current controls should remain.<br><br>His haughty retort of the WP's plan to abolish grassroots is understandable. While he will never admit it, grassroots is definitely a key area where the ruling party recruits potential candidates for elections and young PAP. In this regard, the grassroots committees are therefore NOT apolitical, as the ruling party continually maintains. WP sees it as a 'barrier to entry' for them to work efficiently in their town councils; on the other hand, WP is unlikely to replace it with a neutral committee and chances of it being politically-aligned are just as high.<br><br>On his remarks regarding the issue of fear and how he took Ken Kwek apart during his cross-examination, he is obviously stating his position: if you can't prove it, shut up.<br><br>The aura of induced fear is clearly evident, mostly in part due to the threat of high-handed defamation suits by any who are deemed to have crossed the OB markers of the govt (Catherine Lim nearly found herself in one but her articulate nature and non-confrontational style got her off),  but at the same time near-impossible to 'prove' with any hard evidence.<br><br>The manner and conduct of polling stations is one example.<br><br>And his bold assumption regarding 60% confirmed support is based on a stagnant population content with his past achievements and not the current team. He needs to put his confidence (or overconfidence) into perspective.</div>
