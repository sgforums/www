            <div class='col-md body'>What an interesting exchange indeed. The journalists fielded some quality questions.<br>But of course, like most shows on local politics, we never really got the answers to the questions, did we? There was talk about the past  and the success and the past and the success and the pastÂ…. (did anyone count the number of times 1950s was mentioned when a question about <strong>current  politics </strong>was posed?).  Instead, we took away some interesting insights<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Mr Lee, people are afraid of voting against the PAP, soÂ…..<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: (interrupting) Are you afraid to vote against the PAP?<br><strong>Darius</strong>: No lah, why would I be afraid? After all, if I do not vote for the PAP, my estate will not be upgraded. My Town Council will be last in queue for the funds and like Potong PasirÂ’s residents; IÂ’ll just wait for more than a decade for any housing upgrading. Aiyah, nothing much what.<br><br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Do you think that my son needs me to tell him what to do?  Do I need to whisper in his ear and tell him how to answer? (Reads: I am not pulling the strings from behind)<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Oh yeah? I guess someone else said this like 15 mins ago huh? Â“There are things that I can do, and the Prime Minister and Senior Minister know it, that NO ONE else can do. They all know that.Â”<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Why do we need GRCs around?<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Because there are innate, visceral biases those are natural...... Because when you run out of curry, you go next door.<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Eh hellow, you forgot that Chinese voters voted for JBJ when he won Anson? And Anson wasnÂ’t exactly your upp-tty class estate to begin with. Heartlanders voted for an Indian. Oh waitÂ…Â… didnÂ’t Rajaratnam also get voted in so many times before the GRC came into place? Or was that because he spoke Hokkien??? HummmphhhÂ….<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: If voter turnout was 30%, would you see that as people being a political?<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: No I would see that to mean that people are satisfied and happy with their lives.<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Wait a secÂ…Â…. Apolitical = Happy &amp; satisfied people?<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: So if only 30% voted, would you still see that as a mandate?<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Yes of course I would see it as a mandate.<br><strong>Darius</strong>:  Heya Big Daddy, 30% of the people voted and you got in because they love you Â– Wow, thatÂ’s POPULAR MANDATE indeed. You legitimate son.<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Mr Lee there isnÂ’t an equal playing field for the opposition, so how canÂ….<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: (interrupting) Does any government help the opposition to install itself? No!<br><strong>Darius</strong>: Uh-oh, so there is an Unequal playing fieldÂ…..<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: Taking the scenario that only 30% have voted, what if there is no one voting, would there still be a mandate<br><strong>MM Lee</strong>: Yes! I remind you, that I have not been contested for 3 elections. That is because the opposition know that they cannot displace me.<br>Darius: You know what is scenario or not? Scenario got you meh?<br><br>Well folks, we sure did get our answers<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shit man, missed the CNA show. Will watch the repeat on Fri night.<br><br>Reading all your threads was addictive! It just sprung to mind one thought - "Who do the civil servants vote for?"<br><br>I spoke to this SAF regular friend a few weeks back. He stays in Hougang and I asked him who he would vote for. His instinctive reply was PAP, "otherwise he would be traced and penalised" (in other words, no renewal of 2nd contract).<br><br>I met up with another SAF regular friend just last week and he also gave the same reply. So from then on, I figured that it's the same for every other govt linked organisation or stat board.<br><br><strong>Any one has any comments??</strong><br><br>LKY has once said that "he makes no apologies for the state of the opposition parties today" and another fella (forgot who) has mentioned that if there was "strong opposition in parliament, PAP would not have been able to press on forthrightly with many of its policies".<br><br>Are we really a great country today? There are lots of Mercedes, BMWs and Lexus cars on our roads today. Most people have nice homes and big houses etc but the truth is EVERYONE IS IN DEBT.<br><br>A huge percentage of our population working in the lower rung eg. lorry drivers, mechanics, production operators, cleaners etc, this group earns about $1k - $1.2K on average. With a family to feed, how to survive?<br><br>What about fresh grads from Polytechnics (another huge chunk in our population)? Today's poly grads have become the O'Level grads of yesteryears. Their starting pay is about $1.3k - $1.8k on average. After deducting their personal expenses and contributions to parents, very little is left. How to even set up a family of their own in a few years time?<br><br>The rich get richer and the poor remain poor, not to mention that expenses rise all the time.<br><br>All that news reports on Singapore achieving high GDP growth quarter after quarter makes me wonder.<br><br><strong>Any one any comments?</strong></div>

Infact, I'm surprised that most of them are journalist, and their command of english is questionable, and they are not steady and not tough standing enough.<br><br>2) At somewhere in the beginning, when MM was asked about public being afraid to vote ( something to that effect ). MM actually retorted forcefully to that journalist, where he got his figures, Did he got their names ?, Did he interview 100 interview by himself, He then said 120 in all, but he interviewed 40. Then MM says that his a lawyer, and he more or less is sensitive to this in nature.<br><br>WTF, this to me is this Intimidation (not so different from how the opposition parties are subjected to). This group of not so young professional are obviously not lawyers and they are just speaking out of general view of things AKA.. man-in-the-street talk. And this the very thing the focus group are trying to get MM to understand what they are asking further down the programme. In fact, If this were the case, won't opposition better need to be a lawyer. ( I'm not questioning the antics of other opposition who made false and damaging remarks) But this focus group are not the opposition. In fact, If this group are indeed articulate, MM would have a hell to a discussion on his hands. because later, the "getting rid of opposition parties" came up ?<br><br>2) When the worst articulate girl asked MM why is the PAP arrogant, MM replied if it was so.. they won't be having this discussion. Which is really moot, because obviously this programme was planned and approved by PAP, for what ever reasons. A programme of such nature does not pop up from nowhere, nor were it a request by this focus group. I mean would everyday people simply walk up to MM and asked " why are you so arrogant". Mind you MM is a very Articulate personality and is a man of power, No one in his right mind (at least in Singapore) would want to answer and risked being stuck in a mud, and then asked himself "what have I got myself into" (see point two... the lawyer thing).<br><br>As someone said earlier, not much was answered. At least not the really important once and most are not unexpected. BTW, I am really disappointed with the focus group, at their age in comparisions to western countries, I worried, I mean they are in a very professional line - Journalism for god sake. Suddenly, I'm now certain that we do need more foreign talents. What a damper...<br><br>cheers</div>

After the meeting, he said to them " I  had expected sharper knife...." He had also handled a one to one interview with this Sapphire guy from the New York Times, and he handled well.<br><br>To journalists, his famous words to me were this "you don't bring your rules to play game on my ground, you want to play games on my ground, follow my rules." I don't think FT stand better chance, especially if they make their money here.<br><br>LKY is an old hand in this kind of game. Our young journalists have done well. Not enough, but ok. They just need to learn from this, so that in the next GE, if they have the chance, having the same dialogue with LHL, i expect to see sharper knives. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Son PM and Minister of Finance, wife CEO of Temasek, DAD chairman of GIC, PM vice chairman of GIC, other son runs SingTel. All juicy appointments in family control. Where are the check and balances here exactly? Everyone else can hold the lower level portfolios in the government.
