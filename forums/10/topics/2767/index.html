            <div class='col-md body'>Heh heh, to be precise, I think you guys got the ISA and the ISD mixed up a little. The ISA gives the ISD its power. The ISD does the dirty work. The ISA itself is neutral. But over the years since it was drafted, the ISA has been re-drafted many times, with each re-drafting giving it more and more power. To the point that the ISD is little more than the government's private thugs, enpowered by an radically souped-up ISA.<br><br>Originally the ISA was not such a drastic act. It was drafted to protect Singapore from internal subversion. That's it. Now, if you go up to the Speaker's Corner and say something that the government doesn't like to hear, or infringe by a feather any of the rules and regulations regarding its use, you're being questioned by the police (who knows, they could be ISD), and perhaps even monitored by the ISD, you wouldn't know. Why? In the name of internal security. Be a somebody, and say something against any of the ministers, oh yeah, you're smearing their impecabble reputations, you're a liar, you're trying to create unrest and racial disharmony, you're disturbing the nation's peace, you're trying to destroy Singapore! Under the ISA, you're doing all that! And you must be eliminated!<br><br>Extreme paranoia does bad things to a person. What about a group of people ruling a nation? You get an entire nation scared of each other. Oh don't worry, the ISD's not going to come get me or anyone else here for that matter. We're nobodies, and we're just blowing hot air. Mindless coffeeshop chatter. Nope, no one's planning a coup at the moment. But if I were a somebody, trust me, it would come as no surprise when my door gets knocked on in the middle of the night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The truth is::::: every country on this fucking piece of blue ball has an ISD in one form or the other.<br><br>in some nations, such 'ISD's are even portrayed as the nations guardians or protectors of the weak and the oppressed, some are even believed to be the defender of democracy, freedom and peace like the FBI or NBI of certain nation!!<br><br>Others are even accredited with defending the nation's sovereignity by hunting down enemy spys that seeks to destroy the nation either through covert actions or sabotage like CIA, MI5 and KGB.<br><br>usually, the bigger a nation, the bigger their ISD tends to be, some nations even have more then 1 ISD department like USA, Russia and China.<br><br>while there are some which are less reputable, being linked to KKN and dictorship and suppression of blah blah blah.<br><br>BUT the truth is that every nation if not most nation has an ISD and needs an ISD, and their powers are usually wide and powerful in order for them to carry out their jobs.<br><br>some of these organization are well known, like the CIA, KGB, MI5 mentioned above just to name afew. They arent just simply concern with spying for your information. but regularly tap phones, keep tags on all politicians and the local media and blah blah blah......<br><br>at least in singapore, we know we have an ISD, in other nations, they probably exist in the form of shadows.<br><br>In singapore, if someone is arrested under ISD, the govt would need to explain to the peopel why such drastic actions is needed just like when america CIA arrested the amos couple for being traitor.<br><br>In other nations, that someone would probably simply disappear into thin air or died of a most unfortunate 'accident'.<br><br>But the reality is, such organization is indispensable. but like all organization, it can be abused just like any ministry or any department if the political leader of the nation is evil bent.<br><br>so the existance of ISD is just as normal as the existance of the various govt department and statutory boards. just that some people like to paint it in a less reputable light.<br><br>SO while, some 'human right' and opposition figurehead humbugs from america, singapore or 'developed' nations puke on singapore's ISD. tell them that i too would like to puke on their CIA,KGB and whatever PUKE PUKE organization they have.<br><br>even in a small small company and even in big families, there are informants, backstabber, 2 face snakes and sabouteurs..... so, such organizations are probably part and parcel of human society.<br><br>I wont be surprised that WP and SDP and whatever other political party in singapore or elsewhere might have an internal ISD as well.<br><br>so...... why be bother about it.....?? non of us is holy.</div>

ISA isnt simply a political tool... for your information. there are quite afew of ISA agents on our side who are currently held under malaysian ISA... what is chia thye poh compare to all these agents of ours who risk their life for the rest of us?<br><br>And just to add a bit more info for you.. our ISA got a few malaysians languishing in it for spying on us... though i have no love for spies.... i must respect their courage and their sense of duty to lay down all they have for the country... either malaysian or singaporeans...spies<br><br>CHia thye poh on the other hand is little more then a sucker who got free food and lodging at the taxpayers expense... maybe the govt should have made him work for his food long time ago instead of wasting good money on a stupid man who cant see beyong his eye lashes, his heart is narrower then a thread and his mind is obsess with hate and anger... such people dont deserve to be held under ISA... they should be thrown into the sanitorium, lock behind bars with straight jacket and throw away the fucking key.<br></div>

BUT when the axe come chopping down....<br><br>tell me.... if u are the allie commander... would you openly blame and declare the german people as fully responsible for the plight of the jews??? or wont it be easier to blame just one man and be done with it??<br><br>BUT sincerely.... how many jews did hitler killed with his own hands???<br><br>In singapore.... we the people of singapore voted the govt into office... if you wanna blame someone about the ISA... then you should be blaming us... the voters... who by our combine votes gave the govt this authority... and has continue to do so for the last 31 years.....<br><br>For your information... ISA is a 2 edge sword... it cuts those who faced the charge... but it also cuts into the popularity of the govt... so if there is widespread discrimination... then i have little doubt that the govt would be voted out.</div>
