              <p>Japanese help Chinese to be respected</p>
              <p>The Essence of Chinese Frailty<br>BY : Ken Nagasawa</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>Ladies and Gentleman , My intention to compose the following essays has nothing to do with belittle the Chinese people . I have detect a phenomenon that the Chinese people has been a sourpuss around the world , no one respect Chinese people as a whole , in my opinion , it is not an accident but subjective and rational result due to Chinese Frailty . I am here to reveal and study these flaws existed among the Chinese psyche , my purpose for this study is driven by sheer conscience . I hope my work will be helpful for the Chinese to find cure for their frailty , thus improving themselves . It is my conviction , that , the Chinese frailty syndrome can be healed . The human soul are pliable , all the medicine which Chinese really need is a courageous mindset to accept the truth and a dose of remedy for their deficiency on the moral high ground . I will try the hardest I can to precisely making those flaw to transpire , there are no virulency in the process , everything revealed here are subjective reality according to my observation .<br>Firstly. I have to make it clear that , the Chinese today . By their mentality and culture , have nothing to do with the ancient Chinese . The ancient Chinese way of life and spirit is dead in China long time ago . Today’s Chinese have absolutely nothing to resemble their ancestor in terms of ability and character . It will be gruesome mistake to affiliate them with the ancient Chinese . The reality is that , the modern Chinese has no recollection and understanding of the spirit from their ancestors , everything they had known is fathomed from their imagination and guessing , by which had nothing to do with the truth . Thus , I am here to safely busted a delusion which the Chinese had insisted to enforcing upon the foreigner and themselves , the truth is that , the modern Chinese has nothing to do with ancient civilisation of China .</p>
              <p>The Chinese people are highly egoistic , they are the worst type of self-serving people . The very nature of Chinese is subsumed with selfish and callousness . The notion of altruistic is incomprehensible to the Chinese people , to the marrow of their bones , Chinese are avarice and extremely selfish . Chinese inclined to take advantage of others , and unwilling to share anything they possess . This reality and truth had determined that the Chinese are incapable to create a society with moral standards of philanthropy where people in misfortune can be looked after with . Chinese are callous and cruel , by which they devoid of a soul of being sympathica . The rampant and insatiable lust for pursuing gold but disregard others well being has rendered the Chinese society with full of wrongs and injustices . Thus , as an result , no trust can be fostered among Chinese society . Chinese people ‘s suspicious nature has rendered them not to trust anybody except their close kin . Almost every so called Chinese enterprise are family business . What’s really hateful is that the Chinese are making every attempt to instil this execrable depravity into the minds and hearts of young Chinese ,by which it had murdered many vivacious soul. when a Chinese youth who appear innocent and pure , the Chinese will mock at him as being immature or cretin. The Chinese notion of maturity means oily , oleaginous , callous , selfish , full of wiles , avarice and dishonesty , any Chinese youth whose penchant are opposite to those quality will be automatically viewed as immature or stupid . Chinese society is a system of a reverse process of washing out , the people who are dignified will be washed out , the impotent and sneaky type will be lionized . This is the reality of Chinese and Chinese society , and this is the main cause of Chinese frailty . No dignified culture and people can be cultivated within China or among Chinese . This is a sad reality , this is worth for the Chinese people to ponder for question and solution to this ignominious truth . It is my wish that the Chinese people can find cure , however , as to be cured , one has to courageously admit their aliment , if the symptom is denied by the patient , then I guess even the most seasoned doctor and finest remedy will not be helpful .</p>

              <p><br>the chinese should also look at themselves before denying what other people tells us.other people see more clearly how we behave. i understand catknight point of view. long gone are the spirit of the ancient chinese. now its all about power and money hungry men on top. its time for chinese to look at themselves not how much they look like westerners or how good they look with that LV bag.</p>
              <p>but being self serving has also been an age old tradition in china(and everywhere). also look at the sharp contrast with the szechuan quake incident.(nvm the frauds and cheats that flourished).</p>
              <p>china wants to be mordern,wants to be a world power. but they will end up losing their roots if they do not firts stop and reflect.</p>
