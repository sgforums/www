            <div class='col-md body'>Board firm against early CPF withdrawal<br><br>About 400 were turned down in the last 2 years. CPF Board says those in financial difficulty can get help from CDCs, MOM<br><br>By Leong Pik Yin<br><br>THE rules are clear, but many still try their luck each year.<br><br>Former oil rig engineer Shahid Hussein, who has not been able to find full-time work for eight years, is among about 400 people who have written to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board over the past two years appealing for the early withdrawal of their CPF money - and been turned down.<br><br>UNCHANGED:<br>CPF INTEREST RATES<br>INTEREST rates for funds held by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board will stay unchanged between April 1 and June 30.<br><br>A board statement on Friday said 2.5 per cent will be paid for funds in the Ordinary Account and 4 per cent for deposits in the Medisave, Special and Retirement accounts.<br><br>The rate is higher than the average 0.59 per cent offered by the three big local banks here - DBS, OCBC and United Overseas Bank.<br><br>The CPF Act provides for a minimum CPF interest rate of 2.5 per cent per annum.<br><br>The concessionary interest rate for Housing Board mortgage loans, which is pegged at 0.1 percentage point above the CPF interest rate for the Ordinary Account, will therefore remain unchanged at 2.6 per cent per annum during the same period.<br><br>The rates, reviewed quarterly, will be revised again on July 1.<br><br>The 51-year-old gets by, earning $40 a day when he works as a security guard but the employment is ad hoc.<br><br>The board was not moved by his request to withdraw the $200,000 in his CPF account four years early, despite his circumstances.<br><br>'It's been hard for me to get another job because of my age,' said Mr Shahid, who used to earn $4,200 a month as an engineer, excluding extra bonuses when working offshore on oil rigs.<br><br>'The only reason I've been able to get by is because I'm single and I live in my brother's flat.'<br><br>To add to his woes, he also owes about $5,000 in taxes.<br><br>'I'm totally broke. Why can't I be allowed to take out some of my CPF savings in bad times? It's my hard-earned money.'<br><br>This is the second time Mr Shahid had tried appealing to the CPF Board. He was rejected the first time, a few years ago.<br><br>Last year, he turned to his MPs, Dr Michael Lim and Rear-Admiral Teo Chee Hean, for help. Both wrote to the board on his behalf, to no avail.<br><br>Members are allowed to withdraw their CPF savings only when they reach 55, or under special circumstances, such as physical or mental incapacitation.<br><br>A CPF Board spokesman said that other premature withdrawals are disallowed 'as they go against the primary objective of CPF', which is to help members have enough savings for 'retirement, housing and health-care needs'.<br><br>She added that those who request early CPF withdrawals represent just a 'tiny fraction' of the three million CPF members here.<br><br>While the board understands that some may be facing financial difficulties in this economic climate, the CPF 'must stay focused on these core purposes', she said, pointing out that they could seek financial assistance from community development councils, or get help on employment opportunities from the Manpower Ministry.<br><br>Still, to those like Mr Shahid, saving for the future makes little sense when the present seems so dire.<br><br>'I don't feel I should go around and beg for financial help when I've got $200,000 sitting in my CPF account,' he said.<br><br>MPs, like Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland Bukit-Panjang GRC), have received their fair share of such pleas for help.<br><br>'I can understand their urge to take out the money. They feel they can't even survive the present, why talk about the future?' said Dr Teo, who received about five such appeals for help last year.<br><br>'But I don't think it's advisable to use up CPF savings. You never know what kind of needs you may have when you're older.<br><br>'I think the key is to find them a job as quickly as possible. Or, if they're unable to work, we can give them financial assistance.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the opening post, it is simply disingenuous for the MPs Â– (let alone a Minister rank too) - from the Ruling Party to simply write to the CPF Board, and then shrug the shoulders and say: Â“I tried, but the Board will not change their rulesÂ”.<br><br>Those rules were set by the Government a.k.a. the Ruling Party, and those Civil Servants in the CPF Board merely follow guidelines set by the Government.<br><br>One can understand the frustrations of the 51 year old Engineer Â– retrenched at this age and unable to find new employment, having to compete in a tight job market and facing competition with younger and as well-educated (but inexperienced) new entrants into the Workforce.<br><br>The 51 year old Engineer could have utilized A PORTION (50% ?) of his $200,000 CPF savings to set up a new business, and would have created job opportunities for others.<br><br>Yet the short sighted and tight fisted Government will on the one hand encourage entrepreneurship, while on the other hand refused to allow such an environment to succeed.<br><br>This reluctance to allow CPF holders the full access to the individualÂ’s CPF Account had been growing stronger with each review of CPF Policies.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">When CPF was first introduced, it was ruled that any Singapore Citizen with CPF Account will be able to withdraw the full amount on reaching the age of 55 years</span>.</strong><br><br>Following the <strong>Howe Commission </strong>in early-1980s, it was recommended that the <strong>withdrawal age should be delayed till age 60 </strong>.<br><br>Following public outcry, and murmurings that the Government could not return all that is due to CPF Account Holders, this proposal was put into cold storage; but the idea was modified and new ideas came up to withhold portions of the CPF from being paid out on demand.<br><br>Brilliant ideas came about that will permanently hold portions of the CPF Â– such as Medisave, MediShield, and the Minimum Sum, all of which require minimum sums to be held that can result in a SUM TOTAL of $80,000 being retained per account.<br><br>With a CPF contributing population of more then 2,000,000 Singaporeans, this will result in an immediate freezing of $160 Billion into CPF, giving more time for the Government to Â‘useÂ’ our funds at an interest rate lower than that charged by banks.<br><br>That part of the post that claimed CPF payment of 2.5% interest per annum is higher than that paid by Banks is a BIG JOKE.<br><br>CPF has NEVER paid higher interest to CPF Savings than that paid by Commercial Banks, which was stated to be paying 0.59% by the three big local banks Â– but FAILED to confirm if the 0.59% is paid MONTHLY on Fixed Deposits (depending on the Fixed Deposit amount and the period of saving).<br><br>The 0.59% paid monthly will amount to 7.08% PER ANNUM, compared to 2.5% p.a. paid by CPF.<br><br>With the shrinking birth rate that is experienced since the success of the Â‘STOP-AT-2Â’ Family Planning Program, so aggressively promoted during the early 1960s, the situation has reach a point of crisis Â– TODAY - for Singapore; and more so for CPF.<br><br>The current CPF status of account holders is shaped like an inverted PYRAMID Â– with the widest part of the Pyramid being place NOT sitting on its wide bottom, but placed UP-SIDE DOWN.<br><br>In the present year 2004, the WIDEST of the Pyramid will represent the larger numbers of Singaporeans, now aged 55 to 65 and are or soon will be drawing on the CPF - as they were born between 1939 to 1949.<br><br>Those born in the years between 1950 to 1960, will soon also be drawing on their CPF Accounts as each year pass through 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 till 2010.<br><br>Where will the incoming funds be coming from - so as to support the CPF withdrawals of this large number of 'baby boomers between 1939 to 1960s, who will now begin to be retiring CPF Account Holders ?<br><br>From 1961 to 1971, the Family Planning Program began to kick in, and the birth rate began to shrink; with the kids born during this period entering the workforce between 1981 and 1991.<br><br>With the passing of each year, there are fewer kids entering the labor pool to contribute their CPF to provide more funds to generate CASH RETURNS to pay back to those large numbers retiring.<br><br>What has happened to the money of those large numbers of workers Â– born between 1939 and 1949 - AND contributing to the CPF; and also those large number of workers born between 1950 to 1960 ?<br><br>The CPF is a cheap source of funding to the Government for all the Government Expenditures in infrastructure developments in Singapore Â– the roads, highways, land reclamation, HDB, Paya Lebar Airport, Changi Airport, and other Fixed Assets.<br><br>Can the CPF Board sell these Fixed Assets and convert to Cash for the CPF Account Holders ?<br><br>Can the CPF earn enough from the loans that it dispenses to the Government, by buying long term Government Bonds ?<br><br>It is OBVIOUS that the Government has to generate revenue or PROFIT, so as to be able to pay back to the CPF Board.<br><br>The revenue generated by the Government will come from Taxes - direct and indirect; and will need to have these Revenue to be managed in Growth Funds, so as to generate more profit to be returned to the CPF Board for the Principal Sum borrowed and the Interest Rate payable.<br><br>Although it has been constantly denied, it is hard to believe that the GIC do not manage funds held by the CPF, so as to allow it to achieve a higher rate of return - AND COMPENSATE for the SMALLER NUMBER of CPF Contributors from a SHRINKING WORKING POPULATION, as a result of the declining Birth Rate.<br><br>The only alternative available to the Government is to:<br><br>1.	Delay the pay back date Â– extend the withdrawal date from 55 years to 60 years<br>2.	Create more sub-accounts Â– so as to freeze more CPF funds from being paid out; hence the brilliant schemes of MediSave, MediShield, Minimum Retention Sum.<br>3.	Create self-management of the funds allowing investments in approved but High Risks Speculative Investments that SUPPORT the Financial Institutions.<br>4.	Freeze a portion of the CPF Account to be disbursed monthly till death.<br><br>The THIRD Approach is ingenious, as it<br>Firstly - provides incentives for Foreign Fund Managers to set up base in Singapore, and help to increase Singapore's profile in the Financial World;<br><br>Secondly, if there are any losses suffered at the hands of the inexperienced CPF Account Holders, the CPF Board will need not pay out the amount loss, but the Account Holder will have to make good the amount loss at any later date when profits are made;<br><br>Thirdly, should the Account Holder be successful in his investment decisions, the CPF will stand to gain with additional funds being returned to the Account.<br><br>It is a No-Lose Situation for the CPF Board, as the CPF Account Holder carry the full risks for his own money.<br><br>It would have been more believable of the Government good intention, if it had allowed the CPF Account Holder to take a portion of his CPF Savings to start a business venture Â– at least he is speculating in a business that he understand, instead of speculating on the stocks of other companies listed in the Stock Exchange.<br><br>It would have been more helpful if this approach was available to experience managers, who are retrenched, and they would have been able to start small businesses that would have helped to create jobs in a high jobless environment.<br><br>It would have been more sincere of the Government in their statements of looking after Singaporeans Â– and not the GovernmentÂ’s own interests Â– if they had allowed the Account Holder to use a portion of the funds to improve the education level of the Account Holder, or the Account Holder's children.<br><br>Does the CPF serve us as much as it serves the Government ?<br><br></div>
