              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I know who will win. dont you?</p>
              <p>1st Malaysia Opposition has won.</p>
              <p>Now?</p>
              <p>Will KMT the OPPOSITION, win as well?</p>
              <p>Is this the beginning of an era for OPPOSITIONS?</p>
              <p>i know but i cannot tell you as I am also called a Neutralist.  ;)</p>
              <p>comments on CNA coverage:</p>
              <p>1. initial impression  : unsatisfactory . Here's why - digital video and voice signals could not be recieved clearly but poorly. This is such a basic service quality that is not up to scratch. I urge the authorities to put in more effort as sgpore's reputation is at stake. The world is watching. Not just the other issue, if you know what the... i mean.</p>
              <p>Before the telecast, did they not test? I expect better.</p>
              <p>they should use satellite in this day and age for clearer image and not using low resolution, low quality media to cover such important 'live' events.</p>
              <p>I was almost about to switch off the tele and just fly there to watch for myself and be my own reporter where I provide UNBIASED, HONEST, and TRANSPARENT coverage. even tho I am a novice. its not difficult.</p>

              <p>....exactly like what our govt has said....but it's immaterial if DPP or KMT wins. The Taiwanese has won because it's not about democratic election only, it's a democratic nation.</p>

              <p>indeed TW is the most democratic country in Asia. no doubt about that.</p>
              <p>many countries are decades behind them in this respect ;)</p>
              <p>one thing i like about TW democracy : the people who supported one party need not wait a decade for change.  this is also why i think TW is great.</p>
              <p>also, Ma promised no preferential treatment for KMT regions over DPP regions.</p>

              <p>Taiwanese can be proud of themselves and walk talk for they are showing to the rest of the world what democracy is all about. It is about the right of citizens to take charge and change government by peaceful means. It is about citizens' right to censor government through peaceful means and particularly to prevent any accumulation of power by anyone in power.</p>
              <p>In this sense the Taiwanese are more advanced in thinking than us Singaporeans. Every citizens must be able to voice their unhappiness with any wrongful government and make them take actions for the interest of the people.</p>
              <p>In this way Taiwan will be able to avoid falling into the hand of any tyrants that at the end they assure themselves of justice, equity and fair play and not hypocrisy, propaganda and underhand and abuses which are far worse than corruptions itself.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans can celebrate this event in that it also means that Singaporeans who are happy with change brought by democracy at work in Taiwan is also the same change they want when necessary and when the time comes without fear or favor.</p>
              <p>Our TV and newspapers keep playing up footages to make a mockery of Taiwan people participating in democratic processes to protect the narrow interest of our power that be. This success in democratic change of government once again give us another opportunity to remind all citizens that Singapore belongs to all of us Singaporeans and when it is necessary they can change government and do the same without being subjected to undue pressure or hypocrisy by power that be.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Ma will win by a big margin. He will steer Taiwan away from the dangerous path of pro-indepence and concentrate on the prosperity and progress of the country. I agree our past media coverage keep concentrating on the fight scenes in their parliament. At least CNA now discuss some of the issues at hand but still pale in comparison to those TW channels as mentioned above.

              A convincing victory by Ma:
              http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/world/asia/22cnd-taiwan.html?hp
               
              By KEITH BRADSHER
              Published: March 22, 2008
              TAIPEI, Taiwan â€” Taiwan elected on Saturday its first president who had campaigned for closer economic relations with Beijing, paving the way for a considerable lessening of tensions in one of Asiaâ€™s oldest flashpoints.
              
              Ma Ying-jeou, a Harvard-educated lawyer and former Taipei mayor from the Nationalist Party, won by a convincing margin. He prevailed despite a last-minute effort by his opponent, Frank Hsieh of the Democratic Progressive Party, to warn that the Chinese crackdown in Tibet represented a warning of what could also happen to Taiwan if it did not stand up to Beijing.
              
              With all votes counted, Mr. Ma prevailed 58.45 percent to 41.55 percent and Mr. Hsieh quickly conceded defeat. Clear skies and warm weather until early evening helped produce a heavy voter turnout of 75.7 percent,which tends to help Nationalist candidates, like Mr. Ma.
              
              Both partiesâ€™ polls showed an increasingly close race in the final days of campaigning, in contrast with the last polls by media organizations nearly two weeks ago, which showed Mr. Ma ahead by 20 percent. But in election day interviews, voters echoed Mr. Maâ€™s stance that closer relations with the mainland and its fast-growing economy represent the islandâ€™s best hope of returning to the rapid economic growth it enjoyed until the late 1990s.
              
              Jason Lin, a 41-year-old interior designer, said as he left a polling place in Taipei that he had always voted for the Democratic Progressive Party until this year and remains a member of the party. But he crossed party lines to vote for Mr. Ma on Saturday because he was convinced that Taiwanâ€™s economic survival depended on closer ties.
              
              â€œIf we donâ€™t get into Chinaâ€™s market, we are locked into our own country,â€� he said.
              
              Beijing officials have been wooing the Nationalists for years, even hosting visits to the mainland over the past three years by those party leaders who are especially eager for eventual political reunification with the mainland, like Lien Chan, the partyâ€™s unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2004.
              
              Mr. Ma has taken a more cautious approach to the mainland, attending annual vigils for those killed during the Tiananmen Square killings in Beijing in 1989 and denouncing the mainlandâ€™s repression of the Falun Gong spiritual movement over the past decade. During the campaign, he ruled out any discussion of political reunification while calling for the introduction of direct, regularly scheduled flights to Shanghai and Beijing and an end to Taiwanâ€™s extensive limits on its companiesâ€™ ability to invest on the mainland.
              
              Chinese government officials had no immediate response to the election results on Saturday evening, but had made little secret of their hope that he would win.
              
              â€œChina has a love-hate relationship with Ma â€” when I visited China last November, they criticized Ma a lot, and then asked me to vote for Ma,â€� said Yen Chen-Shen, a political scientist at National Chengchi University.
              
              American officials have been deeply frustrated with President Chen Shui-bian, also of the Democratic Progressive Party, and have sought to lessen tensions between Taiwan and the mainland while preserving the political status quo. But the Bush administration has also been irritated by the reluctance of Nationalists in the legislature to vote for purchases of American weapon systems, including systems that President Bush offered for sale in 2001 but which Taiwan still has not purchased.
              
              Many in Taiwan have preferred to spend money on social programs while relying on the United States military to deter aggression by the mainland, prompting bitter jokes among American military personnel that if mainland military forces ever land on Taiwan, the Taiwanese will fight them to the last American.
              
              Cheng Ta-chen, a Nationalist aide to Mr. Ma on security policy, said that the Nationalists had not been given enough information by President Chen to understand and approve military purchases.
              
              Following his inauguration, scheduled for May 20, Mr. Ma will have almost complete political power to pursue his agenda. His party and two tiny affiliated parties together took three-quarters of the legislature in January elections. Nationalists also serve as the magistrates, a position akin to mayor, in 15 of Taiwanâ€™s 25 largest cities.
              
              The extent of Nationalist control made some voters nervous on Saturday.
              
              Two controversial referendums, calling for Taiwan to apply for membership in the United Nations, also fell well short of passage. 
              
              Taiwan's referendum law requires a majority of eligible voters to vote on a referendum for it to be valid. Nationalists called for voters not to cast ballots for either initiative and slightly less than 36 percent of eligible voters did so. 
              
              With China strongly opposed to United Nations membership for Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province, the island's recent efforts to win membership have failed completely. The United States and China had both denounced as provocative the referendum sponsored by the Democratic Progressive Party, which specifically called for the island to apply as Taiwan and not using its legal name, the Republic of China. 
              
              The legal name reflects the principle that Taiwan and the mainland still form one China. 
              
              Taiwan's economy grew 5.7 percent last year, but middle-class and working-class incomes have stagnated as an affluent elite has grown prosperous, often from investments on the mainland. 
              
              Much of the islandâ€™s manufacturing industry has shifted to the mainland and hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese, have moved to the mainland to manage these operations. The bulk of these are men aged 25 to 45, leaving a dearth of skills and entrepreneurial energy in Taiwan itself.
