They just reject without giving reason and they just oppose simply to oppose. Actually tat is a smart policy. U oppose the current leader, they cannot do anything and it make them look bad. And when they look bad u have a higher chance of winning the next election. The only way changes can be made is when the country have a strong showing in the election</p></div>

              <p>Cool win for Ma Ying-jeou and KMT.</p>
              <p>i was in taipei 2 weeks back and stumbled into one of their night rallies while loitering. one of their eager supporters handed me a flag and a cap and ushered me in to the rally area. i stayed for 15mins, didn't wait to hear ma speaks but the speakers prior were as fiery. the speeches were punctuated with, "if you agree, wave your flags", etc. etc. Then all will wave the flags in unison. I partake in that as well. it was a lot of fun for a neutral audience. but i make sure i wave my flag in fervour. it was also interesting as well because in between the speeches, there were song and dance.</p>
              <p>the KMT cap is here on my home study on my desk and i put up the flag here as well. overall, a short nice experience of attending a taiwanese rally.</p>
              <p>unfortunately, most of the audience were older folks. the younger taiwanese are more concerned about keeping up with the latest pop culture from japan.</p>

              yalor... thats why the govt should actually relax the rules on holding a protest. like increase the numbers allowed in a protest (maybe to 30) and loosen the application criteria (so anyone can apply).<br><br>
              The protestors should however, state the scale of the protest they'd anticipated, so as to allow the police to set up proper measures for public safety concerns.

              <p>There will be need for police presence at every protest to prevent it from turning into a riot. What if there are multiple protests? Who's going to pay for the additional police manpower required?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it may be possible to confine outdoor protests to a defined area e.g. Speaker's Corner provided that a cap be placed on the number of participants that can be safely accommodated within the area. It must not disrupt traffic and a reasonable charge be levied on the organizers to pay for the additional cost of policing.</p>

              <p>Anyway, in a way the people ask for it to be controlled.    I still meet many who just are so "goody" to obey the PAP.   These people are hopelessly blind and immature politically.    I suppose these people don't mind that they are deprived of democracy.</p>

              <p>KMT has lost to the opposition for 8 years.    They are appreciative and happy that the people have given them the opportunity to be back in power again.   As mentioned by KMT, they will not want to disappoint the people of Taiwan.   Ma did make it clear that Taiwan is different from Singapore as Taiwan is democratic.   I believe even if he said about the corruption free gahmen in Singapore does not mean that he is going to adopt whatever crap from PAP which will not benefit the taiwanese.   KMT stated they have to be careful in whatever they implement, the way they run the country.    If you watch the Taiwan news, you can tell the great differences between KMT and the evil PAP.  I believe Ma will not be so stupid to implement crap which cause negative effect from PAP to incur the wrath of the Taiwan people who voted for him.    KMT treasures the people of Taiwan but PAP do not treasure the people of Singapore.   PAP only treasures the oppportunities of sucking more and more money from us.</p>
