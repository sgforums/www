              <p><br>And I don't think the oppostion can run the country better than the PAP either. A sad state for the politics of singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While we need a stronger opposition, we need a opposition that can do a better job than the ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you think the KMT was relected into power? It is because the KMT can convince people that they can manage the country better than the DPP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can a opposition party in singapore do that? I don't think so. Those guliable people in singapore are sensible in a sense that bread and butter issue like the economy needs to be the first issue to tackle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no closer links between the government and people other than economy. Economy is the basic principle of being able to manage a country well. A democratic country is USELESS if the people can't feed or afford a good standard of living.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at africa, a few of them are a democratic country, yet it is hardly a safe or nice country for most people to live in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a clear line between a greater opposition voice, and having the oppositon being able to led the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If people is like some of the members here, thinking that econmical woes are not that important as compared to a more free or liberal singapore, then singapore is in a worst state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taiwan has told us that we should not elect a oppostion into power for the sake of democracy, it told us that what is needed is a opposition that can threaten the ruling party control, and force them to do and perform better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We NEED a opposition that can do a better job than the PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Democracy works if the ruling party can perform well enough, improve people's standard of living. Hence singapore is still enjoying the benefit of democracy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But that alone isn't enough, it needs a opposition to threaten  the ruling power's position so that the ruling party will need to know what is in the interest of singaporeans. Hence the opposition needs to understand it NEEDS to do a better job than the PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While PAP needs to know that a democratic country requires more opposition to work, the opposition needs to know that they need to run a country better than the previous ruling party. If they cannot do so, they are letting the people down.</p>
              <p>BOTH the PAP and the opposition party in singapore have yet to meet the basic principle of democracy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps when a opposition finally prove that they can be better than PAP in managing of singapore's economy, then that will be the day when singapore experience true democracy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And some people are not even democratic at all in taiwan. There is one DPP politician who said that people who voted for the KMT isn't taiwanese, and she is abandoning taiwan.</p>
              <p>Another pan green celeb said that those overseas taiwanese who come back and vote isn't human.</p>
              <p>How is that democratic at all?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans who are pro-opposition, STOP looking at the surface of the world's politics. Just because some other country is more democratic than singapore does NOT mean they are a perfect example to follow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The same as the US, the US is perfectly willingly to side with saddam as long he is pro-US, when he isn't, the US will try and spread democracy and depose him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevermind if Iraq is worse off under occupation because spreading democracy is SOOOO right. Even the US has lots of politics that is just as dirty as the singapore politics.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>The Gini coefficient of different sets of people cannot be averaged to obtain the Gini coefficient of all the people in the sets: if a Gini coefficient were to be calculated for each person it would always be zero. When measuring its value for a large, economically diverse country, a much higher coefficient than each of its regions has individually will result. (The coefficient is usually applied to measurable <a title="Nominal" href="/wiki/Nominal"><span style="color: #0066cc;">nominal</span></a> income rather than local <a title="Purchasing power" href="/wiki/Purchasing_power"><span style="color: #0066cc;">purchasing power</span></a>, tending to increase the calculated coefficient across larger areas.) </li>
              </ul>
              <dl><dd>For this reason the scores calculated for individual countries within the <a title="European Union" href="/wiki/European_Union"><span style="color: #0066cc;">EU</span></a> are difficult to compare with the score of the entire US: the overall value for the EU should be used in that case, 31.3<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-3"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[4]</span></a></sup>, which is still much lower than the United States', 45.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-4"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[5]</span></a></sup> Using decomposable inequality measures (e.g. the <a title="Theil index" href="/wiki/Theil_index"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Theil index</span></a> <span class="texhtml"><em>T</em></span> converted by <span class="texhtml">1 − <em>e</em> <sup>− <em>T</em></sup></span> into a inequality coefficient) averts such problems. </dd></dl>
              <ul>
              <li>The Lorenz curve may understate the actual amount of inequality if richer households are able to use income more efficiently than lower income households. From another point of view, measured inequality may be the result of more or less efficient use of household incomes. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Economies with similar incomes and Gini coefficients can still have very different income distributions. This is because the Lorenz curves can have different shapes and yet still yield the same Gini coefficient. As an extreme example, an economy where half the households have no income, and the other half share income equally has a Gini coefficient of ½; but an economy with complete income equality, except for one wealthy household that has half the total income, also has a Gini coefficient of ½. In practice, such distributions do not exist, and therefore, the impact of different but realistic curves is less obvious. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>It measures current income rather than lifetime income. A society in which everyone earned the same over a lifetime would appear unequal because of people at different stages in their life; a society in which students study rather than save can never have a coefficient of 0. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-5"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[6]</span></a></sup> </li>

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems in using the Gini coefficient</span></h2>
              <ul>
              <li>Gini coefficients do include income gained from wealth; however, the Gini coefficient is used to measure net income more than net worth, which can be misinterpreted. For example, Sweden has a low Gini coefficient for income distribution and a higher Gini coefficient for wealth (the wealth inequality is low by international standards, but still significant: 5% of Swedish household shareholders hold 77% of the share value owned by households)<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-6"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[7]</span></a></sup>. In other words and as a normative statement: The Gini income coefficient should not be interpreted as measuring effective <a title="Egalitarianism" href="/wiki/Egalitarianism"><span style="color: #0066cc;">egalitarianism</span></a>; and distribution of stock ownership does not appear to correlate to many recognized indicators of egalitarianism. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Too often only the Gini coefficient is quoted without describing the proportions of the quantiles used for measurement. As with other inequality coefficients, the Gini coefficient is influenced by the granularity of the measurements. For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity) will usually yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles (high granularity) taken from the same distribution. This is an often encountered problem with measurements. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Care should be taken in using the Gini coefficient as a measure of egalitarianism, as it is properly a measure of income dispersion. Two equally egalitarian countries with different immigration policies may have different Gini coefficients. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Greater equality in a society does not necessarily mean greater overall prosperity. The Gini Index cannot be used to directly measure prosperity. </li>

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">General problems of measurement</span></h2>
              <ul>
              <li>Comparing income distributions among countries may be difficult because benefits systems may differ. For example, some countries give benefits in the form of money while others give <a class="mw-redirect" title="Food stamps" href="/wiki/Food_stamps"><span style="color: #0066cc;">food stamps</span></a>, which might not be counted by some economists and researchers<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since June 2007">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span style="color: #0066cc;">citation needed</span></a></em>]</span></sup> as income in the Lorenz curve and therefore not taken into account in the Gini coefficient. America counts income before benefits, while France counts it after benefits, making America appear more unequal vis-a-vis France than it is. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The measure will give different results when applied to individuals instead of households. When different populations are not measured with consistent definitions, comparison is not meaningful. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>As for all statistics, there may be systematic and random errors in the data. The meaning of the Gini coefficient decreases as the data become less accurate. Also, countries may collect data differently, making it difficult to compare statistics between countries. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>As one result of this criticism, in addition to or in competition with the Gini coefficient <em>entropy measures</em> are frequently used (e.g. the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Theil Index" href="/wiki/Theil_Index"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Theil Index</span></a> and the index of <a title="Anthony Barnes Atkinson" href="/wiki/Anthony_Barnes_Atkinson"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Atkinson</span></a>). These measures attempt to compare the distribution of resources by intelligent agents in the market with a maximum <a title="Information entropy" href="/wiki/Information_entropy"><span style="color: #0066cc;">entropy</span></a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Random distribution" href="/wiki/Random_distribution"><span style="color: #0066cc;">random distribution</span></a>, which would occur if these agents acted like non-intelligent particles in a closed system following the laws of statistical physics.</p>

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Advantages of Gini coefficient as a measure of inequality</span></h2>
              <ul>
              <li>The Gini coefficient's main advantage is that it is a measure of inequality by means of a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ratio analysis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_analysis">ratio analysis</a>, rather than a variable unrepresentative of most of the population, such as <a title="Per capita income" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita_income">per capita income</a> or <a title="Gross domestic product" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">gross domestic product</a>.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>It can be used to compare income distributions across different
              population sectors as well as countries, for example the Gini
              coefficient for urban areas differs from that of rural areas in many
              countries (though the United States' urban and rural Gini coefficients
              are nearly identical).</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>It is sufficiently simple that it can be compared across countries
              and be easily interpreted. GDP statistics are often criticised as they
              do not represent changes for the whole population; <span style="color: #ff0000;">the Gini coefficient
              demonstrates how income has changed for poor and rich. If the Gini
              coefficient is rising as well as GDP, poverty may not be improving for
              the majority of the population.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The Gini coefficient can be used to indicate how the distribution
              of income has changed within a country over a period of time, thus it
              is possible to see if inequality is increasing or decreasing.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The Gini coefficient satisfies four important principles:
              <ul>
              <li><em>Anonymity</em>: it does not matter who the high and low earners are.</li>
              <li><em>Scale independence</em>: the Gini coefficient does not consider
              the size of the economy, the way it is measured, or whether it is a
              rich or poor country on average.</li>
              <li><em>Population independence</em>: it does not matter how large the population of the country is.</li>
              <li><em>Transfer principle</em>: if income (less than the difference), is
              transferred from a rich person to a poor person the resulting
              distribution is more equal.</li>
              </ul>
