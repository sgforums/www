            <div class='col-md body'>Are we really scare or inarticulate as suggested by Seah in littlespeck.com?<br><br>Election<br>A popular misconception<br>Ask someone who he's going to vote for, and chances are you'll learn something about the Singaporean. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Mar 11, 2006<br><br>For a long time I've been baffled by the reaction I get when I ask some Singaporeans, "Who are you going to vote for?" More often than not, he would reply, "Sorry, can't yell you. Voting's a secret!"<br><br>This reticence to talk about one's political choice in an election, even from among educated liberal Singaporeans who advocate an 'open society' is a marked contrast to developed societies.<br><br>In the West, they'll happily tell you they're Republican or Democrat (United States) or that they'll vote Tory or Labour (Britain) - and give the reason why.<br><br>Some, in fact, pin badges of their choice. Very rarely would you hear amyome say, "Can't tell you, voting is secret."<br><br>For awhile, I had come to the conclusion that it was probably due to the Singaporean's fear of letting people know that he a opposition supporter, especially if he's a civil servant.<br><br>I'm sure the fear factor widely exists, but that's not the whole answer. How then can one explain the same answer emanating from supporters of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP)?<br><br>Surely there's no need to be afraid.<br><br>I can only think of two reasons for the phenomenon.<br><br>1. In early elections, opposition parties had made the transparency of the voting slip an issue by saying that the number attached to it was designed to allow the government to track down how people had voted.<br><br>The Government ran a campaign to counter it with the message "Your vote is secret", explaining the number was to prevent duplication.<br><br>The phrase "Your vote is secret" was passed on throughout the years, election after election, that it had come - erroneously - to mean that voters should not reveal which candidate or party they had voted for.<br><br>2. The second possible reason is that Singaporeans are reticent creatures who don't want to let people know their political choice, whether for PAP of opposition, for fear of a debate.<br><br>In other words, they don't want to get involved in any discussions, which may follow any answer they give. Singaporeans are not renowned for their ability or passion to articulate their beliefs, especially in politics. So better say nothing.<br><br>Whatever the reason, the Singaporean's close-mouthed attitude - or fear - to talk about their political choice doesn't augur well for the country's desire to become a vibrant city.<br><br>Today, if you were to ask people, "Who are you going to vote for?" you'll still likely get the answer, "Sorry voting is secret." Quite mindlessly!<br><br>If at all there's any light is that during in the run-up to the coming election is that younger professionals are more ready to say whom they'll vote for.</div>
