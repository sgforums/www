The Government has to decide and make an announcement in the Budget.<br><br><span style="color: red;">[color=brown]But on smaller issues, Mr Lee agreed that the Government should not step in too quickly and allow the people to discuss and come to their own conclusions.</span>[/color]<br><br>Read The Straits Times for the full story.<br>_________________________________________<br><br>PM Lee is kidding, he is not stating facts.   If he is serious in the above statement "<span style="color: red;">The PAP needs to win the support of the electorate and get a consensus on issues.</span> "  then consult us on the issue of annuity instead of of making it compulsory.   The CPF money is our hard earn money, it belongs to us not the gahmen, not PM LEE.   It is not right for him to make decision on using our CPF money to buy annuity.   This could be his way of shirking responsibility to take care of us when we grow old.<br><br>I wonder since when PAP bothers to get consensus from the electorate before they plan and implement policies and whatsoever.

Clearly you are another one hoodwinked into submission by the propaganda and pretty images implanted into the minds of the zombies.<br><br>I would assure you that the PAP is not more motivated... unless you mean motivated to suck more money out of the civilians (aka sheeps), then I would whole-heartedly agree with you.</div>

If majority opt in, it shows PAP have won their support. Else, at least those who want to opt out for personal reasons can have this freedom to do so.<br><br>If people wants it, People will Opt-In.<br>If people does not want it, please dun compulsory it for the People.<br><br>Its the People's money. should they not have the right to Opt in/out? Is this not a basic right?<br><br>Why must make it Compulsory ? If its good, sell this idea to the people which he did already and with the help of all his team.  If its so great , why worry?<br><br>Now, let the People Decide. Give them the freedom to OPT.<br><br>The issue here is not about Annuity. Its about the choice given to the people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is reported every now and then about how marvellous its education system is.<br>How 1st world it is in many respects.<br>How well and highly educated its population is.<br>How smart the people can save for a rainy day.<br>How how how...<br><br>A population of highly educated people should make the right decision , couldn't it?<br><br>Even if not everyone disagrees with the annuity scheme, educated people should have their wish respected if they somehow are not willing to buy the scheme.  Afterall , is it not that everyone is different and everyone is an individual living in different circumstances , financial needs and lifestyle needs?<br><br>We are already the highest savers, I propose after the age of 62, all cpf money be withdrawable if there are valid reasons to do so such as in life and death situations, financial difficulties, children university fees, hospitalization, surgery , consultation expenses of anyone in the family.<br><br>For example, authistic / learning difficulty / mentally challenged / disabled / children need special care and as they grow up, they are financial liabilities to the family.     Children born with rare uncurable diseases also require a lot of financial support.<br><br>Could someone advise why under these example circumstances, a person cannot use the CPF and withdraw as much as needed ?  Lets say he withdraw everything. So, his retirement could be a problem. But he may also have other insurance to and retirement plans he bought to cover him. And given the legalising of older working age, and employment act to encourage employers to continue hiring older workers, this man can continue to retire without problem by continuing to work.<br><br>What problem is there? I like a strong rebuttal.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
