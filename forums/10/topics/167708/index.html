            <div class='col-md body'>Christmas appeal to the govt: do more for the rising poor.<br><br>Singapore's Rising Poor<br>Although economy improves, government is still bugged by widening rich-poor gap. Fabio Scarpello. Asia Times.<br>Dec 7, 2005<br><br>To the world, Singapore is a remarkable success story: a former fishing port, the city-state in just 40 years has turned itself into Asia's second-richest country in terms of per capita income.<br><br>Yet, underneath there's another reality that speaks of a widening wealth gap, with most forced to work long hours to make a living.<br><br>"There is a growing gap," said Sinapan Samydoray, chairman of Think Centre, a Singapore-based organisation that deals with social issues.<br><br>"The bottom 20% of the population earns less than 10 years ago in real terms. Almost 87% of the people are staying in government houses. Sixty percent of the people do not pay tax because they earn too little."<br><br>Singapore's social divide increased during the economic crisis that hit East Asia in 1997.<br><br>While the average income of Singaporeans fell by 2.7% in that period, that of the poorest families fell by a staggering 49%, according to a paper by Professor Mukhopadhaya Pundarik of Singapore's National University.<br><br>However, it seems the problem is inherent in the country's past and present political economy (the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services and their management).<br><br>Singapore's success story has been mainly based on attracting foreign investment.<br><br>To do so, the country offered top-class infrastructure, a corruption-free environment, tax incentives and - crucially - low-cost labour. The policy has borne fruit.<br><br>Multinationals poured in, and the country's economy ballooned from S$8.9 billion in 1965 to the current S$180.5 billion (US$109 billion).<br><br>In the last few years, competition from countries such as China, India, Thailand and Malaysia has meant that, to remain competitive, Singapore's workers have been asked to tighten their belts further.<br><br>In addition, the new global climate spurned soul-searching among Singapore's political elite, who decided to shift the country's economy to higher-value added activities.<br><br>The tougher competition and the shift in economic policy have not affected the country's well-educated and the rich.<br><br>In fact, the number of millionaires in Singapore is increasing faster than any other country, according to the Merrill Lynch/Capgemini World Wealth Report in 2004.<br><br>Those with assets of more than US$1 million now number 48,500, an astounding 22.2% more from the previous year.<br><br>At the same time, the bottom 60% of the city-state's 4 million inhabitants - who are not as well educated or skilled - face an increased chance of unemployment as well as daily hardship to make ends meet.<br><br>Singapore's official unemployment rate stands at 3.3%. But, according to a recent Ministry of Manpower labor market report, 66.7% of those still looking for a job six months after having been laid off are people with no more than a secondary education.<br><br>"Those who are 40 to 50 years old are really struggling. They have no education to handle the new technology," Samydoray said.<br><br>And things do not look too promising. The country's gross domestic product growth has slumped to about 4% from last year's 8%, and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is on record as saying:<br><br>"The jobless rate may rise to about 5% in the coming years, as Singapore loses jobs to China and other countries where labour costs are lower."<br><br>To make matters worse, as explained by Samydoray, there is no minimum wage in Singapore, and the influx of temporary foreign labour has driven wages down for locals.<br><br>"Every employee has [his/her] own contract," he said. "There is no minimum wage and it all depends on how good you are at bargaining.<br><br>Migrant workers are not wrong but they keep labour costs very low and locals are stuck. Singaporeans are forced to find two jobs just to survive."<br><br>However, long working hours are often not enough for low-paid Singaporeans to earn the S$1,500 a month, deemed the minimum necessary to get by.<br><br>For these people, the city's perks are out of reach. Fil Low, a 20-year-old shop assistant at I Nuovi Cosmetics, averages two hours overtime a day but still only makes S$ 900 a month.<br><br>"We do not really enjoy our life because of our schedule," she said.<br><br>"We can only really go out about two or three times a month. It is not an enjoyable life. Professionals have a good life. For us, it is just making a living."<br><br>Lion, 52, drives his taxi a minimum of 12 hours a day, seven days a week. He never goes to a cinema, bar or to see friends.<br><br>"I am just too tired and not in the right mood. I work all the time but I still cannot support my family properly," he said, without disclosing his monthly earnings.<br><br>Razman, 30, works as a security guard at a Carrefour supermarket during the day and as a personal trainer in a gym three nights a week.<br><br>He averages 14 working hours a day, which pocket him about S $1,400 a month.<br><br>"I never go out," he said. "I sometimes see my friends in the evening for a couple of hours when I am not working at the gym, but no more than that.<br><br>"I am usually tired ... I am used to this. Maybe it is in my genes; my father also worked very hard. Whatever other people do in other countries, we have to do twice as much. It is Singapore's lifestyle."</div>
