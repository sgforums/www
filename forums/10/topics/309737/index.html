              <p>The key to a enjoyable and stress free life is to work towards financial freedom and paying off you mortgage is probably the most important of all. And if you consider the price of property and interest rate in australia, you will have to be very careful about your cashflow and affordability.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let compare the difference between paying off a $400,000 mortgage in Singapore vs. Australia over 30 years period</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore @3.8%</p>
              <p>Montly installment : Approx $1800</p>
              <p>Total interest paid after 30 years : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$270,000</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Australia @9.0%</p>
              <p> Monthly installment : Approx $3200</p>
              <p>Total interest paid after 30 years : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$760,000</span></p>

              <p><br>fishbuff, I believe the right question you should be asking is, what is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disposable</span> income of average family in SG and Oz? It is meaningless to talk about income (after tax) if you dont take into consideration the cost of living.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not too long ago you quoted an article about this 26yrs old BLOKE who own $0.5m worth of property but has got only a few thousands cash in his bank account. Is this normal in Australia?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Considering the fact that australia property market is slowing down, while home mortgage rate is still creeping up, do you think this BLOKE will stressing his butt off to pay off his loan? How is his situation any better than Singaporeans paying their mortgage? For Singapore, at least we can still get loan directly from HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be asking what is the land size you can get for $450,000 + $760,000 (interest) = $1,210,000. In property, it is meaningless to talk about land size if you dont consider the supply side of the equation. If you want land, you should consider moving to WA, they are miles of land waiting for you, if you are willing to create your own water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with living in big houses, but you must make sure you can afford it or you end up being a slave to the bank. According to some older australians I spoken to, they believe that is the problem with young australians right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If mortgage crisis can hit USA, it can happen anywhere regardless of land size or freehold.</p>

              <p>Ai yo Fish - why bother talking to them lah.</p>
              <p>If anyone is wise enough to consider the implications of a mortgage - they won't borrow at 80% . They aim for borrowing at 50% or less. No money - don't start a family then. Cheaper to live as a single than someone with kids.</p>
              <p>If they are silly enough to borrow at more than 80% , then they bear the full brunt of it all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is about knowing your limits and your safe boundaries financially.</p>
              <p>This is regardless of whether it is in Singapore and Australia. Besides Singapore has mostly 99 year lease apartments while most Australian properties are freehold for land and house packages. Different context.</p>

              <p>For 1.2 million in Australia, I can build a small boarding house in Australia and profit off international students. Get a good accountant to write off my taxes legally and profit even more. So in a few years time, my 1.2 million will be more than it should be , taking into account inflation rates.  And I will have enough for a decent house and land plus a yacht with milliondollar seaside views and maybe savings investment on one side with domestic help once per week and my children will go to the best private schools.</p>
              <p>What is so f**King great about having a maid and taking of children? I believe parents should have a role to play in the children's upbringing . With that money in Australia , I probably have more time to spend with my kids rather than to slog all the time and watch them brought up by a stranger. Don't have time to look after your own children and bring them up properly? Don't have any then. Last thing I want to hear is some spoilt brat boasting about his daddy giving him money and expecting people to clean up after them when they create a mess.</p>
              <p>How about that?</p>

              <p>I am afraid we already know what is your "plan", which sound more like a "daydream" to me. Plus there is nothing very innovative about that "plan" either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However I am convinced that you will not be able to execute that "plan" with $1.2m and definitely not make the sort of return like as you claimed. Plus, I also doubt you know anything about handling corporate taxation, not to mention about the cost of owning an yacht in Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, I can easily acquire a $600K private apartment and rent it out to overseas students and lecturers and still make an annual return of about 5.5%, without the hassle of engaging accountant to evade tax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, are you convinced that property value and inflation doesnt move in tandem?</p>

              <p>For 1.2 million in Australia, I can build a small boarding house
              in Australia and profit off international students. Get a good
              accountant to write off my taxes legally and profit even more. So
              in a few years time, my 1.2 million will be more than it should be
              , taking into account inflation rates.  And I will have enough
              for a decent house and land plus a yacht with milliondollar seaside
              views and maybe savings investment on one side with domestic help
              once per week and my children will go to the best private
              schools.</p>
              <p>What is so f**King great about having a maid and taking of
              children? I believe parents should have a role to play in the
              children's upbringing . With that money in Australia , I probably
              have more time to spend with my kids rather than to slog all the
              time and watch them brought up by a stranger. Don't have time to
              look after your own children and bring them up properly? Don't have
              any then. Last thing I want to hear is some spoilt brat boasting
              about his daddy giving him money and expecting people to clean up
              after them when they create a mess.</p>
              <p>How about that?</p>

              <p>It's just like during a uni lecture when you are waiting for the lecture progress, someone asks something that stalls the lecture because he can't see the deeper meaning or common sense of it, and everyone will feel like bashing him.</p>

              <p>I feel sorry for you . You think that Australia doesn't even
              have domestic help. They do . You just employ them casually to come
              in and clean your place . The cheapest rate is 18 bucks per
              hour.</p>
              <p>Eating out in Australia can be very expensive to some - yes .
              But if I can afford it , it wouldn't be expensive or inconvenient.
              Just very unhealthy.</p>
