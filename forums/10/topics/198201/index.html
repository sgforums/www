            <div class='col-md body'>The Constitution usually sets out the basic rights of citizens and defines the role of government and its component branches.<br><br>What are the basic rights and why must they be protected? What is the role of the government? What should be done in order to advance as a progressive society?<br><br>Should the government be more proactive, dynamic and responsive to change or should it only be too concerned with legalistic controls to consolidate government's power to maintain its own concept of law and order?<br><br>Should the constitution serve the larger long-term interest of the state or the people.<br><br>The answer is obvious isn't it? Government is elected to serve the people to look after their interests and wellbeing through :<br><br>(1) administration,<br>(2) justice,<br>(3) maintaining democratic election processes<br>(4) implementing policies and decisions in tangible processes with accountability and responsibility which will promote citizens' social, cultural and economic vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>Specifically the constitution would establish the mechanic of government as consisting of three branches of government, namely (a) executive, (b) legislature, (c ) judiciary supported by a non-aligned civil service in the interest of all citizens.<br><br>Finally, the constitution should provide a certain clear framework of implementation of policies, decisions and administration, through involving citizens'participation in nation building ?<br><br>A review of the constution is overdue if it is to attain the above-stated elements of serving the people, clear defination of role and processes of implementation to avoid self-centred unaccountable or ad hoc governance.<br><br>Read more about the current shortcomings of leadership-centred governance which have essentially resulted in the "20 major policy errors of governemnt" as posted to the feedback unit.<br><br>If the government wants to run the country with people's participation or bring about a cosmopolitan and inclusive society then it must go beyond narrow leadership-centric look-good surpluses and all the window dressing statistical presentations.<br><br>There is a need to recognise that any form of legalistic governance based on extending controls through passing more laws and regulations like the GRCs or anti-internet and anti-freedom and anti-people regulations will not assure good corporate governance and will weaken the country.<br><br>There is obviously a much larger scope of government one that is empowering the collective talents, coordination, knowledge applications and innovation in every field in collective nation building, the key to the people's vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>Review of the constitution will give a fresh opportunity for progressing to first-world standards of governance to attain teamwork, effective coordination of different branches of the government, through accountable governance among the three branches i.e. legislature, executive, and judiciary. Through accountability and transparency there will be empowering and greater stability and law and order. There will be greater chance for all government to work with unity of purpose.<br><br>Try a different approach and people will come forward to help and serve and play their role to help build the country to a higher standard.</div>

The important thing is to realise the state we are in and see whether we can make the constitution work for all in nation building where leadership or single individuals or concepts of government have thus far been unable to do so.<br><br>Let us be open minded and broad-minded. Do not be too trivial or legalistic about the constitution. The fact that it may be difficult to amend should not mean that just because it is difficult one should not try.<br><br>My suggestion is not to be too legalistic or procedural and controversial about such a document. If the existing document is too vague and general over major issues of government such as its respective role or rights and freedoms, revision will make such matter clear and that will be good for nation building.<br><br>The most important consideration in reviewing the document is to set certain clear direction for cooperation among component parties i.e. citizens, government, ruling party and working of three branches for progress and prosperity in nation building.<br><br>There have been too many gerrymandering with the existing constitutions within the existing general laws affecting election, loss of citizens' basic rights and freedoms by ruling party in the name of racial harmony and law and order etc at the expense of social and cultural cohesion and mass participation in all aspects of nation building.<br><br>By providing clearly established rights and mechanism for coordination and redressing of practical problems among all parties, the rights and freedom of citizens can be suitably protected and ensured and protected so that all will be the winners - government find it easier to govern the country, and will obey rule of law and not legalistically try to circumvent rights and freedoms of citizens to deprive and sap the country of vibrancy and synergy.<br><br>Branches of government will work closely as a team and everyone respect the CONSTITUTION (with suitable provisions to redress any wrongs or infringements by any branch of government or anyone) as the binding pledge and not infringe it. There will then be loyalty of citizens who will be proud to enjoy being citizens and work for the nation.</div>

However by being too general in the provisions, we are running the risk of one-man at the helm deciding on every nitty gritty in the provisions to suit his political agendas which may not coincide with that of the nation.<br><br>I only proposee that the constitution be suitably upgraded to provide clearly defined freedoms and rights of citizens and framework of government for greater accountability in the establishment of the system.<br><br>All that need is to incorporate overall useful framework for constitution to be workable with sufficient criteria and guidelines for decisions and policies to be made more collectively and accountably to prevent concentration of power in one man like the secretary general of the ruling party.<br><br>(2)    The three branches of government are being dominated by the Sec'y General of the ruling party who makes all the policies and decisions to suit narrow agendas of control of freedoms and manipulate election processes, and political rights.<br><br>How to progress from where we are and upgrade from a one-man control of the whole pseudo-democratic system to a collective accountable good corporate governance is a bigger prorblem the people as a whole need to solve.<br><br>All other considerations like problems of defining the details are secondary and can be solved by a good "Definition" section of the Constitution.</div>

However by being too general in the provisions, we are running the risk of one-man at the helm deciding on every nitty gritty in the provisions to suit his political agendas which may not coincide with that of the nation.<br><br>I only proposee that the constitution be suitably upgraded to provide clearly defined freedoms and rights of citizens and framework of government for greater accountability in the establishment of the system.<br><br>All that need is to incorporate overall useful framework for constitution to be workable with sufficient criteria and guidelines for decisions and policies to be made more collectively and accountably to prevent concentration of power in one man like the secretary general of the ruling party.<br></div></blockquote>Exactly.
