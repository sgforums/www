              <h1>Did we spend our money unwittingly on Merrill Lynch director’s prostitution bills ?</h1>
              <p><strong>Compiled from Lianhe Wanbao and Fox news</strong></p>
              <p>Wall Street CEOs, lawyers, bankers and media executives chalked up
              thousands of dollars in prostitution charges on their corporate credit
              cards — swiping their cards for $2,000 an hour prostitutes, according
              to a New York madam who pleaded guilty last year.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="reflect aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/3296513627_a922ab7ac4.jpg?v=0" alt="merrillpro01 by you." width="500" height="375"></p>
              <p>The madam, Kristin Davis, went public on ABC News last week, and
              said that she has a list of over 9,800 clients, many of whom she says
              New York prosecutors deliberately avoided when taking her case.</p>
              <p>Among her clients were: a vice president of NBC Universal, the part
              owner of a Major League Baseball team, the CEO of one of the country’s
              largest private equity firms, <strong>an investment banker from Lehman Brothers, an investment banker at <span style="color: #ff0000;">JP Morgan Securities</span> who spent $41,600, an investment banker at Goldman <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sachs </span>who spent $27,000, and a managing director from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Merrill Lynch</span>.</strong></p>
              <p>Davis told the network she disguised the charges in various ways so
              they would appear to be legitimate business expenses when accountants
              sifted through credit card statements.</p>
              <p>One CEO, she said, ordered her to send him invoices for “roof repair on a warehouse”<strong> to disguise the charge for prostitutes from corporate funds.</strong> In total, this madam raked in several hundred thousand dollars from the
              same people who just received a $700 billion dollar bailout.</p>
              <p>According to Davis, her highest-earning model raked $3060 per hour.
              Even a “full body massage” service offered by a model at the lower end
              of the scale will cost the customer $612 a hour.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="reflect aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3661/3296514381_48586aa32b.jpg?v=0" alt="merrillpro02 by you." width="500" height="375"></p>
              <p><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p>So these are the “top talents” emulated by our esteemed PAP leaders
              who pegged their salaries against theirs. Actually, there is nothing
              wrong in men fooling around, but to make use of corporate funds to pay
              for prostitutes is really outrageous and disgusting !<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> How much of
              Temasek’s “rescue package” were misused by these Merrill Lynch
              directors to spend on prostitutes ?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Perhaps MM Lee can consider joining Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs. </strong></span>He is too good for us and we really cannot afford to keep him on our
              payroll anymore:</p>
              <p>“So for the average family earning S$1,500-S$3,000, we are talking
              of astronomical figures but for people like me in government, to deal
              with the money which we have accumulated by the sweat of our brow over
              the last 40 years, you have to pay the market rate or the man will up
              stakes and<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> join Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers or Goldman Sachs</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">you would have an incompetent man and you would have lost money by the billions.”</span></strong></p>
