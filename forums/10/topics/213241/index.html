All this for f**k ?<br><br>same for indonesia - the whole world know about the anti-chinese riots a few yrs ago and honestly, who actually believe that with this new president in place, things have changed ?<br><br>however, perhaps MM Lee could have just not talked about it and keep it to himself. why bother stirring up the issue again ?  if the ppl there choose not to face it / do something about it, why shld we bother ? it doesn't really do us much help...we are happy that these chinese send their kids here for education, spend here for their medical care, invest, shop, etc....rather than back there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

unless Badawi will step in to soften the matter further with his characterisitic gentle ways, reaffirming his philosophy of being a <span style="font-style: italic;">'Progressive Muslim'</span>.<br><br><br></div>
