            <div class='col-md body'>Ching Cheong completes six months in detention on spying charge<br><br>Reporters Without Borders voices outrage at the continuing detention of Hong Kong-based reporter Ching Cheong, who today completes his sixth month in solitary confinement on a trumped-up charge of spying for Taiwan which the Chinese authorities have been trying to bolster by means of smear campaigns against him and his family.<br><br>The correspondent of the Singapore-based Straits Times, the 55-year-old Ching was arrested by the Chinese political police on 22 April while on his way to the southern city of Guangzhou. Several source have said he was seeking documents about former Communist Party of China leader Zhao Ziyang, who died in January.<br><br>Â“The governments of Hong Kong and Singapore must put pressure on the authorities in Beijing to make them see reason in the Ching case, and everyone must continue to campaign on ChingÂ’s behalf,Â” Reporters Without Borders, reiterating its call for his release.<br><br>More than 15,000 people have already signed an international petition for his release that was launched by Reporters Without Borders and the Hong Kong Journalists Association.<br><br>Ching is being held at a State Security premise in Beijing. The Chinese authorities have refused to allow anyone to visit him, including representatives of his newspaper. His wife, Mary Lau, was invited to Beijing but she was afraid of being arrested herself and did not go.<br><br>The Chinese foreign ministry announced on 31 May that Ching had confessed to being a Â“spy in the pay of foreign agenciesÂ”. He was charged with spying for Taiwan on 5 August and faces a possible life sentence for Â“endangering national security.Â” On 17 August, the State Security turned down his wifeÂ’s request to hire a lawyer to defend him.<br><br>Lau has rejected the charges against her husband, saying he always led a modest life-style with no sign of the money he allegedly received from Taiwan, and that he was always motivated by the desire to inform, not to hurt the PeopleÂ’s Republic of China.<br><br>Reporters Without Borders is firm in its condemnation of the campaigns to smear Ching being relayed by pro-Beijing publications in Hong Kong. These have included naming a Shenzhen journalist as his accomplice and mistress. The journalist concerned immediately called a news conference in Hong Kong to deny the allegation.</div>
