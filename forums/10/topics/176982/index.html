            <div class='col-md body'>Taiwan president rebuked by US for China speech<br>Financial Times<br><br>By Mac William Bishop in Taipei<br>Updated: 8:13 p.m. ET Jan. 31, 2006<br><br>Washington has delivered an exceptional rebuke to Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian after a speech in which he proposed abolishing a unification council with China, as well as other hardline policies.<br><br>The US State Department issued a statement on Monday evening defining US policy towards Taiwan and reminding Mr Chen that Washington "does not support Taiwan's independence and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo by either Taiwan or Beijing".<br><br>"We certainly weren't expecting [Mr Chen's speech] and we weren't consulted about it," Adam Ereli, spokesman for the US State Department, told reporters at a regular briefing.<br><br>Mr Chen, who has been espousing a harder line towards China since an electoral defeat in December, proposed at the weekend abolishing the National Unification Council, a non-official advisory body whose responsibility is to co-ordinate unification with China."What unification of China are we pursuing?" he asked.<br><br>Mr Chen also called for Taiwan to join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan" Â– instead of the country's official title, the "Republic of China" Â– and for the drafting of a new constitution by the end of the year.<br><br>Mr Chen's Democratic Progressive Party and many supporters of Taiwan's independence view the "Republic of China" title, flag and constitution as relics of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's once-authoritarian ruling party, now its main opposition.<br><br>"Most Taiwanese people want to see the country pursue national dignity and enhance its Taiwanese consciousness," Mr Chen said.<br><br>China considers Taiwan part of its territory even though the island has been ruled as a de facto independent state since 1949. China has threatened to invade if Taipei declares formal independence.<br><br>The US, which is obliged by law to offer Taiwan a means of self-defence if its security is threatened, was unhappy with Mr Chen's speech. "We are pointing out, once again, that the US policy towards Taiwan is governed by our 'one China' policy, the Taiwan Relations Act and the three US-China joint communiquÃ©s," said Mr Ereli.<br><br>"We're issuing this [statement] in the wake of some comments by President Chen in Taiwan that we don't want to be inflammatory or send the wrong signal, so we thought it useful to reiterate US policy."<br><br><a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11114437/" rel="nofollow">http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11114437/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The US State Department repeated its displeasure over possible changes to unification guidelines with a call for improved communication<br><br>By Charles Snyder<br>STAFF REPORTER IN WASHINGTON<br>Saturday, Feb 04, 2006,Page 1<br><br>A senior State Department official has called on Taipei to communicate fully with Washington to avoid a repetition of President Chen Shui-bian's (ÃªÂ�Ã‹Â®Â±Ã¢) "surprise" Lunar New Year proposal to scrap the National Unification Council and unification guidelines and seek UN membership as "Taiwan."<br><br>James Keith, the department's special assistant for East Asian affairs, said he expected that Washington and Taipei would continue to operate very closely together in the future, "with no daylight between us in terms of our policy approaches."<br><br>Speaking to Taiwanese reporters at an impromptu press conference on Thursday after he made an appearance on Capitol Hill, Keith said that US policy toward Taiwan had not changed, "and we have every expectation that that will be the case in Taiwan as well."<br><br>Noting that communication between the two sides was very close, Keith said he was "gratified" by this.<br><br>"It's important that we use those channels to ensure there are no surprises between us, because these are issues that directly affect American interests, and therefore we need to be in close touch," he said.<br><br>The State Department is said to be angry that Chen put forward his proposals on UN membership and the unification council without telling Washington first. That would explain the department's sharp reaction on Monday when it took the unusual step of widely publicizing its reaction statement to Chen's speech, equating his speech with an effort to change the "status quo."<br><br>Keith, the department official most closely involved in Taiwan policy, said the department acted because "we felt it necessary to be absolutely clear about US policy ... We fully expect that the president and his government will continue to adhere to the status quo ... and that the kind of assurances that were provided in the past will continue to be honored."<br><br>The gap in communication that the department says occurred around the New Year speech is curious, considering that communication between the two sides has been closer and more open in recent years.<br><br>This is especially the case in Washington, where de facto ambassador David Lee Ta-wei (Ã€Ã®Â´Ã³Â¾S) and other officials with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office are in regular contact with key US officials.<br><br>"We've heard from the Taiwan government just about every day this week, and last week and the week before," Keith said.<br><br>On Chen's proposal to seek UN membership under the name "Taiwan," Keith said only that US policy had not changed.<br><br>"Our expectation is that we'll stay in close alignment with the government in Taiwan on that and many other issues," he said.<br><br>Keith did not directly comment on the latest statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang (Ã¼SÃ–Â¾Â·Â¼) on the issue, saying he had not seen Huang's remarks.<br><br>In response to the US rebuke, Huang said that Chen was merely suggesting that the government was considering scrapping the council and the guidelines because the council is covered by a legislative resolution that all ad hoc commissions without a legal basis be eliminated.<br><br>"The president is just reflecting the concerns of Taiwan's people," Huang said on Thursday.<br><br>"It was not Taiwan's intention to surprise the United States," he said. "If there are differences on both sides, we shall strengthen communication with the US authorities."<br><br><a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/02/04/2003291468" rel="nofollow">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/02/04/2003291468</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>US rebukes Chen over inflammatory remarks<br><br>The United States has rebuked Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian, warning him not to take actions that might precipitate unrest in the region.<br><br>On Sunday (Jan 29), President Chen had referred to the one-China principle as a problem and said he supported abolishing Taiwan's National Unification Council, which was set up in 1990 to promote the eventual reunification of China and Taiwan.<br><br>"This kind of council and its representatives seek a unified China and, under the guidelines, even accepts the one-China principle. These are all problems," Chen had said.<br><br>In an extraordinary move, Washington issued a statement on Monday (Jan 30) reasserting that its policy towards Taiwan is governed by the one-China principle, the Taiwan Relations Act as well as the three US-China Joint Communiques.<br><br>For the United States, a real problem would be the abolition of the one-China principle, along with the other moves that Chen had threatened, such as revising Taiwan's Constitution and holding a referendum on the new version next year.<br><br>Washington has reacted furiously to these proposals, calling them "inflammatory" and liable to upset the delicate relationships between China, Taiwan and the United States.<br><br>With its military forces deeply involved in Iraq, the last thing the United States wants now is an upsurge in tension and possible military action in the Taiwan Strait.<br><br>Washington is also worried that Chen's volatile remarks will distract the current strategic dialogue between the United States and China over issues such as Iran and North Korea.<br><br>And it does not help that Chen's outbursts occurred amid preparations for Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to the United States in late April.<br><br>Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman, said: "We're issuing this (statement) in the wake of some comments by President Chen in Taiwan that we don't want to be inflammatory or send the wrong signal, so we thought it useful to reiterate US policy on the subject."<br><br>The US policy is to oppose any unilateral change in the status quo, added Ereli, visibly unamused by Chen's provocative words.<br><br>Said Professor Wang Jianwei, an expert on cross-strait issues at the University of Wisconsin: "It is an open expression of displeasure at Chen's erratic behaviour."<br><br>This is not the first time that Washington has angrily tried to restrain the Taiwanese leader.<br><br>Professor Dennis Hickey, an Asian expert at Missouri State University, said: "The Bush administration has warned Chen time and again to avoid provoking China."<br><br>So far, there has been no official reaction from Beijing on Chen's threat to scrap guidelines on reunification with China and the body that created them.<br><br>Still, observers have been reminded of how President George W. Bush issued a similar verbal reprimand when Chen had threatened to hold referenda concurrently with the 2004 Taiwan presidential election. Bush's warning went unheeded.<br><br>There is now grave concern that the pro-independence leader, who cannot run for a third term, may feel he has nothing to lose by again ignoring Washington's warnings.<br><br>Prof Wang said: "Chen's latest remarks have raised US fears that he may once again use constitutional reform to pursue his independence agenda."<br><br>Christopher McNally, a China specialist at the Hawaii-based East-West Centre, said: "It is a red line that China has made clear no Taiwanese administration should cross. Beijing will do everything, including military threats, to stall the process before it gets underway."<br><br>In his remarks, Chen also repeated his belief that, as a sovereign nation, Taiwan should apply to join the United Nations.<br><br>That call came in the wake of a decision by the UN's World Health Organisation (WHO) last Friday (Jan 27) to deny Taiwan's bid for observer status.<br><br>In an additional sting to Washington's rebuke, Ereli said that Taiwan's participation in the UN would be a unilateral change in the status quo and that Washington could not support it.<br><br>His comment startled China watchers in the United States.<br><br>Prof Wang said: "To my knowledge, this is the first time that a US official has clearly defined Taiwan's effort to join the UN as a 'unilateral change of the status quo'. Ereli's remark is very significant."<br><br>Taiwan was forced out of the WHO in 1972, a year after it lost its UN seat to China.<br><br>Ereli's comments reflect growing anxiety in the White House that Chen will turn into a wild card who will take unpredictable and potentially disastrous actions during the remainder of his term.<br><br>Ralph Cossa, president of the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum CSIS, said: "Chen is clearly pushing the envelope. While others may step back and reflect when faced with political adversity, his inclination is to take a dramatic leap forward instead."<br><br>Chen is believed to be playing the China card to revive his own fortunes following the poor showing of his Democratic Progressive Party in last December's local polls.<br><br>Washington is also worried that the Taiwan leader will pursue the so-called "nuclear option" -- that he will simply declare independence before his term expires in 2008.<br><br>Said McNally: "The United States is very apprehensive about Chen moving in this direction and wants to nip his efforts in the bud before it gets too late."<br><br><a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2006/02/02/200602020002.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2006/02/02/200602020002.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MOFA denies President Chen angered Bush<br><br>2006/2/6<br>The China Post staff<br><br>Taipei yesterday denied reports that President Chen Shui-bian infuriated American President George Bush personally but admitted the U.S. remains concerned by Chen's tough stance, foreign minister James Huang said yesterday.<br>"Over the past few days, Taiwan and the United States exchanged views over the issue through diplomatic channels. The sentiment is frank and friendly," Huang told reporters.<br><br>Huang said that "as there is a still gap between the two sides regarding the understanding of the issue, the United States remains concerned over this."<br><br>Independence-minded Chen touched a diplomatic nerve during Chinese New Year after he said that he would "seriously consider" abolishing the National Unification Council and its guidelines for national unification.<br><br>Eliminating them could fuel Beijing's suspicions that he is pushing for independence for the island which China regards as part of its territory.<br><br>Scrapping them would also violate Chen's "five noes" policy, which consists of a series of pledges not to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait provided China does not resort to military force. Analysts say the "five noes" policy serves as a reassurance for the U.S. that Chen will not move towards independence.<br><br>Taiwan's China Times yesterday morning quoted a Nilson Report from California as saying Bush was infuriated by Chen's threats to abolish the National Unification Council.<br><br>"He did it AGAIN after what happened last time?" Bush reportedly asked his advisers, who were briefing him on Chen's latest moves.<br><br>The Nilson report said the U.S. side was offended as it felt Chen should have learnt his lesson from the last time he infuriated the Bush administration in 2003 by calling a national referendum despite American disapproval.<br><br>The Nilson report also said Bush and his team were busy fighting global terrorism and handling North Korea's nuclear threat. Both these items need China's cooperation. The Bush administration is also concerned about Iran's plans to restart its nuclear program and the last thing it needs is Chen threatening to spark new international instabilities.<br><br>"(There is) absolutely no inclination by Bush or the NSC to sympathize with Chen's personal political issues," the Nilson report said.<br><br>It said the U.S. viewed Chen's calls to abolish the council as invoking two major foreign policy taboos -- changing the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and breaking policy promises.<br><br>But foreign minister Huang said the Nilson report was incorrect, adding his office verified it with senior U.S. officials.<br><br>"Bush was not irritated by Chen's statements," Huang said.<br><br>"That report cast a cloud over ties between the heads of state of Taiwan and the United States and my office has an obligation to rebut it," he said.<br><br>Huang and other foreign affairs officials said the foreign ministry had been in close contact with the U.S. mission here, the American Institute in Taiwan, (AIT). Sources said the ministry made it clear to the AIT that Chen's security advisers are only assessing eliminating the council and no decisions have been made.<br><br>"Taiwan has no intention of catching Washington off-guard," one official said.<br><br>But the official also said Huang told AIT officials that Taiwan was responding to China changing the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. On Thursday, Chen's top China policy maker Joseph Wu said China's increasing military build-up was changing the status quo and eroding the basis of the "five noes" policy, which is predicated on China not using military force.<br><br>Bush is scheduled to hold a summit with Chinese president Hu Jintao in April and there is rising speculation that Chen's latest moves may make Bush disinclined to push for Taiwan's interests in his talks with Hu.<br><br>Chen in his January 29 address also suggested Taiwan should reapply to join the United Nations in the name of "Taiwan" instead of the island's official title, "Republic of China". He also called for putting a new constitution to a vote later this year.<br><br>Chen's remarks surprised U.S. officials, who reiterated Washington's opposition to Taiwan's independence and to changes in the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.<br><br>Former foreign minister Chen Tan Sun, who is now Presidential Office secretary general, said ties with the U.S. were still intact.<br><br>"It is only natural that the two sides will not agree with each other on everything because of their different national interests," Chen Tan Sun said.<br><br>Chen Tan Sun said he was "unaware" that Chen had provoked Bush's displeasure but said any misunderstandings between the two sides could be resolved with communication.<br><br>The United States, which is obliged by law to offer Taiwan a means of self-defense if its security is threatened, is the leading arms supplier to the island despite switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.<br><br><a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/detail.asp?ID=76458&amp;GRP=A" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinapost.com.tw/detail.asp?ID=76458&amp;GRP=A</a></div>
