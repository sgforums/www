            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I doubt' the US can capture OBL with such brute force.  They ruined their chance for surprise with such use of brute force.  Unless they are hoping that the Northern Alliance will turn him over when they govern.<br><br>I think that's fat hope.  All ragheads will always support ragheads.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah....no point catching him. Putting him on trial or prison, even for life would only spur on his sidekicks to try to force the Americans to free him by carrying out even more vicious attacks. The 1970s hijackings of airliners were an example. Give in to their demands and there will be more hijackings, carry out raids like Entebbe(IDF) and Mogadishu(GSG9) and notice how the hijackings tapered off in the 80s?<br><br>Kill him. A dead terrorist matyr is better than a live one(which he already is). At least it'll leave a vacuum which might see them implode if a power struggle develops.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 03 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, this war came a little too early, in my opinion. There are lots of emerging technologies and platforms which are currently under end-phase testing but require another few years to field. They are under development and would greatly aid in the war. Like the MV-22 Osprey, Global Hawk, Micro UAVs, Hyperspectral imaging (which will negate eagle's tactic), the OSCW etc.... with Prowlers scanning the airways and ready to jam them, as well as the Rivet Joint giving the ability to localise the transmissions, Osama's ability to coordinate his forces is limited already... I just hope they start the REAL pounding of Afghan positions with Arc Light equivalent missions... they are capable of creating much more hell on the ground than they are doing right now.... just hope they will carry out Arc Light equivalent missions with FAEs soon...<br>LET THE REAL POUNDING BEGIN!!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by YourFather (edited 12 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Given the latest happenings....<br><br>if the Northern Alliance can circle Kendahar and surrounding mountain ranges, perhaps they can slowly squeeze them Omar and OBL out.... afterall, the winter is coming, any movement by them will give the American a perfect IR paint to bomb them....<br><br>The special forces can also do a drop in, bang bang and get out... somewhat like what they did to the viet congs when flushing them out of their caves and tunnels...<br><br>The NA can simply go through each of the city to search Omar and OBL to ensure that they are not hiding them. They can also launch general assault on any mountain ranges that habour the Teliban and Al-Queda members.<br><br>Anyway, it seems like the American have gotten airbase inside Afganistan anyway. The NA can do the ground work, American/Coalition the air and SF.<br><br>BTW, I still think that Sept 11 involves more than just OBL. I think there are other terrorist cell group (albeit link to OBL) that are involved. Perhaps even part sponsor by a rouge state.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not so. A few months before the attack, there was talk of developing a whole new nuclear warhead, something which America has not done for quite some time. This warhead is supposed to be a DEEP penetrator warhead, and its supposed to penetrate deep enough such that radiation on the surface will be minimal. Its supposed to be used for tunnels and bunkers. THAT would have worked well.<br><br>One more thing worried me. OBL that SOB has got his paws on nukes, or so he claims. Problem is he may not be blaughing, especially when Pakistani nuclear scientists were helping him develop them. tsk tsk...Always knew it was a bad idea for an islamic country to have nukes.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why its called HYPERspectral imaging is because it is able to differentiate frequencies with ultra-minute differences. The exact shade of blue or any other frequency for that matter will turn up the same for a normal sensor, but with a HSI sensor, it will be able to sense minute differences btw them. So if you insist, yes, theoretically its possible, practically? It better be one heck of exact, cos with HSI, even mud that has been trampled on can be differentiated from those that have not, based on the minute differences in frequency of light reflected by them, even though externally they look the same. Coupled with the fact that they are used in conjunction with KH-11 sats and radar sats, you better make 'juz some gadgets to emit all sorts of intensities of radiation around these spectrum to avoid detection' that look like humans or tanks, that emit EXACTLY the same frequency.<br><br>As for that 'sats are too far away thing', the USAF's KeyHole-11 and -12 series sats have a resolution of a few inches, so dont take baths in the open, ok?
