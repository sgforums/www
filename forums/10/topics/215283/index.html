            <div class='col-md body'>Source: <a href="http://www.mediawatchsg.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediawatchsg.blogspot.com</a><br><br>Abstract only, please click link for full article<br><br>Our review<br><br>The above report carries a reply from Mr Yaacob to the WP's press release (http://www.wp.sg/news/press_releases/20061012_haze.htm) published yesterday in the Straits Times and TODAY (http://www.todayonline.com/articles/148636.asp)<br><br>Far more Singaporeans would have read the newspaper reports than the actual WP article on their website.<br><br>Two important pieces of information were not published in the article by TODAY:<br><br>1. Ms Sylvia Lim was aware that the Government has attempted to tackle the haze issue since 1991:<br><br>"As early as 1992, the then Environment Minister Dr Ahmad Mattar told Parliament that the government would work with the Indonesian government to look into the problem of the haze from forest fires in Indonesia."<br><br>2. Ms Lim had also listed out the milestones that should be set for Indonesia:<br><br>......<br><br>The article ends off with Ms Lim's acknowledgement of the difficulty involved which was not reported in the original press release:<br><br>She added: "We also recognise that the enforcement for these cross-border problems is always very challenging. If there is a timeline for Indonesia to work to, at least there are some milestones for us to look at, and see if there's any progress."<br><br>Did Mr Yaacob reply to Ms Lim's proposals?<br><br>We find it surprising that Mr Yaacob make no mention of Ms Lim's milestones in his "reply". Instead of engaging the WP on the haze issue, he chose to interpret the press release as "unhelpful criticism" and defend the government's "track record". Was his reply intended for Singaporeans or Ms Lim?<br></div>

The obvious lack of competition and decision deferment style of leadership is reminiscent of Ruling Party politics.<br><br>GLCs and govt agencies are breeding grounds for the scholar elite. The rest of the employees just make up the numbers. That's not to say they are incapable people, but will forever be 2nd rate versus the scholar elite. The lack of questioning decisions is not practiced, ideas are not nurtured, save those from the scholarly cadre.<br><br>Dr Yaccob Ibrahim's response to Sylvia Lim's statement concering the Haze underlines a growing problem among the Ruling Party: in their paranoid state, they will view any statement from alternatives with contempt and disdain. Not only will they widely preceive any such statement, no matter how harmless it may sound, as a threat to their political security but will vehemently and 'robustly' strike them down as soon as they are aired.<br><br>Actually i prefer them to carry on in this manner, using cannons to respond to pea-shooters. The more high-handed they are, the more people will see them as nothing more than 'disconnected' from reality and the people, ignoring the concerns of voters and going on a political mileage campaign.</div>
