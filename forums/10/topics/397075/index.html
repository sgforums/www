              <p>With Singapore’s demographics being altered radically over the last few years due to the relentless influx of foreigners, PAP leaders have been emphasizing the importance of racial and religious harmony in recent weeks, the latest being Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.</p>
              <p>Speaking at a community event in Pasir Ris yesterday, DPM Teo called on Singaporeans to strive to be part of the “common space” they share with one another.</p>
              <p><em>“Each community in Singapore must be allowed to have its own space to practise its culture, traditions and beliefs. But we must subscribe to a wider common space among all of us, where we come together as Singaporeans, regardless of what our race, language or beliefs are,”</em> DPM Teo was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>He noted Singapore’s history as an immigrant society and said that this is “the kind of Singapore that we want to build, where people find their own space and their comfort level and they feel at home here.”</p>
              <p>PAP leaders have often used the fact that Singaporeans’ forefathers are immigrants too to exhort them to accept more foreigners into Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies have become increasingly unpopular among Singaporeans and could cost them some votes in the next general election.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living and led to an overall decline in the quality of life.</p>
              <p>Despite the widespread unhappiness on the ground, the PAP has continued to insist that foreigners are “essential” for Singapore.</p>

              <p>Thats wat i am saying here!</p>
              <p>                 "Army??? i smell those uniform also want to vomit already, so stink" From  angel7030</p>
              <p>This is wat u get for doing ur country service.Then gals like her(angel7030) start the "i wish i can join shit".</p>
              <p>My sis visited me during my Tekong days of 3months BMT.When i told her this is the best soup(fake shark fin soup) in Tekong,she said this "this looks and taste like niao(pee)"</p>
              <p>I remember that forever... Imagine the shit i and a whole lot of guys have to put through for 2 years.We only wan some respect, in the end wat we got was this???</p>
              <p>When i went to taiwan for training,the local was so good to the "Ah pin ger(soldiers)" that they gave us cold drinks and smile at us when we passed by.They even cheered us on when we were just sweating around.That really left me a very deep impression.</p>
              <p>Comparing the kind of treatment we are getting here,its really sad being a singaporean soldier protecting the country.</p>
              <p>The ppl who implemented the system didnt even under go the basic training.Who are they to tell us wat to do? And those ppl who just moved into singapore?Who are they to judge Singapore SAF soldiers. </p>

Whilst, the foreign talents are brought in by the overseas companies stationed here as expatriates. How can it be possible to welcome foreign talents with gracious arms when local talents are not valued by the Singapore government. By opening the doors to foreign talents to apply for the companies here simply means that a local university graduate is deprive a shot at management by letting companies the right to choose who is cheaper when business costs play an important part of corporate governance.  </p></div>
