It is going to get alot more competitive.<br><br>When it first started, Singapore was so desperately short of post-docs that anyone with a PhD in a relevant field can probably get a decent paying job. Now it is possible to get a Chinese post-doc with a year's experience in a reputable research lab <strong>who is prepared </strong>to take the job for S$3k... </blockquote>Oh me God, that's a revealing RMB $15,160.07... why should FT Chinese mind a lower pay? whether they stay or leave Singapore, they have it 'tailored-made'... in any case ur salary's from taxpayers' coffers if ur 'company' hasn't any revenue yet... think about that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I fact, a friend in the pharma industry tells me they rejoice when they hear of copy drugs in China that turn out to be contaminated and harmed patients.

They are prepared to spend but they need highly experienced people with the relevant qualifications. At the clinical trial stage, they will need clinical staff (doctors, nurses etc), product specialists (scientists and doctors from the pharmaceutical company's development team) and good biostatisticians.</div>
