            <div class='col-md body'>OUTPUT by Singapore's drug factories jumped by over a third last year, pushing overall biomedical production up by 30.2 per cent.<br>This robust growth puts biomedical output at a record $23 billion, almost four times production in 2000.<br><br>More than 90 per cent comes from pharmaceuticals, with the rest from the medical technology sector, a field that makes devices such as heart valves.<br><br>Singapore will soon have a new kind of factory on the biomedical scene - cutting-edge plants manufacturing human vaccines and other drugs derived by culturing living cells - a highly advanced field called biologics.<br><br>The fledgling biomedical sector already accounts for one quarter of the gross domestic product (GDP) generated by the manufacturing industry as a whole, making it second only to electronics, which accounts for 29 per cent.<br><br>The figures on the health of the biomedical sciences cluster, which were released yesterday, also showed that it employed 10,571 people last year, up 3.9 per cent from 2005.<br><br>A further 1,800 jobs will be created when new biomedical investments committed last year are fully realised, a process that typically takes three to four years.<br><br>These new commitments will be worth about $2.3 billion in additional GDP a year.<br><br>New plants coming on stream include Singapore's first commercial-scale biologics facilities as well as plants by pharmaceutical giants Abbot and Merck.<br><br>New entrant Abbott's planned $450 million facility, for example, will be its largest nutritional plant.<br><br>International players also continue to set up research programmes here, one of the latest being the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases' new malaria research programme.<br><br>The Government target for the biomedical sector to generate $25 billion in output and 15,000 in jobs by 2015 looks within reach, said Mr Yeoh Keat Chuan, executive director at the Economic Development Board for the biomedical sector.<br><br>'The outlook is very positive for biomedical sciences, which means we are likely to achieve our targets early,' he said.<br><br>At the research and development (R&amp;D) level, the number of biomedical research scientists and engineers has grown from 2,055 in 2001 to 4,054 at last count.<br><br>Biomedical research units linked to the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) have also chalked up 15 patents, since their first one in 2002, in areas such as virology and bioimaging tools.<br><br>The foundation for biomedical sciences has been set, according to Mr Philip Yeo, outgoing A*Star chairman.<br><br>'For the last five years, we have done basement one, first floor,' he quipped, leaving successor Lim Chuan Poh and his team to build the second and third floors.<br><br>EDB's biomedical investment fund Bio*One Capital - designed to nurture firms contributing to the sector's growth - ploughed $114 million into 16 projects last year. Some products from its portfolio companies are entering the trial stage.<br><br>Bio*One plans to continue supporting firms in biologics as well as those in medical technology and small molecules translational projects.<br><br>What the Government plans to push next is something called 'translational research' or bringing medical innovations from the laboratory to the hospital bed, and finally on to the marketplace.<br><br>(Straits Times, 7 Feb)</div>

To her surprise, she landed her first job within two weeks and discovered a career trend.<br><br>Her job, however, had nothing to do with what she had expected when she first went to Melbourne six years earlier, which was journalism, advertising or public relations.<br><br>She made it as a junior executive at a beach hotel on the flourishing island of Sentosa.<br><br>What she and many Malaysians seeking jobs here have discovered in recent years is a growing disconnect between their university degrees and subsequent careers as a result of the changing global economy.<br><br>It merely follows the trend in the developed world as old businesses disappear, sometimes overnight, and new ones spring up, creating problems for graduates with an inflexible job expectation.<br><br>My friendÂ’s son who graduated in civil engineering from one of AmericaÂ’s top colleges, for example, is now teaching in a secondary school instead of working in construction.<br><br>Lawyers have become journalists or musicians and doctors are now managers. An IT graduate I befriended is a professional photographer and a few trained biologists have done well in sales.<br><br>Cases of people working in jobs unrelated to their training have become so common that interviewers have stopped asking candidates questions like: Â“Why should a trained scientist like you want to work as a junior executive with us?Â”<br><br>In the past, parents used to send their children to study accountancy, law or engineering, the so-called secure careers, and see them move single-mindedly into these professions.<br><br>A doctor was then a doctor, a biologist generally worked in the lab and a civil engineer, more often then not, would end up wearing a hard hat Â– square pegs in square holes, so to speak.<br><br>Scattered stories of graduates working outside their studies have been around for some time, but the numbers really took off around the mid or late-90s.<br><br>The reason was two-fold: the large loss of industrial jobs to countries like China and India, and new economic demands that cause some jobs to disappear and others to flourish.<br><br>People were also responding to SingaporeÂ’s own economic restructuring to move into higher technology and services that required retraining and reorganising of the labour market.<br><br>The economic downturns of Sept 11 (2001) and the SARS crisis (2003) caused large unemployment Â– and career dislocation.<br><br>In the first half of 2001, for instance, four in 10 of the 9,000 people retrenched were executives and 16,500 tertiary-educated Singaporeans were jobless by September. This resulted in professionals having to move into new unrelated work.<br><br>In the years ahead, multiple skills and career flexibility will be a fact of life as a result of further changes. Careers will blow hot and cold due to rising and falling demands.<br><br>In some years, skills like IT, construction or accountancy would be in demand; in others, especially now, it would be personal banking, healthcare or teaching.<br><br>Â“Any professional sticking to one career choice or skill stands the chance of being left behind,Â” said an executive head-hunter.<br><br>Whether working in Singapore or abroad, the ideal 21st Century graduate will be one who is anchored to one or two disciplines but who has also covered a spread of diverse elective courses.<br><br>To its credit, before the world economy changed, the government argued that economic restructuring had to begin in education.<br><br>Today, eight out of 10 Singaporean students get post-secondary education that is steadily moving into a multi-faceted approach.<br><br>Firstly, it abandoned the old exam-oriented model and adopted a large part of the American system.<br><br>The two biggest universities, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, now allow students to pursue courses outside their immediate fields of specialisation.<br><br>This is filtering downwards to schools. By end-2007, upper secondary students in 40 schools will be offered 40-hour courses in five polytechnics.<br><br>Â“We'll cover subjects like tourism services (accommodation, food and beverage, and tour planning), IT, Media and Design, Chemical and Life Sciences as well as Game Design,Â” an official explained.<br><br>This will move to the pre-teens with the opening of SingaporeÂ’s first Â“primary school of the futureÂ” in 2008 (with 14 more by 2015) to prepare children for a life dominated by technology and information.<br><br>Â“We want to teach children from young to be comfortable with the latest technology,Â” said a senior official.<br><br>Increasingly, students will be offered a wider range of courses and electives, allowing school dropouts to have a better crack at a meaningful job.<br><br>Some special schools are moving into non-academic studies. A case in point is North Light School where students can be seen playing games on Xbox 360 consoles during classes.<br><br>At Townsville Primary, a small supermarket has been set up, at which children take turns to work Â– giving them lessons in arithmetic and working skills.<br><br>When the two S$10bil (RM22.9bil) casino resorts open in 2010, further career shifts will likely follow. You may well find a medical practitioner working in a casino Â– and I donÂ’t mean in a clinic either. </div></blockquote></div>

During the selling process, some people have difficulty saying "no" and will actually tell you that they are interested in order to avoid potential conflict.

Once the blueprints is in their hands, bye bye intellectual property.<br><br>I would be very careful about what I say about China's research and technological capabilities.
