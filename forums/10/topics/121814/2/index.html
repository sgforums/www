In fact if propriety or decorum is extended to citizens in solving and not grossing over of problems there will be plentiful propriety and decorum extended to parliament, speakers, judges and the collective leadership. This is a 2-way process to be cultivated by MPs and the house speakers as a true spirit of parliament. May be he should explain this matter in the next sitting so as to give a more balanced view of the hushed remarks of Dr. Ong which should not be quickly a matter for censor.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
