            <div class='col-md body'>In political and economic terms, it is reasonable for Japan to have a permanent seat. The seat holders for the security council is based on a old system in which is reserved for the major victors of world war two. 60 years later, we see that new political and economic heavy weight surfaced while the influence of some of the permanent members go down hill. If we will to continue to based the security council on a old going-to-outdate system, stability wont be governed optimumly.<br><br>We need political and economic heavy weights to be in the security council. Their presence means that economic and political advises can be given readily, actions can be done effectively. To be honest, i see that Japan have more weight than Russia and France. If thats the point, why shouldnt they be given a place in the security council?<br><br>Singapore was elected without objection into the security council as a non-perm member a few years ago because of the fact that our political and economic weight is significant. We have to be grateful that the world sees our importance and not our physical and historical insignificances. Since we made it into the security council because of wise judgement, why shouldnt we support another country whom truely deserve the position?<br><br>Although Japan just surfaced from depression this year and China is rising at a amazing pace, we cant say that Japan is falling. Japan have the largest national reserve of a few trillion dollars far ahead of the second runner up. Japan can be considered by far as a small nation while at the same time, it holds the second most technologically powerful and third largest in the world. It's industries are substaining high annual growth, penetrating a wide spread of markets and by far succeeding rivals by a distance in terms of technology, innovation and quality.<br><br>The problem about Japan now is that it refuses to admit it's war time atrocities. The world intepret their lack of remorse through loud actions such as the historical whitewashings and it's governmental visit to the yasukuni shrine. As japan is refuting any allegations, germany on the other hand is officially taken up responsibilities on it's historical wrong doings. The lack of resonsibility in japan and the sincerity of germany made matter worse.<br><br>To be honest and as i try not to be politically bias, i think that it is a sin to deny the surfacing of historical truth. It is not just politically wrong and not just an act of dishonesty, but i see it as a sin. Denial of historical events is denial of historical truth which is in turn can be considered as cheating and lying to the mass public and your future generation. Historical facts are there for which lessons are to be drawn. Lessons drawn are to enlight our future generation and it is through this perpentual enlightenment that we humans became a better entity. It is lessons from history that taught us to work, to love, to trade and to fight together. It is from simple sentences in our history text books that lead to major decisions made which benefit the life of people somewhere on earth. All in all, cheating truth, denying the facts, lying to your future generation is nothing but a sin.<br><br>Mr Lee is being pragmatic in his support of Japan's bid for a permanent seat. I see no fault in it. He also made a gentle but clear comment that Asians are uncomfortable with Japan's action towards historic-irresponsibility. He also brought up Germany as a role model in this case. I dont know how China would react but on how China should reaction, in my opinion, is to say nothing or at least dont be in a position to condemm Singapore. Why?<br><br>Japan's seat in UN will not affect China's position in global leadership in any significant extent. While the world sees that Japan is important, the world wont be dumb to treat china is a sick dragon. Would the world not heed or at least listen to the chinese opinion? I dont think so. The problem about Japan is that, it is highly possible that she will be an american loyalist. However as we know that decisions in the security council are frequently influenced by america and even if it is not so, nothing can stop america's foreign policy, i dont see how would it worsen China's position. In another words, with or without Japan, US still have a comparative advantage in the council.<br><br>For many years to come, North korea will still be a East Asia security pandora box. The situation in north korea is commune to East asia and the pacific rim stability. China and Japan share a common objective in which is a disarmed north korea is a national interest. I strongly believe the security council will put in more efforts to stablised the region as Japan sees the korean crisis as a national piority as well as a global interest. Japan and China can influence US to step down alittle while she add on more to the affair. This will ease the uneasiness of uncertainity behind the questioned motive of US pushing for a disarmed north korea which hindered many advancement.<br><br>The Chinese word for crisis is 'wei ji'. While 'wei' is for danger, 'ji' is for opportunity. Japan's seat in UN could very possibly be a danger but if the Chinese and the Japanese will to understand their mutual importance, work towards unity and stability, the Japanese entry can well be seen as an opportunity for China and Japan to work towards many common goals. The entry of Japan can be seen as giving the world an opportunity to be much more stable.<br><br>All these, the interest of China.<br><br></div>
