            <div class='col-md body'>If Japan had not denied their history or tried to give excuses for their invasion of Asia from 1933 to 1945, East &amp; South East Asia wouldn't have this problem right now.<br><br>Germany didn't try to deny their history and has sincerely apologized many times over 60 years to other European members- not only during the time when people remember the various events of WWII- but also during times when it was unexpected.<br><br>That's why in June 2004, the German leader joined in the Normandy Beach celebrations with the French President and the American President- all three pledging not to allow such a conflict to happen again. And again Gerhard Schorder(sp) pledged that Germany will not forget what has happened in the past and regretted that Germany was a major player at that time- to its shame now.<br><br>Japan has done nothing of that sort since 1945. They have said stuff like "regrettably" but they have shown none of the sincerity and they have avoided addressing the issue as much as possible. They haven't even written an offical apology at all.<br><br>It's no wonder Asians find it hard to forget, let alone forgive.</div>
