Will he merge the PFP back with KMT?</div></blockquote>This will depend on current KMT chairman Ma-Ying Jeou or former chairman Lien Chan to influence James Soong to continue to ally with KMT. As earlier on there was report on the possibility on DPP ally with PFP but it was being rejected as during the parliamentary elections the Blue Party consist of KMT,PFP,NP and most of the people vote for KMT as they thought that PFP is belong to KMT so they vote KMT. The results were out and PFP have only 30 over seats dropped from the previous one so they are unhappy and reports said that they want to spilt. But the situation now is still confusing whether PFP spilt or merge from KMT.</div>

If there is a new faction of PAP, the faction would be crushed by the old PAP within a few days by the help of the police who are loyal to them. So I think that having a new faction of PAP is impossible and risky too. You remember what happened to BS last time a split faction of PAP? Many of their members went to jail and during 1968 they did a silly thing by boycotting the parliament resulting the PAP to sweep all the seats of the parliament.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that in a democracy, it is the duty of every government to actively promote the opposition. Apart from the obvious benefits of a strong opposition, a populace that is powerless to have its views heard through political means will ultimately have to look for alternative means of engaging in politics.

            <div class='col-md body'>Today the ST newspaper in the Insight section they reported on what are the tatics and targets for the opposition party. After reading I felt that the opposition party are really ready for the next general elections as they had make many house visits in different wards to ask the people to support and vote for them. Like example the WP are concentrating the NE area like Aljunied GRC, Nee Soon East and maybe even Sembawang GRC. While the SDA is on the south-west side like Jalan Besar GRC but also on Tampines GRC and Chua Chu Kang SMC for Steve Chia. While SDP is concentrating on the west side like Hong Kar Grc. So the question now is that when will the next general election will be held it must be lastest by 2007. One thing is that whether the opposition camp can field their members and win the support from Singaporeans to vote for them and this only depends on them whether they can do it a not</div>

I would welcome a commitment to restore the CPF cuts in their manifestos....but I haven't seen anything to that effect.<br><br>The WP, being the 'strongest' of the opposition party, last issued a manifesto in 1998. In it, there were commitments such as:<br><br>"2.3.1.1. The Party proposes to raise personal allowance to a total of $5,000.00 ($3,000.00 personal allowance plus $2,000.00 earned income relief).<br><br>2.3.1.2. The Party proposes to raise the allowance for dependent spouses (i.e. not just for wives as at present) to $2,000.00.<br><br>2.3.1.3. The Party proposes to raise child allowance to $1,000.00 per child."<br><br>But there was no discussion as to the financial impact of those tax cuts and how they intend to balance the budget. It does not inspire confidence.<br><br>The opposition will always have to do more than the incumbent, who has 40 years of track record. We know the PAP has managed to balance the budget although I disagree with many of their policies.

            <div class='col-md body'>Afraid there are frogs in the well who have no idea of what a proper manifesto should look like and yet dare to expose their ignorance. Take a look at one from the UK Conservative Party. They revealed how they were going to fund their policies by cutting back on certain programmes and civil service posts. This is just an abstract:<br><br>http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=manifesto.uk.lowertaxes.page<br><br>Just saying you will cut taxes will not cut any ice with me. Show me where you are are going to find the money. One reason the Conservatives lost the recent election is that economists looked at their figures and found they don't add up. There is a shortfall that must be made up by raising taxes or other means...<br><br>If the opposition in Singapore wants to be credible, it's time to pick your heads out of the sand and properly engage a discerning population.</div>

I think we should vote for CDC members like the PAP field some of their members to let us vote like what is being done in China. Even though like that  is not fair we still can vote for our most favoured person better than they put them the person they want and we may don't support that person at all and must have some equality</div>
