            <div class='col-md body'>I say that our opposition party has no hope. As they this few years only get a few seats in the parliament cannot win the citizens trust as everytime something happened not pleasent and not having trust. The Worker's Party, Singapore Democratic Alliance are still alright as they still speak out in a careful way not to harm the image of our country. But the worst opposition party in Singapore is the Singapore Democratic Party. They are the most shameless and useless party as everytime they attack the PAP which is still acceptable. But everytime go overseas they everytime say everything bad on Singapore which will spoilt the image and they never think properly at all just anyhow shoot like machine gun with no purpose or point. Dr Chee Soon Juan is the worst politician I have ever met in Singapore as he only talks blah blah all the way but never do any action at all! His attitude is also very not good as that time he accused SM Goh and MM Lee on the Indonesian thing on Ge 2001 but later say sorry. He is crazy man and should keep quiet and see that SM Goh and MM Lee sued him and he lost the contesting of the next GE and fined heavily. So I has lost the hope on our opposition party and hope that someone will revive it and become glorious. But I still support our government the PAP as they had done many contributions to Singapore and should thank them.</div>

If she want to regret do it herself personally and not Mr Goh to do it or else we think that she is too dependent on Mr Goh. Mrs Goh please do it personally and will support you one and thank you very much</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if the opposition parties were to have more seats in the parliament,those PAP leaders should have an open mindset first.Like i said before,those PAP leaders dont have "guts" to take on criticism from the public,media and especially from the opposition party members.They treat critics as a "challenge" to their position and afraid they would get embarrassed by the opposition members of their "wrong doings" if they were questioned on TV in the parliament.<br>This type of "take things too serious" attitude make those PAP leaders unwillingly to accept a strong opposition parties into the parliament.And hence,they keep thinking ways n means to stop opposition parties from winning a majority seats in the parliament.That is why the PAP leaders have to change their conservative,stubborn n out-dating mindset first in order for the opposing parties to set a foothold in Singapore.</div>
