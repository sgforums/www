            <div class='col-md body'>Do not talk about opposition party when most Singaporeans have "no balls" to vote for a two party system.  Everyone hopes that there are some opposition MPs in the parliament but he/she also hopes that the opposite MP be elected in a constituency other than his/hers.<br><br>Every Singaporean has been brainwashed to believe that if there is an incompetent government being elected, Singapore will dwindle into a ruin.  This is not true.  Most of the countries in the world are governed by relatively worse governments than ours but they still thrive.  Who dare say that these countries are not progressing.  They are not as good as us because they have a much bigger population.  If they are not progressing, why is it that Singapore is experiencing competition in economic development?<br><br>If only most Singaporean believe that there should be another group of competitors in the political arena, will Singapore see "real opposition" in the parliament.  Certainly, people like Chee Soon Juan should not be among the competitor group.<br><br>Singaporean must first be prepared for the worst before they can enjoy a more decomcratic political environment.  Democracy comes with a price.  It may first deliver some confusion and upset before it provides a more liberal environment.  Are Singaporean ready ?</div>

Even if the government is crap, other countries still have to buy agricultural produce from them. In short, they ahve their own supply of food and water while we have to depend heavily on KL for these.<br><br>I have to say, sovereignity without self-sufficiency is  not worth much.</div>
