            <div class='col-md body'>There is a difference between a small place like Singapore and a large country like USA.<br><br>There is definitely a trade off between civil liberty and the law that bans guns. Two spectrum of considertaions. To ban guns is to prevent small disputes between individuals turning into dangerous gun fights that may hurt innocents as well. Even in Singapore now, small disputes could turn into big fights creating casualties. The second consideration is to preven small arms to be used by robbers or any syndicates to commit crimes. Laws banning guns would probably be effective in achieving the first objective, but there is a trade off in the second; those victims of criminals would not be able to protect themselves against these criminals effectively.<br><br>For a big country like USA, there are people who live in isolated farms or ulu ulu places. Unlike in city areas, police officers could not reach you within minutes of call for help. Thus, personal defence and safety has to fall on each individuals. Having a gun could even out the odds against robbers. This is true.<br><br>However, in Singapore's context, we live in a ver compact style. With such density of residential population, pschological and physical stress may result in more frictions among the population. Thus, banning guns would be the wiser move. Even if criminals possess guns, it is not easy to escape from their crime scenes in such a compact city. You go bang bang, the whole neighbourhood will know. Unlike in USA, if you go bang bang in the ulu ulu place, nobody knows.<br><br>The harsh law on gun possession definitely has its effects on criminals. Criminals are not stupid people. If money is what they are after, no need to use gun that could endanger their own life if they get caught.<br><br>This has explained why there are less crimes committed with guns in Singapore, though we cannot completely eradicate the possibility.<br><br>However, in the context of a terrorist threat, the ground rules might have changed. It is not money that they are after but innocent lives and blood that they are after. Thus, the odds against the potential victims will increase. Whether releasing the rules on guns possession will help, is yet to be examined.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you on the gun laws. I hate guns and I feel they should not be allowed to be kept by members of the public.<br><br>I have had my life threatened by a certain person before. He is twice my size and many many times stronger. I am unable to report him to the police because he used a third party to convey his threats to me. For me to make this a police case will cause the third party to be implicated as well. So, now without the protection of the police, how am I to assure my safety?<br><br>FYI, I have practised martial arts before and I feel that I am too small sized to keep someone so many times bigger from hurting me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main threat we fear is that of terrorist. However, terrorist are normal people with an objective, unlike the insane, who kill at random. I believe that, if Singapore were to be more careful at how we present ourselves to the world, the threat of "carbombs" and attacks would cease to exist. Many governements love scaring its people into believing there are threats imminent and unpredictable. It is a good way to psychologically control the way the people act and think, especially towards election dates. But let us not be fooled.<br><br>With respect to laws on personal protection, i do not believe it is in Singapore's best interest to allow guns to be privately owned. It has worked well for us for many years, and i hope it would continue on. If one is distressed due to fear or threat of injury or death, the logical solution is to lodge a police report. That is their job, so allow them to do it. We have to help them, to help us. Even if nothing comes about due to lack of evidence and probability, at least it has been laid down on paper for future reference. It would be useful if something actually happens to u.</div>
