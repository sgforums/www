              <p>PM Lee is just short is saying that!</p>
              <p>National Day belongs to all Singaporeans, says PM Lee</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said National Day is an event that belongs to all Singaporeans regardless of their background, race or religion. And he is glad that in recent years, community groups have taken the initiative to organise celebrations.</p>
              <p>One of them is the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations.</p>
              <p>On Sunday night, Mr Lee joined the federation in its annual National Day mass singalong at the HDB Hub in Toa Payoh. He noted that the federation has played an important role in promoting Chinese culture and language. It has also been reaching out to other community groups, and Mr Lee said this has helped to build a stronger sense of unity. Mr Lee has just been named the federation's first patron in its 25-year history.</p>
              <p>He said: "I hope we can strengthen the communication between the government and the Chinese community, and better understand the community's view on issues. I also hope the clan associations can renew themselves, and contribute further to Singapore's development."</p>

              <p>Extracted from Stomp : Foreigners shoo family away from Botanic Gardens landmarks because they "booked it"</p>
              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>
