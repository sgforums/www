              <p><strong>Nuclear plants are safe, and have a good track record.</strong>  So
              far, none "blew" up in a mushroom cloud.  Chernobyl was a
              Soviet Reactor, and if anyone of you ever bought any product made
              in a socialist economy, you will know its quality is horrible.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, gas power plants have a greater propensity to
              blow up due to its explosive nature.   </p>
              <p>I think the only problem with building a nuclear power plant is
              a matter of lead time for construction, international safety
              approvals etc.  It can take 10 - 25 years... who knows whether
              by then the output will be sufficient or not. </p>

              <p>Although there are no catastrophic Chernobyl-esque explosions ever since the turn of the century, one can never assume that there are no cover-ups of negligence by private or even government nuclear companies. As can be seen in this link, there are smaller incidents that do not make it into world news headlines. (<a title="List of civilian nuclear accidents" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents)</a></p>
              <p>With nuclear materiel, even a small radioactive leak will be enough to contaminate groundwater which even the best osmosis procedures from Hyflux cannot fix.</p>

              <p>Like any SG policy, it reeks of business interests. Obviously, there's going to be lots of money involved and any environmental or social benefits will be peripheral.</p>
              <p>The nuclear option isn't really renewable since uranium or plutonium could be said to be limited. And even if we extended the lifespan of the nuclear option through other fuels like thorium, the high-cost associated with it doesn't make it a solution if the goal is energy-independence, liberating a society from energy and money interests.</p>
              <p>News of advances in solar technology, <a href="http://www.ecoinstitution.com/green-news/the-future-of-solar-renewables-new-quantum-%E2%80%93-dot-photovoltaics/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news199962208.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39807/113/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/mit-solar-cell-on-paper/">here</a>, constantly promise us low-cost, abundant, renewable energy. However, they rarely make their way into the mass market, available to the majority of society. Why? Could it be that it isn't in the interests of energy companies to give people access to abundant energy? If energy were in such abundance that it becomes cheaply available like how coke is cheaper than water in some countries, wouldn't that be an incentive against promoting and developing solar power? In that same breath, what does it say about a system that intentionally suppresses efficiency for the sake of monetary profit?</p>
              <p>The alternative of solar, wind, tidal, wave and geothermal could easily power the world if the establishment were really set on doing it. But in an age of bigger and bigger governments, why would you want to liberate people, which might lead them to question authority. People are easier to manage when stressed by trying to meet the cost of living (WTF is that?! We have to pay simply to live?), chained to their jobs.</p>

              <p>Did ur "Experts" or "Expats" take up Singapore citizenship n live "Permanently" in here?If they do,how many of them?I bet after cheating the PAP government money,they run away n hide in their countries enjoying their lives.</p>
              <p>So now,LHL listen to these "Experts" or "Expats" who say they can build nuclear plant for Singapore n it would be safe.But then,do they stay behind n live with us together in here for the rest of their lives,just to make sure its safe?No,they will earn the money after building the nuclear plant,n went back to their countries,call some hookers n enjoy their lives.</p>
              <p>And if any disasters happen,they will just said"Hey i dont know,i have already give instruction to the engineers in Singapore.How the hell the nuclear reactors blow up,i have no idea,i am not going to be responsible for it."Then shrug their shoulders n carry on their lives.</p>

              <p>Contrary to popular belief, Nuclear Reactors these days are much safer, especially the Gen 3 and Gen 3+ that are emerging, as well as the Gen 4 reactors, which is currently in building in Japan and China. Also, radioactivity are contained well within the cooling waters and the waste casings. The wastes casing can withstand a train wreck with nothing but a slight scratch as evidence and it requires almost no maintenance. The stigma of Chernobyl Disaster still exists BUT there has only been 1 Nuclear Reactor accident in the past century with more than 5 fatalities, as compared to the hundreds by other energy-production facilities like Coal and Gas power plants.</p>
              <p>The Chernobyl Disaster is due likely to its reactor design which has been vastly improved upon and unlikely that it will be targetted as systems these days are geared towards PREVENTING the processing of uranium waste into weapons-grade enriched nuclear material.</p>
              <p>I support the existence of nuclear power plants as it will significantly reduce emissions and also electricity bills, which in turn will gear towards increased manufacturing and 24/7 systems such as business and trade, driving the economy to another level.</p>
              <p>In fact, with recycling of nuclear waste, we can expect to extend the world's power life expectancy by a few hundred years, alongside with existing fossil fuel-based reactors.</p>
              <p>And if there's war, with or without a Nuclear Plant, what are Singapore chances in surviving either way, especially with the existence of long-range artillery in China, India, N. Korea and the mobile naval/aerial fleet of other countries + compactness of our city buildings.</p>

              <p>Reactor design or safety systems regardless, the cause of the Chernobyl Disaster - just like many other smaller incidents in advanced countries like Japan - was caused by the human factor - negligence, ineptly equipped or trained operators, etc. - in Chernobly's case, Wikipedia has this to say:</p>
              <blockquote> In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations 
                  of operating rules and regulations. "During preparation and testing of 
                  the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary 
                  load, <strong>personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems 
                  and breached the most important operational safety provisions for 
                  conducting a technical exercise."<sup id="cite_ref-atom_57-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#cite_note-atom-57"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> This was probably due to their lack of knowledge of <a title="Nuclear reactor physics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_physics">nuclear reactor physics</a> and <a title="Nuclear engineering" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering">engineering</a>,
                   as well as lack of experience and training.</strong> According to these 
                  allegations, at the time of the acciden<span style="text-decoration: underline;">t <strong>the reactor was being operated 
                  with many key safety systems turned off</strong></span>, most notably the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Emergency Core Cooling System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Core_Cooling_System">Emergency Core Cooling System</a> (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power 
                  reduction system). Personnel had an insufficiently detailed 
                  understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor,
                   and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion.</blockquote>
