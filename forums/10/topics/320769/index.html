              <p><span class="postbody">Our self-glorifying leader again claims success in his leadership all over the news boasting to world leaders how successful we are everywhere.</span></p>
              <p>Let us see how successful is our type of government.</p>
              <p><span class="postbody">If we have indeed a good economy do we have to have so
                  many workers earning $800.00 pm and so many people above 45 having
                  problems in finding employment.
                  <br> <br>Is a good government one which gives all sorts of excuses to tax
                  the people, withholds spending on basic government services in the name
                  of avoiding welfarism and charge all kinds of fees for services which
                  should have been provided from taxation.
                  <br> <br>Are we enjoying the fruits of our labor from 40 plus years of
                  paying all kinds of taxes fees and charges even for the most basic
                  transportation, housing utilities and medicare?
                  <br> <br>If we have a good government why are we having so many people who
                  are unable to retire or withdraw their CPF at 55 as originally planned
                  many years ago. <br> <br> Isn't there a total fiasco in the whole CPF and retirement scheme. So
                  how can we call this kind government good and competent government?
                  <br> <br>If we have a good government why is it the taxes collected are
                  withheld and why increase the GST when we are running a $6.5 billions
                  surplus.
                  <br> <br> If we have want to avoid welfarism at least let people survive with whatever they earn and keep taxes to the bare minimum.
                  <br> <br> Only when there is such a balance will we be able to avoid welfare.
                  <br> <br>Because government squeezes them at both ends by taxing them and
                  making them to pay for all services government today has to shoulder a
                  large section of population who could not make ends meet due to such
                  double whammy and has to make a "U" turn to welfare which it claims to
                  be avoiding.
                  <br> <br>So the moral of the story is that a good government is not one
                  which only talks and looks good but one which is honest and caring and
                  will look after the citizens and one which keeps taxing and charging
                  fees and indulges in profiteering schemes like double and triple taxes
                  on transportation and double charging on lands acquired for low-cost
                  housing built on lands acquired for low cost housing?
                  <br> <br>If we have a government which is open and accountable and willing
                  to admit mistakes accept criticisms and problems as has happened too
                  often and recently in the Mas Selamat we will have a truly good
                  government.
                  <br> <br> Why engage in propagandas and hypocrisy instead of practising acceptable good and accountable efficient government.
                  <br> <br>If the success is a matter of playing the property or share market
                  through taking a ride on world recovery or bull run once in a while?
                  What kind of success is that?
                  <br> <br>Let us see the true success by engaging growth of practical
                  knowledge applications motivating the citizens through good practical
                  education, mass participation in democracy without all the craps about
                  rule of law or promiscuity of democracy at all levels and not rely on
                  claims about success relying on superficial temporary economic or
                  property recovery as our ministers are doing.
                  <br> <br>In terms of restructuring the economy to value-adding technology
                  driven or knowledge-based economy there is no sign yet this is taking
                  root or happening. We have to transform the education system to fire up
                  all citizens to apply their practical knowledge all fields. Otherwise
                  we have to keep importing citizens to make up the missing number.
                  <br> <br>Let the truth come out and see whether we have a truly successful
                  government or a country which is closely knit and cohesive society
                  where every one is truly equal without being divided like now by dirty
                  politicking or government using its political power to sue active
                  citizens to keep staying in power and claiming superficial success.
                  <br> <br> <br> What is success?<br></span></p>

              <p>The Bearable Bear,</p>
              <p>Please note that I have defined my views on what constitute a successful government. If you have something substantial to say let us see your views. If you cannot show us your views with logic, then my views stand. It is not a matter of my verbose posting on this matter. It is the duty of every good citizens to give his views and it will not be a good leader to call such citizens names as he has been doing. This alone shows we do not  have a good government.</p>
