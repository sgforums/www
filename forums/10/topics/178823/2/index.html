            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry if it seems like i'm hijacking  this thread:<br><br>but I wonder why incidents like abu gharib evokes so much passion and talk ...<br><br>while something much closer to home goes almost un-noticed ?<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=178986" rel="nofollow">Malaysia's "Abu Gharib" ... </a><br><br>some people practise "Selective Idealism" perhaps ? ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>to me, some people hate the US for doing all these things, but of course, this hatred goes a lot deeper than that, some stem from religion, we all are aware of that, it's somewhat amusing, if it wasn't so tragic, that in so many parts of the world today, from algeria to venezuala, any wrong in their society today gets blamed on the US, ironic, if you think of how other other countries would be crying out for US help whenever disaster strikes ... some stems from the jealousy and envy of the US, for like it or not, no one in the world today comes close to besting the military or economic might of the US today. that's why even supposed allies like germany and france are quite happy to trip up Uncle Sam's plans at every chance ....<br><br>the above is a non-normative, and cynical take of what I see in the world today, and now for my personal opinion: I'm quite happy and content to see a uni-polar world dominated by the US, for "the good in the US will correct the bad" ... let's put it this way, supposed these abuses were committed  by some other country, do you think they would ever see the light of the day ? ... one good example would be Russia's conquest of Afghanistan, that took place barely 20 years before the Americans went into the place ... lots of people literally disappeared during that period, ditto chechenya .... remember that all these abuses were not  uncovered by some foreign intelligence services, but got blown to the New York Times by serving members of the US military .... that is the key thing, as much as the US tries to practise realpolitik, she'll have citizens concerned enough, and willing to stand up, to do the right thing, because her citizens enjoys "freedom", and are willing to embrace it (freedom ... with all that it implies) ...<br><br>of course, this is not a popular opinion in the world today, I do not have the illusion though, that the US is a perfect country ... she's far from it of course, ...  but i would rather that the biggest, meanest, bully in the neighbourhood is Uncle Sam than a lot of other countries I know ... if the roots of your dislike and hatred are religious in nature, then kindly ask yourself if you've been brainwashed by dogma, and try to step back and take a look again ... if not, do the same ... decide if what i've said about the good correcting the bad of the US is true.<br><br></div>
