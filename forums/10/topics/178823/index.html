One event that leads to another...<br><br>Saddam gassed the kurds, we like to condemn that action, inhuman, WMD, yada yada yada. How would you react in Saddam's shoe? How would other leaders react? saddam did what a good and strong leader would do, minimize death and suffering by his people by bringing the war to the enemy, quick and decisive.<br><br>The US claims they attacked iraq regarding some wmd. You can't be THAT stupid to accept that filmsy reasoning right? It was an excuse! What could be the real reason? I may never know but I believe oil was a driving factor.<br><br>Is it wrong for the americans to torture inmates in abu gharib? Since many forumers believe that it is "expected", "acceptable" and "understood" that muslims around kill danes, priests and conduct terrorism because of some pictures, why can't the americans torture known felons?<br><br>The reason for torture can be very diverse in fact. It is wrong to torture for fun, for the heck of it and "because others are doing it".<br><br>But time critical information, CIA interrogation for information, all these are done to save lives. Torture and hurt (NOT KILL) a few felons to save a few hundred of your own countrymen, that's worth a shot.<br><br>Also, abu gharib is a jail. Its not a hotel. There are no soft beds, gold taps and thick carpets. Don't expect VIP treatment by the soldiers who are already incensed that your fellow jihadists are killing their friends and colleague. You and your friends have been kidnapping and murdering soldiers and civillians alike.<br><br>Why don't you complain about changi prison's lack of beds, forced haircuts and lack of privacy?<br><br>If you do not want to have hundreds of muslims killing your people, don't publish offensive pictures of their prophet. If you do not want to get tortured in abu gharib, then don't conduct terrorism.<br><br>A disclaimer for the stupid:<br><br>I do NOT worship the white man. I've seen their "superior" behaviour and its disgraceful. I think most of them are dumb anyway. Chinese and indians are WAY smarter than them.<br><br>I DO NOT SUPPORT TORTURE FOR THE SAKE OF IT, FUN, FOR POLITICAL OPPRESSION OR BECAUSE THE JONESES ARE DOING IT.<br><br>I believe in the sanctity of life, ironically. TO SARCRIFICE ONE OR TWO TERRORIST TO SAVE ONE OR TWO HUNDRED OF YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY AND COLLEAGUES IS RIGHT.</div>
