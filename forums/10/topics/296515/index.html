COE has come down and the lifespan of taxi has also been extended. Taxi companies should rightly pass all these savings to cabbies but they are not.<br><br>Anyway, i doubt the fare adjustment is to help the cabbies cope with soaring operating costs. Didn't ComfortDelgro said that it is to better meet supply and demand? And didn't some tourists complain that they have to wait for more than a hour for a cab?</div>
