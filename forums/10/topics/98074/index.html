DO YOU GAIN THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE by instilling FEAR in them?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>On his other remark "'For a simple reason. I can't even speak proper English,' he said, professing that he can't even pronounce the letter 'R' properly ", obviously not everybody who speak proper English had a "swift rise" in EDB. Reading it the other way, he seems to say that "scholarship holders can have a swift rise to the top even if he can't speak proper English. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> everybody in EDB work hard also you know, minster minister....be fair to them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Take for example you getting a warning from an authority, be it a warning from a TP, a teacher, your parents, your boss etc. Now, after this warning, what is your thought? That you should be careful least the warning becomes a punishment. This, I afraid is what goes on in the mind of most people when they get a warning or a unfriendly rebuttal.</div>
