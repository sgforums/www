            <div class='col-md body'>That is why India is now the shining star in the South Asia; largest pool of IT talents who had ventured successfully into forming Googles, Yahoo &amp; Infosys etc. In addition, there are also big established industrial players like Tata group &amp; Hindistan Aerospace. Strong banking finacial sector as well.<br><br>Dun forget there is a cery sizable of Indian IT professionals behind the success of the American Silicon Valley. These Indian professionals formed the backbone of the vital R&amp;D teams in big IT players like Microsoft, Cisco &amp; Sun Computers. The fresh Indian talents also filled the seats of the top Ivy League universities in states. Just look at Nasa, Boeing and even Bank of America, you will be surpise to find many important job functions are filled by Indian nationalities.<br><br>India has the every potential and capability to become the next emerging power in the East. Her huge middle income group, most benefited from the IT boom in India, is cash rich and ready to spend on quality goods and services. This market is still untapped and has the  potential to grow.<br><br>But some of the out dated laws and political factors are stillholding back the India development. We will definitely see more changes when the fresh pool of young and talented Indian politicans, with international exposures, emerge into the Indian gov cabinet. India is also banking heavily on her huge pool og IT talents to fuel her industrial amibition in 21st century.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to also consider the possibility of Mumbai's readiness for a disaster:<br><br>For years they have suffered from seasonal rain, which traditionally floods their area, after months of the scorching sun. The psychological readiness for the pending disaster, along with the infrastructure support, is probably pivotal to the fast recovery to that city.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup which is why I said... Don't know whether its true a not.<br><br>Anyway, there was another article by an American in ST I think 2 weeks ago, he was saying that the response time if the same incident happened in Singapore would have been better than the Americans.
