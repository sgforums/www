              <p><strong>WASHINGTON (CNN)</strong> -- The top military and civilian
              leaders of the U.S. Air Force were forced out Thursday over the
              handling of nuclear weapons, the Defense Department secretary said.</p>
              <p>Chief
              of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley and Secretary Michael W. Wynne
              resigned over the department's concern over two incidents, including
              the August flight of a B-52 bomber that flew across the country with
              nuclear weapons.</p>
              <p>"Focus of the Air Force leadership has drifted"
              in terms of handling nuclear weapons and equipment, Defense Secretary
              Robert Gates said.</p>
              <p>In August, a B-52 bomber flew from North
              Dakota to Louisiana with the crew unaware that six nuclear-tipped
              missiles were on board. Four officers were relieved of duty afterward,
              including three colonels.</p>
              <p>Gates also cited this year's discovery
              that components designed to arm and fuse nuclear warheads were
              accidentally shipped to Taiwan in 2006.Â <span class="cnnembeddedmoslnk"><a href="http://cnn.site.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Air+Force+officials+ousted+over+nuclear+gaffes+-+CNN.com&amp;expire=-1&amp;urlID=28967578&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2008%2FPOLITICS%2F06%2F05%2Fpentagon.firings%2Findex.html&amp;partnerID=211911#cnnSTCVideo"></a></span></p>
              <p>Critics
              also cite last month's news that the Air Force's 5th Bomb Wing failed a
              defense "nuclear surety" inspection -- despite having months to prepare
              and being under close scrutiny after the previous incidents. The
              inspection found deficiencies in the wing's ability to protect its part
              of the nation's nuclear stockpile.</p>
              <p>The resignations come after a
              report on a Navy admiral's investigation that criticized the Air
              Force's reactions to the incidents.</p>
              <p>Gates said the report
              "depicts a pattern of poor performance" in which Air Force brass didn't
              act to improve security after mishaps and Air Force personnel handling
              nuclear weapons consistently failed to follow existing rules.</p>
              <p>Air
              Force leaders "not only fell short in terms of specific acts, they
              failed to recognize systemic problems, to address those problems or,
              when beyond their authority to act, to call the attention of superiors
              to those problems," Gates said.</p>
              <p>The investigation found that
              although the Taiwan incident didn't compromise the integrity of the
              U.S. nuclear force, it represented "a significant failure" by the Air
              Force to ensure sensitive military components, Gates said.</p>
              <p>Gates
              said the report concluded that erosion in the branch's command and
              oversight standards helped lead to the incidents, and that they could
              have been prevented if the oversight programs had functioned correctly.</p>
              <p>He said he asked for the resignations after consulting President Bush.</p>
              <p>Sen. Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Service committee, welcomed Gates' decision.</p>
              <p>"Secretary
              Gates' focus on accountability is essential and had been absent from
              the office of the Secretary of Defense for too long," Levin said. "The
              safety and security of America's nuclear weapons must receive the
              highest priority, just as it must in other countries."</p>
              <p>Rep.
              Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and a senior member of the
              House Homeland Security Committee, also welcomed the resignations.</p>
              <p>Markey said he's long been concerned about what he called a series of dangerous Air Force missteps in handling nuclear weapons.</p>
              <p>"The
              magnitude and frequency of these errors indicate a deep-seated problem
              within Air Force culture, practice and training," Markey said. "The
              entire Department of Defense should immediately recommit itself to
              ensuring the safety and security of our nuclear stockpile before one of
              these mistakes has lethal consequences."</p>
              <p>A senior military source
              said the August nuclear weapons incident was the straw that broke the
              camel's back but that other leadership issues also factored into
              Moseley's and Wynne's resignations.</p>
              <p>A previous investigation into
              the B-52 flight uncovered a "lackadaisical" attention to detail in
              day-to-day operations at the air bases involved, an <a class="cnninlinetopic" href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/U_S_Air_Force">Air Force</a> official said in October.</p>
              <p>Maj.
              Gen. Dick Newton, assistant deputy chief of staff for operations, said
              the investigation found "a failure to follow procedures" by "a limited
              number of airmen" at the two bases. Newton defended the procedures
              themselves.</p>
              <p>Wynne is not the first secretary of a military branch to resign since Gates became Defense secretary.</p>
              <p class="cnninline">In
              March 2007, Gates announced the resignation of Army Secretary Francis
              J. Harvey in the wake of reports of substandard conditions at Walter
              Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.</p>
