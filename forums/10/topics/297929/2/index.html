Yet, you continue to throw allegations against them without first using this avenue? This is not a stupid hotline where you would not know if the person answering is the MP a not; this is a place for you to directly question the MP. Facts are facts, and I do not twist them.

If they encourage the hike, where do they get their fat super overpaid salary.  They have to continue to increase the taxi fares and other stuff to make sure they can continue to get super super world class pay.</div>

You are portraying them as stuck up people who will only listen and talk among themselves, and not the voices of the people. And if politicians are supposed to talk to politicians, why is there a need for meet-the-people sessions?

The same logic as to why an accuse need a lawyer to defend him.<br><br>Just like your other post that Singaporean like to just complain.
