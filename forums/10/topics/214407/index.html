He has been to 30 interviews but hasn't found a job. -- KELVIN CHNG<br>Mr M Lim, 46, said he has acute hearing loss in his left ear and is partially deaf in his right.<br><br>Now, the father of two teenage boys is trying to secure early withdrawal of his Central Provident Fund savings for his daily expenses.<br><br>In assessing his application, the CPF Board considered a medical report from Alexandra Hospital and another from Raffles Hospital.<br><br>A CPF Board spokesman said: 'Both doctors certified Mr Lim as not permanently unfit for any employment. (See report on next page.)<br><br>But Mr Lim has another story to tell.<br><br>He claimed he has gone for close to 30 interviews in the last five months. But has been unable to land a job.<br><br>Mr Lim's problems started about a year ago when he began to lose his hearing.<br><br>He would hear loud 'woo' sounds in his left ear which would bug him 'for 24 hours non-stop'.<br><br>The situation gradually worsened.<br><br>In March, he was diagnosed at Alexandra Hospital with asymmetric hearing loss - which results in different hearing levels between the left and right ears.<br><br>Usually this form of hearing loss can be cured if treatment is administered within the first three to four days. Otherwise, recovery may be difficult.<br><br>According to a hospital spokesman, Mr Lim suffered a 62.5 per cent hearing loss.<br><br>NEW CLAIMS<br><br>While speaking to The New Paper, Mr Lim made two other claims.<br><br>He said that he suffered a heart attack in mid-September and that he lost his hearing completely at the end of August.<br><br>He also claimed to be suffering from a bloated stomach earlier this month.<br><br>However, the Alexandra Hospital spokeman said they could not verify these claims as he has not been to the hospital in recent months.<br><br>Mr Lim's wife, 48, is also an accountant, while his sons, aged 15 and 17, are in secondary school.<br><br>Mr Lim claimed his hearing disability cost him his job as an accountant this year after working for two months at a company.<br><br>The company declined to comment on why Mr Lim left.<br><br>Mr Lim's last-drawn monthly pay was $3,200. Before this, he earned $4,250 monthly as a finance and administrative manager at a construction company, which has since folded.<br><br>He feels his handicap has been a major obstacle in looking for a new job.<br><br>'I answered advertisements for accountants or accounts executives. But somehow when I go for the interview, they seem to be able to tell I have a hearing defect.<br><br>'I think it's because I say 'excuse me' too many times and I always ask them to repeat what they just said.'<br><br>Mr Lim said he can hear when the speaker is standing close to him - but not if that person is 2m or more away.<br><br>But during his interview, The New Paper observed that he could carry out a conversation in person even though he did not use a hearing aid.<br><br>Why? Because we were seated less than 1m apart, he claimed.<br><br>Currently, his wife, who earns about $3,000 a month, is the sole breadwinner.<br><br>She declined to speak to us.<br><br>They live in a four-room flat in Potong Pasir.<br><br>Mr Lim's claimed his savings are now under $10,000.<br><br>He estimated that their average monthly household expenditure is around $3,000.<br><br>This includes about $600 for both his sons' tuition fees and about another $600 for his maid.<br><br>Too extravagant?<br><br>Mr Lim said he is keeping his maid only till her contract ends this month.<br><br>PUBLIC TRANSPORT<br><br>He tries to save, he said, by taking public transport instead of his eight-year-old car.<br><br>Why not sell the car then?<br><br>Because it will not fetch much, he said.<br><br>Instead, he has been trying for the past year to take out his CPF savings from both the ordinary and special accounts - 'easily about $300,000'.<br><br>But he can't because he is not yet 55, the minimum age for the withdrawal of CPF.<br><br>He is currently using $400 a month from his ordinary account to pay his mortgage, with another 15 years of repayments to go.<br><br>That adds up to about $72,000.<br><br>PERMANENTLY INCAPACITATED<br><br>A CPF Board spokesman said CPF members can apply for early withdrawal only if they are certified by a doctor to be 'permanently incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment, terminally ill or found to be of unsound mind'.<br><br>=================================================<br>What CPF Board says<br>October 10, 2006<br><br>A CPF Board spokesman said Mr M Lim's case was reviewed twice.<br><br>Besides looking at the medical report from Alexandra Hospital, they sent him to Raffles Hospital for a separate review by a specialist, paid for by the CPF.<br><br>The spokesman said: 'Both doctors certified Mr Lim as not permanently unfit for any employment. As such, we have informed Mr Lim that he is not eligible to withdraw his CPF monies early.'<br><br>She said if Mr Lim's condition deteriorates, he should provide the board with an updated medical report and his application would be reviewed again.<br><br>She added: 'As Mr Lim has indicated that he has difficulty getting a job, we have notified the Singapore Workforce Development Agency to assist him with his job search.' (See report below).<br><br>According to the CPF Board's 2005 annual report, the number of early withdrawals due to physical incapacity totalled 646 last year.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is bad but what i am trying to say is is there anyway to enhance his hearing or is it bad to the extend that nothing can be done in terms of medical aid? I know of hearing aid hardware and devices that can be worned to the ear like an in-ear type earphone. But i am not sure how much it costs and if its possible to use his medisave to pay for it. Calibration and maintenance of the device aside it may only be a one-time payment. If the accountant post is a deskbound job having a hearing aid should not affect this guy's ability to perform his duties.</div>
