              <p>While economists quibble, the world's richest man has
              decided: the United States is already in recession. So Warren Buffett
              tells German magazine Der Spiegel in an interview to be published on
              Monday.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">
              
              if(window.yzq_d==null)window.yzq_d=new Object();
              window.yzq_d['CnIcGXxseNI-']='&amp;amp;U=13f72kcar%2fN%3dCnIcGXxseNI-%2fC%3d606566.12660390.12976856.3272417%2fD%3dLREC%2fB%3d5257501%2fV%3d1';
              "It
              is perhaps not a recession in the way that economists would understand
              it... but people are already feeling the effects and it will be deeper
              and longer than people think," Buffett said on a visit to Frankfurt.</div>
              <p>Buffett,
              the 77-year-old chief of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company, blamed
              financial institutions for introducing instruments "they can no longer
              control" and said the "genie can no longer be put back in the bottle."</p>
              <p>Buffett,
              who overtook Bill Gates this year as the world's richest man, said he
              believed the financial markets should be more tightly regulated.</p>
              <p>According
              to the Forbes annual billionaire's list published in March, Buffett saw
              his wealth jump from 52 billion dollars last year to 62 billion,
              pushing Microsoft co-founder Gates into third position after 13 years
              at the top.</p>
              <p>US economic growth has slowed dramatically in recent
              months and a growing number of economists believe the world's largest
              economy will experience a recession during 2008 amid a housing slump
              and related credit crunch."</p>
              <p>Our GIC and Temasek CEO, PM, MM, SM have much to learn from such guru who have been more effective in investing monies than any one else on this planet.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story : Wealth creation is not to be left to any gut feel or pure economists or financial institutions alone as they failed because they were too over-confident of their instruments like hedging or rates or yields without looking at bigger fundamentals at work.</p>
              <p>MM Lee appears to play with the theory that what come down will always go up. In a different cup what is down may only stay at the bottom and not come up e.g. Citbank is becoming technically bankrupt and it is now realized it is quite wrong in his predicting it is the chance for Singapore to get to invest in it and lose more billions.</p>

              <p>How not to invest people's trust monies in an impulse in a major financial crisis is what GIC or Temasek should learn don't we think so?</p>
              <p>Now have GIC/Temasek made the right decisions in throwing away good monies after bad in recent forays like UBS, Citibank, Merry Lynch is part of this topic aren't they.</p>
              <p>If not what do we want to talk about? M/W should be humble and try to learn from these latest boo-boo and not invest in technically bankrupt financial institution as a result of incompetencies and lack of accountability in investing people's trust monies.</p>

              <p>Come on, this is just the internet and not get carried away. It is not an official parliamentary report on how to invest people's trust funds in overseas projects.</p>
              <p>Dr. Vivian will tell you that any feedbacks to official Reach will not get a response or in other words official feedbacks at the most are only instrument to allow venting of frustrations which will not be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>On this basis all the non-official websites of someone not even known who started sgforums will be ignored more and worth even less than 2 cents.</p>
              <p>So why not just relax and let us enjoy bantering of views and opinions and not behave like the point_blank trying to correct such people's views and opinions.</p>
