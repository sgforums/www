            <div class='col-md body'>Why can't   we ask the whereabouts of our CPF savings?  Is it so wrong to insist government show us what it is doing with<strong> OUR MONEY</strong> ?<br><br>And why is GIC so afraid to reveal the sums?  Government's explaination ("afraid of financial sabotage...)  is so <strong>stupid </strong> even a fool won't believe it!<br><br>Should'nt CPF board show the account books and assure Singaporeans that their CPF savings are in safe hands -  or properly invested?<br><br>Who should be held accountable if GIC invest CPF money  and lost heavily?<br><br>Will we ever know about such bad investments that went very wrong?<br><br>x x x x x x x x<br><br>Academic warns Singapore must overhaul CPF..<br><br>By Jame DiBiasio 06 September 2000<br><br>" Tinkering with the Central Provident Fund's parameters won't be enough to meet Singapore's social security goals.<br><br>The Singaporean government must stop its implicit taxation of its citizens through the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and give more weight to its fiduciary responsibility to them if Singapore is to sufficiently provide for its aged, says Mukul Asher, professor of public policy at National University of Singapore. He estimates that by 1998, the average balance members could withdraw upon retirement had declined to the equivalent of a mere 10 months' wages.<br><br>The <strong>table</strong> below illustrates this problem. Asher calculates the average monthly wage for a Singaporean, both including the CPF contribution and without, and the estimated lump sum that members will withdraw from CPF upon retirement. The problem is especially acute for women: Asher's numbers are a median between the higher salaries of men and the lower salaries of women. Considering Singapore has been a high-growth economy for decades, the numbers are alarming.<br><br><strong>For table please Refer:  http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/Political%20Freedom/financea060900.html</strong><br><br>CPF funds are invested by the Singapore government through vehicles such as the Singapore Government Investment Corp. (SGIC), Asher believes. The government does not say how CPF funds are invested, on what criteria or what returns they achieve. Although many observers have guessed the government invests CPF funds directly into infrastructure and public housing, Asher says the numbers don't support this view: it has persistently run large budget surpluses. That has led him to suspect CPF funds are largely invested offshore.<br><br>The professor cites anonymous SGIC executives as saying it aims for an inflation-adjusted annual return of 3-4% in Singapore dollar terms. He assumes if a 3.5% annual return was achieved from 1987 to 1999, when the average actual return to CPF members was 0.88%, then Singaporean citizens are being implicitly taxed the remaining 2.62% return, or S$2.3 billion ($1.4 billion) -- the equivalent of 20.9% of corporate and personal income tax revenue in 1999.<br><br>Government officials accept the need for change, Asher says. But so far the options they have floated, such as raising contribution rates allowed in accounts with higher interest rates or increasing the withdrawal age, are going to have only a minimum impact. The additional contributions required by individuals to sustain a monthly income in retirement of two-thirds their working salary are so high as to be unrealistic. �"Unless [the government] is willing to end the implicit taxation of CPF wealth, and unless it increases the weight given to its fiduciary responsibility to its members, the progress towards providing the adequate replacement rate will be limited," he says.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He calls for more public accountability for how CPF funds are invested and their returns, and for allowing CPF members to choose among allocations of varying risk.</strong></span> Individual annuity markets or similar options must also be developed. Asher will present his findings in Rayong, Thailand at a seminar sponsored by the World Bank and Thailand's Ministry of Finance later this month.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>simply love the topic of CPF. i have been working for 13 years , still cant see any money inside after buying a HDB flats.<br><br>will we get to see our money again? I agree, prolly no. the education minister has started hint us we will be paying our uni fees by ourselves base on his statistic of subisdies 75% yet our uni students still pay $5000-$6000/year. it come to staggering $24k without subsidies to study in singapore?   if our child study 4 year honours it mean $100K/child. if you have 2 child, $200k. we can jump off our precious HDB flats in no time.<br><br>if we let our child handle by themselves this amount, i dont think they can ever be free of debts, not to mention more problems for our birth rate.<br><br>will govt let our CPF pay for the uni fees for our child? if base on the top calculation, i dont think so because if they do, many elderly will use up their saving in no time and  govt have to spent money on them for the elder age.<br><br>sound passimistic? my idea: buy a house in JB and working in singapore. for those not rich when they retire, migrate to thailand/ malaysia. for those rich and educated, stay and pay the govt. for those middle class, migrate australia/ NZ/canada.<br><br></div>

I took a look at the HDB financial report recently and they are bleeding as well, taking government grant every year. You may want to take a look at it yourself by going to the hdb website. They post it there. The statement looks strange to me though so maybe, someone who is more financially trained can interpret it better than me.</div>

He estimates that by 1998, the average balance members could withdraw upon retirement had declined to the equivalent of a mere 10 months' wages.<br><br>The <strong>table</strong> below illustrates this problem. Asher calculates the average monthly wage for a Singaporean, both including the CPF contribution and without, and the estimated lump sum that members will withdraw from CPF upon retirement. The problem is especially acute for women: Asher's numbers are a median between the higher salaries of men and the lower salaries of women. Considering Singapore has been a high-growth economy for decades, the numbers are alarming.<br><br><strong>For table please Refer:  http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/Political%20Freedom/financea060900.html</strong><br><br>CPF funds are invested by the Singapore government through vehicles such as the Singapore Government Investment Corp. (SGIC), Asher believes. The government does not say how CPF funds are invested, on what criteria or what returns they achieve. Although many observers have guessed the government invests CPF funds directly into infrastructure and public housing, Asher says the numbers don't support this view: it has persistently run large budget surpluses. That has led him to suspect CPF funds are largely invested offshore.<br><br>The professor cites anonymous SGIC executives as saying it aims for an inflation-adjusted annual return of 3-4% in Singapore dollar terms. He assumes if a 3.5% annual return was achieved from 1987 to 1999, when the average actual return to CPF members was 0.88%, then Singaporean citizens are being implicitly taxed the remaining 2.62% return, or S$2.3 billion ($1.4 billion) -- the equivalent of 20.9% of corporate and personal income tax revenue in 1999.<br><br>Government officials accept the need for change, Asher says. But so far the options they have floated, such as raising contribution rates allowed in accounts with higher interest rates or increasing the withdrawal age, are going to have only a minimum impact. The additional contributions required by individuals to sustain a monthly income in retirement of two-thirds their working salary are so high as to be unrealistic. �"Unless [the government] is willing to end the implicit taxation of CPF wealth, and unless it increases the weight given to its fiduciary responsibility to its members, the progress towards providing the adequate replacement rate will be limited," he says.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He calls for more public accountability for how CPF funds are invested and their returns, and for allowing CPF members to choose among allocations of varying risk.</strong></span> Individual annuity markets or similar options must also be developed. Asher will present his findings in Rayong, Thailand at a seminar sponsored by the World Bank and Thailand's Ministry of Finance later this month.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>if u wan e ans, go ask them lo..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> or even sue them for not letting u know wheres ur own earn money gone 2... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
