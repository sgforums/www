WSO(fighter) seems interesting enough... flying in fighter aircraft and do weapons employment ... better than be hit on the ground.<br><br>Any idea what their training is like ? Tough ?

Perhaps the pilots among the 140 sqn have rosters to see who are assign as the WSO role, etc...</div>

I was thinking that Vipers WSO are still a full-fledge fighter pilots (different from the USN Tomcats WSO) given that the back seats have full flight authority. In case the pilot is injured, say, a bullet hit him and he is not capable to command the plane, in theory, the WSO is then responsible to bring the plane home. Its kinda like the WSO of the Apache or any attack helicopters.  I don't think the Vipers WSO cockpit is purposely built for weapon cueing and targeting only like the Tomcats or Tornadoes.<br><br>I think even F-111 WSO has the flight control stick and throttle, only in a less convinient position.</div>

Given shortage of manpower, wouldn't it be more flexible to have all pilots cross trained as WSO, but have a roaster system, eg. each pilot gets a six-month stinct in the WSO seat.  Makes sense in war time... And... it is also the policy of RSAF to rotate pilots into different sqn so that they can share knowledge across all sqn. You can be a Viper pilot today, but tomorrow you might be assign to fly the Skyhawks or Tigers.</div>

After that, then they will learn the art of being a WSO.<br><br>My friend told me that it's tough being a WSO, especially when he has to know what the pilot is doing.. at the same time doing his job.

Would it be like if so and so is ok but not quite good enough in certain skills, eg. dogfight, so when they stream the graduating pilots, they simply send the "not-good-enuff to be frontline fighter pilots" but "a waste to be a chopper of transport" pilots to the WSO school?<br><br>Would a pilot rather be a Viper WSO or an Apache pilot?
