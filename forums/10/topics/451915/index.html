              can you tell me how does a natural disaster increase the GDP of 
                  that country? Before a massive reconstruction is to take place, the 
                  whole bloody economic system is crippled and you have no OUTPUT for some
                   time. After the crisis, then only reconstruction can take place. But 
                  after reconstruction, the economic level may not reach the pre-crisis 
                  level. In the end, its still a net loss to the economy. What is 
                  happening right now is a very good example. Since the Japan Earthquake 
                  and Thailand Flood, the world's economy is still in a doldrum.</div>

              <p>Hi Mike, what I understand about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</a> is that its a very very gross calculation of productivity: one that includes both good as well as bad.<br> <br> GDP per se is a very gross and oft arbitrary measure as I explain. 
                  Suppose I asked you what was the GDP of an imaginary (undiscovered) 
                  tribal community  of 100 living in isolation from civilization- your 
                  answer would either be "don't know" or quite possibly "zero" since such a
                   subsistence culture does not requisite the need for currency in their 
                  daily interpersonal transactions- honour/ barter systems suffice- yet 
                  the community continues to thrive in so far as they have done so for 
                  eons. To state that such a tribal community were inferior to that of say
                   Swiss society (high GDP) without further specifications would be 
                  presumptuous if not chauvinistic to say the least- the wide difference 
                  in GDP of each society being largely the consequence of the 
                  establishment of local currency and exchange rates- subsistence farmers 
                  eat/ barter their own produce rather than trade it for money- thus the 
                  'lower' perceived GDP. In short, the isolated tribal community is no 
                  less a society merely because it does not have a complex and complicated
                   financial system as the so call industrialized countries have, <a href="http://www.famous-quotes.net/Quote.aspx?Not_everything_that_counts_can_be_measured"><em>"not everything that counts can be measured and not everything that can be measured counts"</em></a>~ A Einstein.<br> <br> There are also many versions of GDP presentable- for one, the <strong>per capita GDP</strong> of Fukushima has certainly gone up by many folds- once possibly a 
                  thriving community based upon tourism and nuclear energy related 
                  industry, 20+km of peri-nuclear reactor area is now a nuclear no-go zone
                   only admissible to nuclear clean-up/ monitoring teams- so ironically, 
                  per capita GDP has increased multifold- due both to the exodus of 
                  communities and clean up operations.<br> <br> Also, I have even read of clean up bill calculations higher than the 
                  USD250billion quoted- just depending on what you  total- annualized, his
                   could also possibly be higher than the original GDP of Fukushima prior 
                  to the disaster- e.g. fishing village/ nuclear energy facility: again 
                  suggesting that GDP is an inappropriate description of human 
                  development. <br> <br> The 2011 BP Oil Spill is another example of an avoidable disaster now estimated to cost US$40billion in costs [<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/02/bp-oil-spill-costs-hit-40_n_777521.html">Huffingtonpost.com</a>]-
                   compensatory and clean up- would the area's GDP rise with an intensive 
                  rebuilding and clean up effort now active in the affected areas?- Quite 
                  possibly: yet with the exception of the depraved, who would suggest that
                   the oil spill was in some way productive despite some GDP related 
                  parameters 'progressing'? <br> <br> Rgds,<br> C6</p>
