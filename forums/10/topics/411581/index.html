              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE : The National Family Council (NFC) is expanding its efforts to target a new segment of society - youths.
              <br> <br> It wants youths to embrace the idea of marrying and having children early, as part of their definition of success.
              <br> <br> But just how easy is that?
              <br> <br> "Getting married early? I think it may restrict you (from) things that you (want) to do," said one Singaporean. 
              <br> <br> "I want my own independence. I want to do whatever I want and not worry about having a family," said another. 
              <br> <br> Students in secondary or tertiary institutions are the new targets. 
              <br> <br> "We don't want youth to look at success purely in terms of having a 
              great education, and getting a good job and making good money. I think 
              the kid should also embrace the notion of having a good family as part 
              of their definition of success. So we have to look at other ways and 
              means of reaching out to the youth," said Lim Soon Hock, chairman of 
              National Family Council. 
              <br> <br> The council said it will use the new media platforms such as Facebook, 
              Youtube and Twitter, along with viral marketing methods to reach out to 
              Generation Y. 
              <br> <br> Another idea is through youth forums, where they can air their views on settling down.
              <br> <br> 22-year-old Uma Devi, a student of Singapore Management University, thinks the new strategy of giving youths a voice could work.
              <br> <br> She said: "It will be effective. At the same time, before a person wants
               to set up a family, they should be stable first. It'll be better to 
              work that out instead of driving at the youths."
              <br> <br> Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Vivian 
              Balakrishnan said: "Family as an institution in Singapore is under 
              stress. Many of the other things that we strive and spend so much time 
              on in life ultimately are all very transitory and sometimes quite 
              meaningless. 
              <br> <br> "But we want to emphasise the family. It's not because we need to 
              produce the next generation of economic workers. And it certainly isn't 
              just about pro-creation or fertility."
              <br> <br> NFC will hold a strategic planning workshop next month, where more details will be brainstormed and ironed out. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I think this is an unfair statement. If you put it this way, why are you still a pub owner only? Why can't you invest in a large space and compete with Saint James? Are you that lazy or incompetent too? Or you lack the financial backing and chance to strike it really big?</p>
              <p>Everyone plays a role in society. Every role is different. Some jobs seems to be glamourous, while others are shunned by many. We need people to fill the roles. Not everyone can fit in. There are many who are capable but lack chance, because there is a lot of limitation here.Lady Luck does not smile on everybody. The ITE boy you said was probably daring to venture out and think out of the box to achieve that salary. However, had he been unlucky and met some crisis, I doubt you can sing that tune you just did.</p>
              <p>We had evolved dramatically from the pass 40 years. Our focus has never changed. Economic growth first. This fact stays. With good growth, we create jobs. Without it, I doubt I can comfortable sit at home and type this message.</p>
              <p>Some of us look for stability, while others are adventurous to try new 
              things.From my perspective, I doubt many are willing to settle down early. At least not without the financial sustainability put in check first.</p>

              <p>Because ITE working full time as sales man so get $8k/ month?</p>
              <p>If I were to work full time as a tutor, I can definitely get higher and would not be complaining. Problem is, I have yet to even complete a basic degree.

              <p> </p>
              <p>got money = can have a romantic wedding, honeymoon, pay for your HDB deposit, no need worry about renovation, can have kids like at about 26 (tts if you are fast) without worrying to find money for your hospital bill, money to buy milk powder, money to send your kids to pre-nursery, nursery, kindergarden, primary school when tuition sets in if your kid happens to be a little slow, den u have to buy iphone ( WAHAHAHA) for your kid, not only just yourself........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all is money money money. seriously. A lot of pple wish to settle down fast because they know sooner or later they have to do it but within this LOTS of pple, how many can actually do this comfortably? </p>
