              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I think this is an unfair statement. If you put it this way, why are you still a pub owner only? Why can't you invest in a large space and compete with Saint James? Are you that lazy or incompetent too? Or you lack the financial backing and chance to strike it really big?</p>
              <p>Everyone plays a role in society. Every role is different. Some jobs seems to be glamourous, while others are shunned by many. We need people to fill the roles. Not everyone can fit in. There are many who are capable but lack chance, because there is a lot of limitation here.Lady Luck does not smile on everybody. The ITE boy you said was probably daring to venture out and think out of the box to achieve that salary. However, had he been unlucky and met some crisis, I doubt you can sing that tune you just did.</p>
              <p>We had evolved dramatically from the pass 40 years. Our focus has never changed. Economic growth first. This fact stays. With good growth, we create jobs. Without it, I doubt I can comfortable sit at home and type this message.</p>
              <p>Some of us look for stability, while others are adventurous to try new things.From my perspective, I doubt many are willing to settle down early. At least not without the financial sustainability put in check first.</p>

              <p><br>Fair or unfair is each individual thinking, to me, the society had so far, being fair to me, a young of man of age 27yo complaining these and that, cannot take the hardknock of life and family life, now then i understand why MM said, "I am worry about our young, they cannot take hardship of life like their parent or grandparent did, today young lack of patient and demand alot"</p>
              <p>With more of these type of young men around, I feel so sorry for singapore future. Learn to be more creativity and if got opportunity, do some business, dun alway think of being a labour for other, let other be a labour for you. So, what if you complete yr degrees, the whole street are full of it, end up also working for other, then with a degree you start to demand for higher paid and end up not getting it and start to get frustrated, there are many opportunities in the singapore economy for you to move in, just open your eyes and use your cowsense, from selling foods to renting rooms, go for it, singapore in future will be a big tourist and immigration hub, there is a need to increase transportation, foods, rooms and resting places. Hotel81 boss start with a small room for rental, he go on and start getting frens to join him to build 3 storeys out of it and from there, expanded with loan from banks, our nearby katong laksa aunty start from a drop out in secondary school, start learning from her grandmother about cooking laksa, go around with her grandmother pedalling on the street with laksa illegally, get caught so many times, until the authority give her a place to sell laksa and now, 3 private properties and with 2 mercs, laksa ingredient also go into production, sell laksa only leh..bloody hell, U degree still struggling for a life here, must be joking.</p>
