            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">Those who have NEVER fallen before in life, does not know the meaning of depression.</div></blockquote>Depression is actually a very common phrase of life, could be due to stress, grief or some sort of unexplainable phobia. But by and large, everyone will experience depression to some degree at certain stage in their life. My father for one, suffers mild clinical depression and was put on medication for a while.<br><br>If depression is unavoidable, then it is important that we learn to deal with it. Medication is a form of help, but more importantly the person who is depressed must learn to look on the brighter side of life. As family, we should encourage and bring the depressed out door more often to appreciate life.<br><br>I guess at this point in time, people are saying that, "hey, its easy to say so when you don't have unpaid bills building up in our closest." But in the case of Tan, he was not deprieved of means to assist him, he had received help and is reasonably confident that he can receive it again if he ask. His situation may not be desirable, but it is far from being desperate as his debts run only till about $1000 +.<br><br>As an individual, he was also perhaps not proficient in financial planning. My father inherited a family full of debts when my grandfather committed suicide after owing lots to loan sharks due to gambling problem. I was then three and it was common for loan sharks to turn come knocking every now and then. My father got a help from our relatives but there was also not a lot they can do as my family clan was "on the wrong side of politics" for a while and some of my relatives will "disappear" for years before appearing out of no where. Under such bleak circumstance, my father quit uni and took a job. With financial planning, we were able to repay the debts both to loan sharks and to our relatives within a few years. My family has now a middle class income and is able to support me in oversea study.<br><br>One of my uncle was a carpenter with a monthly income of 800 plus. Although that was more than 20 years ago, his income never rose beyond 1,500. But with planning, he is not only able to bring up his three children but also see all of them tru NUS.<br><br>Life is difficult and full of challenge. It was, is and will be. While the government and society can prepare "safety nets" to offer assistance, it is largely due to individuals and their family to stick together and face the challenges. Suicide is not a method of meeting life's challenge, it is an irresponsible action to quit life and abandon all those who places trust and faith upon him.</div>
