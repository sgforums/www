The RC will also provide psychological and other assistance for the family. It is also reported that the family had never approached the RC for assistence, something which I though we should all worked on.<br><br>I'm glad that since the news has been out, people immediately volunteered to help and I think that despite how some people think that Singaporeans act like pigs, there's still a pretty side of Singaporeans.<br><br>BTW, I'm currently overseas but I would like to help to.
