            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, as much as our society has failed to save this family, this same society is shaped by our gov. (see young Miss WeeÂ’s comment)<br><br>I agree with another post in the forum that our gov have got no clue what is happening in this sector of our society.  The ruling elite class is too remote to even imagine their difficulties.<br><br>Raising transportation fare is less than a peanut to these elite.. but imagine no $ for MRT ticket to go ID dead husband!  (well, to make things worse, I doubt these very poor has store value tickets.. thus have to buy the more expensive single trip ticket)<br><br>There are private charities and community services around to assist this group of people.  But perhaps because they are so poor and kept to themselves (outcast?), they have limited knowledge on assistance available to them.  Charities have been working hard to reach out to this sector of society but I guess they missed this family.<br><br>Managing SGforums funds can be tricky, I think itÂ’s unnecessary.  We can plan our own private contribution.<br><br>If anyone has address to this unfortunate family, please let us know. (kindly do not post address openly, we'll PM u for it.)<br></div>

(see young Miss WeeÂ’s comment)<br><br>I agree with another post in the forum that our gov have got no clue what is happening in this sector of our society.  The ruling elite class is too remote to even imagine their difficulties.<br><br>Raising transportation fare is less than a peanut to these elite.. but imagine no $ for MRT ticket to go ID dead husband!  (well, to make things worse, I doubt these very poor has store value tickets.. thus have to buy the more expensive single trip ticket)<br><br>There are private charities and community services around to assist this group of people.  But perhaps because they are so poor and kept to themselves (outcast?), they have limited knowledge on assistance available to them.  Charities have been working hard to reach out to this sector of society but I guess they missed this family.<br><br>Managing SGforums funds can be tricky, I think itÂ’s unnecessary.  We can plan our own private contribution.<br><br>If anyone has address to this unfortunate family, please let us know. (kindly do not post address openly, we'll PM u for it.)<br></div></blockquote>Thk u!!!!</div>
