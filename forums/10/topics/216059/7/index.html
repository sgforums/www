            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think it's true that people only commit suicide when there is no way out. Take for example a student who suicide jumped because of academic expectations. His future is bright, yet he still chose death. And, what about those big starving families in Africa? Why do parents choose to live even when they  have watched their children die of malnourishment? I'm a big believer that there is always an alternative to death. A family can be seen as a huge burden but it can also be seen as a source of emotional support. Something worth fighting for. It's just that when you are depressed, you can only see the negative side of things and death is so tempting.<br><br>I find it sad that people think the only source of help comes from the government. Can't find a partner? SDU.  Don't know how to bond with your neighborhood? RC. Every single thing has to be facilitated by the Government. Our society is so disunited that people find it hard to ask each other for help. Before, society is more tightly-knit. There is a sense of 'village spirit'. Then, when times are bad, people look towards each other for help. Now, we look towards the government for help and try to hide our troubles from each other, because we don't want to feel ashamed. There's 'pride' at stake.<br><br>And no please, the question is not how we can improve the RC to build community spirit. It's how WE can build improve community spirit. There was no RC before and they did just fine. You want to know why we prefer to have the RC? Cuz then the responsibility is pushed to the government. If they screw up, we can just blame them. See a poor man walking down the street? Go back home, post in forums complaining about the government. Furthermore, we have this fake beggars begging for money when there are other people who are ALOT more needy than they are. Yet, they are the ones getting the help. It's ridiculous.</div>

On the other extreme, if it is a 66-year old retiree with young children who would have to rely on public funds if he cannot find a job, it certainly makes good sense to sponsor him for training.</div>
