            <div class='col-md body'>1) If he has no money how can he  upgrade himself? Some of the families of the kids I work with are low income families. The parents seem to be in a helpless cycle of joblessness - father gets retrenched, mother's company renovate force them go on long leave, father manages to find job, mother falls ill, father unable to find a job that is suitable, mother gets retrenched - the same old story over and over again. The social worker assists them constantly to find job opportunities - but when education level, job skills are against them, the likelihood of them finding a job is not easy.<br><br>2) Then again, same old story of other people who don't need help constantly complaining of poverty. The complaints of the middle-income 'poor' tend to drown on the needs of the desperately poor - WHY? Because it is the middle-income 'poor' who has access to internet, who has the education level to read newspapers etc and who have the time to communicate their dissatisfaction!<br><br>The desperately poor are too busy trying to make ends meet.<br><br>3) Dont undermine the combined efforts of social workers, community workers, welfare workers who are out there trying their level best to help these people.<br><br>Their numbers are small, the people who need help are many. The money is not enough, it is spread thin (how much do you donate? do you want a welfare state?)<br><br>You never hear about the stories of people who get an additional bit of financial help, who get subsidies, who get a little bit of comfort and listening ear from these people simply cos its never big news, because the money is never big enough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to survive with few hundreds dollars in Singapore for the poor? For some rich guy, few hundreds is jus a meal in a luxury hotel for them. The poor had to struggle to earn that few hundred, suffer hardship from their boss. The poorer have to eat maggie mee at home. This is Indeed Unfair. Really dislike the rich people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

What is important is that the boys work hard to get as good an education as they are capable of.</div>

He could have enrolled in a BEST and WISE programme, followed by one of the part-time Nitec and ISC programmes run by ITE. For funding, he could have approached CDAC for a training award. If he has a job, his employer can send him under SDF sponsorshop as well.<br><br>http://www.ite.edu.sg/%7Ecetweb/stp/nitecisc/nitecisc.htm</div>
