            <div class='col-md body'>I got once heard of an article about "The Endless Cycle of Poverty"... According to theory, those who are poor tend to have lotsa children, among these children, chances are they wont get the required education, some may lead a life of gangsterism, then with minimum education, they received minimum wage jobs and has little knowledge to set a planned life... and then the cycle continues... the poor need to break this cycle in order to lead a happy life if not for them then the next generation...</div>
