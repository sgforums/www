            <div class='col-md body'>A few months ago, I wrote some stuff (not very good stuff) on my blog concerning a particular relative. No names were mentioned, though I did state the relationship (along with a variety of swear words and curses). Let's just say that our families have never had a good relationship since the day I was born.<br><br>Anyway, he found it (I have no idea how) and emailed the posts to the extended family, along with any other posts that concerned them. I have since deleted the blog and put another in its place, mainly so they can still read what I think about their actions (no names, though).<br><br>The Acidflask affair got into the newspapers recently, and just today he sent an email to my mom and some other relatives. (You can read it here: <a href="http://cimorene-86.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://cimorene-86.blogspot.com</a> along with alot of stuff I wrote when I got pissed off)<br><br>Maybe at first sight the posts make me seem like some bitch, but I really was pissed off at the way he treated people - my mom, my grandparents, everybody. Any comments?</div>

And because of that, the law of defamation still applies," said Mr. Bryan Tan, a lawyer at Tan and Tan Partnership, who specializes in IT law.<br><br>Myth 2 - My blog is password protected, so it is personal.<br><br>Fact -?"You're not off the hook even if you protect your blog with a password and give access only to certain people. As past experience with e-mail has shown, it can be copied and forwarded to the whole world in a matter of minutes".<br><br>Myth 3 - What I write in my blog is my personal opinion. I write to de-stress and express my personal views on the Internet where free speech is being practiced.<br><br>Fact - "The law allows you to have a opinion about something," said Ms Doris Chia, a partner at Harry Elias Partnership. "The comment is fair if the facts that support the comment are true and that it was made without malice".<br><br>Said lawyer Tan: "Do be sensitive about what you write. Even if it is not defamatory, would the person being targeted benefit from your views? Criticism is not wrong if it is constructive.
