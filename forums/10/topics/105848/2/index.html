These older people saw how the government closed down newspapers and fired journalists even before you were born. They don't need to see more proof.<br>There are people who think differently from you!! If you simply write these people off as "brain-washed" or "simple", you will never understand them and will never get them to see your view.<br><br></div></blockquote>If you read carefully, you will see that I was talking about 2 groups Â– the younger generation who were brain-washed from young and the older generation upon whom PAP built their success. I am not so worried about the young generation --- the young can adapt fast, even if dulled by years of education and assurances that the government will ensure more good years ahead.<br><br>But the older generation is at risk. They lived through the period where economic growth benefited everybody. That era is now passÃ©. Future growth will produce winners and losers. Losers will once again be the working class. If you are old and working, well you can go look at what WDA has to offer Â– be retrenched and retrained to work in some worse-off job made to look glamorous by the WDA. And the sad thing is, that is going to be the way of life (which is what the WDA is advertising). I will try my best to avoid this planned fate, although I cannot be sure I will not fall into it.<br><br>The older generation can ignore what I say, go listen to the govt then. The old and poor will not be left behind. See our MM 81 years old still has a job--- what is there to fear? Those kanna retrenched at age 40++ sure can find jobs one mah. Is the govt talking sense or am I talking sense? Just look around yourself to see the reality.

I am not joining you in bitching and mourning about FT, NS and rising costs, old and stale, unless you have better solutions. You are the one who used the word "brain-washed" so don't talk to me about being biased. You are the one who brought up one letter from an angmoh with a conclusion that is known to many of us long time ago and it is you who take the government's way as the "planned fate", so don't talk to me about naivity.</div>

I did not post the article to highlight the fact that someone lost his job or to allow him to vent his frustration at being laid off nor is it to discuss the foreign talent issue. I posted the article to show readers how ST operates (the title shows it all).<br><br>While readers can read the article any way they like, I am more concerned at how ST operates. Some obvious questions that come to my mind are:<br><br><strong>(1)</strong> Why are intelligence officers being employed as editors in the media industry?<br><br><strong>(2)</strong> Why are journalists asked to present Â“factsÂ” that are supplied by editors but are not historically true?<br><br><strong>(3)</strong> On his website, Mr Gupte revealed he was sacked when he refused to comply with what he saw as unprofessional behaviour as a journalist and escorted out of the country by intelligence personnel. Does this mean that all Singapore journalists are supposed to follow orders from the top and report fiction and not facts?<br><br>I am not seeking answers for any of the above questions, although I would like to know more if any one here has worked in the Singapore media industry before and like to share.<br><br>Indeed, the answers to the questions are like asking Russians why KGB exists in the former USSR. However beautiful the explanation, it only shows that those at the top are very skilful at using the media to influence people.<br></div>
