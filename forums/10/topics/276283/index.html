            <div class='col-md body'>ARE Singaporeans Living LONGER?<br>You referring to Delayed retirement plans and likelihood of surviving right?<br><br>well, I have some news for you from CNA:<br><br>MOH to set up 2 specialty centres for cancer, heart disease<br>By Julia Ng, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 26 August 2007 1903 hrs<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MOH to set up 2 specialty centres for cancer, heart disease </strong></span><br><br>SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry (MOH) is setting up two new specialty centres for cancer and heart disease at the National University Hospital (NUH) over the next 12 months to meet rising demand.<br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said this at the Healthcare Charity Run, aimed at raising money for the President's Challenge charity campaign.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: darkblue;">In Singapore, cancer and heart disease are the two top killers and cancer alone claims 4,000 lives every year.<br><br>By 2015, it is projected that new cancer cases will jump from the present 9,000 a year to 13,000, while the number of heart patients will grow from 200,000 to 320,000.</span> </span></strong><br><span class="small">Mr Khaw said Singapore must ramp up its capacity and capabilities to meet this demand as the population expands and ages.<br><br>Last year, the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) attended to 125,000 outpatients, while the National Heart Centre (NHC) handled almost 10,000 in-patient episodes (one patient could be hospitalised a few times and each hospitalisation is one 'episode').<br><br>"Seriously they are 'choc-a-bloc' now. If you visit them, you'll see every nook and corner fully used up. As growth is not sudden, we just have to build it up slowly. So in the case of NUH, they already have some service going on for years, that's why the choice of NUH is quite clear," said the health minister.<br><br>Last year, NUH's Cancer Institute saw 3,600 new patients Â– a 20 percent increase from 2005.<br><br>Its cardiac centre now handles 10,000 new heart patients every year.<br><br>Mr Khaw said with more specialty centres at the national level, this will make room for doctors to sub-specialise and develop new niche areas. In the long run, this could mean better care for patients.<br><br>He said: "When I look at specialty development over the last 15 years, my preference, going forward, is to spawn off a second centre for those centres with large critical mass."<br><br>The strategy is for the national centres to pilot new projects and once the treatment procedures become routine and standard, they could move downstream to other general hospitals.<br><br>This way, patients pay less and have better access to specialised care. It also frees up resources at the national centres so that they could focus on developing higher-end capabilities and treating patients with greater complications.<br><br>Mr Khaw also challenged other specialty centres to aim higher.<br><br>He said: "At the same time, I'm asking the existing specialty centres to aim higher. I think after 15 years of specialty development, my assessment is that they've done very well. I think we should begin to set our sights higher. Centres like SNEC (Singapore National Eye Centre) ophthalmology ought to look at their role as the referral centres of the region.<br><br>"Heart centres, likewise, ought to aim higher as well. There're a number of developments that we're now studying. We'll be doing our consultation with senior doctors to see which other national specialty centre to have. This is to prepare ourselves for the future. You can't just build a centre and have it running within a few years. It'll take 10, 15 yrs."<br><br>Until then, MOH will continue to invest in the national centres to help them grow further.<br><br>In fact, the NHC is slated to be re-built on its current Outram site, which is fast becoming inadequate for its current level of patient care, education and research.<br><br>Welcoming the move to set up a new Heart Centre, the NHC, which has 50 percent of the market share, said this not only provides more choices for patients, the new centre will help to manage and improve waiting times.<br><br>On its part, NHC said it would continue to provide cost-effective and high standards of cardiac care to Singaporeans.<br><br>The NCCS also welcomes the setting up of another specialist team at NUH.<br><br>The Centre said its doctors have long enjoyed good partnership on various research collaborations with the NUH team.<br><br>Having a new cancer team at NUH will benefit patients and help NCCS enhance its expertise, to develop into a strong regional centre for cancer treatment and at the same time, allow it to expand its international collaborations with reputable medical and research institutions.<br><br>Apart from capital investments, MOH is also looking at increasing the list of recognised foreign medical degrees to boost the pool of doctors here.<br><br>Chua Song Khim, CEO of National University Hospital, said: "We're willing to find space for infrastructure and stuff. But it's the human resource we need. We need doctors, nurses, allied health staff and support services to make sure we can support the projected increase."<br><br>Last year, Singapore trained 200 local doctors and attracted another 200 foreign ones, but Mr Khaw would like the number for both groups increased to about 300.<br><br>- CNA/so </span><br><br></blockquote></div>
