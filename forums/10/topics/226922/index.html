            <div class='col-md body'>In today's Straits Times,(22.12.2006)  there appears an article in Insight page entitled "People &amp; Politics - 7 highly visible types in Singapore politics"<br><br>In this article, the Straits Times claimed that it has published readers' letters to the forum page from writers who have "the knack of raising ssues in a timely and coherent manner."<br><br>It cited the writings of people like Mr. Michael Loh, Mr. Leong Sze Hian and Dr. Lim Boon Hee and gives an impression that Straits Times has been objective in publishing letters from its readers with mention that some of its regular forum writers like Mr. Michael Loh has scored some kinds of record in the Guiness Book of record being the most prolific newspaper's forum writers.<br><br>May I ask the Straits Times to show that in the same breath, whether it has published well-articulated letters from writers who write on serious social or political issues or problems in the past and how many of such letters have been published as against those which were rejected in order to back up its point that Straits Times has been objective and welcoming enough to publish well-written or coherent letters from its readers.<br><br>Let me ask the Straits Times why my various letters to the Straits Times on "High costs of living" or "Proposed Revision of the Constitution" or "Time to review the Conservation Law", were less coherent or worthy of publication or not as coherent as those of Mr. Michael Loh?<br><br>I would just reproduce one such rejected "serious letter" written to the Straits Times on 18.12.2006 concerning the problems caused by the unchanging past summary practices of URA in implementing conservation of properties which is now reproduced below:-<br><br>{QUOTE}Date:- Dec 18, 2006<br>From: Mr. Robert Teh Kok Hua<br><br>To: The Editor,<br>The Straits Times,<br><br>Dear Editor,<br><br>Your article Â“Historic buildings no bar to progressÂ” (by Kannan Chandran, Straits Times 13.12.2006) raises many issues and challenges confronting the ongoing conservation efforts of the government.<br><br>Enough has been said about the need for conservation of buildings of historic and heritage architectural legacy. For example, beside many past articles by various correspondents on this topic, Mr. Kannan has again lent vocal support to conservation by rightly emphasizing that Â“Heritage buildings should be viewed as assets, not stumbling blocks to progressÂ”. He cited the fact that refurbished colonial villas previously owned by the family of Straits Chinese tycoon Tan Kim Seng and now incorporated in a new condominium development, known as Grand Duchess or Ducess @ St Patricks were instrumental in the sale of 121 units within 36 hours of its soft launch.<br><br>Mr. Ler Seng Ann Director (Conservation &amp; Development Services ) of URA in his recent reply (Â“Many criteria in conservationÂ” ST 24.9.2006) to a forum letter has attributed our conservation success to the public support and he added that Â“We need to balance that with economics, changing lifestyles and expectations, needs of building owners and other factors.Â”<br><br>However, in my view, the success of our Conservation Exercises was due to the following factors:-<br><br>a)	Many of the prewar shophouses in China Town, Little India and Kampong Glam were already compulsorily acquired by the government under the Land Acquisition Act with compensations based on market values of the properties as at 30 November 1973;<br>b)	The Rent Control Act, and<br>c)	The private landowners were also given financial incentives to conserve their pre-war rent-controlled properties under the Decontrolled Premises Act.<br><br>The Rent Control Act was abolished in 2003 and provision for compensation for compulsorily acquired properties had been amended several times already.<br><br>Numerous articles have been published in the Straits Times like Â“Conservation targets newer buildingsÂ” (By Kalpana Rasshiwala, ST 14.7.2006) etc, wherein architects have described the practical difficulty in extending the traditional conservation of monumental sites and buildings to prime commercial properties outside these areas and newer private strata developments like Beverly Mai (The first condo built in 1974) and Futura, (2nd condo built in 1976) etc. as Â“Uphill BattleÂ”.<br><br>With 6,500 buildings in monumental sites like China Town and Little India, Cuppage Road and Kg Glam largely protected, under our conservation programs to date, it may be asked:- (1) Is such a level of conservation for a small country like Singapore enough ? (2) Land being rare and expensive, how do we balance conservation with the loss of redevelopment potential and creation of jobs ? (3) Is there a need to over-conserve by conserving more old buildings of the same type? (4) Is there a case for compensation to property owners who have lost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in property values when prevented from redeveloping their properties?.<br><br>In conservation areas, there are many old, dilapidated or unsafe buildings. Since there are no incentives for new owners to redevelop the properties to their maximum potential and inject a new lease of life to the locality, there are left in their neglected state.<br><br>With the bulk of our national monumental buildings in core conservation areas like China Town, Little India and Cuppage and Kg Glam largely conserved, is there an overriding need to continue to conserve more and more of the same or every old building of certain age or architecture. Prewar buildings are already amply represented. It is post-war iconic buildings which the public want the URA to begin conserving.<br><br>Of late, on 8.12.2006, URA has published yet another notice of amendments to the Master Plan. URA is proposing to conserve the peripheral precincts in Syed Alwi Road, Rowell Road, Desker Road, Lembu Road, Jalan Besar as conservation areas.<br><br>Millions of dollars of property values will be wiped out upon conservation.  Some of the property owners affected have been granted planning approvals previously for more intensive redevelopments. Such a conservation proposal cannot be justified.<br><br>From the foregoing, it is timely for URA to revisit our conservation objectives and review all the criteria e.g. economics, social lifestyle and offer a fair and equitable conservation approach or methodology going forward. Unless such issues and problems which may cause great concerns to all are adequately addressed in ongoing conservation processes, it will be unreasonable to expect the public or any owner affected to support, even if a building is highly deserving of protection and well justified by the experts on specifics. {UNQUOTE}<br></div>

As lawyer, he could only see governance of the nation only from the narrow lawyers' perspective resulting in over-controls to get to what they want. The result is more over-control of people, taxing on major or big ticket items like housing and infrastructure cost recovering on all essential government services. An average family ends up paying S$500,000.00 - S$800,000.00 per family on housing and vehicular taxes to support the whole governmental machinery. Such heavy citizen burden impedes economic competitiveness and progress.<br><br>(2) Self-centredness and over-protection of elites and elitist policies in the name of meritocracy.<br><br>Even with all the scholars and lawyers and doctors, the society is unable to solve all the above-stated problems causes by legalistic wrangling for the past 40 years which impedes further progress.<br><br>Singapore could have progressed much further than it has given people's immense contribution from the past sacrifices if the cost burdens on the citizens are not persistently kept so high through creative accounting and legalistic wrangling of all laws and regulations. Ordinary citizens are so over-controlled by all sorts of devices that they have either given up or are migrating.<br><br>It is time to think out of the box and not be brainwashed by the propaganda that everything is well. It is not well and the ordinary people are suffering.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Forumers,<br><br>Just to keep all informed of what transpired leading to publication of my letter to the Forum Page in today's Straits Times (28.12.2006), I reproduce below the emails exchanges with Forum editor Mr. Kong Soon Wah below:-<br><br>Date: 26.12.2006<br>Dear Mr. Kong Soon Wah,<br><br>Many thanks for your reply. In compliance with your advice, I have amended to said draft to below 400 words as attached and hope that you will now publish it. Regards,<br><br>Date:- Dec 26, 2006<br>To: The Editor,<br>The Straits Times,<br><br>Dear Editor,<br><br>QUOTE"In your article Â“Historic buildings no bar to progressÂ” (Straits Times 13.12.2006), Mr. Kannan Chandran has correctly pointed out that Â“Heritage buildings should be viewed as assets, not stumbling blocks to progressÂ” citing refurbished colonial villas previously owned by the family of Straits Chinese tycoon Tan Kim Seng as instrumental to the sale of 121 units within 36 hours of soft launch of Ducess @ St Patricks.<br><br>In replying to a recent forum letter, Mr. Ler Seng Ann Director (Conservation &amp; Development Services ) has acknowledged the Â“need to balance that with economics, changing lifestyles and expectations, needs of building owners and other factors.Â”<br><br>However, in my view, such conservation success is mainly attributable to the Land Acquisition Act allowing government to acquire sites at market values as at 30 November 1973, Rent Control Act, 2003 and Decontrolled Premises Act offering landowners opportunities and financial incentives to conserve previously rent-controlled properties.<br><br>As your correspondent Mr. Kalpana Rashiwala has pointed out in his article Â“Conservation targets newer buildingsÂ”, published in the Straits Times on 14.7.2006, architects have described the ongoing conservation of prime commercial sites and iconic post-war strata developments like Beverly Mai (The first condo built in 1974) and Futura, (2nd condo built in 1976) etc. as Â“Uphill BattleÂ”.<br><br>Yet, of late on 8.12.2006, URA has served notices to conserve yet more prime commercial sites like Syed Alwi Road, Rowell Road, Desker Road, Lembu Road, Jalan Besar. Millions of dollars of property values will be wiped out upon conservation with some land owners being unable to proceed with previously approved redevelopment.<br><br>With 6,500 buildings already conserved, it may be timely to review our conservation objectives and programs by asking questions e.g. (1) Is this level of conservation enough ? (2) Land being rare and expensive, how do we reconcile conservation with loss of redevelopment potential and creation of jobs ? (3) Is there a need to conserve more of the same type? (4) Compensation to those deprived of approved redevelopment.<br><br>In the first phase of our conservation, buildings being conserved were often old, dilapidated or even unsafe. Today, circumstances are different and even if a conservation proposal is justified by experts on specifics, there may be a need to reexamine overall conservation needs and provide fair and equitable compensation to land owners affected."UNQUOTE<br><br>Robert Teh Kok Hua<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Kong Soon Wah [mailto:sw@sph.com.sg] On Behalf Of STForum<br>Sent: Friday, December 22, 2006 4:28 PM<br>To: teh kok hua<br>Subject: Re: STRAITS TIMES' CLAIM OF OBJECTIVITY IN PUBLISHING FORUM PAGE LETTERS - IS IT TRUTHFUL<br><br>Dear Mr Teh,<br><br>I have not rejected your letter of Dec 18.
