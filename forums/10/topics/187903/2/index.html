            <div class='col-md body'>MM Lee has told the 10 journalists in the recent TV Dialogue "Does My Vote Matter?" some of his own value systems and governing philosophy.<br><br>Now citizens can see finally his many inner thoughts and views about people. He clearly told the people through the questions and answers that there was no such thing as level playing field for the opposition.<br><br>It may be true that if someone falsely accuses a person of some wrongs, the victim has the right to defend himself. This is a sort of level playing field as well.<br><br>But in the instances referred to by the journalists this is not a case of false accusations by the oppositions. It is about the kind of society younger people will like to have and the right of oppositions to participate in political processes.<br><br>Even when opposition should be raising issues about some NKF wrong doings or some other issues like the high costs of living there is no issue with level or unlevel playing field but accountability and transparency in government and right of opposition or people in raising issues in order to help solve the problems and issues e.g. falling wages, and losses of economic competitiveness.<br><br>So MM Lee obviously has missed the issues raised by the panelists. They raised real and legitimate issues and problems which should be open up for discussions. In such political processes no citizens should be under threats of any kind including threats of defamation lawsuit hanging over them. Is this the kind of level playing field the govenment will not and cannot grant?<br><br>Coming to think over the many issues affecting the citizens at this time, it may well be asked: What do we elect a government for? Is not the government elected to provide level playing field between the powerful and the weak, the manufacturers and producers as exploiters as against the innocent public or consumers.<br><br>If there is indeed no such thing as level playing field should the incumbent government being the protector and custodian of people's rights and interests given the right to create unlevel playing field and then say in the next breadth they cannot grant level playing field to anyone on the receiving end.<br><br>If government cannot make the playing field level, will it allow any powerful forces in society to exploit the innocent citizens or consumers with immoral or false advertisements or unequal contracts.<br><br>If there exists any unequal relationship between employers and employees, businesses and consumers, rich and poor, elites and the ordinary workers, criminals and humbler law-abiding citizens, which side will the law or government elected by the people stand?<br></div>

His imperfection is over something relatively minor called misdemour but to them every bit of misdemeanour is good for them to use to debunk anyone for speaking up against inefficiencies and incorrect policies.<br><br>I think as good leaders they could just deny allegations and like gentlemen let oppositions do their part in nation building by staying composed for people will be forgiving some mistakes which may be unavoidable. But they are now too obsessed in defending almost every allegation giving way to no issue or criticism.<br><br>It is very clear that they will debunk anyone who dare to criticise the government. If criticisms are right they would simply ignore the critics and not reply and there is nothing anyone can do about stonewalling tactics either.<br><br>They are now presenting candidates as if all of them are capable people with talents to solve problems. But it is a fact that the new MPs will soon take on the same adversarial attitude towards criticism instead of truly serving as representatives of the people. Even unelected candidate like Sitoh is speaking as if he owns the upgrading monies with special power to do anything they like even to delay in upgrading of estates if he is not elected.<br><br>Using Sitoh's own monies is unlikely for he will say that only those who are loyal will deserve his assistance.

His imperfection is over something relatively minor called misdemour but to them every bit of misdemeanour is good for them to use to debunk anyone for speaking up against inefficiencies and incorrect policies.<br><br>I think as good leaders they could just deny allegations and like gentlemen let oppositions do their part in nation building by staying composed for people will be forgiving some mistakes which may be unavoidable. But they are now too obsessed in defending almost every allegation giving way to no issue or criticism.<br><br>It is very clear that they will debunk anyone who dare to criticise the government. If criticisms are right they would simply ignore the critics and not reply and there is nothing anyone can do about stonewalling tactics either.<br><br>They are now presenting candidates as if all of them are capable people with talents to solve problems. But it is a fact that the new MPs will soon take on the same adversarial attitude towards criticism instead of truly serving as representatives of the people. Even unelected candidate like Sitoh is speaking as if he owns the upgrading monies with special power to do anything they like even to delay in upgrading of estates if he is not elected.<br><br>Using Sitoh's own monies is unlikely for he will say that only those who are loyal will deserve his assistance. What kind of people have we produced in our education system I wonder.</div>
