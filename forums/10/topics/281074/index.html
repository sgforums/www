            <div class='col-md body'>This is what I mean; whatever the fark they handle or "address" or "look into", it boils down to saving THEIR money...<br><br>Hence, it is akin to having the Left Foot on one boat, &amp; the other Right Foot on another....<br><br>Like this, BEETTER DON'T FARKING BOTHER TO ANYTHING!!!!!<br><br>SIT DOWN AND SHAKE THEIR FARKING ELITES LEGS!!!!!<br><br>===========================================<br><strong>Why S'pore can't run this route<br>Cubby Leong</strong><br><br>WHEN two seemingly fit young men Â— a national triathlete and an army captain Â— each collapse and die and the end of a long-distance race, some look to an obvious solution: Make medical screening of participants compulsory.<br>.<br>And why not, given Italy's record with this approach?<br>.<br>Since a regulation was passed in 1982 requiring anyone above 12 years of age to be screened beforehand, the number of sports-related deaths in that country has plunged 89 per cent Â— a remarkable statistic, admits Dr Benedict Tan, head of Singapore's Sports Safety Committee.<br>.<br>But it is not a road that Singapore can afford to go all the way down.<br>.<br>On Friday, the 12-member committee, after two months of intensive research, recommended that professional and national athletes be required to undergo medical screening. It stopped short, however, of making such tests mandatory for all participants of marathon and triathlon participants Â— although the authorities are looking into getting organisers to provide health insurance coverage.<br>.<br>The committee was set up in July following the death of triathlete Thaddeus Cheong, 17, at a Southeast Asian Games trial. Then on Aug 26, army captain Ho Si Qiu died after completing the 21-km Singapore Bay Run.<br>.<br>Dr Tan, who is with Changi General Hospital's Sport Medicine Division, noted that compared to America or European countries, Singapore has "a higher proportion of novices taking part in high impact sports like marathons and triathlons".<br>.<br>As such, "the chief safety officer for such events should come up with a comprehensive support plan", he said.<br>.<br>The committee's recommendations call for, among other things, organisers to take into account skills levels and risks, and to have sufficient automated external defibrillators (AEDs) on hand.<br>.<br>But Italy's comprehensive screening programme may not suit Singapore. Such tests can cost between $400 and $800. Dr Tan said: "While the Italian model is effective, the high cost involved has prevented us from replicating the exact model here."<br>.<br>Rather, Singapore will take the "middle ground" of targetting the higher risk population.<br>.<br>"People whose families have a record of heart failure are encouraged to screen. So are the people who take part in intensive competitions like the marathon or triathlon," he said, while emphasising that the rate of sports-related fatalities has not gone up.<br>.<br>The committee has recommended that sports facilities provide cardiovascular screening of all new members.<br>.<br>At gyms like Planet Fitness, medical screening is not mandatory although there is a fitness consultation process that measures strength and agility.<br>.<br>S-League clubs and basketball team Singapore Slingers already practise compulsory medical screening, as do the S-League Prime League and National Football Academy age group teams. Also required to be screened are Singapore Sports School students enrolling for the first time and anyone going for lifeguard and Outward Bound courses.<br>.<br>Screening aside, the committee's 95-page report had a slew of other recommendations for event organisers and facility operators. A number are already in practice.<br>.<br>There are 477 Singapore Sports Council (SSC) staff trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of AEDs stationed at all SSC facilities.<br>.<br>Just last month at the Toa Payoh Sports Hall, 61-year-old Koh Ser Kiong collapsed after his weekly badminton game. He was revived by the trained staff on site.<br>.<br>Said SSC chief executive Oon Jin Teik: "The guidelines have always been there. We're just taking a multi-prong approach to the situation now."<br>.<br>But at the end of the day, the weekend warrior's health is his own responsibility. Singapore Athletic Association president Loh Lin Kok said: "While the deaths have caused a lot of concern, we cannot over react Â… People should know what is good for them Â… (that) 10km is the right distance for them, instead of being ambitious and doing the full 42km."<br>.<br>Indeed, the committee's recommendations emphasise public education.<br>.<br>With sports participation growing, Parliament Secretary for Community Development, Youth and Sports Teo Ser Luck, said: "Organisers should create awareness for safety. We're currently looking into working out incentive programmes for them to roll out a comprehensive health cover."<br>.<br>SAFETY at sunday's TRIATHLON<br>.<br>It will be the first event held following the committee's announcements of its recommendations. And come this Sunday at East Coast Park, a series of safety measures have been put in place for the 400 over participants at the Asia's First Women's Triathlon.<br>.<br>These include two automated external defibrillators, two ambulances, 10 lifeguards, six nurses, two doctors, 36 canoeists, three jet skis and one powerboat on standby.<br>.<br>While health screening was not mandatory, every participant had to sign an indemnity form declaring they were fit to take on the gruelling 1500m swim, 40km bike and 10km run.<br>.<br>Organising director Christine Tan added: "Our medical partners, KK Hospital, have helped us draw up a comprehensive support plan for the event. All the stops are in place to provide a safe environment for the ladies to compete."<br></div>
