              <p><strong>Digging a hole – IMF and WB loans</strong></p>
              <p>The Ukrainian President, Viktor Yushchenko, realized that IMF loans
                  are a bad thing. The President of Lithuania, as well, set rules for
                  taking out IMF loans. The crisis seems to have hit hard and anyone who
                  has ever found themselves deep in the pockets of banks knows how hard
                  it is get out because eventually those loans have to be paid back. Now
                  it is becoming interesting to see how Presidents used Western funds in
                  their positions with funded campaigns and advisors from overseas and
                  are scratching their heads a little and saying, <em>“Wait a minute, I think I’m being screwed.” </em></p>
              <div>
              <p class="rtcutp"><a style="display: none;" href="http://www.russiatoday.ru/About_Us/Blogs/With_words_we_govern_men___Disraeli.html?fullstory">Read more</a></p>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">The IMF and the World Bank
                  are simple structures. For a long time they have been giving out loans
                  that they know will not be repaid and interest rates that are intended
                  to run a country aground in debt in order to help the political power
                  printing the money. This part should be read “the United States”.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Personally, from a purely political point of view, I applaud whoever
                  came up with the plan and I would call that person a pure genius. This
                  is not to say that I endorse the action; this is to say that this is a
                  great plot for countries to get what they want.</strong></span></span></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">The U.S. has been doing
                  it for a long time. I would assume the true power of credit was
                  realized during the 1920’s when Chevrolet allowed people to purchase
                  cars on installment plans. In turn, this skyrocketed the brand way
                  beyond the industry leader, Ford, who refused to use such a system,
                  even when Chevrolet was setting record sales. Ford had layaway plans
                  set up, but people wanted cars right away and eventually he realized
                  the power of credit. The system made sense, people were happy as long
                  as they could get what they wanted on the spot and car manufacturers
                  were happy because they got the volume of sales they desired. <br> <br> After World War II the United States decided to help its allies. The
                  Marshall Plan was introduced. The plan not only allowed the United
                  States to keep using its large industrial strength left over from
                  making bombers to making goods for the destroyed Europe, but also
                  allowed the United States to make permanent friends, even from former
                  foes. The Soviet Union kept on creating underground revolutions in
                  Eastern Europe and setting up friendly leaders in power. The United
                  States simply gave those in need what they wanted on the spot, with an
                  installment plan in place to assure future reimbursement for the time
                  and money spent. However, money devalues over time and thus to
                  compensate for this economists came up with interest rates. The amount
                  of money that the U.S. was making was outrageous. So, why stop there?
                  Make the interest rates a little higher, make sure that the countries
                  are in debt a little longer, and Washington made a little more money.<br> <br> So, the history lesson is over. Today, <a href="http://www.russiatoday.ru/Politics/2009-06-21/Ukraine_backed_into_a_corner.html">Ukraine</a> and most of the <a href="http://www.russiatoday.ru/Top_News/2009-06-18/Thousands_rally_in_Latvia_to_stop_cuts_in_public_services.html">Baltic states</a> find themselves deeply in debt to the U.S. These countries do not want
                  to bite the hand that feeds them and thus the respective leaders of
                  those countries did anything that the “hand” asked of them. Ukraine and
                  some other Eastern European countries sent troops to Iraq. Kiev was
                  doing all it could within its power to push Russia away from the Black
                  Sea and the Baltic states and more than willingly allowed the U.S. to
                  deploy troops and radar installations on their soil. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The IMF loans,
                  however, challenge the sovereignty and the ability to pay for the
                  countries that accept the loans. When hard times hit, the repayment of
                  loans remains a number one priority and so the countries are forced to
                  cut spending on social benefits, government salaries, government
                  programs, national defense, and others. </strong></span></span><br> <br> Anytime a country accepts an IMF or World Bank loan, it virtually owes
                  the United States money because the amount owed is in dollars and thus
                  depends on the exchange rate as well. If a country suffers from a lot
                  of inflation, it still has to pay the same amount in dollars and in
                  turn lose a lot of ability to pay for its own citizens and programs.</div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong></span></span></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> With Ukraine and some Baltic states realizing that their sovereignty is
                  undermined and their economies are heavily dependent on outside
                  funding, it may lead to a little tension between the creditor and the
                  countries involved.</strong></span></span> The creditor himself has financial problems and
                  already relies heavily on the revenue generated by the payments from
                  all those who owe him money. If that revenue is lost or decreased, just
                  like Citi Group, Chase, Washington Mutual, Bear Sterns, and others, the
                  creditor may become quite irate and force the issue of repayment
                  through means of heavier political pressure and inside influence.</div>

              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">One of the crucial pillars of support for today's Dollar System is Washington's control of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The way this actually works is carefully disguised, behind a facade of technocrats and economic theory of free market ideology.</strong></span></span> In reality, the IMF is a modern era collection agency for the Dollar Empire...</div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">The next step for IMF conditions, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>demand a country turn to "market-based" domestic prices.</strong></span></span> This is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>code for eliminating government subsidies or price controls.</strong></span></span> Often developing countries <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>have state-subsidized fuel or food or other necessities for their people.</strong></span></span></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">In 1998 the IMF demanded, for example,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> that Indonesia remove state food subsidies for the poor.</strong></span></span> The<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> idea of "market-based price" is itself a fiction</strong></span></span>.</div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A market is man-made. </strong></span></span></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">The market in Switzerland or Denmark or Japan is different from the market in Cuba or Cameroon. What the IMF is after is a slashing of state budgets to<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> minimize the state role in the economy and make a target country defenseless against foreign takeover of its key assets...</strong></span></span></div>

              <p><strong> BRIC summit calls for <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reform of financial institutions</span></span>, new world order</strong></p>
              <p>The first summit meeting of BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China)
              leaders concluded Tuesday, with <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>calls for cooperation, financial
              architecture reform, and a multi-polar world order.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>In a joint statement issued after the conclusion of the summit, the
              leaders called for greater voice and representation of emerging and
              developing economies in international financial institutions.</p>
              <p>"The emerging and developing economies <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>must have greater voice and

              <p>Ironically, though the IMF is a main prop of the Dollar System, it's nominally headed by a European, today a German, Horst Koehler, and before him, by a Frenchman, Michel Camdessus.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The real power is carefully concealed behind the facade.</span></strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></p>
              <p>Under the constitution of the IMF, no major decision is possible without 85% support of the board of directors. The United States, which drafted the original IMF charter at Bretton Woods New Hampshire in 1944, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>made sure it had the decisive veto control with an 18% vote share. That veto remains to today.</strong></span></span> Insiders know well that the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IMF is run by Washington. It is no accident that its headquarters is also there. </strong></span></span></p>

              What while the global economy sinking Indonesia is among a few countries along with India and China that saw positive growth at 4% even. Its shows a hard fact that Indonesia hasn't even reached its full potential in economic development. while developed economics countries suffer a lot during crisis we are still growing and growing at 4 % at that.

               I'm not an economic expert but some thing are just way to obvious to layman:
               Small economy countries could by means of modern economy develop its economy far exceeding its actual domestic potential. Those countries rely on EXPORT and GLOBAL demand. They suffer a lot during this global crisis because they've exceeded their real domestic economy. They have been enjoying astonishing prosperity well exceeding their natural capability by means of supplying global demand. In short they are enjoying a bloated economy. Japan is one of those developed economy countries which has been enjoying growth from global demand! So does Singapore but such naturally small economy countries do not have REAL economic strength while the global demand is down! In short there are only a few countries which could sustain growth by largely their own domestic demand. China, India and Indonesia seem to be a few of them. These are the REAL GIANTS! or real potential giants! These countries could keep on going while the rest of smaller economy countries are literally dying!

              Facts speak louder than mere sentiment. we never had a negative growth the least growth we have is about 3.6% It was even 4% before. We are more democratic and open than many other South east Asia countries until a traitor to the people come to power some day at least. Damn to him or her if that so. true that we need to restructure our legal system but the only thing that has been keeping Indonesia a back is not its  volatile stability or even terrorism since they are isolated incidents but poor leadership on the part of its leaders who many put other country's needs above the domestic needs. We have natural resources like no other! Most of them however are exported with little added value. Global crisis has come to prove and shown who are the REAL economy GIANTS. It also shows at least on the part of Indonesia that we are economically underdeveloped.
              But it also tells you that one could get rich quicker and easier here than in economically developed countries

              <p><br>Facts speak louder than mere sentiment. we never had a negative growth the least growth we have is about 3.6% It was even 4% before. We are more democratic and open than many other South east Asia countries until a traitor to the people come to power some day at least. Damn to him or her if that so. true that we need to restructure our legal system but the only thing that has been keeping Indonesia a back is not its volatile stability or even terrorism since they are isolated incidents but poor leadership on the part of its leaders who many put other country's needs above the domestic needs. We have natural resources like no other! Most of them however are exported with little added value. Global crisis has come to prove and shown who are the REAL economy GIANTS. It also shows at least on the part of Indonesia that we are economically underdeveloped. But it also tells you that one could get rich quicker and easier here than in economically developed countries</p>
