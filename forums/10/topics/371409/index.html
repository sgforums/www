              <p>Anyone, like me, saw the Channelnewsasia's programme on Singapore remerger with Malaysia?<br><br>Thay got professors, think-tank speakers to talk about this topic. All of them talked about "<strong>regionalisation is the way to go and not nationalisation</strong>". <br><br>Throughout the programme they kept talking and talking about the need for integration. Nobody stepped back and asked why the need for integration.</p>
              <p>Their argument for regionalisation? because of growing China and India. I don't get the logic.<br><br>So why do we need to integrate with the region to fight against these two gaints? If anything, Singapore should integrate with winner and not loser, with India and China</p>
              <p>I mean not too long ago, we have LKY, LHL and GCT talking about Singapore having two wings as India and China take off as global superpowers. </p>

              <p>By Daniel Buenas</p>
              <p>May 01, 2006</p>
              <p>PEOPLE'S Action Party leaders - including Senior Minister <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Goh Chok
                  Tong - last night launched a scathing attack on veteran opposition
                  leader Chiam See Tong's idea for economic union between Singapore and
                  Malaysia.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Speaking at a PAP rally in Potong Pasir,
                  Mr Goh - who has been tasked by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to help
                  the party's candidate Sitoh Yih Pin unseat incumbent Mr Chiam in the
                  coming elections - said the opposition leader was not being a 'realist'.</p>
              <p>He
                  was referring to Mr Chiam's suggestion at a rally in Chua Chu Kang Park
                  on Saturday that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>one way to grow the economy would be for Singapore and
                  Malaysia to strike an economic union.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> 'Economic
                  union is possible only between two countries of equals, otherwise it is
                  not possible,' Mr Goh said. 'My point for bringing this out is, to show
                  that (while Mr Chiam) has some ideals, some vision, he is not a
                  realist.'</strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Chiam had also said on Saturday that
                  such a union would allow Singaporeans to travel freely to Malaysia, and
                  that because the Opposition has no history with the Malaysian
                  government, it could 'bargain on a clean slate' on bilateral issues.</p>
              <p>In
                  response, Mr Goh said: 'When it comes to negotiations with the
                  Malaysians, would you rather Lee Kuan Yew negotiate or Chiam See Tong?
                  Just ask yourself . . . would you rather I (or PM Lee) negotiate, or
                  Chiam See Tong?'</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam's comments also came under fire
                  from two other PAP leaders who turned up at the rally - Trade and
                  Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang and Minister for Community Development,
                  Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan - as well as Mr Sitoh himself.</p>
              <p>Mr
                  Balakrishnan noted that, while Mr Chiam's plan would allow Singaporeans
                  to 'pack their bags and travel to Malaysia anytime', it would also
                  allow equal access to Singapore.</p>
              <p>'His teammates in the
                  Singapore Democratic Alliance have been saying that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>foreigners have
                  been taking away jobs from Singaporeans,' Mr Balakrishnan said.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'You
                  want union? You want free entry of people, of foreigners . . . are you
                  really talking about making this place so everyone can come here? No
                  work permits, no employment pass no control? Think again. Think very
                  carefully,' he said.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>In his speech, Mr Lim also questioned
                  Mr Chiam's suggestion, and asked Singaporeans to compare the economic
                  strategy of the PAP to that of the Opposition in order to judge who
                  would better serve their interests.</p>
              <p>'Mr Chiam says, we join
                  Malaysia, we have a market of 27 million straightaway. Therefore, we
                  can have double-digit growth every year,' Mr Lim said. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'Wah lau, so
                  easy ah . . . so why just join Malaysia? Why not join Indonesia? They
                  have 240 million people. Maybe triple-digit growth.'</strong></span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Economic union with malaysia was Chiam See Tong's idea, not PAP's idea.</p>
              <p>Please don't be a shameless bastard PAP, go and steal other people's idea and present it as your own.</p>

              <p>we can alway take off from the Asean point of view, why need a Union? France, German and Brit are getting heated up by some third world european countries banking and currency systems, in order to substain Euro Dollars, they have to support those 3rd world countries banks. Do you want Singapore to support mynamar bank by pouring in Sing dollars just to hold on to a new Asean Dollars in near future? Think hor.</p>

              <p>The EU type integration is only one of the three possibilities. The next is NAFTA type of integration and the last is economic integration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) EU type integration with its own parliament and its own statute. Anything that fall within EU's domain of law and regulation, there will be free movement of people, goods and services.</p>
              <p>This type of integration will kill us all. Freedom of movement of people means Indonesia, - alone with a population of 190 millions, will drowned us into the sea.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) NAFTA type of integration with an economic trading block that gives preferential tax or incentive to its members.</p>
              <p>NAFTA is based on the concept of comparative advantage. Indeed, Canada with its resources, US with its business and Mexico with its cheap manpower.</p>
              <p>But if we look at Asean. Different stages of economic development, with resource, labour and production that are more or less similar than complimentary. What comparative advantage can we squeeze from each others?</p>
              <p>Do Singapore wants to give preferential tax or incentive to Asean at the expense of mighty India and China?</p>
              <p>No preferential tax or incentive can counter a growing economic and political might. As India and China grow in influence and power, they can force Asean to shut down its trading block by threathening tax barrier on Asean's goods and service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) Economic integration with lower tax and tariff among Asean. This is the most likely form of integration. About ten years ago, some businessmen complained to our govt that Vietnam has tariff of 60 to 30%. Now, I think it is down to 30 to 10%.</p>
              <p>More inter-Asean trade is always a good thing. But why is Singapore going all out to formalize it? What long term benefit will it bring to us? Why bother to lock Singapore in such system?</p>
              <p>By formalizing this trade relationship, Singapore is forcing itself to march in locked-steps with all our neighbours. If they decide to go slow, we also go slow.</p>
              <p>If Asean decides to march three steps and rest one step, Singapore follows because of the trade formalization. If India and China is marching at six steps and rest one step, shouldn't Singapore be following them instead? <br><br>Shouldn't Singapore be following the winners? - the flying geese of India and China.</p>

              <p>we can alway take off from the Asean point of view, why need a Union? France, German and Brit are getting heated up by some third world european countries banking and currency systems, in order to substain Euro Dollars, they have to support those 3rd world countries banks. Do you want Singapore to support mynamar bank by pouring in Sing dollars just to hold on to a new Asean Dollars in near future? Think hor.</p>

              <p>Sometime worse is happening in the EU. Many EU govts operate on perpetual budget deficit. Their treasuries and banks are backrupt. So to run with operating costs, these politicians pledged their country's name, country's asset, country's goodwill, country's future etc to foreign banks for loans.</p>
              <p>Some of these greedy politicians used these loans to get higher return by recycling the loans into risky but high yield derivative options. As people know, these high yield derrivative options are nothing more than scams.   </p>
              <p>When the economic bloodbath was unleashed, all the EU members were hit hard. Litvia was the hardest hit country. Mighty England was on the verge of economic collapse, operating with 0% interest rate on bank's loan. Even mighty France was down with a bloodied nose. The only member left standing was a bruised Germany.</p>
              <p>Germany has to content with playing nurse. Integration means the strong helping the weak in times of need, otherwise why integrate? Who should it prioritised? Germany's own banks? or Litvia? or Lithuania? or Iceland? or England?</p>
              <p>Some EU members behaved in this way because they have the Union to turn to as a last resort. They could afford to be reckless with their financial discipline.</p>
              <p>Do Singapore wants that? For misbehaving or undiscipline Myanmar or Vietnam or Indonesia because they have a small 'big' daddy of Singapore to bail them out everytime they get into trouble?   </p>
              <p>Do Singapore want to put herself in future situation as Germany's in 2009?</p>

              <p><strong>Latvia In Crisis as Thatcher Free Market Model Collapses</strong></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US">The global financial and economic crisis has hit the small Baltic country Latvia harder than any single country with the possible exception of Iceland. As part of its attempt to join the European Monetary Union the country has fixed its currency the Lats to the Euro. <span> </span>The
              result has been to make a bad situation catastrophic. How the situation
              develops will have direct bearing on the fate of many emerging
              countries of eastern Europe. It marks the death of the radical
              experiment with Thatcherism in eastern Europe.</span> </span></p>

              the surface the crisis the country is experiencing the result of a
              borrowing binge among consumers which got out of control and now must
              be reigned in by tough government austerity measures. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In reality, it is
              a tale of greed of foreign bankers, a failed economic reform and a
              political system that is fixated on Euro entry as the Holy Grail for
              the economy.</strong></span></span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Events in Latvia
              over the past two years signal the death of the radical neo/liberal
              Thatcher economic shock therapy imposed after the dissolution of the
              Soviet Union when the West, led by Washington, mandated that the IMF dictate terms of economic transformation for the former Soviet economies.<span>  </span></span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">On the one side are western banks, above all Swedish banks which more of less colonized Latvia
              after 1990 as their ‘sphere of influence.’ They are allied with the IMF
              and the EU, though of late the latter two are themselves in a deep
              policy split. </span></span></p>

              the other side is a growing grass roots popular protest which since
              January has led major marches against the government, and which has
              just elected to Parliament an ethnic Russian party for the first time
              since 1990, with ethnic Latvian support, as a signal of the depth of
              protest to the free–wheeling plunder era of the past two decades. Until
              the present crisis, Latvia
              was praised in western financial markets as the ‘poster child’ of free
              market success in the region. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It was growth based on easy credit, a
              real estate bubble and consumer debt. The success was only for a tiny
              elite of bankers and local oligarchs as now is clear...</strong></span></span></span></p>
