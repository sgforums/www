              <p>What is allowing singaporeans to bring home more than 4/5 of
              their pay?</p>
              <p>Also, if lower the cost of car ownership, then Singapore will be
              flood by cars and not the foreginers. (The number of cars in SG by

              <p>this is not true.</p>
              <p>i only say lower cost of ownership, but never say about removing vehicle growth limit.</p>
              <p>look at the COE system. 1 concept, different ways of application.</p>
              <p>in Singapore, we "believe" in free market principles, and thus, we bid for COE, escalating COEs to higher and higher levels.</p>
              <p>In Beijing, the COE they implement is that only 20,000 COEs will be given at <strong>random</strong>, thus preventing explosive growth in no. of cars, yet at the same time keep prices low.</p>
              <p>and singaporeans are currently bringing home only 4/5 of their pay, since 20% goes into CPF, which is essentially untouchable.</p>

              <p>I would think that NS is a form of compulsory physical exercise to 
              strength personal health, personal social well beings through mental 
              development during physical training and cordial gathering and 
              interaction sort of like in this forum, as well as justification for 
              spending of budget.  If there is no defense means no people manning, and
               which companies can / would like to accomodate and support all these 
              people. Their parents and family also relied on their income. Indeed, 
              present defence policy and management should be revisited as people in 
              the world are more well educated, like-minded, no desire for conflict 
              like wars but in a more social context of peace and harmony. Most 
              diplomats and leaders of the world are not so stubborn as to stimulate 
              war amongst countries because no one stand to gain, conversely, their 
              immediate families, relatives and friends in other part of the world 
              would suffer become of their wrong decision. What I think is that 
              defence budget to cut on spending of armoury like acquiring of more 
              missiles etc, and less flight training of flighter airplanes and warship
               to save on fuel and also these serviceman can enjoy more time with 
              their families - touring etc. And the saving of the defence budget could
               be used to increase the monthly salary of the NSmen in a form of 
              variable components, and also to increase other low pay structure 
              servicemen / women such as logistic etc. High ranking officers between 
              countries can organised periodic interaction through social game like 
              golfing etc so as to foster cordial relationship while enjoying 
              themselves amd work on improvement of social well being through this 
              game.</p>
              <p>The physical exercise and training should be moderated and less 
              strenuous but consistence on the physical and mental well beings, and 
              look into improvement and changes for a more socially acceptable norms 
              of health and safety standard along the way etc etc etc. Just opinion, 
              and may well wishes always materialised for the well beings of all.</p>

              <p>2years FT in my opinion is enough. however one need to fine tune the reservist period. if you reqire ppl to serve 10 cycles or 40 which ever come first, first they had to look into IPPT standard, how can a reservist man who serve 2 -4 weeks a year have the same IPPT standard than the regular??</p>

              <p>i am coming towards my 40s and still serving the nation. i enjoy my time with my buddy and share the laughter with the men. but the IPPT, compensation, distinguishment btwn PR and citizens has to be made widen to show appreciation of our service!!</p>

              <p>even though i am not a supporter of the PAP but neither do i support SDP doctrine regarding NS.</p>
              <p>NS system is flaws but however major revamp is not require. afterall we are small nation, maintaing respectable reserve unit is require.</p>
              <p>2years FT in my opinion is enough. however one need to fine tune the reservist period. if you reqire ppl to serve 10 cycles or 40 which ever come first, first they had to look into IPPT standard, how can a reservist man who serve 2 -4 weeks a year have the same IPPT standard than the regular??</p>
              <p>no wonder RT lesson are hard to book. always fully book!!</p>
              <p>i am coming towards my 40s and still serving the nation. i enjoy my time with my buddy and share the laughter with the men. but the IPPT, compensation, distinguishment btwn PR and citizens has to be made widen to show appreciation of our service!!</p>

              <p>We the nazi gals will alway go for those who had serve NS, cos we find them more well groomed, mature and got good leader ship, even their physical are better than those who do not do NS, cos most of bf who did NS, exercise regularly. I think that is all i can find good in our Male doing NS, it taught them endurance, tolerance and better thinkers</p>
