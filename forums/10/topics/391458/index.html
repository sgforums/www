              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Blurring state and party lines<br></span></strong>INSIGHT: DOWN SOUTH<br>By SEAH CHIANG NEE<br><br>If China and Singapore can become twinned on the world state, they can promote a new global order that would blend authoritarianism and capitalism.<br><br>Some of the brightest Chinese officials have been coming to study how the ruling party has achieved prosperity and won elections while retaining its one-party predominance.<br><br>Such study trips – which cover the economic, social and political areas – have been reported occasionally.<br><br><span style="color: darkslategray;">Some observers believe that Singapore’s politics, with its top-down system, may be of special interest to China’s Communist Party as it ponders over reform options.</span><br><br>The latest comment came from Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who said that many groups, representing different levels of the Chinese government, had been coming in recent years to attend study courses.<br><br>On one visit – according to Lee – they showed interest in how his People’s Action Party (PAP), with a small suburban office, could reach out to its crowded heartland electorate.<br><br>The answer they got would have given them a lesson on how the PPP can benefit from its incumbent power by blurring the line separating state from party.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>In his outspoken way, Lee admitted that all grassroots organisations (with nearly 30,000 community workers) which interact and organise activities in the estates were actually part of his party.</strong></span></span><br><br>It is used by the PAP to foster bonds with Singaporeans.<br><br>Since they are publicly-funded and overseen by the People’s Association, a government statutory board under the Ministry of Community Development, the community workers are supposed to be non-partisans.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>“... Everywhere they (the Chinese) go, they see the PAP – in the RCs (residents’ committees), CCCs (citizens’ consultative committees), and the CCs (community clubs),” Lee beamed.</strong></span></span><br><br>The confirmation that these are part of the PAP could become an embarrassment to his younger ministers as the message sinks in.<br><br>It may also come as a surprise to some of the grassroots volunteers who thought they were non-partisans working for their community.<br><br>(Already the party recently announced it had difficulty recruiting enough volunteers, and grassroots bodies were some 35% understrength.)<br><br>The critics don’t faze the architect of the scheme. <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Lee once said: “I make no apologies that the PAP is the (Singapore) government and the government is the PAP.”</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: red;">His remarks moved an online analyst to comment: “No wonder the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is so interested to learn from Singapore.”</span><br></strong></span></span><br>The furore shows how much Singaporeans have changed over a generation.<br><br>In the 60s, when Lee was using these tax-funded grassroots organisations to combat pro-communists and racial extremists, it seemed natural and few people complained.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>But with many of today’s better-educated youths, the idea of the PAP using tax money against the opposition in a democracy has become unacceptable.<br><br>If the Chinese visitors had probed further, they would have found that control of grassroots is merely one of an arsenal of weapons the PAP has to hold on to power.</strong></span></span> <br><br>“If they did, the Chinese might be surprised by the reach of some of the PAP’s tentacles in the city,” a small businessman said.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Over 50 years, it has built a whole network of top-level people to run the civil service, trade unions, the press, police, armed forces and state-linked corporations that control much of Singapore’s economy.<br><br>The sheer number of people working for them – or associated with them – is large enough to make the party hard to defeat in an election.</strong></span></span> <br><br>Even if an opposition party – or coalition – were to win enough seats to form the government, it may find itself shackled on the implementation level with such extensive PAP influence in state and community machinery.<br><br>Keeping all these personnel could reduce the chances of smooth government functioning, at least for awhile, and quickly replacing a large number of them would be impossible.<br><br>The city is too small to allow for such a massive replacement of experienced people. All these do not make the PAP undefeatable and irreplaceable, but they render the task extremely difficult.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: red;"><strong>These “controlling” factors have led political analysts to regard Singapore as a role model for China to emulate, should it decide one day to introduce some form of democracy, without losing power.</strong></span></span><br><br>“Singapore has shown that its system, although criticised by the West, can preserve harmony and economic growth while giving people the vote,” said a PAP supporter.<br><br>The relevance of Singapore’s political system to China still crops up occasionally.<br><br>Most commentators say it is impractical given the vast disparity in size.<br><br>One Chinese blogger wrote: “With all due respect to Singapore, I just don’t want to compare China and Singapore. You can compare Singapore (population: 5 million) and Shanghai (16 million), or Hong Kong (7 million).”<br><br>Wang Jian Shuo added: “Politi-cally, to rule a city of several million is, of course, very different (from) ruling a bigger country (which) actually needs more wisdom in the political system.<br><br>“For example, I don’t want someone in Beijing to make decisions for me about what my children should believe. So, there is a huge difference here between Singapore and China.”<br><br>Singapore’s top writer, Catherine Lim, however, looks at the equation from another angle.<br><br>At a university forum, she spoke of the emergence of a new breed of young, sophisticated Singaporeans wanting political freedom and forcing the PAP leaders to deal with their demands.<br><br>“Not if China comes to their rescue,” Lim said.<br><br>The outspoken author was referring to a possible 2030 scenario when China’s power rises, while the United States declines and is unable to offer an ideological alternative.<br><br>Thus, she said, <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>if China and Singapore could blend authoritarianism and capitalism and become twinned on the world stage, “the Lee Kuan Yew model of governance will have achieved an international acceptance that the PAP could never have dreamt of”.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>It is an open secret that PRs are encouraged to turned citizens.</p>
              <p>With citizenship, the gulf between PR and citizenship, which Singaporeans have been fighting so hard to maintain, is as good as non-existence.</p>
              <p>Grassroots is small fly. Visit any PAP meet-the-people sessions and see for yourself the number of foreign assistants.</p>

              PAP can maintain its totalitarian family rule simply because it's much easier to subjugate and control a small population in a single concentrated population spot.

              <p>i would prefer Singapore to be protected by Chinese (given the
                  ethnic majority) than to be overrun by the Malay states in a

                  internal fighting of power happens in Singapore....</p>
              <p>i would quickly suggest to step up more strengthening diplomatic
                  ties with China as a major military protection...we could also gain
                  economic advantage from her super growth at the same time</p>

              <p>I rather not, ethnic majority is the lamest excuse to justify this.</p>
              <p>If China protect us, it would only give our neighbours more reasons to wipe out off the map and we being a small dot is bad enough cause nobody will even notice that we're gone. There are people who still don't know Singapore is an independent country not a province of China or even where we are located.</p>

              <p>It is naive to think that communist PRC will be charitable to take care of its neighbour even when they becomes global leader one day. I work for 15 yrs in PRC and I understand the mentality of the government officials from my dealing with them.</p>
              <p>Communist is still very much alive in China. One must not be obscured by the economy properity of this country to think that communist is dead. Ask any Taiwanese why they refuse to reunite and join PRC, the answer is for the fear of the communist.</p>
              <p>I have the opportunity to work for many JVs in PRC where our Chinese partners are from the top 5 SOE (state own enterprise). These JVs still have a party directed planning system whereby the party chief has the final executive and administrative authority over the mgt committee, including the CEO and CFO.</p>
              <p>Chinese are not charitable and like us, will only offer any assistant in return for financial favour or advancement of political/personal objectives. Many of their decisions or actions are sometime rather irrationale when transparency lack and top down directed. Many foreign companies failed to recognise this when they enter into joint ventures, later were decimated, losing money and patent.</p>
              <p>PRC will replace US as the economy leader one day but Singapore will only able to benefit from the rise provided we have something to offer in return. The question is what? If PRC is making commercial aircrafts, silicon carbine down to shoe and tooth paste..whatelse can Singapore offer in exchange?  unlike our neighbours that have gold and silvers, God give us only our minds. The misconception that having a large population and continue to expand sg population to saftguard our future is faulty. We have no natural resources like in US, that support the growth of the population and cosmopolitism of New York. Even Hong Kong will eventually integrated fully with PRC to be valid but will be very different in future. </p>
              <p>Singapore can only stay relevance as trading hub and add value to the  products, resources and services to our neighbours. The gene will continue to differiate our level of prosperity comparing that to our neighbours.</p>
              <p>As for PRC, they will remain as communist at least for the next 10-20 yrs. The reason being that they already had identified their next leader after Hu. They will not give up party control in exchange for economic advancement. They have shown the world when they crashed the student uprise in 1989.</p>

              <p>China old guards are around ... and the new ones will see a New China....the young are no longer indoctrinated with the Old Mao's Little Red Book....it will surely change but that would be the next 30 - 40 years from now....more elite researchers are flocking back to China...it would be a different China...and they will buy back their lost treasures and history....</p>
