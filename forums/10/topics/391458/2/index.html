              <p>Even if they are not indoctrinated with Mao's little Red Book, they are still fed propagandas from young like what our PAP has been doing. The only difference is that they are fiercely patriotic for good or bad.</p>
              <p>They will buy back their lost treasures yes, but history? Mao's cultural revolution destroyed history and treasures that can't be bought back and people who rule China today are most likely those who are sons and daughters who benefited from the cultural revolution. They destroyed part of China's history with their own hands.</p>
              <p>Some of them see us descendants of Chinese who migrated out of China for various reasons as traitors to China.</p>
              <p>You think they really care about us, a little red dot? See us as brothers related ethnically? Look at Taiwan situation, how many missiles are pointing at Taiwan when China kept repeating that Taiwanese and Chinese are brothers, no need to fight.</p>
              <p>Yes, no one will help us for free but what kind of lunch can we offer to this giant that can pretty much feed itself?</p>
              <p>If you look at the map, the closest ally we can have if Malaysia and Indonesia become hostile is Australia in terms of distance.</p>
              <p>I'm very sick of the Pro-China propagandas that PAP keep feeding us through the media.</p>

              <p>Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, friends and foes,</p>
              <p>Please dun be too carry away with our govt foreign policies with regard to China and some other superpower countries, the govt objective is not about sovereignity or getting colonised again, but rather, we are looking at the aspect of economy.</p>
              <p>You and I had fully agreed that China will be a economy powerhouse in near future, in terms of military, it is another story, but our objective is to ride the on the success of China economy, not on their military. And to do that, we need to built the foundation, the basis to let our people understand china more indept, that is why there are so many exchange programmes and business transaction going on, but there is no threat at all in our own independency. So, dun think wildly ya.</p>
              <p>It is of great luck that we, as singapore, with a high percentage of chinese who learned chinese and chinese culture and therefore able to both attract PRC and also do business with them. Hongkong sooner or later will be full china, taiwan is a big issue there, only left is we, Singapore, we want to be a financial service provider to china business, we want to be the mediator and the interimer business partner for anyone from the west or middle east who want to find the next silk route to china.</p>

              <p><br>what middle man, no lah, we are not the gate to china, Hong kong had alway been the gate to china, we are just making it more smoother, provide a platform of financial services, the know how and know why, the financial human resource, the joint venture and the outsourcing condition into china.</p>
              <p>The west can directly move into china, why they need us, but they can utilitise our clean financial services and resources and also take us as an outsourcing partnership just like a second base for launching into china.  </p>

Hongkong had alway been the NY of Asia, that is their main and core industrial, but as the 50 years of self governing coming to an end, we hope that the shift will move to here, and unlike HK, we are more diversified, we are the best oil rig producers, we got the fastest and smoothest port and oil processing around here and also many other industrial, Hongkong focus mainly on their financial sector, and perhap some shipping lines.</p>
