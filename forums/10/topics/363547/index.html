              <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ministerial Committee On Low-Wage Workers Report</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Identities
              of persons quoted in this article will remain anonymous unless
              otherwise stated.The views expressed are made in their personal
              capacity and do not contribute in any way to their mental capabilities.</span><br><br>A
              recent government report says that government largesse to the tune of
              $1.1 billion,has seen the wages of local low-wage workers rise
              significantly.However,many experts have stated that after factoring in
              inflation,the real wage increase has been only $5/mth.<br><br>The
              report,which was led by Education Minister Ng Eng Hen,points out that
              low-wage workers had seen their pay rise from $1,200/mth in 2006 to
              $1,310/mth in 2008.<br><br>However,chairman of the Society of Financial
              Services Professionals,Mr Leong Sze Hian,points out that based on data
              obtained from the Singapore Department of Statistics,the inflation rate
              for 2007 was 2.1% while the inflation for 2008 was 6.5%.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">If we factor in the inflation rate for this 2 years,the value of $1,200 in 2006 is equal to $1305 in 2008.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
              other words,the real wage increment for low-wage workers this past 2
              years is a paltry $5,which is enough to buy you a MacDonalds Happy
              Meal. </span><br><br>The government report also revealed that families
              staying in 3-room flats have seen their monthly salaries rise from
              $1910 to $2220.Mr Leong Sze Hian believes this may be due to the fact
              that more family members have had to enter the workforce.<br><br>He
              says that if there are more members in a family working,an additional
              wage increase of $300 might be a good thing.However,this also means
              that the average income of each family member has decreased.And of
              course,the expenses incurred such as transport,meals,laundry etc will
              increase.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">PoThePanda merlions :
              $1.1 billion?Do we have that many low-wage workers in Singapore?I
              suppose this will go into the debit column of the Finance Ministry's
              Accounts... ;x</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is after all,time to balance the Accounts...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I don't know why but i keep thinking of Texaco,Enron etc...*innocent whistles*</span></p>
