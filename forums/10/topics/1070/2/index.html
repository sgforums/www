That is perhaps one of the puzzling point of this issue. What is the purpose of gathering support here when none of us is going to be on the jury? So what do you hope to gain from this? When you can answer those questions yourself truthfully, then you will perhaps see the way to end this.<br><br>And it is no point trying to bulldoze your way through a forum. You started this posting to ask for people's comment. So perhaps you should be gracious enough to accept both the good and bad ones. The world does not revolve around what you want to hear only.</div></blockquote> I gave her chance after chance to come clean with me with this issue.<br>Since she take's my offer for granted, this is what we call end of peaceful solution !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That still does not answer the question of why didn't you bring all these to court if you are so amandant about the end of a peaceful solution when you have heaps of proof instead of using a forum. Same with all other questions of what you hope to gain from these and why do you need to gain support from this forum?<br><br>Is it because you think that your case will not stand the test and be thrown out?<br><br>One other thing you mention, you said you gave her chance after chance to come clean with you, then under what status are you connected to this incident that you are so obsessed with it?<br><br>Let me deduce it. To be a correspondent in a case like this, you need to be either the parties or their legal representatives to be involved. Judging from the emotional outbreak you show from your reply, I think you are directly involved in this incident. So that narrows down to you being the ex-husband or one of her so called lovers. So that is probably why you are engrossed in fixing her. But then again this is part of my deduction, and it could be wrong.<br><br>Whatever it is, my intention is not to agrue with you. Just hope that you can come to your senses and do what you think is right.</div>
