If you really intended to sue her, gather hard evidence and go before a court of law. Otherwise, after your supposingly "showdown" (should it ever happen), you are going to get your ass burnt. And for your naive thinking of garnering support here, and judging from the responses here, I doubt you are even near to making a ripple in the pond.<br><br>The reason why you get garbage support is that people don't just listen to one side of the story.

If you really intended to sue her, gather hard evidence and go before a court of law. Otherwise, after your supposingly "showdown" (should it ever happen), you are going to get your ass burnt. And for your naive thinking of garnering support here, and judging from the responses here, I doubt you are even near to making a ripple in the pond.<br><br>The reason why you get garbage support is that people don't just listen to one side of the story. Unless you can verify it to the point that it is an undeniable event, you are not going to have loads of people believing you.<br><br>I personally feel that you are just trying to get her "fixed" over some other incident rather than what you claimed. Perhaps it is over grades, perhaps over something else.</div></blockquote> Ok, u want proof, I'll send them to you by post !<br>I have heaps of court documents, photos etc of the divorce of Susan Chua as I was a co-respondent in the divorce case filed by her ex-husband.<br>Email me your name and postal address to : s1606310z@hotmail.com<br><br>After reading them, you tell me whether I have enough proof to convince you !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you claimed that you had heaps of evidence and proof, then why is it that you did not bring it up in a court of law? That is perhaps one of the puzzling point of this issue. What is the purpose of gathering support here when none of us is going to be on the jury? So what do you hope to gain from this? When you can answer those questions yourself truthfully, then you will perhaps see the way to end this.<br><br>And it is no point trying to bulldoze your way through a forum. You started this posting to ask for people's comment. So perhaps you should be gracious enough to accept both the good and bad ones. The world does not revolve around what you want to hear only.<br></div>
