              <p>On the whole, from the different polls by the Americans, majority that is more than 50% does not favour Bush.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Bush is tasting his own medicine, serve him right.  He has been too arrogant and spent most of the time on war.    When his predecessor, Bill Clinton, was the president, he managed to turn the economy around, and Bush is just doing the opposite.</p>

              <p>Don't be deceived. Obama will just carry on the policies of an inhumane corporatocracy. Who was his top campaign contributor? Goldman Sachs, who gave out $11.4 billion in salary bonuses after receiving $10 billion of the US taxpayers' money.</p>
              <p>Just by voting for the corporate bail-out bill, which is already estimated to cost the US $5 trillion, is testament to where his allegiances lie.</p>

              <p>Besides, in 2007 Judicial Watch labelled him among the top 10 most corrupt politicians in Washington, alongside Hiliary Clinton, House Speaker Pelosi and others.</p>
              <p>Judicial Watch Announces List of Washington's "Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politician" for 2007- <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/judicial-watch-announces-list-washington-s-ten-most-wanted-corrupt-politicians-2007">http://www.judicialwatch.org/judicial-watch-announces-list-washington-s-ten-most-wanted-corrupt-politicians-2007</a></p>
              <p>Don't expect him to fight for the interest of the common people. Have you heard him say anything about the PATRIOT Act? How about the NSA and FBI's illegal spying on the American people, even on anti-war activists? Or what about the deployment of US troops for "crowd and traffic control"?</p>
              <p>Two More US Military Units Assigned for Homeland Security - <a href="http://www.infowars.com/?p=5733">www.infowars.com/?p=5733</a></p>
              <p>Despite the raptures of the American people about changing "change", it seems that the only change that is coming to America is more tyranny. When Obama is talking about creating a "civilian national security force" [can anyone say Gestapo?] (<a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=69601">www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=69601</a>), its just like Germany when Hitler rose to power. Sheer oratory eloquence ensures that the public swoons and falls in line.</p>
              <p>Moreover he is also part of the globalist organisation, the Council on Foreign Relations, from which every president from 1921 have been a member of, except Bush Jr (He was probably too stupid). Like previous administrations, he'll probably fill the government with people from this as well as other similar think-tanks.</p>
              <p>If you want to know how he's foreign policy will look like, look no further than Zbigniew Brezesinki, Obama's foreign policy guru, who also was Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor. Note that he has a close relationship with David Rockefeller, with whom he co-founded the Trilateral Commission with. This is the guy who gave the world the Iranian Revolution by supporting Ayatollah Khomeini's revolution against the Shah, the person who provoked the Soviet-Afghan War in 1979 by aiding the Mujahedeen which gave rise to Osama Bin Laden. In 1997, he published a book called "The Grand Chessboard" which set out US geostrategy. In order for the US to preserve global dominance, Eurasian dominance is key for it contains 75% of the world's population and resources. While Obama is for withdrawing troops from Iraq, he is planning to expand the war in Afghanistan and also he has said he would support violations of Pakistani sovereignty in the War on (OF) Terror, a fraudulent war built on the 9/11 lie. And that's what Brezesinki adocated even before the PNAC wrote its "Re-building America's Defence" report calling for a "new Pearl Habour".</p>
              <p>While Obama would certainly be change compared to Bush, it'll just be more of the same, except that its done in a smarter way.</p>

                                      who also was Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor. Note that he
                                      has a close relationship with David Rockefeller, with whom he
                                      co-founded the Trilateral Commission with.</p>
              <p>This is the guy who gave
                                      the world the Iranian Revolution by supporting Ayatollah Khomeini's
                                      revolution against the Shah, the person who provoked the
                                      Soviet-Afghan War in 1979 by aiding the Mujahedeen which gave rise
                                      to Osama Bin Laden.</p>
              <p>In 1997, he published a book called "The Grand
                                      Chessboard" which set out US geostrategy. In order for the US to
                                      preserve global dominance, Eurasian dominance is key for it
                                      contains 75% of the world's population and resources.</p>
              <p>While Obama
                                      is for withdrawing troops from Iraq, he is planning to expand the
                                      war in Afghanistan and also he has said he would support violations
                                      of Pakistani sovereignty in the War on (OF) Terror, a fraudulent
                                      war built on the 9/11 lie.</p>
              <p>And that's what Brezesinki adocated even
                                      before the PNAC wrote its "Re-building America's Defence" report
                                      calling for a "new Pearl Habour".</p>

              <p>Most of above is actually true.</p>
              <p>But I don't think Brezesinki is associated with PNAC group.</p>

              <p>Lets not refer to it as "one world government" since you probably will think I'm going to connect this to a conspiracy. Rather, lets focus on a policy of global integration (Yes, semantic deception again). And remember that I have never centered this movement on any particular group or individual.</p>
              <p>Remember what Brezesinki said?</p>
              <p>"We cannot leap into <em>world government</em> [his words, not mine] in one quick step... The precondition for eventual globalisation- genuine globalisation- is <em><strong>progressive regionalisation</strong></em>, because thereby we move toward larger, more stable, more cooperative units."</p>
              <p>So the precondition for global integration is "progressive regionalisation". Since the CFR is in North America, let's use the North American Union as an example. In 2002, the CFR released a report entitled "Towards a North American Community" in which it supported an integration between Canada, the US and Mexico, which was formalised when Bush signed the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) with his North American counterparts. But really, its an extension of the 1994 NAFTA, which sought to "harmonise" regulations between the 3 countries. And under the SPP, regulations between the 3 in a wide-range of fields from immigration to education to agriculture and even military etc are further integrated in a repeat of the EU. Not only is the CFR guided by this globalist ideology, but as evident from NAFTA and the SPP, it is able to guide government decisions because every administration puts CFR members into high-ranking political positions. Most significant departments of the US Cabinet are usually staffed by CFR members.</p>
              <p>As further evidence of the CFR's globalist ideology, its president Richard Haas wrote this in an op-ed:</p>
              <p>"Globalisation thus implies that <em><strong>sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality, but that it needs to become weaker</strong></em>. States would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves, because they cannot insulate themselves from what goes on elsewhere. Sovereignty is no longer a sanctuary." -<a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9903/sovereignty_and_globalisation.html">http://www.cfr.org/publication/9903/sovereignty_and_globalisation.html</a></p>
              <p>Moreover, the simultaneous merging of an emerging NAU and the EU is also conducted with the blessings of the CFR, together with other globalist-minded organisations. The Transatlantic Policy Network, which pushed for a common market (integration) between the US and the EU, lists the CFR as one of their cooperating institutions. <a href="http://www.tpnonline.org/institutions.html">- http://www.tpnonline.org/institutions.html</a></p>
              <p>You'll probably call these guys "crackpots" too, although you're unqualified, but what the heck..</p>
              <p>"The most powerful clique in these elitist groups have one objective in common- the want to bring about the <em>surrender of sovereignty and the national independence of the US</em>. A second clique of international bankers in the CFR... comprises the Wall Street international bankers and their key agents. Primarily, they want the world banking monopoly from whatever power ends up in the control of <em><strong>global government</strong></em>." -Chester Ward, Retired US Rear Admiral and former CFR member.</p>
              <p>And remember what Carrol Quigley, who was a CFR historian wrote: "The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim; nothing less than to create <em><strong>a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole</strong></em>."</p>
              <p>If you're that good at Googling conspiratorial stuff, shouldn't you know that "NWO crackpots" usually accuse the CFR of being a harbinger of world government. But I guess, even the best sometimes screw up.</p>
              <p>P.S No, Brezesinki is not connected with the PNAC, as far as I know nor did I claim he was. I was just comparing his 1997 book about geostrategy in Central Asia with the PNAC 2000 report that indirectly called for the US to invade oil-rich countries in the wake of a "new Pearl Habour" (which would conveniently come 1 year later).</p>

              <p>Sorry, he was not a CFR historian, I wrote that because he was given the opportunity to study the CFR's internal documents. He was a CFR member though.</p>
              <p>Who cares about what a man like Brezesinki said? Even though he is probably more influential than you or I will ever become? He influenced policy back in Carter's days that is still having ramifications today. Moreover, he attends Bilderberg Meetings. So yes, its important to pay attention to what he says, especially about the precondition to world government being progressive regionalisation. I don't see how that can be construed as an illogical reasoning.</p>
              <p>Of course, he opposed the Iraq invasion because it was a stupid idea and would not advance US interests in the region. You may not know, but Brezesinki is probably someone you call a Machiavellian. Instead of invading Venezuela, he would probably pit Columbia against Venezuela. Iran/Syria/China could be manipulated against Russia. Just like how he pitted the Mujahedeen against the Russians to give them a "vietnam".</p>
              <p>The point I was trying to make in my original post was that Obama does not represent change which will benefit the working citizen. If you don't want to address that, and instead want to debate about world government, then do that in the NWO thread. Otherwise, stay on topic.</p>

              <p>He is.

              <p>"The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can 'throw the rascals out' at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy." - From "Tragedy and Hope"</p>
              <p>Surely this cannot be taken out of context, and lets forget the NWO for a moment since this thread is about Obama, who is NOT change. By the way, I emailed the CFR for a membership roster, for which <em>they dont have a historic one for the public</em> so it'll be impossible to verify Quigley's membership (pretty efficient, I must admit). However, I couldn't find Obama's name in it, so <strong>I was wrong</strong> to say that he was a member. And what of it? Does not change the disproporationate amount of influence the CFR has on every administration.</p>
              <p>A final call, if you want to call me out on the NWO, do it in that thread.</p>

                                                          and not baseless allegations."</p>
              <p>How is the fact that Obama is not president yet linked to Arapahoe's assertion
                                  that whatever views for which I've substantiated is "bullshit"? If
                                  they are, Arapahoe is bound by forum ethics and the guidelines to
                                  provide some evidence for his assertion.</p>
              <p>Similarly, Soosiangong has just made a baseless allegation because his
                      statement implies that Obama is God, or some representation of God,
                      without giving some evidence for it (evidence which I look forward to
                      seeing). Likewise, he has asserted that Obama will "attain global
                      peace" without backing it up, while I've given substantial evidence
                      that he will bring just the contrary.</p>

              <p>If the US Citizens believe that "<em>all politicians are more or less the same</em>" - and if Obama is a shade better than the "Capitalist" and the "Communist" put together, then he certainly deserve to win - simply based on his ability to 'hoodwink' the popular votes from those millions of Americans who voted for him; as well as the majority of the Electoral College votes that was given to Obama.</p>
