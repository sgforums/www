              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dear Dr Chee Soon Juan and Dr James Gomez,</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>I am a new bird in politics and want post a simple question to u two.</p>
              <p>Why Obama (ya u are right.The US President --designate.</p>
              <p>not my friend) is the only Black Senate in US Senate?</p>
              <p>But  there are 37,502,300 Black or African American</p>
              <p>or 12.8 % of US population!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/files/dynamic/RACEHO.pdf">Race and Hispanic Origin in 2005</a></p>
              <p>How one person to represent 37,502,300 Black peoples.</p>
              <p>Obama is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">5 th Black Senate</span> in US history since abolishing</p>
              <p>of salvery in 1863--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-140 years</span>!!</p>
              <p>2.FYI.in the Cabinets of Singapore,there are 3 Indian races,</p>
              <p>1 Malay,and one Indian/Chinese(father is Indian) out</p>
              <p>of overall 20 Cabinets members.4 in 20=20%!!</p>
              <p>I think GRC can represent miniority better!!</p>
              <p>do u think so?</p>
              <p>3.Pl tell me how good is the US system !!</p>

              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dear Dr Chee Soon Juan and Dr James Gomez,</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>I am a new bird in politics and want post a simple question to u two.</p>
              <p>Why Obama (ya u are right.The US President --designate.</p>
              <p>not my friend) is the only Black Senate in US Senate?</p>
              <p>But  there are 37,502,300 Black or African American</p>
              <p>or 12.8 % of US population!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/files/dynamic/RACEHO.pdf">Race and Hispanic Origin in 2005</a></p>
              <p>How one person to represent 37,502,300 Black peoples.</p>
              <p>Obama is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">5 th Black Senate</span> in US history since abolishing</p>
              <p>of salvery in 1863--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-140 years</span>!!</p>
              <p>2.FYI.in the Cabinets of Singapore,there are 3 Indian races,</p>
              <p>1 Malay,and one Indian/Chinese(father is Indian) out</p>
              <p>of overall 20 Cabinets members.4 in 20=20%!!</p>
              <p>I think GRC can represent miniority better!!</p>
              <p>do u think so?</p>
              <p>3.Pl tell me how good is the US system !!</p>

              <p>With LKY at the helm of Singapore Politics for more then 51 years, is it not sad that your cynicism still exist - when Singapore had it in the Constitution, the Flag, the National Anthem and the Pledge that all everyone in Singapore is EQUAL ?</p>

              <p><br>Only a fool will believe that there is a joke in believing there is any pressure in submitting a simple application.</p>
              <p>Can your 10-year old niece even know how to fill a candidate's nomination form, or is she only good at sucking the candy paper only ?</p>
              <p>Was James Gomez intending to "rule the nation", or was he merely offering himself to stand as a candidate to be elected as a Member of Parliament ?</p>
              <p>If you cannot read accurately the contents of what have been written, you should have your 10-year old niece to teach you to read if she is as intelligent as you claim.</p>
