Whether is it public or silent mob, these exercises are held very frequently. So often in fact, Mindef took the trouble to provide months of advanced notice to all NS personnel on their ICT or manning period so as to minimise disruptions to their daily activities.</div>

This illness is nothing compared to the one inflicting Malaysian's Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar who foams at the mouth whenever  he talks about Singapore...<br>Now he was reported as saying ....</span><br><br>Jan 27 (Bernama) -- <span style="color: darkred;">Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar said Monday Singaporeans should think of the consequences of instigating their government over sensitive issues between Malaysia and Singapore, particularly those with the "threat of war" angle. "They should think about it or they'll regret it later," he said<br>Syed Hamid was asked to comment on the move by Singapore's Young People's Action Party (PAP) to allowing citizens of the republic to discuss the possibility of war between Singapore and Malaysia openly on its official website.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Syed Hamid said that it was irresponsible to talk about war. </span><br>He said that Malaysia, in the past, only mentioned about defending its right and sovereignty and nothing about war. Malaysia, he said, had always stressed on negotiations and if things do not work out, Malaysia prefers referring matters to a third party for solution. "<br>He said that it was unnecessary for Singapore to show its political backing by certain countries and military weaponries to influence Malaysia's stand on disputed issues between the two countries.</span><br><br><span class="large">And now his is blaming ordinary Singaporean for "instigating their government" on internet forums ?!!  Even odder  for him  comment on Singapore using "certain countries and military weaponries" for influence and prefer to talk about PAP forums instead  of Singapore's parliament speech and info release on 25 Jan . What the hell is he barking up now ?<br><br>In fact, the Malaysian media was so QUIET for over 24 hrs after Singapore's Parliament speech that not a single word was mentioned about Singapore, the bilateral issues, and let alone on Dr Jayakumar's speech. They only started reporting today about  Dr. M commented to the press team on his return to KL .<br><br>What is noticiable on NST Sunday Times (26 Jan) are<br>Zero abstract on Singapore's position.<br>Zero coverage on Singapore's release of letters and doc.<br>Zero comment from NST or their usually inflammatory editorials.<br><br>My bate is the Malaysian gov and its media is going to respone with more retoric, confusing media talks and lies to the Malaysian pple.</span></div>

But I have to release them now because this hope is no longer realistic and so much misinformation on the water issue has been put out by Malaysia that needs to be rebutted by conclusive evidence."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>But Mr Syed Hamid has questioned Singapore's motive for making the documents public.<br><br>"What are they trying to show, to prove? I think there is lack of good faith in this particular case. You don't publish these letters. These letters can be published when you're writing memoir or something like that," Mr Syed Hamid said.<br><br>"By this action, it simply means that all this while it has no intention of finding a solution," he said.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Mr Syed Hamid also refuted Singapore's claim that Malaysia had repeatedly changed its position each time a solution was near.<br><br>"They want it commercial, they want market price. We reacted to that. Market price means not three sen. And we're willing to pay more for the treated water to reflect market and commercial price. I think its unfair - this blaming game," he said.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>However, the Malaysian minister agreed with Professor Jayakumar that loose talk of war is both irresponsible and dangerous.<br><br>"Malaysia has never talked about war but we've always been talking about defending our rights and sovereignty. We've never said that we're going to go to war," the Malaysian minister said.<br><br>"The reason that why negotiate, we said in a conflict situation, we would like to negotiate and if we cannot agree, we'll refer to it to a third party. We've never tried to show our strength or trying to show that we can defeat anybody," he said.<br><br>But this was in stark contrast to comments Mr Syed Hamid made late last month, when he was quoted as saying that Singapore had two choices on the Pedra Branca issue: "If it refuses to compromise...go to war."</strong><br><br>Mr Syed Hamid also stressed there would not be anymore negotiations between the two countries to break the current impasse.<br><br>He was, however, non-committal on Professor Jayakumar's statement that Singapore is prepared to refer the matter to arbitration, according to the laws of Johor, as provided for in the agreement.<br><br>screw him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  BS politicians <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
