              <blockquote>Shadrake recently sent an open letter to the Australian press about his 
              unjust confinement in Singapore. I (<span class="post-author vcard"><span class="fn">Gopalan Nair) </span></span>am reproducing it with the permission
               of Amnesty International.<br><br><em>JUSTICE SINGAPORE STYLE<br><br>I 
              AM BEING PROSECUTED AND FACING JAIL FOR EXPOSING JUDICIAL SCANDALS IN 
              SINGAPORE – SCANDALS THIS PAP DICTATORSHIP DOESN’T WANT DECENT 
              SINGAPOREAN CITIZENS TO KNOW ABOUT. <br><br>ONE PARTICULARLY HEINOUS 
              SCANDAL CONCERNS GUIGA LYES LAROUSSI, A TUNISIAN, WHO WAS THE MAIN DRUG 
              SUPPLIER TO SINGAPORE’S SO-CALLED HIGH SOCIETY DRUG CIRCLE IN 2004.<br><br>THIS
               DESTROYER OF LIVES WAS ALLOWED TO ESCAPE SINGAPORE AFTER FACING A 
              MANDATORY DEATH PENALTY CHARGE. THE CHARGE WAS THEN ‘NEGOTIATED’ DOWN SO
               HE WOULD RECEIVE A JAIL SENTENCE OF BETWEEN 20 TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON 
              INSTEAD. <br><br>THEN ANOTHER MIRACLE HAPPENED: HE WAS ALLOWED BAIL IN 
              THE SUM OF $280,000, GIVEN HIS PASSPORT BACK AND ALLOWED TO LEAVE 
              SINGAPORE. THIS WAS DONE WITH THE HELP OF TOP GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
              BECAUSE THEY FEARED HE WOULD EXPOSE BIGGER NAMES IF HE WERE TO BE SENT 
              TO THE GALLOWS.<br><br>I EXPOSED THIS AND OTHER JUDICIAL SCANDALS IN MY 
              BOOK BECAUSE I HATE INJUSTICE. WHILE THIS EVIL DRUG BARON – FRIEND OF 
              THE RICH AND PRIVILEGED IN SINGAPORE – IS ENJOYING HIS LIFE OF LUXURY IN
               HIS MANSION ON HIS FAMILY ESTATE IN LE BARDO, TUNISIA, SINGAPORE IS 
              PLANNING TO HANG MORE PITIFUL DRUG MULES - PERHAPS SOME WHO HELPED GUIGA
               GET RICH. <br><br>HOW IS IT THAT THIS EVIL DRUG TRADER MANAGED TO 
              ESCAPE JUSTICE? I CANNOT GET MY PASSPORT BACK AND BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE 
              SINGAPORE. THEY ARE DETERMINED TO PUNISH ME FIRST! <br><br>I AM FACING A
               SIX MONTHS PRISON SENTENCE FOR EXPOSING THIS AND MANY OTHER JUDICIAL 
              SCANDALS IN SINGAPORE. THERE ARE TWO OTHER CHARGES HANGING OVER ME 
              ARISING FROM MY BOOK ONE OF WHICH CARRIES A TWO YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. MY
               MEDICAL PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN HORRENDOUS TO MY WELL-BEING AND FINANCES. I 
              ALMOST BLED TO DEATH IN THE STREET SIX WEEKS AGO FROM INTERNAL BLEEDING.
               HAD I NOT BEEN RUSHED TO HOSPITAL I WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED AND DIED 
              WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING THE CAUSE UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. <br><br>WHERE IS
               THE JUSTICE IN WHAT THEY ARE NOW DOING TO ME? DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT 
              GUIGA LYES BEN LAROUSSI HAD ESCAPED JUSTICE? DID THE STRAITS TIMES 
              PUBLISH THIS SCANDAL? THEY DID NOT! WHY NOT? BECAUSE THE POWERS THAT BE 
              IN SINGAPORE, WHO CONTROL THE MEDIA, DIDN’T WANT TO ANYONE TO KNOW.<br><br>BUT
               WHAT HAPPENED WHEN A ROMANIAN DIPLOMAT RAN AWAY IN MARCH FOLLOWING A 
              FATAL TRAFFIC ACCIDENT? SCREAMING HEADLINES IN THE NEW PAPER AND STRAITS
               TIMES FOR HIM TO BE BROUGHT BACK AND TRIED! <br><br>GUIGA LAROUSSI, 
              DESTROYER OF LIVES – INCLUDING HIS OWN SINGAPOREAN GIRLFRIEND MARIANA 
              ABDULLAH - - HAS BEEN ON INTERPOL’S WANTED LIST FOR FIVE YEARS. THE HEAD
               OF INTERPOL IS YOUR VERY OWN FORMER POLICE CHIEF KHOO BOON HUI! NO 
              ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO BRING HIM BACK. HIS LAWYER, SUBHAS ANANDAN, HAS
               SAID THAT HIS POWERFUL FAMILY WILL TELL THE TUNISIAN POLICE TO ‘GO FLY A
               KITE’ IF THEY ATTEMPT TO ARREST AND HAVE HIM EXTRADITED. THIS IS YET 
              ANOTHER SCANDAL IN THIS SAGA. I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TREATED HAD I 
              BEEN A DRUG SYNDICATE BOSS. <br>AMAZINGLY, Law Minister and Second Home 
              Affairs Minister, K. Shanmugam recently told TODAY that the death 
              penalty for drug offences here is a “trade-off” the government must make
               to protect “thousands of lives” if drugs became freely available. He 
              further explained that if Yong Vui Kong (now on death row with 36 
              others) escapes the death penalty, drug lords will see it as a sign that
               young traffickers will be spared and will then use more of them as drug
               mules. “You save one life here, but 10 other lives will be gone. What 
              will your choice be?” he added. <br>MY CHOICE MR. SHANMUGAM? IF ANYONE HAS TO BE HANGED, START WITH DRUG BARONS LIKE GUIGA LYES BEN LAROUSSI!<br>I KNOW I WILL NOT GET FAIR JUSTICE. I WILL GET SINGAPORE JUSTICE!<br><br>Alan Shadrake<br>A Prisoner of Singapore<br>October 28 2010</em></blockquote>

              <p>He is a British. Why did he send open letter to oz press, not UK press?</p>
