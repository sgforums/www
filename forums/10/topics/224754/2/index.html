            <div class='col-md body'>Well,<br><br>If the article is accurate, then that is another typical case of Singapore's 'go-by-the-book' style. This is not the first time some big or small Singapore companies demonstrated such illogic inflexibility because the rule say so. Our big local bank also made a big joke few years back in Hong Kong destroying safe deposit boxes. I personally had bad experiences when NUH guard shouted at me(sick patient + customer) for making a wrong entry from automatically opened exit door.<br><br>Doing business is about customer service. We need to be flexible sometimes. Although some rules can not be bent, well, at least it must be managed nicely, not a straight 'NO' to people's face.<br><br>Not that I am critical of Singapore companies. My own future is very much tie to Singapore's success. But the military top-down no-question-ask approach of many Singapore GLCs have to adapt with time.</div>

And it's free seating so it means EVEN if the lady is seated up in front for easy boarding ...she must be able to make it to the toilet as well and since the airline is not wheelchair friendly - how is the passenger going to go to the toilet in an 8 hr flight if her family members cannot hold her up ? In the seat ? That makes it objectionable. And IF she is allocated a seat near the toilet , how is she going to walk to the entrance if her family members can't hold her up to stand?<br><br>I got a feeling that the family might have been asked to show how they will assist in her mobility and probably could not show it. No enough details except from one side .<br><br>They should have just booked a qantas and qantas has a special allocation for disabled passengers and they are able to take off some of their seats in certain airplanes for medical transportation ( repatriation of patients have been done this way) . The family will just pay more and less the hassle .<br><br></div>

I won't be surprised if the public has sympathy for them tho . I won't call that demanding - misguided is the word I would use - some of those who think Tiger airlines is at fault are not wrong but their views might not be right either if it was according to the scenarios I have given.<br><br>Like I said it is only one side of the story and I am just playing devil's advocate.<br><br></div>

However they did say they will take her if she is able to be assisted by the family. Now if you are an airline hostesss or steward - would u want to carry a person who is a quadriplegic ? Not I , I have enough injury to my own back to know the pain that comes with it.<br><br>Occupational Health and Safety regulations in Australia state clearly that no employee is to risk their own health in their jobs and that they have a right to refuse any requests which may endanger their safety. If the employee chooses to do so and injure themselves , they are not covered by the company fully.<br><br>So if the girl cannot walk and the family is assessed as fully requiring the assistance of the staff to help lift her , therefore endangering the staff in terms of occupational injury i.e. back injury. They have a right to refuse her onboard . I would say that it is fully justified. </div></blockquote>I think you've touched a chord with this.<br><br>It's all fine and dandy if the airline staff and captain are all smiles and allows the family to board. But assuming that along the tarmac and while being 'assisted' up the stairs, she accidentally falls and suffers serious injuries, what are the odds that the family will sue TIGER airways for 'gross negligence'?<br><br>Those same airline staff and captain may suddenly become red-faced for being 'naive' in going above their call to bend the rules out of compassion.<br><br>The fact is, the rules are there to protect the airline from legal issues; while it may be seen as inhumane, it is a required fundamental in running a service-oriented company.<br><br>The real question is: why did the SG office give a 'green light' to the family in the first place if the Australian office was going to veto it? Was any consensus between the two offices agreed upon before responding to the customer?<br><br>As a gesture of goodwill, they should negotiate a compensation package for the family.</div>

In a lot of country like australia - the airport have sub contract out the counter staffing , thus the airline have no say but to use the service and pay a fee for it. The counter staff are unusually strict. I encounter that before, for SIA even if you luggage weight over a little by a few kg , usually at other place, they will just let you go, but australia side even 1/2 kg they will not let you.<br><br>As for the article , it is highly strange !!! Disable ? if a normal disable person on wheelchair , I would guess there may not be much trouble..... but what happen if the person is disable ...... and really does not seem able to survive the trip without special medical care, which airline does not have- thus she maybe disallow on board..... the story maybe just 1/2 the story, as the writer seem to be purposely leaving out the detail of the disability.</div>
