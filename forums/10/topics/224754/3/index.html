Disable ? if a normal disable person on wheelchair , I would guess there may not be much trouble..... but what happen if the person is disable ...... and really does not seem able to survive the trip without special medical care, which airline does not have- thus she maybe disallow on board..... the story maybe just 1/2 the story, as the writer seem to be purposely leaving out the detail of the disability. </div></blockquote>It's really your luck if you got hit by the weight rule.<br><br>Checking in early usually avoids this complication. Again, it's really who is serving you. Remember that they are obliged to cut your weight if your luggage is has breached the minimum weight limits. On the other hand, the aircraft safety weight limit is usually extremely conservative. Thus early check-ins usually save you from this kind of problem.<br><br>On separate lufthansa, air france and SQ flights, i checked in with an average of 5kg above the limit and i had no problems.</div>
