              <h1>The mortal danger of “self spinning” ourselves in delusion</h1>
              <p><strong>By Fang Zhi Yuan</strong></p>
              <p>At the Singapore Tripartism Forum last Sunday, Prime Minister Lee
              was asked by a business leader to comment on the performance of Temasek
              and GIC in the wake of the stunning revelation of its recent losses.</p>
              <p>He replied straight in the face that “<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">these are very respectable figures</span></strong>” based on the annual returns quoted by Finance Minister Tharman.</p>
              <p>“Some years it will go down, some years it will go up more. But <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>on average it’s not bad</strong></span>. And we have to<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> take a long-term view</span></strong> because this is not money for now,<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> this is money for many years ahead</span></strong>. If you look at a long-term basis, on the overall on the way the government has managed the money, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">we haven’t done badly</span></strong>“, he said. (read the original report <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=2275">here</a>)</p>
              <p>I wondered if the journalist who wrote the report was equally as
              convinced as Prime Minister Lee. If the article was meant to allay the
              fears and angst of Singaporeans, it doesn’t sound reassuring at all.</p>
              <p>In the first place, we are still kept in the dark over the real
              extent of GIC’s losses, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>which a Thai Daily put it at an estimate of
              over S$200 billion dollars. </strong></span>Then there is the danger of Citi Bank and
              Bank of America being nationalized by the United States government
              which will wipe out much of our investment.</p>
              <p>Given the dire state the U.S. banks are in now, how long will we
              have to wait before we recoup our losses and we are talking about a
              mind-boggling sum in terms of billions. Even if the share prices do
              rebound in 10 or 20 years time, what is the opportunity cost lost when
              we could have grown the money by investing it in gold, bonds or fixed
              deposits.</p>
              <p>I am not an economist and yet I am able to point out such
              glaring deficiencies in the news report. Surely there are financial
              professionals in the government and the media who being more
              knowledgable than me, are able to correct the Prime Minister’s mistakes
              and give the people a more accurate and detailed answer ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why is there
              such a deafening silence ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>The culprits responsible for this devastating loss are none other
              than the wife and father of the Prime Minister. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>While Madam Ho Ching
              has stepped down from Temasek, Lee Kuan Yew is still the Chairman of
              GIC and a minister in the Cabinet. Which minister or MP in Parliament
              will dare to question the Minister Mentor’s judgement and authority?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The media has long ceased to be a genuine voice for the people and
              instead it has been deftly manipulated to serve as tinted glasses for
              us to view a distorted reality from the government’s perspective.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Seeing Singapore through this tunnel vision, we are trained over the
              years to believe that our leaders can make no mistakes. We are not
              allowed to question them or to demand for more information from them.
              Just keep quiet and let them run the country because they are the “best
              talents” tiny Singapore can off<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>er.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our leaders are surrounded by cronies and sycophants who dare not
              speak the truth out of fear of losing their rice-bowls or ruining their
              careers. The state media exercise stringent self-censorship to spin the
              news which sound pleasant to their ears. They live in ivory towers
              erected by their sense of pride, omnipotence and infallibility
              completely disconnected with the people they are supposed to serve.
              That is how the Singapore government has been treating us, like kids.</strong></span></p>
              <p>If Prime Minister Lee were to leave his ivory tower for an instance
              and venture into the “wild wild west” of Singapore’s blogosphere, he
              would be absolutely flabbergasted at what his citizens are speaking of
              him. Few were convinced by his lame defence of Temasek and GIC’s
              performance. Many more were angry and shocked by the loss of our
              precious reserves.</p>
              <p>In an online poll conducted <a href="http://wayangparty.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/polls-on-the-temasek-debacle/">here</a>, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">98% of 500 netizens polled want a Commission of Inquiry to be set up</span></strong> to probe into the loss. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">73% are “very unhappy</span>” </strong>with the way the government had handled the fiasco while <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">22% are</span> “<span style="color: #ff0000;">quite disappointed</span>“.</strong> And more embarassingly, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">73% wants the Prime Minister to step down</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>If our leaders come to know about the poll results, they will probably dismiss it as ”an <strong>online poll taken from a website devoted to anti-government invective</strong>.”
              We will be accused of spreading rumors and lies to provoke hatred
              against the government and soon another minister will threaten to
              arrest us.</p>
              <p>We are in great danger of being fooled, misled and deluded by all
              these irresponsible and callous “self-spinning”. The citizens are taken
              in by the spin and remain contented to let their leaders run the show.
              The leaders believe the spin and continue to ignore underlying concerns
              and disgruntlement on the ground. What will this country become ?</p>
              <p>I sincerely implore our leaders to stop hiding behind the spins of
              the state media and come forward to face the people;  fellow
              Singaporeans to stand up and give honest feedback to the government,
              and journalists to be report the truth fearlessly bearing in mind their
              obligations to society.</p>
              <p><strong>An open, accountable and transparent government should not fear its critics and treat them as enemies</strong>.
              In fact, it should be glad that there are Singaporeans who care enough
              to speak out. It will be a sad day for Singapore if nobody bother to
              question how the country is being governed for it would mean that it
              has ceased to become a home in our hearts.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our country is facing the greatest crisis in its lifetime. There is
              no space and time for parochial and petty politicking to safeguard
              one’s vested interests and misplaced pride. Turning a blind eye to the
              problems and pretending all is well will only plunge us into a greater
              abyss.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The soul of a nation does not lie in GDP numbers, world class
              infrastructure or a first world government. It lies in a well-informed,
              socially active and politically mature citizenry which is able keep the
              nation together in spite of any internal or external threats.</p>
              <p>If I do not love Singapore, I would not waste my time typing this
              article. As an ordinary citizen, that’s about as much I can do. I may
              not know enough to teach our esteemed leaders how to run the country,
              but I am concerned enough to express my misgivings about the direction
              we are heading now and in the future.</p>
