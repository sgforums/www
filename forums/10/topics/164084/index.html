            <div class='col-md body'>Very often, we may hear leaders talking about leaderships, talents, or abilities in running a business or country.<br><br>So what is leadership or talent ? Is it something effective or attainable or only some kind of good-looking packaging of self-centred concepts or ideas.<br><br>Presumably leaders should possess uniques abilities or attributes to set direction and unite people to take collective actions or make sacrifices to strive for progress. In order to be effective leaders they have to possess the extra ability to motivate people in knowledge application, teamwork, diligence or sacrifice for the country. They themselves are expected to set good example to act honorably and carry out their words, promises and policies.<br><br>Upon closer examination, many leaders are found unable to fulfill their words of honour nowadays, or turn their concepts and assumptions into mananageable processes to realise hands-on efficiency, competitiveness, excellence, reliability, or sense of justice, empathy with the poor or concern with social and economic wellbeing of all ?<br><br>The most common fault today with leaders is that they tend to rely on concepts and assumptions, rhetorics and presentations and fail to live up to their expectations of the people or followers.<br><br>Hence there is a need for leaders to be fully aware of the dangers of relying on presentations, concepts or assumptions which often end up as broken promises and setbacks to their followers.<br><br>Good leaders must be people who are equally adept with skills of practical implementation. They must understand that people have needs and desires to succeed in their respective fields and positions and they must be motivated to unleash their skills and apply their talents before they could contribute meaningfully to work together for common good.<br><br>Without laying out goals, and policies in implementation processes tasks will be entangled in complexities and uncertainties which cause office politics and conflicts. To that extent tasks are entangled in complexities or uncertainties, there will be problems with application of knowledge and development of technology.<br><br>It is critical to motivate the masses in applications of knowledge and technologies, while dispensing with judgmental conceptual and rhetorical management. At the same time, masses should be motivated to apply skills through broad-based practical education which will lead to widespread application of technology and knowledge.<br><br>In the fast-paced technological age of internet and instant telecommunication, it is urgent to get people to develop their skills and knowledge to be creative, entrepreneurial and proactive, and seize opportunities at practical applications of knowledge by all in every field.<br><br>Because of past conceptual approaches, there have been too many policy failures which caused the slow-down of the economy and unhappiness of the people. As a result, govenrment has to extend controls and regulations, and increasing the taxing and recovering of costs to the full market values thereby causing hardship.<br><br>Today's technology-age leadership should consist of the following criteria:-<br><br>(1) Translate goals and objectives into implementation processes to empower all workers to maximize their knowledge applications, to create competitiveness, technology start-ups and jobs.<br><br>(2) Collective leadership and good corporate governance to avoid self-centred narrow top-down conceptual management that stifle mass participation in knowledge application, implementation of ideas and growth.<br><br>Today's leadership should possess the clear practical ability to motivate people to become true partners of business or enterprise so that the masses could be totally involved in decision making and working towards results together as a team.<br><br>In this way they can then leverage the many resources at work and mobilise the people to realize technologicial start-ups and value-add economic competitiveness which currently could only be talked about.<br><br>No matter how brilliant, the concept of a few talents at the top of organization is too narrow the leadership approach. Today's leaders should be collective open and consultative possessing the total functional abililites and total scope and radar range to cover the whole spheres of social culture and economic exchanges and leveling up of competitiveness. Not only that, it encourages self-interests and controls which are not consonent with the majoirity's vibrancy and growth.<br><br>Process management can be set up to lay out works and challenges to empower all to work  collectively with coordination and application of knowledge at all level to attain results on their own without all the hype, excuses to justify past mistakes and lack of performance.<br></div>

This point is very important and I will certainly cover it in revision on leadership thinking.</div>

By highlighting some of the national issues here, it does not mean we are anti-establishment or anti-government. The fact the we speak shows that we care and are concerned for this country. People may disagree with what a forumite wrote and think otherwise. But please do not call names just becuase you think you views are superior. Others forumites here would naturally be convinced that your view is superior if many other forumites concur to your statements or when you can produce convincing evidence.<br><br></div>
