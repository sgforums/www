            <div class='col-md body'>Spat With Singapore - People Have The Right To Know<br><br>16-28 Feb 2003, Harakah<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Mahathir government's handling of the crisis with Singapore is indeed a disgrace for the entire nation. On January 30 for example, Prime Minister Mahathir compared his letters with Singapore's former premier Lee KuanYew on the water negotiations with 'letters sent to one's girlfriend'. It is of course the job of the government of the day to defend the country's sovereignty, honour and welfare of the people. But these have to be done in accordance with the law and established practices of the civilized world.<br><br>It was a pity that instead of replying and explaining our stance on the issues dealt with in Singapore's revelatÃ­ons Mahathir chose to trivialize the matter. Perhaps now Lee Kuan Yew should reflect on his own words sometimes ago; that with Mahathir and Umno in power (his reply to the possibility of PAS taking over this country) he could have a good sleep! One wonders what the Attorney-General chambers, especially Abdul Ghani Patail, has told or advised Mahathir on the points.<br><br>Foreign Minister Syed Hamid AIbar also displayed similar incompetence during the press conference with his counterpart S. Jayakumar on February 6. Although Malaysia said that we would not resort to aggression and force the government asserted the right to the island's water and airspace.<br><br>From the Iegal point of view Jayakumar made more sense when he said that the matter should stand as they are until the International Court of JustÃ­ce (ICJ) made a ruling on the matter. Apparently the UMNO-led government is trying to deal with Singapore in the manner they deal with Kelantan and Terengganu; namely throw away the books and forget the law.<br><br>The way both Mahathir and Syed Hamid dealt with the issues have been an embarrassment for the entire country. They should be asked to resign. The people have the right to know the whole thing. And the government should not use these issues just to whip up their sentiments and support for Barisan. We should not inculcate the attitude of 'my country right of wrong',<br><br>We know the Mahathir government and its media simply wanted to sensationalise the entire issues with Singapore as the elections are just around the corner. The issue was suddenly propped up by the media when Mahathir suddenly found himself stuck with issues such as denial of funds to SARs where he realized that what he did was against the constitution and the law.<br><br>Not only that he also missed the target as most of the religious schools are now under the control of his own party just like the mosques. So it was really a case of pot calling the kettle black when Mahathir accused Singapore of trying to divert the people in the republic when they revealed the confidential correspondence between him and Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Now the media owned by UMNO are trying to make the fuss over the visit made by Opposition Leader and Terengganu Mentri Besar Abdul Hadi Awang to what they claimed 'the meetmg of Muslim radicals' in Indonesia two years ago. It looks like an attempt to save the government for its pathetic handling of the problems with Singapore.<br><br>Obviously the federal government is only 'good' when it comes to bullying its own people; particularly in Kelantan and Terengganu. Here of course everything looks fine as the state institutions have been put under influence and control of the government.<br><br>Mahathir also accused Singapore of having a kiasu mentality. Well that may be true. But apparently Mahathir and Umno are also suffering from the same kind of problem. Just look at the way Mahathir reacted to the electoral defeats Ã­n Kelantan, Terengganu as well as in the Lunas and Anak Bukit by-elections.<br><br>And do not forget the comments made by him following the acquittal of MP Mohamed Sabu years ago and Abe Jak recently. Mahathir is indeed a good example of a bad sports man who is simply unable to accept defeat gracefully.<br><br>A government should be serious and well-prepared in solving problems. All of us know that the problems with Singapore are not new; they have been around for many, many years. But the government chose to sleep on them.<br><br>And when they got into trouble with SARs (which was a problem created by them any way) they thought the Singapore problem was a good way to get away from the SAR problem. And now when they suddenly realised that the Singapore issue is another disaster they start to sensationalize Abdul Hadi's trip to Indonesia.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Interesting article, btw, I subscribe to the MITA Newsgroups, dtas how i saw the article. . .comments?<br><br>I think it clearly puts into perspective Malaysia's sudden revival of disputes with Singapore. . .<br></div>

Settling any issues with malaysia apparently means bending over backwards to accomidate their feelings and settle the deal... then I hope you are ready for your water fees to skyrocket. I feel that our govt. has been fair enough and greatly competent in the dealing as shown by the way the conduct themselves... finger pointing and childish political manuvering is virtually entirely the work of malaysian politicans... and it's sad that we're their target, because after a while dealing with such crazy people, even some weak-minded people from our side find it hard to see the difference between two party (maybe they believe that no such govt. like malaysia can be so crazy)<br><br>Go ahead, vote these govts out, see if there's anything better... SDP? Your party? Dream on... Most probably the country will go into arnachy and they will drag your mob-mutilated body out and drag it around the streets with a car becos you were the one who started it in the first place.
