            <div class='col-md body'>I took this out from the recent Straits Times(i forget the date).<br><br>The Police(or wat...i forget) made a rule that we are not allowed to cycle to cycle on the pavement.  What about small children? Are they given an exception?<br><br>Furthermore, what about teenagers bikers like me who are not experienced enough to cycle on the roads with other cars which are travelling very fast? Accidents could easily occur.<br><br>And the article stated that cyclists are fighting for space on the pavement with other pedestrians.<br><br>Solutions i suggest(wonder whether it is feasible):<br>1) On crowded pavements, the bikers should ride on the grass patch or select other alternative routes like on the road for a short period of time<br>2) Climb down the bike and push it along SLOWLY<br>3)  Be more polite and say EXCUSE ME( i notice a lot of impolite teenagers just riding past crowds)<br>4)  In the case when there are a few persons blocking the way, just brake and move slowy or follow solution (2)<br><br>Lastly, is it possible for the Police to alert the public on the measures/solutions above? Maybe they should review the policy on disallowing the public to ride bikes on the pavement. Pardon me for any of my grammar or spelling mistakes please.</div>

Some just happily lenggang-lenggang...do they know how to read signs, or do they have a death wish?<br><br>I've always objected to the law banning cyclists from the pavement because the infirm and many cyclists who don't know the highway code (like teenagers) would be put at greater risk.
