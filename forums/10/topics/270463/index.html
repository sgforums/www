            <div class='col-md body'>Internet users learning netiquette the hard way<br>Observers say recent incidents where people got burnt when their comments were put on Net show need for discretion By Ken Kwek &amp; Aaron Low<br><br>A SEEMINGLY innocent comment posted on his schoolmate's blog left Mr Gerald Poh with fewer friends and a lesson about the Internet's real-life impact. He criticised her over a post she had put up about other people in their junior college a few years back.<br><br>'Before I knew it, people were taking sides over my comment, escalating into a war between friends. Many of our friends still don't talk to each other because of that,' said Mr Poh, 21, a biology undergraduate now.<br><br>'Many people underestimate the power of such communication, until they get burnt.'<br><br>Such incidents over the Internet have made news lately. Exchanges within limited circles can suddenly widen at the click of a button and even spark national controversies.<br><br>Take, for example, the case of Second Lieutenant Li Hongyi, 20, the son of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>STOP TO THINK<br>'To persuade others, you have to step into their shoes and be mindful of social norms. All this requires reflection, and unfortunately reflection isn't a practice that's encouraged by today's Internet tools.'<br>DR CHERIAN GEORGE, a journalism lecturer at Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>He sent a letter to senior military chiefs last month, complaining about the misconduct of a fellow officer. He made the mistake of broadcasting it to other servicemen, earning him a reprimand.<br><br>The Singapore Armed Forces, not known for publicising internal matters, was forced to engage the matter after the e-mail found its way into blogs, online forums and the local and foreign press.<br><br>Observers say it is time Internet users learnt real-world realities like the need for discretion.<br><br>Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Charles Chong said Singaporeans are using the Internet to broadcast complaints and musings well beyond the relevant recipients.<br><br>'I get lots of e-mail from youth, which are cc'ed (carbon-copied) to the President, PM and all the MPs,' he said. 'I'm not sure they are well thought through.'<br><br>In the age of always-on broadband connections, the medium is so easy to use that people are 'posting faster than they can process', said Dr Cherian George, a journalism lecturer at Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>'To persuade others when you blog, you have to step into their shoes and be mindful of social norms. All this requires reflection, and unfortunately reflection isn't a practice that's encouraged by today's Internet tools,' he said.<br><br>Another controversial case involved the daughter of Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Wee Siew Kim. Miss Wee Shu Min, 19, posted a comment on her blog last year denigrating the unemployment worries of a 35-year-old worker.<br><br>Miss Wee unwittingly became a symbol of elitism in a debate that even reached Parliament.<br><br>Mr Wee said that 'it was a hard lesson' for him and his daughter. '(I learnt) that it is so easy for people to take phrases out of context and whip up a maelstrom out of it,' he added.<br><br>Other incidents include the resignation last November of opposition politician Goh Meng Seng from the Workers' Party, after posting online comments that he admitted gave the party 'a bad image'.<br><br>He said he was then not sufficiently aware of the Internet's power as 'a double-edged sword'.<br><br>Mr Goh, who has since joined the National Solidarity Party, added that he is now more careful online.<br><br>Dr Daniel Goh, an assistant professor of sociology at the National University of Singapore, noted that the medium creates 'perfectly recorded Internet transcripts' that can be used against the writer.<br><br>A blogger himself, he said he takes pains to think about those at the receiving end. 'My wife complains that I take too long to compose my words, even for a simple e-mail.<br><br>'That is because when I write, I am also imagining those people who may be implicated, as they would be if I were actually in a face-to-face conversation.'<br><br>Dr Lim Sun Sun, who teaches media literacy at National University of Singapore, said many people still do not realise that the Internet is a place where one's hidden thoughts may be open for all to read.<br><br>'The Internet may allow a person to be more open or less inhibited, which is a good thing. But there must be a certain level of 'public self-awareness' as the Web is not a wholly private medium,' she said.<br><br>But while mishaps resulting in negative publicity may occur at times, parents should not be 'paranoid or take a censorious approach', said Dr Lim.<br><br>Housewife Ann Lee, 50, has tried to educate herself by doing what her 15-year-old son is doing online, like blogging and watching videos.<br><br>Said Mrs Lee: 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. At least, I experience what they do and can guide them on the steps to take to protect themselves.'<br><br>kenkwek@sph.com.sg<br><br>aaronl@sph.com.sg<br><br>Anybody remember little miss wee?</div>
