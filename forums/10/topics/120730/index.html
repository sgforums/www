Witnesses said many were forcibly held.<br><br>With leaders from across the country in Beijing, ordinary citizens see the meeting as a time to make their grievances heard, but are routinely prevented from doing so.<br><br>Xinhua cited People's Armed Police (PAP) Commander Wu Shuangzhan and Political Commissar Sui Taiming as ordering all PAP units "to ensure social stability of the whole country during the parliamentary season".<br><br>In Beijing, the PAP was "totally ready", they said.<br><br>Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the rubber-stamp parliament has failed to oppose any policy or initiative put forward by the communist-led government.<br><br>- AFP<br><br>----------------------------------------<br><br>Spot the puns in the article? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
