[b]"we're not that good afterall"</strong>[/b]</blockquote>I disagree to a certain extent - NUS is known for  law and medicine . Law has a reputation for mooting. Only those two , nothing else.<br><br>You cannot compare Singapore to USA - USA has a much longer history than Singapore. They are technologically advanced, because during the start of WW2 while europe was busy with hitler , USA took the chance to jump ahead. Even before the world wars, americans were curious about alot of things - they came from immigration stock - they experimented , learnt etc.<br><br>Singapore has her own achievements too - like her rapid progression to developed nation. My aussie lecturer complimented her on her "equal if not better technology" but just lament the fact that the people who have it didn't really make use of it. Our people are just not taught to think outside the box much.</div>
