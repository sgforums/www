            <div class='col-md body'>To my dear Mr Iveco and Mr Waleed<br><br>I know politics is a dirty game especially during the Cold War peroid. The US nor USSR is not the Mr Nice Guy. But in view of Iran- Iraq war, did the Iranian showed hostilities after the downfall of the Shah when Iranian students seized US embassy personnel on November 4, 1979, labeling the embassy a "Den of Spies. This captivity lasted 444 days.<br><br>Saddam was the opportunist  then. He took advantage of what he perceived to be disorder in the wake of the Iranian Revolution and its unpopularity with Western governments. He launched a full-scale invasion of Iran on 22 September 1980. That cost thousands of life.<br><br>Ironically then, the Soviet Union  invaded 25 December 1979 under the pretext of The Soviet-Afghan Friendship Treaty signed in December 1978. The foreign ministers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference deplored the invasion and demanded Soviet withdrawal at a meeting in Islamabad in January 1980. The United Nations General Assembly voted by 104 to 18 with 18 abstentions for a resolution which "strongly deplored" the "recent armed intervention" in Afghanistan and called for the "total withdrawal of foreign troops" from the country.<br><br>The Afghan resistance movement then recieved aids from the U S, U K, China, Saudi Arabia,Pakistan, and others. The Afghan guerillas were armed, funded, and trained mostly by the US and Pakistan. It is believed that CIA and the Pakistani intelligence also fight along side with the mujahideens and the foreign fighters recruited from the Muslim world. Osama bin Laden was one of them.<br><br>The mujahideen won when the Soviet Union pulled troops out of Afghanistan in 1989,followed by the fall of the Mohammad Najibullah regime in 1992. Instead of uniting the country,they started fighting among themselves which of course the Tailiban emerged the winner in 1996.<br><br>Mr Waleed, you said US is your enemy but if not for US aids in the 80s are  you,guys might be still fighting the Soviets and the communists ? If the US was so evil,why are you,guys still allied to them then ?<br><br>Please forgive me for my ignorance,I am just curious and wish to understand more. And of course, I am neither an anti muslim nor US supporter. Cheers</div>
