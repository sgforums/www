ALso he happens to be a good friend of the Lee clan and spent a considerable amount of time with GLCs before becoming CJ.<br><br>The way he handled the commandoes' dunking case is the only thing that I agree with. At other times, people who shouldn't even have been convicted got stiffer sentences. Take V S Aiyar, for example. That guy's case wouldn't even go to court if he did what he allegedly did in UK. There had been worse cases involving EPL stars, but they all walked free because the prosecutors had no solid case against them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some have argued, and IMHO rightfully so, that the courts' rulings in Singapore show that they are not sufficiently independent from the government.  Is it CJ Yong's fault?  Maybe, maybe not.  He can simply say he was doing his job.  Then again, that was a line often used at Nuremberg.<br><br>It's things like his comments on the drowning case that open the question on his fitness to judge.  He said that Pandiaraj and Bala "enjoyed" the dunking session.  Is he a judge, a psychologist or a clairvoyant?  One would imagine a CJ would be circumspect in making his comments - he's sitting behind a bench, not standing behind a pulpit.<br><br>I can't say I disagree with all of CJ Yong's rulings - I personally feel that the tough stance he took on road rage was what was needed, for instance.  However, overall, I can't say that his judgements are such that I would take them to be correct as a default position either.  It may not be a realistic expectation, but I'd personally like a CJ who inspires my confidence by making more judgements that make me go, "All right!" than those that make me say, "WTF?!".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is essentially an issue of the separation of powers. For the esablishment and maintenance of political liberty the government be divided into three branches, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. Each branch of the government must be confined to the exercise of its own function and not allowed to enroach upon the functions of other branches. i.e. the judiciary must function independent of the executive.<br>Furthermore, the persons who compose these three agencies of government must be kept separate and distinct, no individual being allowed to be at the same time a member of more than one branch. In this way each of the branches will be a check to the others and no single group of people will be able to contol the machinery of the state.<br>The separation of powers is clearly committed to a view of political liberty, an essential part of which is the restraint of governmental power.</div>

We are becoming narrower and narrower in building our nation, Today we are beginning to see inquity and inequality with many social and cultural aspects of nation building overlooked due to lack of checks and balcances which could have been exercised by more effective judiciary or legislative.<br><br>The points of views or visions in any policies of government tend to be narrowly conceived to suit the executive' immediate preceived needs and agendas.<br><br>We are becoming narrow and divided as a nation with only the elites and rich holding sway while the majority of citizens struggling for three meals despite their contributions over the last 40 years.<br><br>This state of our nation building is caused by a strongly empowered executive concentrating all the powers giving little share for proper balancing with legislative or judiciary. The executive practically pushes all decisions into at the legislative chamber and judiciary.<br><br>We are accepting such rule because we have not learned from the longer term and enduring values through sharing of hardship and wellbeings equity and justice which can only be effectively ensured by all the branches in our nation building.<br><br>Looking at the longer term we should build social cohesions and cultural values in the people through a broader nation building philosophy like what the more matured countries have been doing like USA, UK, Switzerland, Finland, their people value freedoms, rights, equity, fairness, workers' rights, justices and innocent-till-proven guilty principles, observance of the same corporate governance and rule of law by government through checks and balances.<br><br>We might not see the woods for the trees as there is very little left of our politicians to lead the thinking or provide the alternative views other than what we have been told by the first-generation autocratic leaders.<br><br>History will show no doubt that self-proclaimed leadership abilities being promoted by the executive-dominated system will not build the broad foundation of a country. Executive-oriented system is very vulnerable and shallow a system and it will lead finally to abuses and transgressions of rights, equity and justices in a society.<br><br>Without building on a broad-based approach giving due consideration to values, aspirations and accountability there will be contentiousness. We are now going through that phase as citizens are not happy with the lack of proper accountability.<br><br>Accountable governance should not be compromised by any expedient policies to suit the rules and beliefs of the governing party. There should be broad-based and mature policies for the good of all from the overall national perspective. Only by involving the broad participation of all will we build a more competitive and enduring society where everyone works. For now a lot need to be done to unravel the past self-serving executive which is making all the decisions and implementations without balancing the needs and aspirations of people as a whole.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We need a gradual shift of power back to the legislative and the judiciary.But as is often mentioned, which is the pressing need of our leaders today?The long term future of Singapore?Or the survival of the ruling party.<br><br>Singapore is only 40 years old.Her instituitions must be given a chance to grow and flourish.We cannot take the chance of having an executive running roughshod over the legislative and judiciary.Our youth cannot withstand such a run-down as we do not have the luxury of existing instituitions to back us up.<br><br>Whoever is in power now has the onus to develop the nation's pillars of democracy and accountablility.We cannot play politics with this issue related to national survival.The path is clear.And no one will want Singapore to go down the path of no return, but it is clear that if nothing improves, that will be our destiny.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some systems of government exhibit a great deal more in the way of separation of powers than our own. In the United States the president as chief executive, the congress as legislator and the supreme court as the most important repository of the judicial power. All perform very different functions and each acts as a check upon the excesses of the others.<br>Able and ambitious people will be attracted to positions in the various branches of Government. They will all want to do their jobs well, to the limits of the power which resides in the office. Tensions will arise. Those tensions will be healthy because they cause the behaviour of one branch of Government to be modified by the attitudes of others. Power will be spread around and shared. The chance to be free from concentrations of arbitrarily exercised power is increased.<br>Complete fusion of power tend to make control of the Government by the people impossible and would tend to produce tyrannical government. Governmental power can be made less oppressive by dividing it up between various branches.</div>
