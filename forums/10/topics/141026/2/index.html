            <div class='col-md body'>How are judges appointed? In the United States, confirmation of the President's nominees to the federal judiciary by the United States Senate is required. In many of the states, judges must be directly elected or at least periodically be subjected to elections where there is no opponents. But if voters express their disapproval, the judge cannot continue in office.<br>The judges for the High Court and Court of Appeal in New Zealand are appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of the Attorney-General. The custom is that the Attorney-General mentions these appointments after he or she has determined them at Cabinet. The Attorney-General usually consults with the President of the law society, the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the Solicitor-General.<br>Should there be a formal screening mechanism when appointing Chief Justices' in Singapore? Should the public have a say in their retention? What qualities do you look for in a perspective judge? Would it make any difference if he or she had been convicted of an offence such as a driving offence? These issues go to the heart of the integrity of the justice system and the test of public confidence in the administration of justice.</div>

"<br><br>Without any institutions that can be "Politically Blind" and which can act independently for the supreme interest of Singapore, can Singapore ever have the X-Factor in anything or everything that is being done ?<br><br>Who should we blame for the absence of the X-Factor, when all planning is always being overseen and guided by the unseen hands and mind of ONE, who claim "supreme omnipotence" in the ownership of Singapore and her Future that "even in his grave, he will rise up to raise hell for the interest of Singapore" ?<br><br>Regretably, your question itself is begging for an answer which hardly can be satisfactorily responded under the present circumstances.<br><br></div>

In addition, this board of Supreme Court Justices will also make judgements in any ISA or defamation suits or even corruption cases involving politicians so to ensure that there's no abuse of power by members of either the exceutive side or the leglastive(sp) side.<br><br>3) Like all any other appointments of any Justices in this board, the process must be transparent and clear. It's hoped that through checks and balances that any judge which is appointed has no or very little biased feelings towards a certain political power. Even if he has some feelings, he must know that he cannot, in any way, show some 'kindness' whenever any judgement is passed to any member of the party he has supported before.<br><br></div></blockquote>You just broadly described the british system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>C J Yong owes people of Singapore a detailed objective explanation why he cannot do anything to correct the oppressive criminal procedures which currently disallow a suspect or accused right of access to counsel.<br><br>The police practically has awesome power to determine what are facts and evidences for their own purposes or agendas.<br><br>It is very clear that innocent people may be greatly prejudiced in any case of criminal investigation. It would be a blatant "gulty-till-proven-innocent" travesty of justice for the accused if he is not allowed to defend himself justly should he be innocent.</div>
