And in the long run, Singapore needs to look at policies that enable families to grow and policies which help families to better balance work with family life.<br><br>Countries like France have shown that family-friendly policies like a 40-week paid maternity leave for the third child, cheap childcare and free nurseries go a long way in reversing falling birth rates.<br><br>On top of free public transport, grants, allowances and tax breaks Â– which increase substantially after the third child Â– the French government recently raised its special allowance to pay mothers 1,000 euros a month if they give up work that year to have their third child.<br><br>French women now have an average of two children each, compared with the European average of 1.5.<br><br>Since its introduction in 2001 and enhancement in 2004, Singapore's Baby Bonus scheme has had very modest success.<br><br>"I think Singapore has reached a point where it has a lot of economic success and now it has some surplus, and it's time to start thinking about the more human element," said Dr Chan.<br><br>So will the Year of the Pig bring on fatter Baby Bonuses?<br><br>Singapore couples will not have to wait long to find out as Budget Day, February 15, approaches. - CNA/so<br><br></div>
