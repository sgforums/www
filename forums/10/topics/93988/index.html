            <div class='col-md body'>Fyi:<br><br>Forum:    the Sammyboy's Alfresco Coffee ShopÂ™ Forum<br>Subject:  Newspaper apology.  Why some don't..<br>From:      (HENDRIXTAS)<br>To:       (ALL)<br>DateTime: 12/09/2004 16:50:28<br><br>Recently the Economist apologized to MM Lee and PM Lee for its<br>article on Temasek. It had to pay damages to these two honourable<br>gentlemen.<br><br>The Straits Times and the local TV media went to town with this news.<br>It had capital value. The fact that a reputed magazine like the<br>Economist tendering an apology and paying compensation was an<br>admission that<br>all is above board in Temasek as well as in SIng Inc.<br>It was vindication as far as international publicity is concerend<br>about<br>how squeaky clean Sing Inc is. Hence the great Singapore media hoohah.<br><br>Over the years and as recently as a few weeks ago, newspapers in<br>Australia and Canada published articles about the same subject<br>matter -<br>Temasek and nepotism - that are more critical and pointed than the<br>Economist. Besides there were articles about the succession issue and<br>dynastic<br>rule alleging nepotism of the highest order. Few months earlier, the<br>Australian published an article - ALL IN THE FAMILEE - a highly<br>critical<br>write up on the level of nepotism in SIngapore. Compared to these,<br>the<br>Economist article was nothing.<br><br>How come these newspapers 'escaped' from ever tendering an apology or<br>ever paying compensation for libel, like the Economist ?. In fact<br>these<br>newspapers were never even sued or even threatened with legal action.<br><br>The answer is simple. In the case of the Economist and IHT, they were<br>stupid enough to sign an undertaking with Sing Inc saying that any<br>legal<br>dispute regarding articles published in these will be settled in a<br>Singapore court of Law.    That's it. Singapore courts will have<br>jurisdiction. There you are. This will exlain to you why these two -<br>The<br>Economist and the IHT - always seem to end up paying damages while<br>other<br>newspapers elsewhere are not even challenged by the Sing Inc setup.<br><br>Why did the Economist and IHT sign such undertakings with Sing Inc<br>several years ago.  Stupidity. Years ago when Sing Inc was flaunting<br>itself<br>as another HUB - Publishing hub of Asia that is, these two British<br>publications rushed in to set up publishing units in Singapore. That<br>required them to sign this stupid undertaking. Thus whenever their<br>new editor<br>or reporter writes something like this, forgetting the undertaking<br>the<br>earlier management had signed, the consequences are this.  They end<br>up<br>paying damages and Dirty Harry gets the additional free publicity (<br>not<br>necessarily true ) to the effect how clean and straight his tiny red<br>dot gahmen is. Harry also gets to show how charitable he is by<br>donating<br>the damages received to charity !!.<br><br>This explains why the Aussie, Canadian and US newspapers whack the<br>shit<br>out of Harry's Sing Inc and go unchallenged by Dirty Harry and Co.<br>They<br>dare not challenge, for if they do so, the courts there will summon<br>for<br>certain official papers and documents as per the defendants request.<br>That may expose a lot of truths and wroms which Harry and Co loath to<br>divulge. For Harry, silence is golden here.<br><br>Only last year a Canadian court threw out Dirty Harry's law suit<br>againt<br>Mr Deval Nair for an article written by him and published in a local<br>newspaper. The judeg described the intent of the legal suit in very<br>derogatory terms.<br><br>Now, that you know.<br>The stupid Economist seem to be making the mistake over and over<br>again.<br>And giving Dirty Harry free good publicity too.</div>
