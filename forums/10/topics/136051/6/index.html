But it adds gays 'must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity'.<br><br>Dr John Hui, Master of the Catholic Medical Guild, told The New Paper in an e-mail reply yesterday: '...while homosexual acts are intrinsically wrong and not to be condoned, those with homosexual tendencies must be treated with respect, love, compassion and sensitivity, like any other human being.'<br><br>He added that as far as he knew no-one has been expelled from the Catholic Church for being gay.<br><br></div>

Again, on what basis did he arrive at this conclusion? No. It was just assumed, as always.<br><br>And from these 2 paragraphs, it seems to imply that the local churches accept homosexuals but condoned homosexual acts, ah.. then again, if homosexuals do not practice homosexual acts, are they called homosexuals?<br><br>Most churches here believe in "faith healing".. if u believe in god, you can be converted back to straights.. but then, there are too many failed cases.. the need to set up a gay church is a solid proof that there are many gay christians who can't change themselves..<br><br>And if homosexuals cannot change their acts, should they continue to receive discrimination? To be criminalised? Since homosexual acts are not allowed legally? How to treat homosexuals with respect if there are so much discrimination?<br><br><strong>HYPOCRITE!</strong></div>
