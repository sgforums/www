One of my current friends is a Satanist, I may not agree with his beliefs, does it mean he is no longer my friend?<br><br><blockquote><br>in case you don't know, the tradition of priests and "holy people" as well as the heirachy of the current catholic church is a continuation of roman pagan practices, as is christmas, whichw as a nordic pagan festival. they dont call it the ROMAN catholic church for nothing.  same thing the concept of worshipping mary comes from the pagan practices of worshipping mother goddesses. all these aint my personal view..it can be found in many many many books sold in all major bookstores .<br></blockquote>You are poorly informed, I have answered such  statements to many different people at many different points of time.  All Catholic Tradition is from Scripture, but you didn't borther find that out did you? And if you are using books such as the Da Vinci Code...<br><br><blockquote><br>i so happen to share that view  do you honestly dare tell me you don't worship mary?  nope im not a gay activist but i have nothing against them. anyway if your doctrine is so "orhtodox" and your leaders perfect why are so many people able to pick out loopholes and use them against you? so maybe the saying that "you leave your brains outside when you go to church" is possibly true.<br></blockquote>Yes, we don't worship Mary. That has been answered so many times, seems like you are just keen on getting shots in wherever you can get them.<br><br></div>
