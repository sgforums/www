Catholics do not adore Mary, we only venerate her. One must only adore God. It is a sin to adore Mary.<br><br>How can you possibly try to separate Jesus' divine nature from his human nature? He is both Man and God.<br><br>To separate Jesus' divine person from his human person is heresy! And this was already heard of in the 5th Century. It was Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, who denied Mary the title of Theotokos (Greek: "God-bearer" or, less literally, "Mother of God"). Nestorius claimed that she only bore ChristÂ’s human nature in her womb, and proposed the alternative title Christotokos ("Christ-bearer" or "Mother of Christ").<br><br>Catholic theologians recognized that NestoriusÂ’s theory would fracture Christ into two separate persons (one human and one divine, joined in a sort of loose unity), only one of whom was in her womb. The Church reacted in 431 with the Council of Ephesus, defining that Mary can be properly referred to as the Mother of God, not in the sense that she is older than God or the source of God, but in the sense that the person she carried in her womb was, in fact, God incarnate ("in the flesh"). </div></blockquote>by saying that are you trying to tell me that Christ is not God but also man? the human body is but a shell created out of dust by God. Jesus is God, not a human being. You are humbling the Lord by trying to claim that He was part human.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">The old testament, as part of the Bible, tells us who God is, how he created heaven and earth, his walk with his chosen people, the israelites, and more importantly tells us clearly that the coming of jesus christ to save the world was prophesized and it is God's plan! With Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection, man, no longer need to offer burnt sacrifices (example) to atone our sins to get close to God. But immorality remains immorality, God has not changed the definition. May be you think that if God change the definition of morality and sin then man will not sin anymore. NO! God is the Holy God and will never accept what is sinful. That is why he sent his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to atone the sins for all mankind so that we can be reconcilled with him.<br><br>I accept God and the Bible in faith. If you want to have better understanding of the Bible and God, as Oxford Mushroom said, go to the theological college.<br>I am not qualified to explain but I do know that many things, like the Holiness of God and God's standards of morality, are not subjects for discussion. It is either you accept it or not.</div></blockquote>i had addressed this issue in length in another post.. hence, will not repeat myself here.. and thanks for bringing out the point about "faith".. should the christians then targets their preaching within the confinement of the church then? since not everyone shares the same "faith" as the christians.. just like you never get to see dalai lama condemning those people who butcher animals for a living.. when a religious person start to "push" their faith into other people's boundary (i.e., the non-believer), that's an immediate infringement of rights.. and a demonstration of religious intolerance..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Not sure what you are trying to say with these few verses. To me, these verses tell us that God's wrath is on man because man knew there is God but do not gloriy him as God. Instead, man worshipped idols made in the form of man, birds.... That is why many christian (non catholic) churches put no statues of anykind in the church, except a wooden cross as a symbol of our salvation. God is against worshipping of idols.<br><br>What have we ignored? </div></blockquote>Ah.. I guess you didn't read my post carefully enough.. the verse i quoted precede the verse you had quoted.. when read together, it simply says that:"homosexuality, according to paul, is a disease pass from god to those who do not believe in god.."<br><br>as to whether such a statement can stand the test of logic and reasoning, i've demonstrated in the earlier post too.. but just to add.. do you want to claim that ALL atheists are HOMOSEXUALS?<br><br>can you see the danger of such categorical argument, which will encourage prejudice and the hatred that follows..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Why God made them homosexuals? sometimes I want to ask God why was I born so ugly? Do they really want to change? or do they think that as long as they are filial to their parents, love God, then God will ACCEPT their behaviors as not sinful???<br>Since they accept God and call themselves Christians, it is up to them to reconcile their behavior with God. We can only pray for them. </div></blockquote>ah.. but did god condemn ugly people? NO.. do christians condemn ugly people? NO.. it's like god created homosexuals for some religious zealots to condemn.. if he really love all his children, should he create homosexuals in the first place? if u read the articles from american psychiatric association, you will know that gays are facing lots of identity problems, especially during teenhood.. which will more likely to result in depression and suicide (compared to straights)..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Homosexual is a sin against God, nothing to do with any other's rights. Oxford Mushroom is quite clear on this and I will not add. </div></blockquote>if those 3 verses that he quoted cannot stand the test of reasoning, should it be "force" onto others? it's a question of faith, like u said.. so why shouldn't the church be focusing on christians only? further.. the only reason spelt out is by paul.. who claimed that if you do not believe in god, you will become gay.. i've shown how wrong such views might be.. will not elaborate again here..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">I hope the blacks are not insulted by your comparing their fights for civil equality to your fight for rights to homosexuality. </div></blockquote>why would i fear they would be insulted? i do not hold any prejudice against anyone in particular (except maybe religious zealots=p), why would i fear? and back in those days, it's justified for the blacks to get insulted, to be treated as lower class human beings, etc.. etc.. it took hundreds of years to bring the blacks from slavery to the current status they have now.. as the society progress, we can only hope that human beings will become more and more tolerant with diversity..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">I only have two friends who appear to be gays. I never ask them if they have sex with man, women, children or what. We shared happy moment, together as a group on many things.

We respect their need for privacy and they respect our stand on moral standard. </div></blockquote>yup, precisely.. gays are like anyone else.. the only difference is that gays are attracted to the sex gender.. that's it.. gays are no less human than the others.. and hence, why the discrimination (from sexual acts to marriage laws to hdb rules)?<br><br>and i do encourage you to probe them.. not in a group though.. maybe over the phone, or when u are with them face to face.. they will most likely be willing to share their life story which can be very interesting.. they will be your loyal friend if you show respect to their homosexuality..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i will quote the matthew shepard story again. for fear that oxford mushroom might not have read.. pay attention specifically to the leviticus quotes.. even such a religious fanatic did not quote those words you have used..<br><br>and for those who still think that such condemnation is justified.. think again.. matthew shepard's case is not an isolated case.. if u type gay bashing on google.. you will return with many many urls..<br><br>for those who argued that police will help catch the murder..<br>just ask yourself.. whether is it better to help stop spreading the hatred against the gays.. or is it better to wait till the police catches the murderers? the answer is clear to me.. i'm not sure about you..<br><br><blockquote>Matthew Shepard (December 1, 1976 Â– October 12, 1999) was a college student who was brutally tortured and murdered in a hate crime. Shepard, a student at the University of Wyoming, was robbed and attacked by two men near Laramie, Wyoming on the night of October 6Â–October 7 because of his homosexuality. Shepard died from his wounds several days later. His killers are currently in prison.<br><br>The attack<br>Shepard, a 21-year-old, met Aaron James McKinney and Russell Arthur Henderson in a bar. After he confided to them that he was gay, they deceived him into leaving with them in their car. He was robbed, severely beaten, tied to a fence and left to die. McKinney and Henderson also found out his address, intending to burgle his home. Shepard was discovered 18 hours later, alive and unconscious.<br><br>Shepard's suffered from a fracture from the back of his head to the front of his right ear. He also had catastrophic brain stem damage, which affected his body's ability to regulate heartbeat, body temperature, and other vital signs. There were also about a dozen small lacerations around his head, face and neck. His injuries were deemed too severe for doctors to operate. Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full life support. He died at 12:53 a.m. on October 12 at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado.<br><br>The blood on Shepard's face had been partly washed away by tears, indicating that he had been conscious for some time after the beating. He had been pistol-whipped 18 times with a .357-caliber revolver.<br><br>Police arrested McKinney and Henderson shortly thereafter, finding the bloody gun as well as the victim's shoes and credit card in their truck. The two murderers had attempted to get alibis from their girlfriends.<br><br>The trial<br>It is believed that McKinney and Henderson had posed as homosexuals in order to trick Shepard into trusting them. During court cases both of the defendants used varying stories to defend their actions. Most notably they used the "gay panic defense", arguing that they were driven to temporary insanity by Shepard's alleged homosexual advances towards them. At another point they stated that they had only wanted to rob Shepard, and never intended to kill him.<br><br>Henderson pleaded guilty on April 5, 1999 and agreed to testify against McKinney to avoid the death penalty; he received two consecutive life sentences, without the possibility of parole. The jury in McKinney's trial found him guilty of first degree murder. As it began to deliberate on the death penalty, Shepard's parents brokered a deal, resulting in McKinney also receiving two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. Shepard's parents stated, "We are giving him life in the memory of one who no longer lives" (local Roman Catholic clerics garnered considerable publicity when they stridently opposed the death penalty in the case). Since being imprisoned, McKinney and Henderson have both attempted to justify their actions by claiming that they were dictated by the Bible.<br><br>The aftershock<br>The heavy media coverage of Shepard's death brought issues of homophobia and gay-bashing to the forefront of public debate.<br><br>People in the entertainment industry expressed their own outrage and responded in various ways to the hate represented by the attacks. Actress Ellen DeGeneres hosted Shepard's memorial services in Washington, D.C. where she said that her coming out of the closet shortly before the attacks was "to keep this type of thing from happening". Lesbian singer Melissa Etheridge wrote the song "Scarecrow" in a tribute to Shepard, referring to his initially being mistaken for a scarecrow when he was found. Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote the song "American Triangle" a tribute to Shepard. It was featured on John's 2001 album, Songs from the West Coast. The fence upon which Shepard was tied and left to die has been declared a nationally protected monument. The rock band Thursday, also played a song named "M. Shepard" about the incident and the reason society let it happen. Two films were made about the story of Shepard: The Laramie Project (based on the play of the same name) and The Matthew Shepard Story. Both won numerous awards. Matthew Shepard can also be seen in the documentary Dear Jesse, in a brief interview.<br><br>The anti-gay Rev. Fred Phelps and his supporters picketed Shepard's funeral, as well as the trial of his assailants. They displayed signs typical of their protests, with slogans such as "Matt Shepard rots in Hell", "AIDS Kills Fags Dead", and "God Hates Fags". Phelps has since made attempts to gain a city permit to build a monument "of marble or granite 5 or 6 feet in height" on which will be a bronze plaque bearing Shepard's picture and the words: "MATTHEW SHEPARD, Entered Hell October 12, 1998, in Defiance of God's Warning: <strong>'Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination.' Leviticus 18:22."</strong><br><br>As a counterprotest during Henderson's trial, Romaine Patterson, a friend of Shepard's, organised a group of individuals who assembled in a circle around the Phelps group wearing white robes and gigantic wings that literally blocked the protesters (who were confined to a small protest square by police) from the view of passers-by. While the organisation had no name in the initial demonstration, it has since been ascribed various titles, including 'Angels of Peace' and 'Angel Action'.<br><br>A similar angel tactic has been reused a number of times at other protests by Phelps, but less effectively as the "Angels" are now required to stay in their own separate protest square.<br><br>Matthew's parents Judy and Dennis are now active supporters of gay rights and tolerance educators.<br><br>The Shepard case prompted President Bill Clinton to renew attempts to extend federal hate crime legislation to include gays, women and the disabled. These efforts were rejected by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in 1999. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">i had addressed this issue in length in another post.. hence, will not repeat myself here.. and thanks for bringing out the point about "faith".. should the christians then targets their preaching within the confinement of the church then? since not everyone shares the same "faith" as the christians.. just like you never get to see dalai lama condemning those people who butcher animals for a living.. when a religious person start to "push" their faith into other people's boundary (i.e., the non-believer), that's an immediate infringement of rights.. and a demonstration of religious intolerance..  </div></blockquote>Are Christians pushing our faith into other peopleÂ’s boundary? Or are gays here asking Christians to be accept the act of homosexual in the name of religious tolerance? I said it before, gays are free to practice what they want, but be sensitive to the feeling of others who do not share your liking, they have their rights too.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">Ah.. I guess you didn't read my post carefully enough.. the verse i quoted precede the verse you had quoted.. when read together, it simply says that:"homosexuality, according to paul, is a disease pass from god to those who do not believe in god.."<br><br>as to whether such a statement can stand the test of logic and reasoning, i've demonstrated in the earlier post too.. but just to add.. do you want to claim that ALL atheists are HOMOSEXUALS?<br><br>can you see the danger of such categorical argument, which will encourage prejudice and the hatred that follows..  </div></blockquote>The verses on this issue say that because of what man have done, Â“therefore God gave them over to the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurityÂ…Â”verse 24. Â“ Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lustsÂ…Â”verse 26. It simply means that because of what man do, God leave them to their sinful desires and shameful lusts. God says,Â” I donÂ’t care anymore.Â” How do you interpret this that Â“homosexuality, according to paul, is a disease pass from god to those who do not believe in god.Â”???<br>And in verse 27, God says that Â“Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.Â” In other words, God is saying, Â“do what you like according to your desires and lusts, but you will receive the due penalty.Â” Paul make it clear that this is a sinful, shameful and is a perversion, and Christian must learn to hate things that are sinful, and shameful. Why force us to like it and accept it?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">ah.. but did god condemn ugly people? NO.. do christians condemn ugly people? NO.. it's like god created homosexuals for some religious zealots to condemn.. if he really love all his children, should he create homosexuals in the first place? if u read the articles from american psychiatric association, you will know that gays are facing lots of identity problems, especially during teenhood.. which will more likely to result in depression and suicide (compared to straights)..  </div></blockquote>It is the same question as why do God create sinners. Sinful acts are condemned by God, not by the believers, and the punishment will come from God, not from the believers. Believers accept God's standard and we do not want to condone such act and certainly want no share of the punishment.<br>Homosexual acts, like any sexual acts, are to be done in private. I sympathize with them for their problem and I certainly hope that they can deal with it appropriately, but I cannot condone homosexual.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">if those 3 verses that he quoted cannot stand the test of reasoning, should it be "force" onto others? it's a question of faith, like u said.. so why shouldn't the church be focusing on christians only? further.. the only reason spelt out is by paul.. who claimed that if you do not believe in god, you will become gay.. i've shown how wrong such views might be.. will not elaborate again here.. </div></blockquote>You are gay because you like to have sex with your same sex, not because you do not believe in God. DonÂ’t twist the scripture for convenience, pls.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">why would i fear they would be insulted? i do not hold any prejudice against anyone in particular (except maybe religious zealots=p), why would i fear? and back in those days, it's justified for the blacks to get insulted, to be treated as lower class human beings, etc.. etc.. it took hundreds of years to bring the blacks from slavery to the current status they have now.. as the society progress, we can only hope that human beings will become more and more tolerant with diversity..  </div></blockquote>Equality for a fellow human beings is totally different from equality between what is moral and what is immoral. Greater tolerance for immorality will only result in decadency of civilization.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">yup, precisely.. gays are like anyone else.. the only difference is that gays are attracted to the sex gender.. that's it.. gays are no less human than the others.. and hence, why the discrimination (from sexual acts to marriage laws to hdb rules)?<br><br>and i do encourage you to probe them.. not in a group though.. maybe over the phone, or when u are with them face to face.. they will most likely be willing to share their life story which can be very interesting.. they will be your loyal friend if you show respect to their homosexuality..</div></blockquote>Sexual matters are private matters and I do not probe into any couples sexual life. Among couples we share knowledge leading to a happier married life, but never to share Â”story which can be very interestingÂ”. I AM REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW MAN HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN. In fact, I find it totally disgusting!!! You really need to learn how to respect others. You don't ever ask a muslim to tast a bit of pork for they may find it tasty.<br><br>If gays cannot be loyal friends to those who do not share the same liking, then count me out. thank you.<br></div>

Even if everybody agree to change the society, it will take time. Comparing the gay bashing in america and the great gay party held in singapore, our society is not bad in handling the issue.<br><br>If we deal with one another with what is good and noble, it will be easy for others to accept us. If we avoid flashing our different 'value', especially those "values" that are likely to offend others, we will avoid unnecessary conflict.<br>We don't have to show our ugly side all the time to show that we are not hypocrite.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">singapore came a long way for 4 different races and religions to live in harmony. The basis of the harmony is not the merging of all races and religions but the respect for others. Often it is not them that are showing the difference, it is "I" with my rights, my freedom that is causing the division. why are gay bashing found in the US, the country with the greatest freedom and highest respect for human rights?<br>Before we take every opportunity to should about "My rights", lets examine how others might be affected. Social harmony and country before self??? anyone??</div></blockquote>Haha, gay bashing is present in France and Spain too, you know!<br><br>Anyway, "Social harmony" is extremely different from "country before self" since "country" refers to "interests of the Ruling Party in matters pertaining to preservation of their own power" in the current political context whilst "social" means "communitarian" (as opposed to "communal").<br><br>A society is a community, and a community is a collection of individuals. Therefore, if an individual's basic rights eg. right to life are violated, if the "my rights" are violated, then essentially social rights are being violated too. In pragmatic (read:economic) terms, Private Costs are a subset of Social Costs.<br><br>I'm all for social harmony, but before we can have social harmony, we need to have harmony with ourselves. Conflict often stems from an inferiority complex on the part of those who feel victimised.<br><br>And I would rather have nation before self than country before self.<br><br>Of course, that doesn't mean I support gay sex.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And FYI, USA isn't the country with the highest respect for human rights.<br><br>Regards,<br>the pikamaster</div>
