            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Agree with u that religion is a sensitive topic and pple treat it seriously. However, I believe when I read the book of Genesis (how the world was created) again, I find that it does not contradict science. Anyway, is evolution a confirmed fact (as in 100% true, no arguments about it?) or a theory? </blockquote>Evolution is a proven scientific principle.

In the field of science it is treated as a <span style="font-style: italic;">fact</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world; an organized system of accepted knowledge that applies in a variety of circumstances to explain a specific set of phenomena; "theories can incorporate facts and laws and tested hypotheses"; </span><br><br><blockquote>What is physical verifiable evidence to u? Do u believe in records e.g. the bible? Do u believe in testimonies e.g. pple whom god have touched in their lives? </blockquote>The bible claims certain events. It need to be verified by other records such as historical books etc by real historian. Tis is particularly true since it claims a lot of thigns tat is unimaginable in our physical world. Testimonies is not a concrete evidence because from all religion u can find people with different testimonies of their god. They can't be all right isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Have u made studies into the claims? What are ur findings? Have u intentionally ignored the findings that are favourable that the bible is true? </blockquote>Yes I have made studies into the claim and my findings is from an unbiased viewpoint it is more false than real. Have u yourself intentionally ignore the findings from the other side of the fence ? DO u only read from christian website on certains issues or events ?<br><br><blockquote>Yes, nobody denies that pple use the bible for their own ends. In fact, even Satan know the scriptures well, as seen in how he tempted Christ. U agree that it is the Americans who r wrong, so do u judge democracy by judging Americans? Similiarly, do u judge Christ by judging Christians?</blockquote>I have judge christ by focus primary on the bible. The bible is god inspired isn't it ? It has nothing to do with christians. Have u critically judge the bible yourself or have u just conveniently ignore certain chapters totally because u do not want to believe in them ? If u fear satan know the scripture well, how do u know the bible is not written by satan himself ?<br><br><blockquote>If god does not have grace for us, he would have exterminated any one of us sinners without giving us chance to believe in him and repent. </blockquote>He do exterminate almost every people in noah ark isn't it ? SO by saying the above u agree tat god have no grace and do exterminate people just because of his personal issue ?<br><br><blockquote>U are right that Christ cannot stand sin also, but he love the sinners. I do not think anyone will be free of guilt after they murder someone. It is just not possible. BTW, God will judge them, not us</blockquote>So in the end he hates sin more or love sinner more ? If he hate sin, being omnipotent he can just eradicate sin completely, but he chose not to and leave it with us so he can punish us for it. It has nothing to do with free will as said by jesus himself, if the right hand cause him to sin, gorge it out and throw it away rather than suffering hell forever. Similarly he could simply just give us restricted free will is better than be in hell for eternal after.

U are referring to the Old Testament and u can see how god punishes men for their sins. What will happen if Christ had not come to us? God gives us his grace thru Christ, so that there is no more punishment but forgiveness of sins, if one truly believe/repent. </blockquote>If god had not come then there will be no OT and therefore life becomes better. God is the one tat cause the problems first and u seems to conveneintly forget about tat. It is as though a person kill away a child parents but then give the child a few thousands and this child becomes grateful to this murderer instead. He had promised to punish men and he say the laws r for eternal. No one divine (god or jesus) ever say tat the OT do not have to be followed or grace can cover everything.<br><br><blockquote>So what is your point? Similiar to what we discussed above, do we judge Islam by judging muslim extremists? And where u get that 50% statistics? </blockquote>My point is the world is a better place without religion. Without religion ther will not have any muslim extremists of any other religious fanatic and conflicts will be reduced. Where do I get 50% u see the world around us, Tamil tigers, isreal, north ireland, osama bin laden, crusaders, inquisition gassing in tokyo subway by cults etc. Surely u got to agree tat in the world religion is one of the leading causes for conflicts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Evolution is a proven scientific principle. The definiton of theory is different from layman term of theory. In the field of science it is treated as a fact.<br><br>A: You once told me u will not believe in god unless he appear infront of ur eyes. U refuse to believe unless u see him. Similiarly, u did not see when creatures first start evolving. Why do u believe then? And just to add, god will never appear to u just becoz u challenge him to.<br><br>2. The bible claims certain events. It need to be verified by other records such as historical books etc by real historian. Tis is particularly true since it claims a lot of thigns tat is unimaginable in our physical world. Testimonies is not a concrete evidence because from all religion u can find people with different testimonies of their god. They can't be all right isn't it ?<br><br>A: When u want to read about science, u read journals/encyclopedias etc. Similiarly, when u want to know abt god, u read the bible (or according to the book/scriptures of ur faith), not from a history textbook which definitely do not talk abt god. For ur info, the bible has been adopted by historians to learn about how pple live in their time. It has long been accepted as a historical document.<br><br>3. Yes I have made studies into the claim and my findings is from an unbiased viewpoint it is more false than real. Have u yourself intentionally ignore the findings from the other side of the fence ? DO u only read from christian website on certains issues or events ?<br><br>A: Unbiased? Obviously u need to find out more. The fact that u refuse to believe becoz u never experience is very biased. U also discounted the testimonies of others just becoz u do not which one is true/false. To tell the truth, like u, I used to draw my ammunition from a lot of atheist sources to attack Christians.<br><br>4. I have judge christ by focus primary on the bible. The bible is god inspired isn't it ? It has nothing to do with christians. Have u critically judge the bible yourself or have u just conveniently ignore certain chapters totally because u do not want to believe in them ? If u fear satan know the scripture well, how do u know the bible is not written by satan himself ?<br><br>A: Then u are wrong. The bible also told us a lot of information about early Christians, especially in the book of acts and the epistles. This shows that u have not read the bible enough (I am guilty of that too).<br><br>Below is my answer to u taken from Mark 3 which is self-explanatory<br>Jesus and Beelzebub (Mark 3)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> 20Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. 21When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."<br>22And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub[c]! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."<br><strong>23So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan? 24If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 25If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 26And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. </strong></span><br><br>5. He do exterminate almost every people in noah ark isn't it ? SO by saying the above u agree tat god have no grace and do exterminate people just because of his personal issue ?<br><br>A: Think u should read carefully what I write before u say I agree with u. As for NoahÂ’s ark, do u know whatÂ’s god agreement for his pple after the destruction? Taken from Genesis 9:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 9 "I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you 10 and with every living creature that was with youÂ—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with youÂ—every living creature on earth. 11 I establish my covenant with you: <strong>Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth." </strong><br><br>12 And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: 13 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 15 I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. 16 Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."<br>17 So God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth." </span><br><br>6. So in the end he hates sin more or love sinner more ? If he hate sin, being omnipotent he can just eradicate sin completely, but he chose not to and leave it with us so he can punish us for it. It has nothing to do with free will as said by jesus himself, if the right hand cause him to sin, gorge it out and throw it away rather than suffering hell forever. Similarly he could simply just give us restricted free will is better than be in hell for eternal after. If someone murder another, from your interpretation it is pardonable since god has "grace"<br><br>A: I believe he loves the sinners more. Like what u said, if he hate sin, being omnipotent he can just eradicate sin completely by eliminating us, but he chose not to so that we can have his grace to believe in him and repent. Would u prefer that he give u restricted free will e.g. die die must believe in him? Do u think u will be happier? Are u able to survive that? Yes. I believe if someone murder, but later truly repent, god will still accept him, even at the very last min.<br><br>7. If god had not come then there will be no OT and therefore life becomes better. God is the one tat cause the problems first and u seems to conveneintly forget about tat. It is as though a person kill away a child parents but then give the child a few thousands and this child becomes grateful to this murderer instead. He had promised to punish men and he say the laws r for eternal. No one divine (god or jesus) ever say tat the OT do not have to be followed or grace can cover everything.<br><br>A: Why not u say if he never create men life will therefore become better? If u read the bible closely, men are always the one who cause the problems, not god. And no doubt, like u, they blamed god for all their suffering. No doubt, he had promised to punish men. No doubt, he said the laws r for eternal. But the difference is: He had come to FULFILL for us, becoz no one else can. Grace basically takes over from law after he died for us on the cross.<br><br>8. My point is the world is a better place without religion. Without religion ther will not have any muslim extremists of any other religious fanatic and conflicts will be reduced. Where do I get 50% u see the world around us, Tamil tigers, isreal, north ireland, osama bin laden, crusaders, inquisition gassing in tokyo subway by cults etc. Surely u got to agree tat in the world religion is one of the leading causes for conflicts.<br><br>A: That 50% is a sweeping statement. How u sure that is 50%? Have u took into consideration how all the other wars start becoz of human greed, pride etc. Religion is one of the leading excuses for conflicts, not the actual cause. The cause is: men. We are all sinners and live in a fallen world.<br><br>Also, have u discounted the good things what religion had done for men? Without missions, many orphans would have died. Many would still be out on the streets and dwell in sin. Many would not have their lives changed or become pastors.<br></div>

Americans tried to impose democracy on others and cause a lot of sufferings/destruction, does it means democracy is wrong? If your point is correct, then there is no truth in this world anymore becoz everything brings sufferings and is not working according to ur expectations.<br><br>2) Pple have high ideas, that's what we live for. We have to accept that coupled with the human factor, not all ideas are perfect and can be applied without any problems in this world. That's why Christians have grace. If u understand the concept of grace, u will not see any conflict/error in the bible anymore.<br><br>3) With regards to the sin of homosexuality, I have already illustrated that it is a sin just like any other sin, which god will not punish anymore (if u truely believe and repented). In god's eyes, 'big' sins or 'small' sins alike, we are all sinners. God is a holy god who cannot stand the sight of sin. That's why men need Christ, so that when god sees us he sees Christ's righteousness in us.<br><br>He doesn't see homosexuals different from heterosexuals. To him, we are all oddballs as "all men have fell short of glory".<br><br>4) Flames of conflict are bound to have becoz of pple. Even Buddha says "life is about suffering" (to escape suffering has to practise the 4 noble trues/8 paths).<br><br>Which period in history have u not seen any conflict or human against human? In this case, what is truth to u then? It is easy for one to be delusional, then to come up with 'hard' facts.<br></div></blockquote>the point that the bible classifies homosexuality as a sin already makes it doubtful in my eyes. homosexuality is a sin just because the bible says so, and for no other reason. that sort of reasoning is just waiting to collaspe unto itself. murder is a sin, because it harms another, and takes another's life away from him, thus impinging on another's right. thief is a sin because it causes another's property to be lost to him, thus it also impinges on another's right. Homosexuality, please explain how it impinges on another's rights to make it a sin. and i will make it clear. if u quote me anything from the bible as supporting evidence, then i will say that u have no case at all and that the bible has shown itself to be less than accurate thru this point alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree. Sometimes its just hard to reason with Christians on certian issues becuase they would put forward an argument on the sole ground that "because the Bible says so". This is circular logic becuase they treat the bible as axiomatic without proving thus in advance. Using religious convictions to cement one's argument simply does not tally. If it does, people would quote the bible in examination essays. They dont do that, do they?  I do respect whatever religion people choose to believe in but it is dangerous to impose their own religious thinking on others.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">the point that the bible classifies homosexuality as a sin already makes it doubtful in my eyes. homosexuality is a sin just because the bible says so, and for no other reason. that sort of reasoning is just waiting to collaspe unto itself. murder is a sin, because it harms another, and takes another's life away from him, thus impinging on another's right. thief is a sin because it causes another's property to be lost to him, thus it also impinges on another's right.

Grace basically takes over from law after he died for us on the cross. </blockquote>If he didn't nit pit and just live his own life, then there wouldn't be such violence or terror about him throwing fire from the sky. If he didn;t create human , then he has no gardener and had to work himself which he probably hate. (adam is a gardener) About the OT, he saidit was forever. He never say it is abolish. HE say it is fulfil, but wat do u interprete a fulfil ? Isn't it to stress on how important it is ?<br><br><blockquote>That 50% is a sweeping statement. How u sure that is 50%? Have u took into consideration how all the other wars start becoz of human greed, pride etc. Religion is one of the leading excuses for conflicts, not the actual cause. The cause is: men. We are all sinners and live in a fallen world. </blockquote>Lets put it tis way. Do u think it is easy to convince people to fight a war for your own greed ? These peopel have a mind of their own and u need to give them a good reason to fight. religion is one of the reasons, and it is one of the reason tat make peopel irrational and doesn't think straight. When u see a conflict started because of religion, then u should be sure it is really solely due to tis reason why men fight. It is not an excuse. If they do nto believe fanatically into religion they wouldn't care.<br><br><blockquote>Also, have u discounted the good things what religion had done for men? Without missions, many orphans would have died. Many would still be out on the streets and dwell in sin. Many would not have their lives changed or become pastors. </blockquote>Done for men ? Without religion there is still ophanage. Without religion there r many who can still live their lives as normal. Without religion their life may become better. They have more time and they don't need to donate money or waste time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. I didn't say I do nto believe in god unless he appears in front of me. I am saying I have no real reason to believe in it because it do not have verifiable evidence of its presence. Talking about evolution, there r really verifiable undisputed evidence of its accuracy. In fact certain strain of microbes is found to digest nylon, a product tat was totally man made and in existence only in recent history<br><br>A: U did in ur previous posts. As for evolution, I would rather keep my mind open, rather than believing it as an absolute truth/fact. U should know better that evolution cannot provide answers for some Â‘missing linksÂ’ in science.<br><br>2. the bible talk about past events. He claims many things such as dead walking on the streets just after jesus death. If the bible is true, then tis event surely have to happen. However nobody, historian or civilian ever see any dead walking around the streets then. If someone can verify tis claim, the the bible becomes more believable. Otherwise it can be seen tat something is wrong with its claims. Unless u r talking about the old laws or religion of the past, the bible is not considered a historical document. What paper or which historian refers to it as a study of people in the past ?<br><br>A: U sure? U live in that time? The bible is indeed a historical document. Do a search in the internet to read about its historical significance.<br><br>3. As said before, strong believer of muslim, jews, cults, idol worshipper etc all experience some form of their deity power. However by simple observation they all can't be right because the religion is all different. So if a guy tat believes in some deity claims tat he got 4D after praying to him, then it means he is true and u should forsake your christian god for his ? Com'on testimonies r meaningless<br><br>A: So u are already biased that testimonies r meaningless and u will not differentiate between real and false testimonies?<br><br>4. However the points I had raised r about god acts such as noah ark etc and god do take up a large chunk of the bible. I am still examining christ or god. Wat u have said above is really out of point. It is like I am talking about Harry Potter but then u say the book also talk about hogwarts and say I am not reading enough<br><br>A: It is definitely not out of point. U obviously have not read the bible (enough), as most of ur arguments are lopsided and concentrate in one certain aspect or a certain book in the Bible. I suggest u read it again.<br><br>5. I think u have probably got the wrong idea from tis parable. Wat has tis got to do with Satan being the one tat write the bible ? We r not seeing satan opposing himself or his own people here isn't it ?<br><br>A: I think u did not read properly. The parable answers ur question Â“If u fear satan know the scripture well, how do u know the bible is not written by satan himself ?Â”. Obviously, if the bible is written by satan, it will not have prophesized about SatanÂ’s ultimate defeat.<br><br>6. U probably didn't read properly. ALL THOSE PEOPLE DIE. Tat is the bottomline isn't it ? Aren't these people human too ? Is grace shown to them ?<br><br>A: Have u read the bible and find out why these pple have to die? What kind of pple are they? What have they done to incur GodÂ’s wrath? They were living in tremendous sin and totally unrepentent.<br><br>7. He can eradicate sin completely without eliminating us. Tat is why it is called omni potent. But he didn't do tat. And about murder, u feel tat he can forgive peopel who commit murder, but he can't forgive people who don't believe in him. IS tat rational ? U call tat hating sin ?<br><br>A: ThatÂ’s ur assumption. It is weird that u can define Â‘omnipotenceÂ’ when u dun believe in a omnipotent god. Throughout the bible, u can see that GOD gives pple chance to repent, and yet they still continue to live in sin. ThatÂ’s why they were punished by death. But when Christ came to us, there is no moe punishment, if one truely believe and repent.<br><br>8. If he didn't nit pit and just live his own life, then there wouldn't be such violence or terror about him throwing fire from the sky. If he didn;t create human , then he has no gardener and had to work himself which he probably hate. (adam is a gardener) About the OT, he saidit was forever. He never say it is abolish. HE say it is fulfil, but wat do u interprete a fulfil ? Isn't it to stress on how important it is ?<br><br>A: Weird again. If u believe in an omnipotent god, why does he need a gardener? As what I said in my earlier posts, the purpose of men is to worship and enjoy the lord forever. Christ indeed came to fulfill the law for us by taking all our sins on the cross. He paid the ultimate price (death) for fulfilling all these laws for us, and thus we have grace.<br><br>9. Lets put it tis way. Do u think it is easy to convince people to fight a war for your own greed ? These peopel have a mind of their own and u need to give them a good reason to fight. religion is one of the reasons, and it is one of the reason tat make peopel irrational and doesn't think straight. When u see a conflict started because of religion, then u should be sure it is really solely due to tis reason why men fight. It is not an excuse. If they do nto believe fanatically into religion they wouldn't care.<br><br>A: U are assuming that all wars start becoz of religious conflicts. Is it really so? (e.g. the Two World Wars).<br><br>10. Done for men ? Without religion there is still ophanage. Without religion there r many who can still live their lives as normal. Without religion their life may become better. They have more time and they don't need to donate money or waste time.<br><br>A: For certain groups of pple e.g. the Â‘untouchablesÂ’ caste in India, who has no chance of elevating their status in society, probably only the word can give them some form of comfort and hope. There is no doubt that religious organizations, especially Christian missionaries, give the most help for these pple. U do not see an Â‘AtheistÂ’ orphanage dun u?<br></div>

Sometimes its just hard to reason with Christians on certian issues becuase they would put forward an argument on the sole ground that "because the Bible says so". This is circular logic becuase they treat the bible as axiomatic without proving thus in advance. Using religious convictions to cement one's argument simply does not tally. If it does, people would quote the bible in examination essays. They dont do that, do they?  I do respect whatever religion people choose to believe in but it is dangerous to impose their own religious thinking on others.<br><br></div></blockquote>If Christians do not use the bible to reason with u, then what should they use as a basis for discussion?

Obviously, if the bible is written by satan, it will not have prophesized about SatanÂ’s ultimate defeat</blockquote>If the bible is written by satan, he is prophesized about the end for his opponent/opposition, which may very well be your "loving and just "god. There is no contradiction here. U just need to think all the while <span style="font-style: italic;">God</span> is actually the devil himelf but the <span style="font-style: italic;">satan</span> is actually the loving and just god.

But when Christ came to us, there is no moe punishment, if one truely believe and repent. </blockquote>Then wat is your definition of omnipotent ? If he can't do tis, then surely he is no omni potent and he is powerless to do a lot of things. See people giving a chance to repent ? like who ? Repent on wat ? To become wat ? Wat significance does tat do  ? When u r borned u have sinned. Doesn't tat show his idea of sin is ridiculous and faulty. Why is there a difference when crhist come ?

HE can't make up his mind ?<br><br><blockquote>Weird again. If u believe in an omnipotent god, why does he need a gardener? As what I said in my earlier posts, the purpose of men is to worship and enjoy the lord forever. Christ indeed came to fulfill the law for us by taking all our sins on the cross. He paid the ultimate price (death) for fulfilling all these laws for us, and thus we have grace. </blockquote>Then wat is the use of adam ? Why don't u specifically tell me why does he want adam to tend his garden ? Who says he is omni potent ? He say it himself, not me. About chrits coming to fulfil, don;t u read tat after he say "fulfil: he said tat ALL LAWS of OT R MEANT TO be ETERNAL ?

For those women in the past who fought for equal rights, their situation/predicament might be thousands time more in peril and jeapardy than the (singapore) gays now.

Hence this is not a good comparison.<br><br>For (singapore) gays, lives goes on even when the marriage constitution remained unchanged. They can still have lovers and live the lives they want.
