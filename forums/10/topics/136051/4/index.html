ANy kind of sin is a sin, no sin is greater or lesser than any. My church, at least, do not harp on homosexuality particularly.<br><br>I believe the church is just voicing in what they disagree on and again it is on the  issue not on the person. Just ask the pastor from Church Of Our Saviour who was a gay when he went into the church. He was of cos told that the church do not agree with homosexuality but was he chased out? Nope.<br><br>And of cos the marriage consituition is not something the church can do anything abt. The church like any individuals should be allowed to voice their beliefs. But, like the casino issue, no matter what the religious bodies say, the government has the final say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PRP:</div><div class="quote_body">God does not create gays.</div></blockquote>Damn right. It was Mother Nature who created gays. The fact remains that gays don't become gays at a flick of a switch. I've said this before. Gays or homsexuals in one way or another are born with more sensitive feelings with the same sex.<br><br>From young, they preferred to hang out with guys rather than girls. While other straight guys fancy girls- and it doesn't even mean puberty- since god knows when, somehow these homesexuals fancy guys more.<br><br>And as they get older and learn more about sex, naturally these homosexual feelings get stronger and stronger. So in the end, in whatever age, they then realise that they are gay. So being gay isn't an automatic decision nor is it a quick flick of the switch thing.<br><br>And as I said, being gay doesn't mean that homesexuals aren't human beings. Sure, most of the time, gays make people cring because they are so effiminate- but that doesn't make them any less a human being. And neither does it lessen any talent that they have. If we are to deny an inspiring gay actor just because he's gay and deny him of his civil rights, it would be a loss.<br><br>Whether is he gay or not shouldn't stop him for being an actor he wants to be or he already is. In case if you don't know any example of a famous gay actor, I would say Sir Ian Mckellen is one.<br><br>He's a gay, he's an English Knight and he's a world class actor. He acted as Gandalf in LOTR. Should he still be denied of his civil rights just because he's gay?<br><br>Or even love a God he still loves- even though he's gay?</div>

As for sex outside marriage- if u mean adultery- well, that's fine with me. Although it's much much harder to reinforce the second one due to the liberal times now.<br><br>And if u were referring to pre-marital sex, let's face it- we can't stop it. The best way is to promote condoms. The Catholic Church doesn't like condoms but again, we don't have much of a choice in this time of AIDs and unwanted pregancies.</div>
