If you think that I am homophobic, the rest of my family is much more  so than me. In fact, my parents (and my little brother) would berate me for having such a ... conversation. Remember, my entire family is Roman Catholic, and very strong ones at that. Well, at least My borther and my mother have a very strong conservative bent; my father and I are more ready to criticise, and my 'lil sis just follows the wind.<br><br>But anyway, what I was saying is this: If the government can't even legislate to allow freedom of artistic expression, (look at the restriction on "political" films) don't expect it to be able to legislate to allow for homosexuality, private or public. Don't believe what government officials say,  especially about the Pink Dollar. Just remember the key word "foreign talent" - enough said.<br><br>the cautionary pikamaster</div>
