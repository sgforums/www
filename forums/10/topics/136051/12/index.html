            <div class='col-md body'>since i'm into searching for gay positive role models, let's look at another one.. similar to robert sabuda, she's constantly contributing back to the society didnt she?<br><br><strong>Martina Navratilova (1956-)</strong> is a lesbian Czech-American tennis player. At the age of 19, frustrated by the Czechoslovakian Tennis Federation's interference with her career, she defected to the United States; she became a U.S. Citizen on July 21st, 1981. In 1978, she began a relationship with lesbian American activist and writer Rita Mae Brown (1944-); she later had an affair with Judy Nelson and gained admiration by routinely climbing into the crowd at tennis tournaments to get to Judy after winning matches. In 1980, she was inducted into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame. Her autobiography, Martina, was published in 1985. In April, 1993, she was one of the keynote speakers at the March on Washington. In September, 1994, Navratilova was the second-ranked of only four women on Sports Illustrated 's 40th Anniversary issue Top 40 Athletes list, at #14. Before her singles retirement in November, 1994, she had won a record (for both women and men) 167 singles titles, including 15 majors; before her doubles retirement in 1995, she had won 165 doubles titles, including 31 majors. During her career, she won $20,337,902 in prize money. She has a book contract to co-write three mystery novels; the first, The Total Zone, was published in 1995; the second, Breaking Point, was published in 1996. In October, 1995, she participated in the creation of The Rainbow Card, a VISA credit card program targeted to the lesbian and gay community. Especially since her retirement, Martina has spent much of her time supporting many non-profit groups and charitable causes. Navratilova, who lives in Aspen, Colorado, also worked to overturn that state's infamous Amendment 2.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, last one for the day.. He was not involved in too much charity work.. but his story is an inspirational one, regardless of whether he's gay or straight..<br><br><strong>Greg Louganis (1960-)</strong> is a gay Samoan-American diver. He is generally recognized as the greatest diver ever, and "reigned over his sport for more than a decade with grace, power and unequalled precision." He won 47 national titles, six world championships, and five Olympic medals. Louganis survived a difficult childhood that included adoption, battles with asthma, undiagnosed dyslexia, racial bigotry, abuse, and three suicide attempts. He began diving at age nine, following his interests in dance, tumbling, and acrobatics. He scored his first perfect ten in a 1971 Junior Olympics diving competition. In 1976, at the Montreal Summer Olympics, Louganis won a silver medal in platform diving...at the age of 16. In 1984, at the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, Louganis won two gold medals, in springboard and platform diving, the first man to achieve the feat in 56 years; he became the first diver to score over 700 points in platform diving competition. That year, he won the Sullivan Award, given annually to the best athlete in America. In 1988, at the Seoul Summer Olympics, Louganis again won two gold medals in diving (including a comeback in the springboard competition after hitting his head on the diving board in the preliminary round); he is the only male diver to have won both diving events at successive Olympic Games...and there's no telling what would have happened if not for the 1980 U.S. boycott of the Moscow Summer Olympics. He also received the 1988 Olympic Spirit Award. In 1990, Louganis' "companion," Jim Babbitt, died of AIDS. Although most of his teammates knew Louganis was gay during his years on the national team, Greg did not come out publicly until June, 1994, at Gay Games IV in New York City, where he also gave two virtuoso diving exhibitions. In July 1994, Louganis accepted the U.S. Olympic Committee's Robert J. Kane award, voicing his protest against Cobb County, Georgia's anti-gay laws at the ceremony; the organizing committee for the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics would ultimately move the preliminary volleyball competition out of the county. His autobiography, Breaking the Surface, with Eric Marcus, was published in 1995 and became a New York Times number one bestseller; it was dedicated to Ryan White (after Ryan's death, Louganis gave one of his Olympic medals to the boy's mother). In a television interview with Barbara Walters for 20/20 broadcast on February 24th, 1995, just before his book was published, Louganis announced that he was HIV-positive, seven years after he had tested positive. After retiring from international competition, Louganis became an actor and dancer, and began raising and showing pedigree dogs. He also does volunteer and fund-raising work for Pets Are Wonderful Support (PAWS/LA), as well as lecturing around the country. Even his speaking engagements are not without controversy; in January, 1997, when the University of South Florida asked Louganis to speak to students there, Florida State Senator John Grant, citing "moral decadence," insisted that the speech be cancelled, threatening dire consequences for USF's finances if Louganis spoke. Greg also continues his endorsement work for Speedo, who stayed with Louganis after he came out and again after he announced his HIV status (he lost all his other endorsements). In 1996, Louganis was named one of the 100 Golden Olympians. On March 19th, 1997, a TV- movie based on his autobiography was shown on the USA cable network; it starred Mario Lopez as the adult Louganis, while Louganis himself served as advisor, coach to Lopez, and narrator. Reportedly, Greg and openly gay television personality Steve Kmetko are now dating.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">are you going to say that catholic church is wrong?<br></div></blockquote> No, I did not quote anything from the catholic church and certainly did not say they are wrong, but I leave it to the catholic to make the necessary clarification.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body"> My argument is simple. Sex between 2 consent adults of the same gender should be differentiated with sex between man and another animal.. Since the will of the animal is being infringed when man chose to have sex with the animal.. it's similar to rape!!!<br><br></div></blockquote> Freedom is again being used to justify all wrong doings. Even sex between 2 consenting adults of different gender could be sinful, as in the case of adultery.  According to you argument, if the animal enjoys the sex, its will not infringed, then it is alright to have sex with animal??<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body"> Ah.. if you could not reason beyond what's stated inside the bible, you are a religious fundamentalist (whether you like to be called one or not)..<br></div></blockquote> What is a religious fundamentalist?? I reason within the Bible because gays are trying to interpret the Bible to suit their purpose. All Christians are obliged to clarify, fundamentalist or not. If you donÂ’t believe in the Bible, why do you need the Bible to approve what you are doing?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body"> And if evolution is not THE most current scientific way to teach the origins of men, why should scientists spend huge amount of efforts studying it?<br></div></blockquote> Evolution is a scientific theory, not THE current scientific way to teach the origins of men. You have to ask the scientists why did they spend such efforts. Scientists spent lots of efforts and money in researches and not all their efforts result in THE WAY. What is important is, what have they concluded? Do you agree with their conclusion? You are free to believe what you like, but I am sure neither me, nor my ancestors were evolved from monkeys.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body"> Even within the christians community, not everyone interpret evolution the same way since the darwin's landmark book.<br><br>If the christians can't even decide how to integrate new scientific discoveries into the bible teachings, shouldn't it mean that the bible is a rather subjective book with rather vague ideas?<br></div></blockquote> There are many scientists among Christians and they have different schools of thoughts with regards to scientific theories and discoveries. There is no conflict between science and Christianity.<br>Christians do not integrate new scientific discoveries into Bible teachings. All books and knowledge are subjective and vague to those who do not understand. Read the whole Bible and ask what God wants you to know, donÂ’t pick a few chapters or verses here and there and put your words into GodÂ’s mouth.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body"> I dont know why u brought back paul again. I thought you were the one who told me abt it being a paul's verse<br></div></blockquote> Paul was brought up again by iveco, not me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body"> If everyone is a sinner, why target the gay community? Is it because it's simply an easier target? Since most people are uncomfortable with homosexuality to begin with?<br></div></blockquote> Christianity is good news for all mankind, we target everybody in sharing the good news of salvation. We do not target any group for condemnation for it does not bring any goods to anybody. When it comes to interpreting the Bible, we know that The Words of God do not change with time, place, trends or fashion, and definitely do not change with popularity, so it does not matter if most people are uncomfortable or not. It is the same old Bible for the last 1000 years!!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body"> btw, buddhists do not believe in the concept of god, they believe in breaking away from the cycle of birth and death.. in taoism.. there's no one god.. it's more similar to paganism (which christians hated to the core) than christianity..<br></div></blockquote> Christians hated paganism to the core?? Whatever give you that kind of idea?? To the Taoists, everything is a deity, it is gods everywhere. Different religions different beliefs, we donÂ’t agree in many things but we respect the beliefs, and there is certainly no Â“hate them to the coreÂ”!!! The question to you is, do these religions approve of homosexual acts??<br></div>

There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of "reparative therapy" as a treatment to change ones sexual orientation. It is not described in the scientific literature, nor is it mentioned in the APA's latest comprehensive Task Force Report, Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders (1989).<br><br>There are a few reports in the literature of efforts to use psychotherapeutic and counseling techniques to treat persons troubled by their homosexuality who desire to become heterosexual; however, results have not been conclusive, nor have they been replicated. There is no evidence that any treatment can change a homosexual person's deep seated sexual feelings for others of the same sex.<br><br>Clinical experience suggests that any person who seeks conversion therapy may be doing so because of social bias that has resulted in internalized homophobia, and that gay men and lesbians who have accepted their sexual orientation positively are better adjusted than those who have not done so. </strong><br><br>okay.. keep my post short since i've mentioned this countless of times oredi..<br><br>and elsewhere in both legal and political front, these people have started to accept homosexuality as a natural condition.. especially in Europe..

There are differences even with Christianity itself. Go to EH forum to see for yourself. Such differences are mainly due to how the different denominations choose to interpret the bible.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Freedom is again being used to justify all wrong doings. Even sex between 2 consenting adults of different gender could be sinful, as in the case of adultery.

If you can communicate with an animal, and you can ascertain that the animal loves you back in a sexual way. I would still say, why not? But then, since we cannot communicate with an animal, there's no need to answer this question. The answer is a straight NO (at least in my opinion).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">What is a religious fundamentalist?? I reason within the Bible because gays are trying to interpret the Bible to suit their purpose. All Christians are obliged to clarify, fundamentalist or not. If you donÂ’t believe in the Bible, why do you need the Bible to approve what you are doing? </div></blockquote>Not just gays.. SingaporeMacross had shown you that Catholics do interpret the Bible to "promote" acceptance of gays.. And APA, which is an independent source, also said the same thing.. And political leaders in Europe and Canada had started to accept homosexuality.. The issue is not gays trying to reinterpret the bible anymore..<br><br>i do not need the church to approve my beliefs.. but then church is the single most dominant force in continuing the discrimination and hate crimes (remember the murderer of matthew shepard)..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Evolution is a scientific theory, not THE current scientific way to teach the origins of men.

You are free to believe what you like, but I am sure neither me, nor my ancestors were evolved from monkeys.<br></div></blockquote>read this thread:<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=121760<br><br>ah.. guess you have not watch "Walking with Caveman" released by BBC.. It is the current SCIENTIC way of teaching the origins of men, not the biblical one though..<br><br>i'm bringing this up because different christians "INTERPRET" the idea of evolution differently to fit with their concept of men's origins.. simple as that.. which contradicts with what u had claimed earlier.. "the bible is the only truth..

Read the whole Bible and ask what God wants you to know, donÂ’t pick a few chapters or verses here and there and put your words into GodÂ’s mouth.<br></div></blockquote>Ah.. did you realise that you were the one who pick verses or chapters to put forth your argument?<br><br>the paragraph from leviticus.. I had to quote you another paragraph from the same book..<br><br>and the paragraph from roman.. u ignored the paragraph prior to the one you highlighted completely..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Paul was brought up again by iveco, not me.<br><br></div></blockquote>let's forget about that verse then..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Christianity is good news for all mankind, we target everybody in sharing the good news of salvation.

It is the same old Bible for the last 1000 years!! </div></blockquote>I do not disagree with the first 2 sentences. Cos you need certain moral principles for the general populace.. but then, you had not proven what's so immoral about homosexuality beyond what's stated in the bible?<br><br>The same bible can also change in meaning due to translation issues.. If you watch some of those BBC documentaries I had recommended.. theology scholars are constantly finding new meanings (and translation errors) to the bible..

            <div class='col-md body'>to end of today's discussion.. let me share something interesting from the field of psychology.. Kohlberg's theory of moral reasoning..<br><br>moral reasoning, if derived purely from the strictures were classified as Level 2 (stage 3 and 4) moral reasoning.. when i said that i admire pikamaster's willingness to think about these issues with more objectivity.. i'm in fact saying that he shows signs of Level 3 (stage 5 and 6) reasoning..<br><br>it also address why I cannot want to answer rpr (or prp?) question of right and wrong..<br><br>happy reading.. good night everyone!<br><br><strong>A SUMMARY OF LAWRENCE KOHLBERG'S<br>STAGES OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT<br>Copyright 2000 by<br>Robert N. Barger, Ph.D.<br>University of Notre Dame<br>Notre Dame, IN 46556<br>Lawrence Kohlberg was, for many years, a professor at Harvard University. He became famous for his work there beginning in the early 1970s. He started as a developmental psychologist and then moved to the field of moral education. He was particularly well-known for his theory of moral development which he popularized through research studies conducted at Harvard's Center for Moral Education.<br><br>His theory of moral development was dependent on the thinking of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget and the American philosopher John Dewey. He was also inspired by James Mark Baldwin. These men had emphasized that human beings develop philosophically and psychologically in a progressive fashion.<br><br>Kohlberg believed...and was able to demonstrate through studies...that people progressed in their moral reasoning (i.e., in their bases for ethical behavior) through a series of stages. He believed that there were six identifiable stages which could be more generally classified into three levels.<br><br>Kohlberg's classification can be outlined in the following manner:<br><br>LEVEL           STAGE             SOCIAL ORIENTATION<br><br>Pre-conventional      1            Obedience and Punishment<br><br>2         Individualism, Instrumentalism,<br>and Exchange<br><br>Conventional        3                "Good boy/girl"<br><br>4                 Law and Order<br><br>Post-conventional     5                Social Contract<br><br>6              Principled Conscience<br><br>The first level of moral thinking is that generally found at the elementary school level. In the first stage of this level, people behave according to socially acceptable norms because they are told to do so by some authority figure (e.g., parent or teacher). This obedience is compelled by the threat or application of punishment. The second stage of this level is characterized by a view that right behavior means acting in one's own best interests.<br><br>The second level of moral thinking is that generally found in society, hence the name "conventional." The first stage of this level (stage 3) is characterized by an attitude which seeks to do what will gain the approval of others. The second stage is one oriented to abiding by the law and responding to the obligations of duty.<br><br>The third level of moral thinking is one that Kohlberg felt is not reached by the majority of adults. Its first stage (stage 5) is an understanding of social mutuality and a genuine interest in the welfare of others. The last stage (stage 6) is based on respect for universal principle and the demands of individual conscience. While Kohlberg always believed in the existence of Stage 6 and had some nominees for it, he could never get enough subjects to define it, much less observe their longitudinal movement to it.<br><br>Kohlberg believed that individuals could only progress through these stages one stage at a time. That is, they could not "jump" stages. They could not, for example, move from an orientation of selfishness to the law and order stage without passing through the good boy/girl stage. They could only come to a comprehension of a moral rationale one stage above their own. Thus, according to Kohlberg, it was important to present them with moral dilemmas for discussion which would help them to see the reasonableness of a "higher stage" morality and encourage their development in that direction. The last comment refers to Kohlberg's moral discussion approach. He saw this as one of the ways in which moral development can be promoted through formal education. Note that Kohlberg believed, as did Piaget, that most moral development occurs through social interaction. The discussion approach is based on the insight that individuals develop as a result of cognitive conflicts at their current stage. </strong><br><br></div>

To think that a change, or an upgrade of moral thinking could bring the homo closer to the straights would be ignoring their nature by birth.  If education can change a conservative society into accepting homosexual act as an interesting, as opposed to disgusting, act, then it is better to start educating the homo to enjoy heterosexual act.</div></blockquote>i brought up the article on moral reasoning just to share that moral reasoning is not just about BLACK or WHITE (since prp asked me the same question of right or wrong for no less than 5 times).. the theory is not proposed by gays.. and certainly not a justification of why others should accept gays or not.. i'm just quite sick of answering the same question over and over again..<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by sgdiehard:<br>[b]But going by the exchanges here, the conservative society would likely become more conservative, religious or not.<br><br>I, a non Catholic, finally have to agree with Benedict, sighÂ…]</blockquote>yes, for those who conservative will remain bigoted and narrow-minded anyway.. =p<br><br>but for those who are more open-minded.. it helps to raise their awareness of issues related to the gay community..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any gay who wish to purchase a HDB flat for himself and his "friend" can apply through the scheme for singles. Of course, some rules will be modified to suit that type of situations but I'd believe we can find a way that will ensure that gays who apply to get a flat through the singlehood scheme will not get discriminated or messed up with those who are really single.<br><br>As for bringing S'poreans foward, I always believe in talking. As long as we have a moderate stand when comes to taboo subjects like this and keep our communication lines with the moderate conservatives open- and keep on talking to them in a honest, friendly way- I'd believe they can be persuaded to change their views a little in regards to their attitude to homosexuals.</div>

It is important that we recognise them. Sometimes societies progress by discarding out-dated values and replaced with new ones; other times societies progress when its core values withstand the trials of time. Filial piety is a value that exists since time immemorial, together with other values that form the basic fabric of families and societies.
