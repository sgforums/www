Its not that there are 2 arguments. There is 1 single truth that homosexuality is a natural thing, it occurs in nature and nature is God's creation. Perhaps u've not thought about it, but what if in denying the truth about homosexuality, u're going against the God u so love and respect? Especially as day by day the case for homosexuality being unnatural grows steadily smaller? <span style="color: red;">[b]Maybe u have your staunch stand, but bear in mind that people also had a staunch stand that the earth was flat and that we were the center of the universe. The church even burnt people alive for saying otherwise. I still don't see any of you using christianity as your reasoning taking this into consideration. Are you conveniently ignoring or forgetting this point? Here I'll help u. I'll bold it and highlight it in red.</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>u r not listening also....i will just stop at what i have said...</div>

Its escapism isn't it? Christians like to act holier than thou and say "oh u're not listening anymore" to mask the fact that they have no argument against the facts and can't answer to what has been said. Very convenient.</div>

The number of gay people spreading AIDS are very small compared to the number of AIDS +ve heterosexual people, especially those heteros who engage in casual sex without adequate protection. And in the case of many heterosexual people, their attitudes towards safe sex comes more from wanting to avoid an unwanted pregnancy, something homosexuals don't have to worry about, which might be a factor in the existance of unsafe sex amongst gay people. But why is no one making noise about the even higher numbers of AIDS+ve heterosexuals? This boils down ultimately to discrimination doesn't it? How come heterosexuals who are spreading AIDS even more than gay people are, aren't portrayed as spreading AIDS? Why are they even still accepted automatically as "normal"? 2 words: <span style="color: red;">S-O-C-I-A-L D-I-S-C-R-I-M-I-N-A-T-I-O-N</span></div>

IF the MIW say gays are evil, then the media will say likewise. Anyone remember the childcare teacher who was gay? The parents of his charges seem totally brainwashed. They assumed that since he was gay, he was HIV+, and all things that he touched needed to be replaced.
