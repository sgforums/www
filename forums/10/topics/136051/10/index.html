Therefore, if an individual's basic rights eg. right to life are violated, if the "my rights" are violated, then essentially social rights are being violated too. In pragmatic (read:economic) terms, Private Costs are a subset of Social Costs.<br><br>I'm all for social harmony, but before we can have social harmony, we need to have harmony with ourselves. Conflict often stems from an inferiority complex on the part of those who feel victimised.<br><br>And I would rather have nation before self than country before self.<br><br>Of course, that doesn't mean I support gay sex.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And FYI, USA isn't the country with the highest respect for human rights.<br><br>Regards,<br>the pikamaster</div></blockquote>It is singapore before self and not pap before.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Are Christians pushing our faith into other peopleÂ’s boundary? Or are gays here asking Christians to be accept the act of homosexual in the name of religious tolerance? I said it before, gays are free to practice what they want, but be sensitive to the feeling of others who do not share your liking, they have their rights too. </strong></blockquote><br><br>I've not asked any christians here to stop believe in god, did i? in fact, i had even encouraged a gay christian (from another thread) who had left her church to seek out other gay christian groups. i don't believe there's no way to reconcile gays and christianity. it just depends on how you interpret the scriptures. and as had pointed out by you yourself, the bible, even though the words of god, had to be interpreted by man (you had said that some laws in the book were voided). on the other hand, if you believe that the bible should be followed to the strictest sense, how do you explain the voiding of these certain laws (e.g., prawn eating) you had mentioned in the book but not others?<br><br><blockquote><strong>The verses on this issue say that because of what man have done, Â“therefore God gave them over to the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurityÂ…Â”verse 24. Â“ Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lustsÂ…Â”verse 26. It simply means that because of what man do, God leave them to their sinful desires and shameful lusts. God says,Â” I donÂ’t care anymore.Â” How do you interpret this that Â“homosexuality, according to paul, is a disease pass from god to those who do not believe in god.Â”???<br>And in verse 27, God says that Â“Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.Â” In other words, God is saying, Â“do what you like according to your desires and lusts, but you will receive the due penalty.Â” Paul make it clear that this is a sinful, shameful and is a perversion, and Christian must learn to hate things that are sinful, and shameful. Why force us to like it and accept it? </strong></blockquote><br><br>Let me quote the entire paragraph in totality.. if you look at para 21, it hinted that there are people who knew god but did not glorify him (i interpret it as non-christians). Therefore, god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sinful desires (in our case, gay sex)..<br><br>21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.<br>24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the CreatorÂ—who is forever praised. Amen.<br><br>Let's revisit my original argument. How much truth is there in what Paul had said here? If it is true, shouldn't all non-christians be gay? and you will not be able to find gay christians?<br><br><blockquote><strong>It is the same question as why do God create sinners. Sinful acts are condemned by God, not by the believers, and the punishment will come from God, not from the believers. Believers accept God's standard and we do not want to condone such act and certainly want no share of the punishment.<br>Homosexual acts, like any sexual acts, are to be done in private. I sympathize with them for their problem and I certainly hope that they can deal with it appropriately, but I cannot condone homosexual. </strong></blockquote><br><br>i've never argued for homosexual acts to be acted in public.. please do not twist my words.. in fact, i believe all sexual acts should be done in private.. but then, what u did not address is why is there a discriminition? from sexual acts laws to marriage laws to hdb laws?<br><br><blockquote><strong>You are gay because you like to have sex with your same sex, not because you do not believe in God. DonÂ’t twist the scripture for convenience, pls.  </strong></blockquote><br><br>I did not twist the scripture.. This was said by Paul, not me.. As indicated in the earlier argument..<br><br><blockquote><strong>Equality for a fellow human beings is totally different from equality between what is moral and what is immoral. Greater tolerance for immorality will only result in decadency of civilization.</strong></blockquote><br><br>Decadence? in what way is homosexuality decadent?<br>i contributed to society, pay my taxes, had a regular partner, etc.. etc.. am i not part of the society? how would that be decadence?<br><br>yes, there is a circle within the gay culture that might lead a more promiscuous life.. but are you going to generalise that to the entire gay circle.. and if you just look at the divorce rates, the AIDs incidence rate among straights.. you will realise that promiscuity is not happening ONLY in the gay circle..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My story<br><br>I will avoid talking about the sex in detail to avoid others getting offended..<br><br>The first time I discovered that I'm different, that I'm attracted to the same gender was during my puberty, around 10-12.. For a long time, I believe that it's a passing phase (it's a popular belief back then), I would grow out of it..<br><br>But the problem is, it didn't happen and I never grow out of that phase.. The attraction is still there.. and it's something that one cannot control at will..<br><br>However, I kept questioning myself.. Why is it me? Can I change? For a long long time.. I kept denying to myself those inner feelings I had.. I even tried the dating game to see whether I can get attracted to the opposite gender..<br><br>When I was 26-27, I even took the plunge of going into a relationship.. The boyfriend/girlfriend type.. Within less than 6 months.. She broke up with me.. Stating that she did not feel the passion from me.. It was then that I realised that I did not even have any urge to touch her.. e.g., she had to take initiative to hold my hand everytime we went out..<br><br>I'm glad that she initiated the break-up.. or else, i will drag another person (she quite attractive.. and managed to get attached, get married within 2 years after our break-up) into a "fake" relationship..<br><br>But still, I believe it's okay for me not to accept my own sexuality.. I kept on lying to myself until the age of 28.. I was in fact a homophobic myself prior to that fateful month..<br><br>I took 4 weeks of leave to study for my CFA exam.. During those 4 weeks, it was the most miserable time in my life.. I realise that I had no support, I had no reason to even study since no one will be sharing my happiness if I make it.. While, watching "I not stupid", I burst out into tears.. The first time I had cried in a long long while..<br><br>It was only then that I realised that the problem is I'm leading a "phoney" life.. Pretending to be like anyone else when I'm not.. the only solution is to accept myself.. I started to do internet search for other gays.. I will not go into the details but what's important is that I did not have sex.. I was more busy playing volleyballs, watching movies, etc..<br><br>The first step in coping with homosexuality is the self-acceptance part.. Once that's done, the rest will fall into place.. It took a year for me to find a partner.. the r/s didn't last because we had many differences in our personality..<br><br>And around 2 years later, before my 30th birthday.. i've found that someone in my life.. we have been together for almost 2 years.. i'm planning to move out once i've reach 35..<br><br>This is just a simple story of my own struggle.. And I do hope that not too many people will find it offensive since it did not dwell too much into the "sensitive areas"..<br><br>Many people might still ridicule me but then, at the end of the day.. it's the life that I lead because I have no other choices..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My last contribution for the day.. the following paragraph was lifted from american psychiatric association.. a neutral party in the sense that they are non-religious, non-gay.. their main motive is to help people adjust or cope with their problems..<br><br>http://www.psych.org/public_info/homose~1.cfm<br><strong>"Reparative therapy," also known as conversion therapy, is a term that is used to describe treatment attempts to change a person from a homosexual orientation to a heterosexual orientation. There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of "reparative therapy" as a treatment to change ones sexual orientation. It is not described in the scientific literature, nor is it mentioned in the APA's latest comprehensive Task Force Report, Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders (1989).<br><br>There are a few reports in the literature of efforts to use psychotherapeutic and counseling techniques to treat persons troubled by their homosexuality who desire to become heterosexual; however, results have not been conclusive, nor have they been replicated. There is no evidence that any treatment can change a homosexual person's deep seated sexual feelings for others of the same sex.<br><br>Clinical experience suggests that any person who seeks conversion therapy may be doing so because of social bias that has resulted in internalized homophobia, and that gay men and lesbians who have accepted their sexual orientation positively are better adjusted than those who have not done so. </strong><br><br>my 2 cents.. if u r straight, pls do not ever think about trying out.. u r hurting yourself.. and others too..<br><br>if u r gay, help can be seek readily from some non-profit gay groups.. the route of self-discovery and self-acceptance is not an easy one.. but resolving your inner-conflicts is an impt step for you to lead an well-adjusted life (psychiatrist say one, not me)..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>earthlings73:<br><br>Thank you for sharing with us. Are you Christian as well?<br><br>My friend, the American Psychiatric Association is not as neutral as you think.<br><br>For your further research:<br><a href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0107a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0107a.html</a><br><br>Regarding Â‘double standardsÂ’, there is a difference with the ceremonial law and the moral law in the Old Testament. The ceremonial law may change from time to time, at GodÂ’s discretion, but the moral law will never change. Which is why we can eat prawns and seafood but still have to follow the ten commandments. So there is no fear of double standards.<br><br>And this Kinsey guyÂ… A lot of psychologists say that his research is flawedÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by earthlings73:<br><strong>My story<br><br>I will avoid talking about the sex in detail to avoid others getting offended..<br><br>The first time I discovered that I'm different, that I'm attracted to the same gender was during my puberty, around 10-12.. For a long time, I believe that it's a passing phase (it's a popular belief back then), I would grow out of it..<br><br>[b]But the problem is, it didn't happen and I never grow out of that phase.. The attraction is still there.. and it's something that one cannot control at will..<br><br>However, I kept questioning myself.. Why is it me? Can I change? For a long long time.. I kept denying to myself those inner feelings I had.. I even tried the dating game to see whether I can get attracted to the opposite gender..<br><br>When I was 26-27, I even took the plunge of going into a relationship.. The boyfriend/girlfriend type.. Within less than 6 months.. She broke up with me.. Stating that she did not feel the passion from me.. It was then that I realised that I did not even have any urge to touch her.. e.g., she had to take initiative to hold my hand everytime we went out..</strong><br><br>I'm glad that she initiated the break-up.. or else, i will drag another person (she quite attractive.. and managed to get attached, get married within 2 years after our break-up) into a "fake" relationship..<br><br>But still, I believe it's okay for me not to accept my own sexuality.. I kept on lying to myself until the age of 28.. I was in fact a homophobic myself prior to that fateful month..<br><br>I took 4 weeks of leave to study for my CFA exam.. During those 4 weeks, it was the most miserable time in my life.. I realise that I had no support, I had no reason to even study since no one will be sharing my happiness if I make it.. While, watching "I not stupid", I burst out into tears.. The first time I had cried in a long long while..<br><br>It was only then that I realised that the problem is I'm leading a "phoney" life.. Pretending to be like anyone else when I'm not.. the only solution is to accept myself.. <strong>I started to do internet search for other gays.. I will not go into the details but what's important is that I did not have sex.. I was more busy playing volleyballs, watching movies, etc..</strong><br><br>The first step in coping with homosexuality is the self-acceptance part.. Once that's done, the rest will fall into place.. It took a year for me to find a partner.. the r/s didn't last because we had many differences in our personality..<br><br>And around 2 years later, before my 30th birthday.. i've found that someone in my life.. we have been together for almost 2 years.. i'm planning to move out once i've reach 35..<br><br>This is just a simple story of my own struggle.. And I do hope that not too many people will find it offensive since it did not dwell too much into the "sensitive areas"..<br><br>Many people might still ridicule me but then, at the end of the day.. it's the life that I lead because I have no other choices.. [/b]</blockquote>earthlings73,<br><br>it is good that you have the courage to share your full story. well, quite full anyway. I have a few comments to make: (i'm a straight Catholic btw)<br><br>bold-1) Having Same-sex attraction doesn't necessarily mean that youa re gay. Straights can have it from time to time, basically towards people who are close to you or people whom you admire. For example, a boy can "love" Michael Jackson.<br><br>bold-2) what are the "Dating-game" you are referring to?<br><br>bold-3) If she was your first, well, perhaps she just wasn't the right one for you. And that is probably true too. It sounds like you forced yourself into a relationship and got stuck in an inferiority complex after its failure.<br><br>bold-4) Are you sure that whoever you met online didn't <span style="font-style: italic;">influence</span> you into thinking that youa re gay? One must always be wary of the internet.<br><br>No offence intended,<br>the pikamaster</div>

Kinsey classify sexuality using a continuum with 6 degrees (one end being homosexuals, while the other end being heterosexuals).. the issue is predominance.. do u predominantly get attracted by the same gender or the opposite gender?<br>as an acid test.. think of the following questions: a) when u walk along the street, do u look more often at the same gender or the opposite gender? b) when u r having a sexual fantasy, do u conjure up the image of the same gender or the opposite gender? c) does the body of opposite gender excites you? If all the answers to the above questions for you is "opposite gender", then you are most likely part of the majority.. if not, you might be gay..<br><br>2) i had used the word "game" cause I went out with them on 1-on-1 date.. even though i'm not attracted to them, i tried to come across as though i'm interested.. it was foolish i know.. cause i thought i can change by dating the opposite gender.. but it didn't work.. at the end of the day, i still get turned on by the same gender (in a sexual way; the so-called mari kita)..<br><br>3) nope.. there's no inferiority complex involved if you have not invested any emotions into the relationship.. she's my colleague.. i like her as my colleague (just like a straight can like a same gender as his/her best friend).. and thot that this is finally the person who can change me.. she's caring, pleasant looking.. our relationship started off as friendship and it remained as such.. there's no development after that because i'm not physically aroused when i'm with her.. when she held my hand, i even felt repulsive.. and it never cross my mind that i should hold her hand.. for 6 months.. there's no physical intimacy.. no touching what-so-ever.. she breaking off in fact was a huge relief..<br><br>4) as mentioned earlier, i know who i am since my puberty, since i know what's "masturbation".. my attraction towards the same gender had never changed.. the internet did not influence me.. it's just a tool for me to finally seek help.. to finally find out what is gay all about, something that I had denied myself for the past 28 years..<br><br>nope.. no offence.. i thot u have asked a few really important questions.. which show your sensibility in your thoughts..</div>
