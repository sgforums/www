            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, just to clarify certain points that might have been deduced wrongly.<br><br>The Catholic Church acknowledges that homosexuality is not a choice or diesese although this point is still under research. The Church will never tell anyone to go for therapy or take any other corrective recourse to change their sexual preferences.<br><br>Homosexuals are not turned away from churches, nor are they said to be evil or the such. As someone has posted in this thread, homosexuality is not a sin, homosexual sex is. My wording may be inaccurate but the Catholic Church have the same stance on this as the Muslims (the response being different).<br><br>Gay marriages are seen to the condoning gay sex, thus the Pope is indirectly reiterating the previous Pope's stand, that is, gays should try their best to remain celibate and know that the Church does not condone such acts.<br><br>The rationale for ensuring that the Catholic population knows that gay sex is immoral is so that their devotees will confess that act during confession rather than assume that it is fine with the Church.<br><br>Finally, I totally agree with Timothy that politics and religion cannot, must not, and should never ever mix. The old Catholic institution made a mistake in mixing it and somany problems ensued. Now the Catholic Church has, to a greater extend, pulled out of politics. Of course there are always the black sheep Cardinals...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would urge the participants of this discussion to take note that no one is lynching gays. No one is trying to turn popular opinion against gays.<br><br>Equality for gays has never been an issue, why? Because they are humans, the same as you and I. Why should their equality be an issue?<br><br>There are certain acts done in the animal kingdom, even in human society that should not be condoned.<br><br>Eg. We are all aware of office politics. We all know throwing away a colleague's proposal is immoral. We all know spreading rumours, carrying tales and bad mouthing others is wrong. Yet it is being carried out everyday, everywhere. We are all guilty of it at some point or another. Does it make it ok? Does being in the 21st century make office politics ok? Should we encourage it instead?<br><br>Therefore, just because it is the new century, just because it is being done all the time, doesn't mean it is good and wonderful and that we all should rush to do it.<br><br>Disclaimer: I am not equating gay sex to office politics. Indulging in office politics is not the same as carrying out gay sex.</div>

Its possible. its just like what my mother tells me that whatever I do, whether she thinks is right or not, I will always be her son. I have friends who cheated on their girlfriends and wives, of course I do not agree with what they do and I make it known to them that I will not help them cover up their deeds, but they are still my friends.

I am of course in agreement with you on this point.<br><br>To digress somewhat, perhaps the failure of the "condemn the act but love the person" philosophy might be a contributin reason why we need the yellow ribbon campaign.<br><br>I used to be a horrid bigot. I feared ex cons, hated gays... But after getting to know a few of them, gays and ex cons, I realised that they are the same as us.
