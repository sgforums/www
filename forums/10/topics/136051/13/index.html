Hitler is gay himself.. a closeted one though.. which is scarry.. since the Nazis percecuted gays even before they targeted the Jews..<br><br>hence, in my opinion, it's better for someone to be openly gay then to be a closeted one.. you'll never know what will become of him..<br><br><strong>Hitler was gay - and killed to hide it, book says<br><br>Kate Connolly in Berlin<br>Sunday October 7, 2001<br>The Observer<br><br>Adolf Hitler was gay - or so says a sensational new biography on the Nazi dictator due to be published tomorrow.<br>Eyewitness accounts from Hitler's former lovers, and historical documents that for the first time illuminate rumours that have circulated for over half a century, are disclosed in Hitler's Secret: The Double Life of a Dictator .<br><br>The respected German historian Lothar Machtan even claims in his book that Hitler ordered the deaths of several high-ranking Nazis to prevent the secret of his homosexuality from surfacing.<br><br>Ernst RÃ¶hm, the leader of Hitler's Sturm Abteilung or Storm Troopers, tried to blackmail Hitler by threatening to reveal his sexuality. RÃ¶hm, who was also gay, was murdered as a result, according to Machtan, a history teacher at Bremen University.<br><br>He refers to scores of historical documents to support his thesis. In 1915, the young Hitler was a dispatch rider at the front in France. Years later, yet before Hitler became infamous, one of his fellow soldiers, Hans Mend, wrote in his memoirs: 'At night, Hitler lay with Schmidl, his male whore.' Schmidl, otherwise known as Ernst Schmidt, and Hitler were 'inseparable lovers' for five years, according to Machtan.<br><br>Hitler's service notes read that as a result of the love affair there was reluctance among senior officers to promote him. According to Erich Ebermeier, a lawyer and writer who viewed Hitler's military files years later: 'Despite his bravery towards the enemy, because of his homosexual activity he lost out on a promotion to non-commissioned officer.'<br><br>Police reports from Munich after the First World War also suggest that Hitler was pursued by police because of his sexual orientation. 'As a "brown" [fascist] activist, Hitler managed to lure many young men to his side, but not only for political reasons,' says Machtan.<br><br>According to a Munich police protocol from the early part of the 20th century, a 22-year-old man called Joseph told the police: 'I spent the whole night with him.' Another, Michael, who was 18, told them: 'I had been unemployed for months, and my mother and my brother were always hungry, so, at his request, I accompanied the man to his home.' Another, a boy called Franz, said: 'He asked me if I'd like to stay with him and he told me his name was Adolf Hitler.'<br><br>The police reports were collected by Otto von Lossow, a German army general who took part in suppressing the Hitler putsch in 1923. He kept the Munich police file for years, as, he described it, 'a form of personal life insurance'. If Hitler had attempted to push him aside, he would have blackmailed him with the information, he said. The police documents were published some years ago in Rome by Eugen Dollmann, a close friend of Heinrich Himmler's and also Hitler's interpreter. But because his book never appeared in German, the startling information remained largely overlooked by historians.<br><br>Machtan says that Hitler was particularly drawn to Rudolf Hess, his deputy, who was known in party circles as 'black Emma' and with whom he had spent months in Landsberg prison.<br><br>Why, then, did the Nazis persecute homosexuals, sending hundreds of thousands of them to their deaths in labour camps and the gas chambers?<br><br>'Hitler himself never condemned homosexuality, but he allowed the persecution of gays in order to disguise his own true colours,' Machtan says. </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings 73:</div><div class="quote_body">Adultery involves a 3rd person, isn't it? the one who didn't know about the sexual relationship between the 2 parties having a sexual relationship.<br><br>As I've argued earlier. If you can communicate with an animal, and you can ascertain that the animal loves you back in a sexual way. I would still say, why not? But then, since we cannot communicate with an animal, there's no need to answer this question. The answer is a straight NO (at least in my opinion). </div></blockquote>earthlings,<br><br>Pre-marital sex is considered adultery too. That obviously happens between two people only, unless u count groupies and orgies. The reason why adultery is considered a sin, from the Christian perspective, is because sex before or outside marriage is not made with the commitment that married parties give each other to protect and take care of each other, and to share each other fully with each other; instead, these forms of sex occur under the influence of lust, or at least where lust overpowers love. Clearly, a boss, even a single one, who has an affair with his/her secretary does not really love the secretary in the pure-love sense of the word. Ditto for two teens who are just "having fun".<br><br>For a similar reason, the Church discourages cohabitation, since cohabitation promotes such forms of lust which are sinful because in any occasion of lust, the lusting person is thinking only of his/her own desire and hoe to fulfill it. not about the needs/ desire  of the other person, and doesn't seek to maintain harmony; the person is treating his/her partner as a sex-object, not as a person. And of course, due to the ahrmful influence of Hollywood, many people can no longer distinguish between selfish lust and self-less sexual love.  The harmony element is extremely crucial, according to the Church; In his Theology of the Body, Pope John Paul II even went to the extent of maintaining that both partners ought to experience climax at the same time. (OMG!)<br><br>Actually, the lust idea, come to think of it,  is also why the Church disapproves of homosexual acts. This is the idea that the predominant actor in gay/lesbian sex is lust, the aim for personal gratification, since certain *parts* obviously can't be shared with a partner of the similar gender. And of course, the Church's idea of marriage is that it must involve sex ASAP after the wedding, so obviously if homo sex is out, so is homo marriage.  And in my opinion, the homos have not given much evidence to oppose this view.<br><br>And no, I am not a homophobe. I do not support the notion that Homos should be banned from every corner of society; I'm an insectophobe; I am fully in favour of fumigating and banning every six-legged winged creature on the surface of this planet.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> The real homophobes are those who try to ban gays/lesbians from attending Church service, and who prohibit the ordination of homosexual clergymen, who anyway can't perform any sexual acts after being ordained, since even for a hetero, this would be considered a sin. The protestants might ahve other ideas, erpz.<br><br>Hope that clarifies  things a great deal about the opinion of the Church. Truthfully, I'm getting sick of all this bible-wrangling in this thread. It's not showing the Holy Text much respect.<br><br>btw, what is your source which says that the Dalai Lama is in support of homos?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>the sighing pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pikamaster:</div><div class="quote_body">earthlings,<br><br>Pre-marital sex is considered adultery too. That obviously happens between two people only, unless u count groupies and orgies. The reason why adultery is considered a sin, from the Christian perspective, is because sex before or outside marriage is not made with the commitment that married parties give each other to protect and take care of each other, and to share each other fully with each other; instead, these forms of sex occur under the influence of lust, or at least where lust overpowers love. Clearly, a boss, even a single one, who has an affair with his/her secretary does not really love the secretary in the pure-love sense of the word. Ditto for two teens who are just "having fun".<br><br>For a similar reason, the Church discourages cohabitation, since cohabitation promotes such forms of lust which are sinful because in any occasion of lust, the lusting person is thinking only of his/her own desire and hoe to fulfill it. not about the needs/ desire  of the other person, and doesn't seek to maintain harmony; the person is treating his/her partner as a sex-object, not as a person. And of course, due to the ahrmful influence of Hollywood, many people can no longer distinguish between selfish lust and self-less sexual love.  The harmony element is extremely crucial, according to the Church; In his Theology of the Body, Pope John Paul II even went to the extent of maintaining that both partners ought to experience climax at the same time. (OMG!)<br><br>Actually, the lust idea, come to think of it,  is also why the Church disapproves of homosexual acts. This is the idea that the predominant actor in gay/lesbian sex is lust, the aim for personal gratification, since certain *parts* obviously can't be shared with a partner of the similar gender. And of course, the Church's idea of marriage is that it must involve sex ASAP after the wedding, so obviously if homo sex is out, so is homo marriage.  And in my opinion, the homos have not given much evidence to oppose this view.<br><br>And no, I am not a homophobe. I do not support the notion that Homos should be banned from every corner of society; I'm an insectophobe; I am fully in favour of fumigating and banning every six-legged winged creature on the surface of this planet.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> The real homophobes are those who try to ban gays/lesbians from attending Church service, and who prohibit the ordination of homosexual clergymen, who anyway can't perform any sexual acts after being ordained, since even for a hetero, this would be considered a sin. The protestants might ahve other ideas, erpz.<br><br>Hope that clarifies  things a great deal about the opinion of the Church. Truthfully, I'm getting sick of all this bible-wrangling in this thread. It's not showing the Holy Text much respect.<br><br>btw, what is your source which says that the Dalai Lama is in support of homos?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>the sighing pikamaster</div></blockquote>Dear Pikamaster..<br><br>Ah.. Thx for letting me in on this rather "illuminating" definition of adultery..<br><br>I do respect your position, will not argue against your point. other then to say that the following is the general understanding of adultery:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultery<br><br>As for Dalai Lama's acceptance (not support) of gays:<br><br>http://quietmountain.org/links/teachings/gayrites.htm<br><br>Buddhism has less baggage than Christianity when it comes to the issue of Homosexuality though.. Buddha himself encourages you to think for yourself what's right and wrong.. Guiding you along only through certain principles..<br><br>I do have a thot though.. Hope u will not taken offence.. Why can't the church be more welcoming? Jesus took great efforts to ensure that all those who were discriminated during his time to get access to God.. Isn't this what Christianity is all about? To spread the words of God, no matter how you are born?</div>

U have to realise there r different situation and things r not just black or white but grey, right or wrong but depending on situation<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">No need to make it so confusing.Is homosexuality good &amp; right?U need to answer the question.The very ancient book says it it wrong -- just like it says murder is wrong.So try to convince us the bible is wrong, can u?</span><br><br>Posted by u on the 4th of july. From it u say tat murder is wrong because the bible says it is wrong. Well then, if a person murder another to save a hundred, in the case of killing a terrorist to prevent him from blowing up, is he right or wrong ? Lets say in abattoir they murder animals for meat. Right or wrong ? SPCA have to culled animals because they have no other choice. Right or wrong ? In the ancient book they say god kill many many people. In the bible they say stoning of people if they commit certain crimes. In the church they kill people in crusaders and inquisition. If murder is wrong, then the bible, god and the church r all wrong since they themselves murder or encourage murder.<br><br>Is is homosexual wrong ? If u ask me, if men r homo because of natural, then it is not wrong, and they r as innocent as people who r born with physical defects. DO u think the borned handicapped people r wrong ? Are Siamese twins wrong ? Being born means the state they r in now has NOTHING to do with their decisions or actions, and they r inherited by without their choice or cosent. If these people engages in sexual acts, it is basically the same as we hetero engage in sexual acts. They r inbuilt human instinct.<br><br>However if a person is homo because of nurture, tat means environment and actions and his choice make up for why he become homo, then it will be hard to say if he is right or wrong. But again tis is really his own business and doesn't harm the rest of <span style="font-style: italic;">society</span> (Unless he publicly broadcast or attempt to influence others to follow him)<br><br>So it really is a grey region where there is no right or wrong. So just forget about claiming homo is wrong, and then just drone on homo is wrong without giving much reasons for it.<br><br>Anyway I am not gonna reply back to tis thread as much as I try</div>
