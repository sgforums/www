            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">i say that i believe it is natural, because although its not 100% conclusive evidence, the amount of scientific evidence collected is growing at a high rate. And looking at the amount of documentries produced, it is  hardly prudent to say it is still not conclusive enough. Criminal trials have been concluded on less than conclusive evidence. Like I said, environment only plays a part in whether a person accepts his/her sexuality, or spends his whole life in denial.<br><br>And I find it silly that I always have to repeat myself to people who talk about homosexuality being unnatural.<br><br>1stly. know your history. Consider this statement of yours:<br><br>If homosexuality is normal and does not go against social order, why is it consider a taboo in nearly all the societies from ancient times till now?<br><br>Do u know your history? Do u know that it wasn't considered a taboo in many societies in ancient times, only more recently due to the church's influence? Do u know that in pre-christ societies such as the ancient Greek and Roman societies, it was a perfectly acceptable social norm? Do you know that even after christ, only societies which have been influenced by the overly human-influenced vatican church view it as a taboo, and many other societies still accept it?<br><br>2ndly, more your logic. considering this statement of yours:<br><br>If homosexuality is right, why should pple suppress it?<br><br>Let me ask u, if the earth is round, why did society work so hard to supress it when some people started suggesting that the earth is round instead of it being flat? Why did the church brand people as heretics n burn them for suggesting that earth wasn't the center of the universe as everyone else thought it was? Why did women have to fight so hard for women's rights while men tried to supress them? Why did the blacks have to fight so hard for their freedom while white men tried to supress them? Indeed, history has shown that mankind has often supressed truths more than they do evil. So yes, why do people supress homosexuality? because they are afraid of the ultimate truth!<br><br>finally, while im not homosexual, i find it very offensive that u say that for homosexuals to create a positive image for themselves, they have to say "i acknowledge im homosexual, i need to change" That is pure bigotry, simply put. In your desire to mask your bigotry with niceties, it only exposes it more.<br><br>By the way, hang out less with gay people who have a dilemma between their biased conscience and needs. U need to find more people who are accepting of themselves as they are.</div></blockquote>U can always dwell on conspiracy theories, or look to the fact that homosexuals do have a part to make themselves accepted by the 'normal' society. It should work both ways, for pple of both sides.<br><br>I believe it is not just the Catholic Church, but also other faiths (e.g. Islam) which also have an issue with homosexuals as well. Dun tell me they have skeletons to hide also?<br><br>I have no problem with anyone who are accepting themselves as they are, but they should also be mindful of why pple have an issue with them. By just maintaining homosexuality is an established true shows that u are probably as staunch as those pple who believe it to be false.<br><br>Niceties/bigotry.....who is to judge? I believe u also do not like pple to judge u as well....no further need to discuss with u any longer as i have stated my point.</div>

From my limited understanding of chinese culture (I am currently pursuing a degree in Chinese Language and Literature), I have not really heard of any openly prominent professed gay men in chinese history.

Even the author of the "Holy Blood Holy Grail" is more believable than Dan Brown, as he said:" The things i do not know, I will not write. I will only state :"It was said" "It was believed". Another person whom I think have more credibility is the non-christian author Elaine Pagels who researched intensively about the gnosptics gospel.<br><br>Dan Brown seemed to have the least credibility that night...<br><br></div>

I believe u also do not like pple to judge u as well....no further need to discuss with u any longer as i have stated my point.</div></blockquote>conspiracy theories? sorry. all im stating are facts. perhaps u're the one who's dwelling on conspiracy theories. why do homosexuals have to play a part in forcing society to accept them? like i said earlier:<br><br><strong>HETEROSEXISM</strong> is...<br><br>...the assumption that everyone is heterosexual and that being heterosexual is better, preferable or superior to being lesbian, gay or bisexual. It's the belief that heterosexual or mixed sex relationships are somehow better than same sex relationships.<br><br>It's the belief that only straight people should be allowed to marry or raise families. <span style="color: red;">It's the idea that lesbian, gay and bisexual people are demanding "special status" when they ask for basic civil rights such as the right to safety at work, in the home or on the street. Heterosexism allows straight couples to walk down the street holding hands, whilst same sex couples are accused of "flaunting" their sexuality by doing the same thing.</span><br><br>Pay special attention to the words in red. I think thats the mistake you're committing, and you don't, or are unwilling to, realise it. Besides, let me remind u that many faiths like Islam n Judaism both come from the same roots as Christianity, which is not surprising that they share similiar views on it. But you are mistaken when you say that ancient china ound it a taboo. Maybe u think that since they regard filial piety as an important virtue, a son has to bear his parents a child. But you forget that this is a country where culturally, male actors often play female roles on stage and vice versa, where eunuchs are fairly common and many other "taboos" which wouldn't be taken kindly in our modern society.<br><br>Read your own statement:<br><br><strong>I have no problem with anyone who are accepting themselves as they are, but they should also be mindful of why pple have an issue with them.</strong><br><br>Perhaps then, its the time for christians to question why people have an issue with them too. Have they been overly zealous? Have they been overbearing on others of other faith, or *gasp!* have they even been too hypocrital? As I quote 1 comedy show: How can the church condemn homosexuality when its their own priests who have been instrumental in giving many young boys their 1st homosexual experience?<br><br>And honestly, I think u're missing the point that there are no 2 sides to the coin where the truth about homosexuality is concerned. Its not that there are 2 arguments. There is 1 single truth that homosexuality is a natural thing, it occurs in nature and nature is God's creation. Perhaps u've not thought about it, but what if in denying the truth about homosexuality, u're going against the God u so love and respect? Especially as day by day the case for homosexuality being unnatural grows steadily smaller? <span style="color: red;"><strong>Maybe u have your staunch stand, but bear in mind that people also had a staunch stand that the earth was flat and that we were the center of the universe. The church even burnt people alive for saying otherwise. I still don't see any of you using christianity as your reasoning taking this into consideration. Are you conveniently ignoring or forgetting this point? Here I'll help u. I'll bold it and highlight it in red.</strong></span></div>
