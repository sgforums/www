If you just checked out this forum, you will realise that there are more christians who are more readily talking about their religion compared to let's say buddhists..<br><br>yes, acceptance of gays is not at most 50% in the population, a strange observation is that the older ones (30-40) are more accepting than the younger ones (20+), according to an independent (as in non-gay, non-christians) study my company has done. this is exactly the social prejudice we were talking about.. convincing them to accept requires a more heightened level of awareness.. we have countries like belgium, holland and spain accepting gay marriages.. other countries like UK and Canada will follow suit within the next couple of years.. In the US, if the democrats manage to win favours with the voters, we might see some developments there too.. In asia, the road is still pretty long.. what we can do is to raise awareness of gay issues.. it might take generations for people to accept.. but that does not mean that we should just sit there and do nothing about it..<br><br>err.. have you read the thread? spreading such discriminination messages will spread hatred.. will spread anti-gays sentiments.. not love, which is what the religion is all about.. go back to the earlier parts of this thread, read those hate crimes against gays..</div>

These individuals are as much living under grace like everyone of us. If not, GOD would have punished them like in the olden times. The fact is: GOD no longer held our sins against us, including the sin of homosexuality. When sin is abound, grace is much more abound.<br><br>However, this goes back to our question: do pple have the license to live a life of careless conduct? This applies to everyone, including homosexuals. Think about it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>For those homosexuals who have a single permanent loving partner who cares for them, I wish u all well. (If) it is GOD's plans for homosexuals to have the same rights as heterosexuals, then it will happen. U dun even have to fight for it. No opposing Church can stop it (if) it is GOD's plan.<br><br></div>
