And you are right.. I will give in to you..<br><br><strong>Homosexuality has been documented in China since ancient times. According the scholar Ji Yun of the Qing Dynasty, already at the very beginning Huang Di (The Yellow Emperor, 2697? - 2597? BCE), legendary king and founder of the Chinese culture, had male lovers. This is naturally not very trustworthy because whether there was really a person called Huang Di is not very clear. Two notable royal examples come from a formulaic expression, yÂ¨Â²tÂ¨Â¢o duÂ¨Â¤nxiÂ¨Â´ (Ã“Ã ÃŒÃ’Â¶Ã�Ã�Ã¤). YÂ¨Â²tÂ¨Â¢o, or "the leftover peach", recorded in Hanfeizi, speaks of Mi Zixia (Â�Â›Ã—Ã“Ã¨Â¦), a beautiful youth cherished by Duke Ling of Wei (Ã�lÃ¬`Â¹Â«) who once shared an already bitten but very delicious peach with the duke, who appreciated the gesture (although once the growing Mi Zixia lost his beauty, the duke looked back on this event and said Mi was being insincere [1].) DuÂ¨Â¤nxiÂ¨Â´, or "breaking the sleeve", refers to Emperor Ai of Han China's act of cutting his sleeve, on which his adored male concubine Dongxian (Â¶Â­Ã™t) was sleeping, in order not to wake him.<br><br>Scholar Pan Guangdan (Ã…Ã‹Â¹Ã¢ÂµÂ©) came to the conclusion that nearly every emperor in the Han Dynasty had one or more male sex partners. There are also descriptions of lesbians in some history books. It is believed homosexuality was popular in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties. Chinese homosexuals did not experience high-profile persecution comparing with that was received by homosexuals in Europe during the Middle Ages.<br><br>Same-sex love was celebrated in Chinese art, many examples of which have survived the book burnings of the Cultural Revolution. Though no large statues are known to still exist, many hand scrolls and paintings on silk can be found in private collections[2].</strong><br><br></div>

The Malays were treated much better by the British, unlike their Burmese or mainland CHinese counterparts.</div></blockquote>Malaya was a colony of the brits, just like indo china under the the french and indonesia under the dutch. China at that time was under qing dynasty which was too weak to handle foreign powers in china but it was too big to be swallowed up by any one single power.  Eight countries including japan sent in their troops and occupied and formed special territories in china under several different treaties. Hong Kong was given to the brits and taiwan to the jap in the same period of time. The occupation ended when japan started ww2 and when mao finally took over, all foreign influence in china ended.</div>
