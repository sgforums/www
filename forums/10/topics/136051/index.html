            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Pope condemns gay marriages as 'anarchy'<br>Mon Jun 6, 2005 02:49 PM ET<br><br>ROME (Reuters) - Pope Benedict, in his first clear pronouncement on gay marriages since his election, on Monday condemned same-sex unions as fake and expressions of "anarchic freedom" that threatened the future of the family.<br><br>The Pope, who was elected in April, also condemned divorce, artificial birth control, trial marriages and free-style unions, saying all of these practices were dangerous for the family.<br><br>"Today's various forms of dissolution of marriage, free unions, trial marriages as well as the pseudo-matrimonies between people of the same sex are instead expressions of anarchic freedom which falsely tries to pass itself off as the true liberation of man," he said.<br><br>The Pope spoke to families at Rome's St. John's Cathedral on an issue that has become highly controversial around the world, particularly in Europe and the United States.<br><br>In April, parliament in traditionally Catholic Spain gave initial approval to a law legalizing gay marriage. It is widely expected to be approved by the Senate and to become law.<br><br>But just last week, California's Assembly killed off a bill that would have allowed gay marriage in the most populous U.S. state.<br><br>The Pope, who as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger headed the Vatican's doctrinal department for more than two decades, said "pseudo freedoms" such as gay marriages were based on what he called the "banalisation of the human body" and of man himself.<br><br>(Source:<a href="http://www.reuters.com/printerFriendlyPopup.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=8709268" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>)<br></blockquote>And I, lwflee, condemn Benedict for propogating intolerance and bigotry. Shame on him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most religions strongly oppose gay marriage. Some of the strong oppositions come from the religions of Islam and Catholic.<br><br>Western Protestant is somewhat ambivalent about this Sin. Sorry, to those who are Protestant here.  This is not an attack on the local protestant. But the fact is this- Western societies are not only so morally corrupted but they are building walls of legality and legitimacy by harnessing the sanctity of religion and the principles of democracy to hide.<br><br>I remember reading a newspaper about a Western Anglican Church appointing a bishop who is gay and has gay marriage.  The American (even Sg) talks about no to child prostitution. Yes, child prostitution is bad but is child sex any better? Go to any American High School and you find girls and boys below 16 having sex freely.<br><br>This to them is freedom of expression. Has it never occurs to them that for some issues black is black and white is white? The Western societies seems to have one set of value for themselves and another for others.<br><br>At this point I would say that I am puzzle by the Catholic blanket opposition on abortion. Not even for rape cases?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The church (and the Islamic faith) is against sodomy, unnatural and same sex intercourse. These acts according to the previous pope, are immoral.<br><br>The gays (or by whatever name they go under) are still children of God, still welcomed to church, welcomed by the community.<br><br>Just because gays are welcome, doesn't mean gay sex is condoned.<br>Similarly, just because gay sex is not tolerated, doesn't mean gays are lynched.<br><br>As for abortion, the new pope as agreed, is not good with words. I do not speak for the church but I understand the rationale for being against abortion.<br><br>As any programmer and computer engineer can attest, you create a system, some idiot will do something stupid with it. You create a calculator program, some idiot will type A+B and expect an answer. You create a mobile with an attenna, some clown will use it to dig his ears.<br><br>If the church decides to be ambiguous or allows abortion, how will people abuse this stand? Can you sit back and imagine for a moment? Even atheists  can tell you how society will degenerate if abortion becomes a trend.<br><br>Why then can't the church give little allowances for rape victims, for this and that...etc...<br><br>Like Singapore law, certain rules are not negotiable. Yet like sg(ironically), it will be viewed case to case.  Divorce is a strict no no for Catholism, only the Anglicans practise it, yet if the marriage is proven to be so destructive, so intolerable, if it continues, more atrocious acts will be committed, may result in death or permanent psychological damage, the church will nullify your marriage for you.<br><br>Of course if you said, I married the wrong person. I dun love my spouse anymore. I got tired of my spouse. Continuing this marriage is akind to torture. I'll kill myself if this marriage continues. These are not valid grounds for the church to accept although you have warped my previous paragraph.<br><br>Its the same for abortion. I'm not familiar with any cases and hence are unable to give examples regarding the church allowing abortions.</div>

The administration and decision making body of the Catholic church is just not dynamic enough to meet the demands and challenges of today.<br><br>But alas, we have to bear in mind that being a very old establishment, tradition (i know this shouldn't be) tends to be preserved.<br><br>Also, the church faces 2 unspoken problems:<br><br>Claiming to be THE original faith, they are burdened with ensuring that the system is "perfect" and cannot be abused, ie anarchy or absolute dictatorship. Right now, the pope is the highest authority on Catholic affairs, but he is kept in check by some (i'm not too sure about this) cardinals in a committee.<br><br>Facing opposition and indifference from many fronts, the Church stands alone in its (sometimes inflexible) stand on certain moral issues. Christian bodies denounce Catholism as a cult and the pope as the devil. Goverments either ignore the vatican or give token acknowledgement to the church's stand (which seen from the view of the nations, is understandable).<br><br>The Vatican is not perfect although as a Catholic, I'm not supposed to say that. The Church's stand has to be consistent and, as the moral authority (supposedly), they have to be rather clear in their stand with no way to pervert the meaning.</div>
