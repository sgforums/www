But what do people do when they have sinned? they repent and usually stop performing the sinful acts.. but in the case of homosexuals.. could they do that? no.. sexual orientation is like (left or right) handedness.. even if you force yourself to change, the change can never be a permanent one..<br><br>http://toddlerstoday.com/resources/articles/lefthand.htm<br><br>and yes, left-handers used to be discriminated too..<br><br><strong>"In past societies, there was no sympathy for left-handed persons. Lefthanders International shares stories of children forced to change their dominant hand in fear for their life, their safety and their acceptance. As left-handedness was seen as a curse, children caught using their left hand for reaching and grabbing were often scolded and forced to use their right hand in order to make it dominant. This was an enormous effort for both parent and child. It is stated that to accomplish the change in handedness, the left hand would be tied behind the child's back, down at their side or across their chest to make it unusable for normal activities, forcing the right hand to take its place.</strong><br><br>2) ah.. corrupted popes and gay popes cannot be equated.. found the following list.. it's not 100% accurate since in the past, most gays are closeted.. in the long of gay "celebrity", you can find kings, emperors, and..... popes..<br><br>http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/celebs-list.html<br><br>3) I personally dont see why should a christians/catholics/etc.. leave a church if they find out certain priests (or even pope) are gays.. church is a place for believers to be nearer to god.. if the priests have demostrated his ability in helping believers to do that, does it matter whether he's gay or straight?<br>(i know the answer is yes..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> because of prejudice and discrimination.. just raising this point as a food for thought)..</div>
