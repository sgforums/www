Abortion can be seen as murder because a young life is not allowed to decide its own fate. Otherwise even things like divorce, although best avoided for the children's sake, is not necessary a bad thing. As for free sex, well if both parties are willing, it harms no other innocent parties.<br><br>Discrimination of someone be if for their race, religion or sexuality is just wrong, much as you wouldn't like to be spat on for being christian or chinese, its no less fair to discriminate someone for their sexuality. Many recent enlightening documentries which have aired in the more open minded western countries have revealed that sexuality is largely decided by genes and hormones, upbringing has little to do with deciding a person's sexuality. It might serve to repress it, making the person think he's straight, when in reality he's just going to end up fighting a life ling battle with denial. What good does that do to anyone? All that brings is a life unfulfilled.<br><br>Homosexuality is every bit a part of nature's plan for us as heterosexuality is. More and more animal species have been documented showing homosexuality in some members of the species, surely if homosexuality was unnatural, this would not be so. In the past just because we haven't documented it doesn't mean it didn't exist. That is man's most common folly. To think that something, just because it wasn't documented by man, couldn't have existed. That is sheer arrogance of self, certainly not befitting anyone who believes in God.<br><br>As man slowly learns more about the world around us, the truth becomes clearer and clearer. To deny the truth is to be foolish and live in your own bubble of ignorance. If u want to do so, then u might as well continue believing that the earth is flat and that we're in the center of the universe. And oh all you ignoramus, please don't have kids. The legacy of passing on ignorance spells doom for the human species.</div>

Now u tell me, is nature wrong?<br><br>To all hetro only supporters, if heterosexuality is the only right way, why do u have to work so hard to suppress the truth that homosexuality occurs everywhere in nature including humans? the only thing that needs suppressing is truth. besides, i never say that its wrong to be heterosexual, because that is how the species replenishes its numbers. but hey lets face it, a species will never end up all homosexual, due to survival needs, but a species will also never end up all heterosexual, because the existance of homosexuality in ANY species is natural. and the truth is that homosexuality has existed, exists, and will exist alongside heterosexuality. It can, and it will. Thats the truth. And to supress the truth is plain stupid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>people here must understand, nobody is saying its wrong to be heterosexual. we're just saying its not wrong either to be homosexual, and that be you homosexual or heterosexual, we should all respect other people's sexuality, as we respect their race and religion. the way i see it, so many christians have so little respect for other religions, that its no wonder bigotry seems to be an almost common trait of modern day christians. u do wonder what exactly they teach in church nowadays; to label anything and everything u don't understand as a "sin" and then to keep repeating "we hate the sin, not the sinners" like a broken record?<br><br>here, let me introduce you people to 3 words. I try my best to break thru the fog of ignorance that you all so comfortably enshroud yourselves in, whether u want to open your eyes to the truth, is up to u. also some of u here who refuse to accept the truth because it seems contary to your religion's teaching need to question if those teachings are 100% accurate. They've been proved to be flawed in the past and have been challenged and reformed successfully b4, so keep an open mind to all things.<br><br>the 3 words:<br><br><strong>HOMOPHOBIA</strong> is...<br><br>...the irrational hatred, intolerance, and fear of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.<br><br>its like calling someone a "faggot", "butch". Its the belief that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is "just a phase", that same sex attraction is unnatural, sick abnormal.<br><br>Homophobia hurts EVERYONE. Like racism, sexism and other forms of prejudice, homophobia makes society a much more unsafe and restrictive place for people to live.<br><br><strong>HETEROSEXISM</strong> is...<br><br>...the assumption that everyone is heterosexual and that being heterosexual is better, preferable or superior to being lesbian, gay or bisexual. It's the belief that heterosexual or mixed sex relationships are somehow better than same sex relationships.<br><br>It's the belief that only straight people should be allowed to marry or raise families. It's the idea that lesbian, gay and bisexual people are demanding "special status" when they ask for basic civil rights such as the right to safety at work, in the home or on the street. Heterosexism allows straight couples to walk down the street holding hands, whilst same sex couples are accused of "flaunting" their sexuality by doing the same thing.<br><br><strong>TRANSPHOBIA</strong> is...<br><br>...the irrational hatred, intolerance, and fear of transgender and transsexual people.<br><br>It's the belief that transsexual women are not "real women" and that transsexual men are not "real men". It's the assumption that transgender people are sick or psychologically unstable. It's the belief that transsexual people are only acceptable if they "pass". It's the belief that transsexuals are gay people who cannot accept their sexual orientation and so undergo gender reassignment to hide their true nature.<br><br>Transphobia hurts EVERYONE. Sexism and gender stereotypoing are some of the root causes of homophobia, forcing everyone into strict gender roles.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heng jie, you forgot that gender stereotyping also breeds double standards. It is okay for women to gossip but not for men, even if the latter are feeling pissed with a lot of things. Since all humans are meant to be equal, what is bad for men has to be bad for women too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I know of guys who listen to boybands and are labelled "gay". In fact, boy bands are seen as "gay" just because they draw more women to them.</div>

And looking at the amount of documentries produced, it is  hardly prudent to say it is still not conclusive enough. Criminal trials have been concluded on less than conclusive evidence. Like I said, environment only plays a part in whether a person accepts his/her sexuality, or spends his whole life in denial.<br><br>And I find it silly that I always have to repeat myself to people who talk about homosexuality being unnatural.<br><br>1stly. know your history. Consider this statement of yours:<br><br>If homosexuality is normal and does not go against social order, why is it consider a taboo in nearly all the societies from ancient times till now?<br><br>Do u know your history? Do u know that it wasn't considered a taboo in many societies in ancient times, only more recently due to the church's influence? Do u know that in pre-christ societies such as the ancient Greek and Roman societies, it was a perfectly acceptable social norm? Do you know that even after christ, only societies which have been influenced by the overly human-influenced vatican church view it as a taboo, and many other societies still accept it?<br><br>2ndly, more your logic. considering this statement of yours:<br><br>If homosexuality is right, why should pple suppress it?<br><br>Let me ask u, if the earth is round, why did society work so hard to supress it when some people started suggesting that the earth is round instead of it being flat? Why did the church brand people as heretics n burn them for suggesting that earth wasn't the center of the universe as everyone else thought it was? Why did women have to fight so hard for women's rights while men tried to supress them? Why did the blacks have to fight so hard for their freedom while white men tried to supress them? Indeed, history has shown that mankind has often supressed truths more than they do evil. So yes, why do people supress homosexuality? because they are afraid of the ultimate truth!<br><br>finally, while im not homosexual, i find it very offensive that u say that for homosexuals to create a positive image for themselves, they have to say "i acknowledge im homosexual, i need to change" That is pure bigotry, simply put. In your desire to mask your bigotry with niceties, it only exposes it more.<br><br>By the way, hang out less with gay people who have a dilemma between their biased conscience and needs. U need to find more people who are accepting of themselves as they are.</div>

I seriously doubt so. Since these times homosexuals are seen as lowly outcasts in society already. Not sure about the other civilisations, but as far as I know, it is not accepted in Chinese Ancient Civilisation, and it is a taboo becoz it goes against the 'normal' social order of reproduction.<br><br>Think u read too much conspiracy theories by Dan Brown already. It is afterall, a novel which strives to up its sales and not a good source of information for historical facts (e.g. Constantine never compiled the bible as what Dan Brown believe).<br><br></div>
