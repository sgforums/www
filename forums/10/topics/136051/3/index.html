For everyone's info, I for one am against homosexuality but I am on close terms with a couple of homosexuals. I make my stand clear and these 2 friends are pretty fine with it simply because other than disagreeing on this part of their lifestyle, I treat them like any other friends. I think it is too shallow on anyone's part to say that if we condemn homosexuality, we condemn homosexuals. Cmon, I make friends with a PERSON, not because he is homosexual or he is 'straight'.  Loving a person goes beyond what he does.   Just look at your own friends and family.

But yet, she calls me son.<br><br>I think this society need to re-think about their attitudes.  I think for homosexuals or ex-criminals, it can be called discrimination only when the society do not give them equal opportunities to excel in work, in life and in their ambitions.  If such a person is given equal opportunities by the society, i think it is wrong to say that the society discriminates them just because some of them think that homosexuality is wrong.  Lets be fair to everyone, treat everyone fairly because the other party is a PERSON. And also because regardless of your religion, sexual tendencies or attitudes or beliefs, we are all PEOPLE with our own mind, lets agree to disagree. Hate the act, Love the Person.</div>

Its possible. its just like what my mother tells me that whatever I do, whether she thinks is right or not, I will always be her son. I have friends who cheated on their girlfriends and wives, of course I do not agree with what they do and I make it known to them that I will not help them cover up their deeds, but they are still my friends.  We hang out, we chill out, we share our thoughts and woes....  Seriously does no one here have the - love the person, condemn the act - thinking? Its absolutely fine with me and I think I do it very well.</div></blockquote>ah.. if a gay perform straight acts, will you consider him a gay still?<br><br>the point abt condemning the acts but not the people is "hypocritical"..</div>

My emphasis is the PERSON. I dun care what a person call himself, be it gay or homosexual, I am only disagreeing with the act/attitude/belief.
