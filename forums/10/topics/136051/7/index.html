Why do gays need to wait till 35 before owning a "2nd hand" flat? Even when they have found a lifetime partner? Further, both gays must be above 35 to participate in the "joint single program" for the purchase.<br><br>And the issues related to "Will". All gays need to draft a "explicit" will to make sure that their assets are correctly passed on to their other half. Or else, the partner will not be getting anything, even if they have help contribute to the purchase of it.<br><br>These are just 2 issues faced.

            <div class='col-md body'>I read this from fridae:<br><br>"... on 17 October 1998 in a Methodist church one Saturday afternoon during a seminar on the Bible and homosexuality. Needless to say, the theologians speaking at the seminar Â– which had no woman or gay speaker Â– stated quite categorically that homosexual relationships are sinful. Two things struck me that afternoon. Firstly I wondered why those theologians didnÂ’t instead choose to hold a seminar on teenage abortion or divorce which seem more pressing issues in our society. Secondly it hit me hard that a bunch of religious leaders who stood there supposedly Â“condemning the sin but arguing for the love of the sinnerÂ” never ever thought of spending even five minutes to pray for the grieving family of Matthew Shepard. Shepard, who had been mentioned by one of the speakers, had been brutally pistol-whipped and strung out to die with his hands stretched out like a cross by two Bible-quoting men just five days before this seminar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard). Needless to say the arguments presented did not convince me."<br><br>Checked on the mattew shepard news..<br><br><strong>"Matthew Shepard (December 1, 1976 Â– October 12, 199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> was a college student who was brutally tortured and murdered in a hate crime. Shepard, a student at the University of Wyoming, was robbed and attacked by two men near Laramie, Wyoming on the night of October 6Â–October 7 because of his homosexuality. Shepard died from his wounds several days later. His killers are currently in prison."</strong><br><br>This is the hatred I was talking about earlier.. This might not have anything to do with Christianity.. But if the church continues to preach that Homosexuality is a sin, such things will continue to happen.. Common folks will have this belief that they have the rights to "stone" the sinner..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Will attach the entire wikipedia article.. Quite a good read: One para demonstrates how intolerant is the church against gays.. they do not even give shepard the fianl rest even at his funeral..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>is this what the religion of "love" is all about?<br><br><strong>The attack<br>Shepard, a 21-year-old, met Aaron James McKinney and Russell Arthur Henderson in a bar. After he confided to them that he was gay, they deceived him into leaving with them in their car. He was robbed, severely beaten, tied to a fence and left to die. McKinney and Henderson also found out his address, intending to burgle his home. Shepard was discovered 18 hours later, alive and unconscious.<br><br>Shepard's suffered from a fracture from the back of his head to the front of his right ear. He also had catastrophic brain stem damage, which affected his body's ability to regulate heartbeat, body temperature, and other vital signs. There were also about a dozen small lacerations around his head, face and neck. His injuries were deemed too severe for doctors to operate. Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full life support. He died at 12:53 a.m. on October 12 at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado.<br><br>The blood on Shepard's face had been partly washed away by tears, indicating that he had been conscious for some time after the beating. He had been pistol-whipped 18 times with a .357-caliber revolver.<br><br>Police arrested McKinney and Henderson shortly thereafter, finding the bloody gun as well as the victim's shoes and credit card in their truck. The two murderers had attempted to get alibis from their girlfriends.<br><br>[edit]<br>The trial<br>It is believed that McKinney and Henderson had posed as homosexuals in order to trick Shepard into trusting them. During court cases both of the defendants used varying stories to defend their actions. Most notably they used the "gay panic defense", arguing that they were driven to temporary insanity by Shepard's alleged homosexual advances towards them. At another point they stated that they had only wanted to rob Shepard, and never intended to kill him.<br><br>Henderson pleaded guilty on April 5, 1999 and agreed to testify against McKinney to avoid the death penalty; he received two consecutive life sentences, without the possibility of parole. The jury in McKinney's trial found him guilty of first degree murder. As it began to deliberate on the death penalty, Shepard's parents brokered a deal, resulting in McKinney also receiving two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. Shepard's parents stated, "We are giving him life in the memory of one who no longer lives" (local Roman Catholic clerics garnered considerable publicity when they stridently opposed the death penalty in the case). Since being imprisoned, McKinney and Henderson have both attempted to justify their actions by claiming that they were dictated by the Bible.<br><br>[edit]<br>The aftershock<br>The heavy media coverage of Shepard's death brought issues of homophobia and gay-bashing to the forefront of public debate.<br><br>People in the entertainment industry expressed their own outrage and responded in various ways to the hate represented by the attacks. Actress Ellen DeGeneres hosted Shepard's memorial services in Washington, D.C. where she said that her coming out of the closet shortly before the attacks was "to keep this type of thing from happening". Lesbian singer Melissa Etheridge wrote the song "Scarecrow" in a tribute to Shepard, referring to his initially being mistaken for a scarecrow when he was found. Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote the song "American Triangle" a tribute to Shepard. It was featured on John's 2001 album, Songs from the West Coast. The fence upon which Shepard was tied and left to die has been declared a nationally protected monument. The rock band Thursday, also played a song named "M. Shepard" about the incident and the reason society let it happen. Two films were made about the story of Shepard: The Laramie Project (based on the play of the same name) and The Matthew Shepard Story. Both won numerous awards. Matthew Shepard can also be seen in the documentary Dear Jesse, in a brief interview.<br><br>The anti-gay Rev. Fred Phelps and his supporters picketed Shepard's funeral, as well as the trial of his assailants. They displayed signs typical of their protests, with slogans such as "Matt Shepard rots in Hell", "AIDS Kills Fags Dead", and "God Hates Fags". Phelps has since made attempts to gain a city permit to build a monument "of marble or granite 5 or 6 feet in height" on which will be a bronze plaque bearing Shepard's picture and the words: "MATTHEW SHEPARD, Entered Hell October 12, 1998, in Defiance of God's Warning: 'Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination.' Leviticus 18:22."<br><br>As a counterprotest during Henderson's trial, Romaine Patterson, a friend of Shepard's, organised a group of individuals who assembled in a circle around the Phelps group wearing white robes and gigantic wings that literally blocked the protesters (who were confined to a small protest square by police) from the view of passers-by. While the organisation had no name in the initial demonstration, it has since been ascribed various titles, including 'Angels of Peace' and 'Angel Action'.<br><br>A similar angel tactic has been reused a number of times at other protests by Phelps, but less effectively as the "Angels" are now required to stay in their own separate protest square.<br><br>Matthew's parents Judy and Dennis are now active supporters of gay rights and tolerance educators.<br><br>The Shepard case prompted President Bill Clinton to renew attempts to extend federal hate crime legislation to include gays, women and the disabled. These efforts were rejected by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in 1999.</strong><br><br></div>

By preaching vehemently against sinful acts (abortion, gay sex, etc) it unwittingly puts those people who carry out such acts in danger from religious extremists. Those who gunned down abortion doctors or homosexuals because of their sinfulness are no different from the Al-Qaeda group or Iran's Guardian Council.</div>

Catholics do not adore Mary, we only venerate her. One must only adore God. It is a sin to adore Mary.<br><br>How can you possibly try to separate Jesus' divine nature from his human nature? He is both Man and God.<br><br>To separate Jesus' divine person from his human person is heresy! And this was already heard of in the 5th Century. It was Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, who denied Mary the title of Theotokos (Greek: "God-bearer" or, less literally, "Mother of God"). Nestorius claimed that she only bore ChristÂ’s human nature in her womb, and proposed the alternative title Christotokos ("Christ-bearer" or "Mother of Christ").<br><br>Catholic theologians recognized that NestoriusÂ’s theory would fracture Christ into two separate persons (one human and one divine, joined in a sort of loose unity), only one of whom was in her womb. The Church reacted in 431 with the Council of Ephesus, defining that Mary can be properly referred to as the Mother of God, not in the sense that she is older than God or the source of God, but in the sense that the person she carried in her womb was, in fact, God incarnate ("in the flesh").</div>
