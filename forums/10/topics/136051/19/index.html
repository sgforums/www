I believe all societies believed that the world was flat until somebody travelled in one direction and ended up in the same place.<br><br>The german people elected hitler to power, the german was suffering and they thought the treaty which ended ww1 was not fair to them, were they oppressed, yes, by the winners of WW1, not by the nazis!! but, what is the point??<br><br>Surely there were some wrong beliefs but many old beliefs and values remains part of society till today, it was thought right in the past, and it is still right now. filial piety is the right relationship between parents and children and it is still the right relationship now. Marriage was and is the right relationship between a man and a woman, who are united into one unit family for further extension of the society.
