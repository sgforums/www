            <div class='col-md body'>today I very free. Did more research based on local context. Most of these articles were written by christian gays..<br><br><strong>1. Letter by Clarence Singham to the Straits Times:<br><br>I refer to the letter from George Lim (Govt Should Rethink Hiring of Gays) in the Straits Times dated 15 July.<br><br>I am Christian and I am gay. I have never been addicted to pornography, never been sexually abused and had a loving father and mother as well as other strong male relatives in my life. My family knows I am gay. They love and respect my partner and I because we strive to be filial, to care for them and to lead productive and decent lives. The gender of my partner is irrelevant to their esteem for us.<br><br>The argument that the Bible condemns homosexuality merely represents the view of one segment of the Christian world. There are many others, both gay and straight, who can see a full reconciliation between homosexuality and the Christian faith. The favorite scripture texts that are often used to clobber homosexuals, such as the Sodom and Gomorrah and Romans verses, have long been captive to the narrow, and some would assert, distorted interpretations of one sector of the Christian church. To make strident religious assertions without a fair consideration of alternative views, runs counter to our society's multi religous ethos and is plain prejudice.<br><br>Appealing to doomsday type arguments about the fall of empires, implying that gay individuals are like viruses to be eliminated and suggesting that accepting gays will mortally endanger our children is simplistic and frightening. Simplistic because in one fell swoop it asserts that complex phenomena are brought about by one culprit who is to be demonised and disenfrenchised. Frightening because it is arguments like these that fueled the mass extermination of a race, of homosexuals and other "undesirables" in Nazi "Christian" Germany. Such polemics merely instill fear and irrational emotionalism. They falsely suggest that the road to greater security and happiness requires excising those who are different from us.<br><br>To insist that morality is black and white, even Christian morality, is to be blind to the complexities of morality and life. Only people who are able to develop a highly selective morality based on their own prejudices can say that moral issues are so clear cut. Does Mr Lim intend for the Government prohibit all divorced individuals from ever marrying again? What about banning women from holding positions of authority over men? And while we are at it let's sack every heterosexual who engages in oral sex or practices masturbation shall we? After all, these are some of the so-called black and white moral stances that people have held not too long ago.<br><br>It is high time we recognise that we live in a world whose complexity calls us to base our lives and morals on broad principles of respect, reflexivity and relationship. Respect because we need to give others due space to live their lives to their highest potential. Reflexivity because we are fallible human beings who need to regulalry interrogate our assumptions and beliefs about others who are different. Relationship because we need to harness our diversity and similarities to build a resilient nation. Let's make this nation one that is able to handle the incredible complexities we will be facing in the years to come and not hide behind the guise of religion to justify our insecurities, prejudices and unfounded fears.</strong><br><br>source:http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2003/yax-324.htm<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>My letter to the Straits Times<br>(source:http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2003/yax-324.htm)<br><br>I refer to the letter by George Lim Heng Chye, "Govt should rethink hiring of gays" (ST 15 July 2003).<br><br>He writes of homosexuality as a sin, and, in the example that he uses, places gay people in the company of criminals, gangsters and hooligans.<br><br>Mr Lim writes from the perspective of his religion. Each Singaporean is free to believe in whatever religion he wishes, but at the same time, we should remember that this is a secular state. No religion should expect the state to enforce its particular morality or code of conduct, least of all on those who arenÂ’t of that religion.<br><br>There is no majority religion in Singapore; in fact, many Singaporeans declare themselves as free-thinkers. Mr Lim made an appeal to "the majority of the public" to make known its disapproval. First of all, it is doubtful what majority Mr Lim has assumed, but more importantly, a state has to hold itself to higher standards of human liberty and dignity.<br><br>As an example, for many generations, even now, many Singaporeans held prejudices against interracial marriage. But it has never been the business of the state to yield to baser instincts and ban them. Instead the state remains colour-blind and respects the individualÂ’s choice of life partner.<br><br>Mr Lim says that the government has lost its moral authority by hiring gay persons. Others, on the other hand, might argue that a government would lose its moral authority if it discriminated against a section of its own citizens.<br><br>It is chilling when Mr Lim says there is no greyness between white and black, and that morality is absolute. He is free to subscribe to such absolutist ideas if he wishes, but in practical terms, managing a country necessarily means balancing various shades of grey.<br><br>Also, in practical terms, where does SingaporeÂ’s future lie? We have no choice but to be part of a wider world. As a small country, we have to compete with every resource we have. The world out there is diverse and we need to be open-minded and tolerant if we want to interact successfully with it. We also need every individual and more -- thus the need for foreign talent -- to do his best for Singapore. To exclude a significant part of the available talent pool, local and foreign, on the basis of an absolutist mindset is the surest way to diminish our future.<br></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Vernon Voon's letter to the Straits Times:<br><br>I am homosexual man, not married to any woman and without any children, homosexual or heterosexual. I am also a Methodist and have no problems balancing my religion with my sexuality.<br><br>I read with interest the articles which appeared in yesterday's Forum section of your newspaper, especially the one titled "Govt should rethink hiring of gays". It spells a lot of misconceptions which I would take pains to correct.<br><br>The writer says "love the sinner, hate the sin" and lumps gays with criminals, gangsters and hooligans. But the differentiating factor is that all the other 3 categories of people cause harm to other people against their consent. Gays don't do that. There are verses in the Bible that seem to condemn homosexual behaviour, but they are increasingly coming under attack among religious circles as referring to a cultural context where paganism was rife, and admonition of all sexual acts other than those solely for procreation was imperative, in order to curb idolatry and spread the Christian message of the supremacy of God.<br><br>As for the government losing moral authority by its position, it is my humble opinion that they have actually gained it. By showing that they are an equal opportunity employer where the only thing that matters in your job is your competence and your skills, they have shown the way forward to being a true cosmopolitan society, where people can live, work and play regardless of their race, sex, or sexuality.<br><br>And finally, the writer seems to be convinced that homosexuality arises from nurture and not nature. The jury is still out on this point, I'm afraid. Tests are inconclusive as to whether the root cause of homosexual behaviour is nature, or nurture, or a combination of both.<br><br>But suffice to say that many homosexuals find they cannot change, and many have suffered and fallen short of their true identity in trying to do so. They deny their basic need to love and be loved, and get married to people &gt; only to hurt them later by the inability to form a close emotional and sexual union, or worse.<br><br>PM Goh's views, be it personal, that homosexuality is genetic, is a real breath of fresh air in the current debate. It has made me that much more assured in my identity as a gay Singaporean. Here, a senior statesman, has put his foot down and said, "Hey, to me, being gay's natural. Sure, society can't accept it at first, but give them time." Nothing can be more empowering and more healing to a community long cast aside as the refuse of society. </strong><br><br>source:http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2003/yax-324.htm<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Louis Sung's letter to the Straits Times:<br><br>I refer to the letter by Mr George Lim Heng Chy, titled 'Govt should rethink hiring of gays' dated 15 July 2003.<br><br>I find Mr Lim's argument simplistic, self-moralising and not well thought through. Let me numerate my reasons.<br><br>He quoted 'Love the sinner, hate the sin'. This is simply a thinly veiled hypocritical manner of saying 'please change your behaviour and actions to suit my moral/religious views.' Mr Lim seems to forget that this world is made up of a whole spectrum of people of diverse religious/ethical views. What makes him so sure that his is the be-all and end-all that would lead to a well-lived life?<br><br>What is even more simple-minded - no, laughable - is when he said 'there is no greyness between black and white. White is white and black is black. There is no relativity in morality.' How about a poor son who has to steal in order to feed his feeble, impoverished parents? Is that black or white? On the one hand, he is fulfilling his filial piety by stealing, which is a virtue we would extol; yet stealing is clearly wrong. Isn't this a grey area that requires subtle ethical consideration? Kant's categorical imperative - or absolute moral right - has long been debunked in philosophy. I would advise Mr Lim to read up on relevant texts before making such simplistic conclusion.<br><br>Then there is Mr Lim's claim of 'corrupting and subtle influences of such a lifestyle'. According to survey, perhaps one in ten person is born gay. Need I point out the amount of crimes and cheating on wives done by heterosexual men? All you have to do is flip open the Wanbao and Shin Min, and you see heterosexual couples cheating on one another, fighting, bickering. Why doesn't Mr Lim consider such ill-considered behaviour a 'corrupting' influence on his children's conduct? By sheer law of statistics, the chances a child being 'corrupted' by a heterosexual is nine tenth of that compared to that of a homosexual!<br><br>Scientific research has long since established that brain structure of gays and lesbians are different from that straights. Yet Mr LIm claims that they are such because of being sexually abused, from a single parent family or being 'addicted to pronography'. I would like to know where Mr Lim obtains such sterling research materials and their sources. Using his terms of argument re: porn, why then straight men don't turn sexual maniacs? And pray don't tell me straight men don't read pornography; a simple search on the internet would reveal a vast amount of straight pornography!<br><br>More importantly, would we discriminate against someone born with diabetes? colour blind-ness? dyslexia? So why discriminate against people who are born gay or lesbian? If one doesn't discriminate against the former but the latter, wherein lies the logic?<br><br>As for 'history has shown time and again that great empires fell because of failing human values and shaky moral principles', let me point out Alexander the Great, Plato, Leonardo da Vinci, Michaelangelo etc etc were all gay. They had contributed a great deal to western civilisation, be it conquest, science and the arts whose benefits last to these days. By Mr Lim's argument, they should long have been banished to obscurity and culture would have been poorer for that.<br><br>Mr Lim quoted Christianianity and Islam; if he would only read the great Chinese classics, 'Dream of the Red Chamber', he would find that homosexuality was accepted as part of daily life. So why are we imposing foreign monotheistic values on ourselves, and not open our hearts to accepts values from our as well as other cultures?<br><br>It is such narrow-mindedness that has earned Singapore in the international community the reputation as a draconian state. PM Goh is enlightened enough to relax the rules and more power to him. We are living in the 21st century. Let us not regress because of short-sightedness. Otherwise Singapore would really become what Mr Lim predicted, one of a 'great empires [that] fell'.</strong><br><br>source:http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2003/yax-324.htm</div>

If you are interested to know why, go and study theology.<br><br>I don't expect you to think that the bible makes sense to you but that's no reason to ridicule another person's holy book.<br><br><blockquote>just do a simple internet search and you will find many gay christians ard.. they love god as much as any of the straights..</blockquote>.<br><br>Majority of christians will not agree with that...the bible says you cannot love God without obedience. Gay Christians are therefore living in sin and by no stretch of imagination can they be said to love God:<br><br>"This is love for God: to obey his commands...." (1 Jn 5:3)<br><br><blockquote>no one had clearly articulated why is homosexuality amoral? </blockquote>.<br><br>Because the bible condemns it in the strongest possible terms:<br><br>"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." Lev 20:13<br><br>"In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion" (Rom 1:27)<br><br>For Christians, if God condemns it, it is condemned...period.<br><br><blockquote>do you think your statement of just stay in your bedroom ever be justified?  </blockquote>.<br><br>Just be thankful you don't live in a Muslim country. If you are convicted of homosexuality, you can be stoned to death. Isn't it better to keep it in the bedroom then?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by earthlings73:</div><div class="quote_body">1) uhuh.. certain laws as stated in the book of leviticus (which is part of bible) can be ignored.. which means the book does not make sense out of context.. aren't you slapping yourself on your face? if the bible is indeed the word of god, do u think he will leave it to chance? so whatever happens before jesus can be ignored? if it can be ignored, why passed it down as part of the bible, which u have claimed that it's the truth that will withstand the test of time..<br></div></blockquote>The old testament, as part of the Bible, tells us who God is, how he created heaven and earth, his walk with his chosen people, the israelites, and more importantly tells us clearly that the coming of jesus christ to save the world was prophesized and it is God's plan! With Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection, man, no longer need to offer burnt sacrifices (example) to atone our sins to get close to God. But immorality remains immorality, God has not changed the definition. May be you think that if God change the definition of morality and sin then man will not sin anymore. NO! God is the Holy God and will never accept what is sinful. That is why he sent his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to atone the sins for all mankind so that we can be reconcilled with him.<br><br>I accept God and the Bible in faith. If you want to have better understanding of the Bible and God, as Oxford Mushroom said, go to the theological college.<br>I am not qualified to explain but I do know that many things, like the Holiness of God and God's standards of morality, are not subjects for discussion. It is either you accept it or not.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>2) those people who quoted the paragraph you had quoted usually conveniently ignore the paragraph that precedes it..<br><br>[b]"21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. "</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Not sure what you are trying to say with these few verses. To me, these verses tell us that God's wrath is on man because man knew there is God but do not gloriy him as God. Instead, man worshipped idols made in the form of man, birds.... That is why many christian (non catholic) churches put no statues of anykind in the church, except a wooden cross as a symbol of our salvation. God is against worshipping of idols.<br><br>What have we ignored?<br><blockquote><strong><br>just do a simple internet search and you will find many gay christians ard.. they love god as much as any of the straights.. but then, why did god still make them homosexuals? why can't they change?</strong></blockquote>Why God made them homosexuals? sometimes I want to ask God why was I born so ugly? Do they really want to change? or do they think that as long as they are filial to their parents, love God, then God will ACCEPT their behaviors as not sinful???<br>Since they accept God and call themselves Christians, it is up to them to reconcile their behavior with God. We can only pray for them.<br><blockquote><strong><br>3) and till now, no one had clearly articulated why is homosexuality amoral? christians have this tendency to equate homosexuality as murder or rape (which u had clearly articulated in your earlier post). But we know that murder and rape imply to infringement of another person's rights or body.. why the fear of homosexuals? most homosexuals seek out within own circle.. (less than maladjusted ones as mentioned in one of my earlier posts) so how can homosexuals be immoral when they do not infringe on other's rights?</strong></blockquote>Homosexual is a sin against God, nothing to do with any other's rights. Oxford Mushroom is quite clear on this and I will not add.<br><blockquote><strong><br>4) the blacks suffered from discrimination for a long while.. if they do not fight for their equal rights.. do you think your statement of just stay in your bedroom ever be justified? homosexuals, like straights, need to work, need to form adaptive relationship with a partner, need entertainment, etc, etc.. unless your perception of gays is that of someone who just live to enjoy sex, your point doesn't stand.. and if that's indeed your view, I would encourage you to get to know some gay friends.. u will start to realise that they are like you, in almost any other way, except that they are attracted to the same gender..<br></strong></blockquote> I hope the blacks are not insulted by your comparing their fights for civil equality to your fight for rights to homosexuality.<br><br>I only have two friends who appear to be gays. I never ask them if they have sex with man, women, children or what. We shared happy moment, together as a group on many things. They are like anyone of us, they just did not show their tendency in front of us. They probably know that certain things is best kept to themselves. We respect their need for privacy and they respect our stand on moral standard.<br></div>
