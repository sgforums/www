For those women in the past who fought for equal rights, their situation/predicament might be thousands time more in peril and jeapardy than the (singapore) gays now. I mebbe generalising, but I think gays in singapore, most of them educated, earning good income, cannot be compared to women in the past who worked long hours for measly pay, no education and subjected to beatings by their husbands. Hence this is not a good comparison.<br><br>For (singapore) gays, lives goes on even when the marriage constitution remained unchanged. They can still have lovers and live the lives they want. They can rent/buy private apartments and build love nests. Nobody's stopping them. But for women of that time, it maybe a "Life-And-Death " situation. </div></blockquote>i think u're missing the point that this is all about human rights. About being discriminated against just because u're different. It has nothing to do with poor conditions. And what makes u think its not a life and death situation for gays? Maybe u're viewing it in the context of singapore, but do u know how often gay people get targeted for assault just because of their sexuality overseas? I know of at least a couple of deaths in London itself because the victim was gay. So tell me its not maybe a "life n death" situation for gays then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>like i said, YOUR problem is that ure unwilling to recognise gays have a right to equal human rights as much as any heterosexual person, instead u see recognising their right to equal human rights as a privilege.

            <div class='col-md body'>1. I said if he appears in front of my eyes I will definitely believe in it. But when u offer other forms of convincing evidence I will believer in it as well. U say evolution has some missing links. Why don't u tell me wat tese missing links r ? Perhaps they had ben answered but some christian website just become ignorant to it<br><br>A: So u agree there are missing links in evolution? Why not u research into it and tell me, since u are more of a science person than me. Science is not my forte.<br><br>2. As said before, unless u r talking about religion, old laws or conflicts caused by the bible, there really isn't much histotrical truth in it. Why don't u tell me which scientiific or historical paper treat the content as truth ?<br><br>A: Historians are taking the bible seriously for historical studies. U can read for urself in those online academic journals by doing a search.<br><br>3. Instead of syaing I am biased, u might as well say u r naive to simply belieev in everything people tell u. As said before every religion has some believers seeing some form of their deity power. But they can't be all true since all these religion r exclusive. Why don't u answer on tis point ? Tere r many people who say tat after praying to guan yin then their sickness become better. SO does tat means guan yin is definitely right and your god becomes definitely wrong ? Why don't u answer on tis point to see how incredulous your argument on placing emphasis on testimonies<br><br>A: Who would simply believe everything what pple tell u? Is there anyone around u who did that? Why dun u find out for urself what is true/false testimonies, and not say everything is false?<br><br>4. Maybe it is wiser for u to tell me where have I read wrongly. Perhaps u r the oen tat seems to read wrongly because u conveniently forget the chapters tat make christianity absurb<br><br>A: The reasons why u think it is absurb becoz u read selectively, particularly verses from the old testament. When one studies the bible as a whole, everything is in fact in harmony.<br><br>5. If the bible is written by satan, he is prophesized about the end for his opponent/opposition, which may very well be your "loving and just "god. There is no contradiction here. U just need to think all the while God is actually the devil himelf but the satan is actually the loving and just god. However being good doesn;t mean they win and as such the one writing the account may turn out to be a cruel, harsh unreasonable violent god which is really wat the bible described god as.<br><br>A: Disagree with u. Like wat I have said, Satan will not prophesize his own defeat in the bible.<br><br>6. Have u read on your god deeming EVERYBODY as living in sin and unrepentent ? When has he ever say anyone deserves living ? IS tis grace ? Is killing everyone grace ?<br><br>A: That was in the past when god sends disasters upon men for sins. Why dun u read more about why these wicked pple were being punished? I am sure the stories of Sodom and Gommorrah will interest u more.<br><br>7. Then wat is your definition of omnipotent ? If he can't do tis, then surely he is no omni potent and he is powerless to do a lot of things. See people giving a chance to repent ? like who ? Repent on wat ? To become wat ? Wat significance does tat do ? When u r borned u have sinned. Doesn't tat show his idea of sin is ridiculous and faulty. Why is there a difference when crhist come ? Did he ever say there r no more punishment ? So god change his mind regularly ? He is one type before mose, then he change after moses and now he change again after christ. HE can't make up his mind ?<br><br>A: I will not put god in a box and judge how/what he can do. Why is there a difference when Christ come? Becoz what Christ did on the cross has a past/present/continuous effect. The new covenant was given when Christ said:Â”It is doneÂ”, hence no more punishment. Clear and simple. I wouldnÂ’t say God canÂ’t make up his mind, but see it as his plan for men.<br><br>8. Then wat is the use of adam ? Why don't u specifically tell me why does he want adam to tend his garden ? Who says he is omni potent ? He say it himself, not me. About chrits coming to fulfil, don;t u read tat after he say "fulfil: he said tat ALL LAWS of OT R MEANT TO be ETERNAL ? He say the laws r to be kept and the one who doesn't r the least favourable in his eye. All the things abotu grace etc r mention by, well, people. Jesu never state tat men can do anythign they want nor mention anything about grace.<br><br>A: Read closely againÂ….he said: Â“I came not to abolish, but to FULFILLÂ…Â” Who can fulfill? Only Christ can. Can men keep all these laws by himself? Obviously not, without godÂ’s grace. U are right in saying that Jesus never state men can do anything though, becoz the wicked will still be punished. Â“GraceÂ” has appeared in many parts of the bible. Use www.biblegateway.com to help u find.<br><br>9. Did I ever say ALL wars r caused by religious conflicts ? I say A LOT, or a HIGH PERCENTAGE tat a conflict arises because of religious<br><br>A: So does it show religion is the root of wars? No! It is only one of the causes...the US dun invade Iraq becoz it is Christian, it invades becoz it wants oil.....<br><br>10. Isn't there such thing as government ophanage ? IS there any religion involve in tis ? U see the caste class in india, but isn't the secular gov who is the one tat give the most help to these people ? How about christian treatment to people such as "pagans", slaves, jews and muslim in the past ? Perhaps for now, how about women, homosexual and possible left handed ?<br><br>A: Yes there are government orphanages, but who did the most? Religious organizations, especially Christian ones. I have definitely not seen a orphanage opened by a 'society of atheists' or a 'church of atheist". If the secular gov can give the most help to these pple, then they will not be doing jobs like shit removers. I read that there is even a lower caste than the untouchables washing their clothes for them. Once again, do not judge Christ by judging what Christians did in the past. There are tyrants and oppressors who are atheists too, u should know very well. All are sinners, including Christians and Atheists.<br></div>

Does that mean that women's rights and racial rights are a privilege? That is a fallacy. The fact that gay rights is starting to emerge in our society now is more due to the fact that we're undergoing social evolution brought about by improving education. It has nothing to do with people being bored, just to do with people being more enlightened. Just because we're taking note of something we neglected in the past due to ignorance doesn't justify labelling it as a privilege. Like i said, bigotry at its best</div>

I think there is a very strong link indeed. U might not want to face the truth that there ARE people who assault others without provocation, simply because others are different, but that Is the truth. OF course u would like to be able to pin even part of the blame on gays, but its is not me who is generalising, but it is u who is being unfair.

It would be god tempting Christ in the desert then, not satan.<br><br>6. Then where is grace ? Is killing everyone grace ? U say everyone is sinner and he probably is gonna kill u like he did to sodom and gommorrah. As said before, he find EVERYONE evil, and unattractive to his eyes.

Then it proabbly means u believe blindly god is a loving and caring god when in reality he is something tat changes his mind frequently and treat peopel differently. He tell different thigns to peopel in the past and because of tat they live their life differently. It is easy to say "past present and future" effect but the past had already being gone and he had in a sense, ill treated these people from the past.
