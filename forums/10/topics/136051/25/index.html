All u can say is its wrong. but the proof u've offered is subjective. its not based on solid physical evidence. wherelse we've time and time again pointed out that homosexuality is evident in nature among animals, so it is certainly a natural thing. also, it was widely prevalent in many ancient societies and civilizations. these are irrefutable proof that homosexuality is naturally occuring and NOT wrong. U simply just keep ignoring the same evidence which has been presented again n again that i wonder if u aren't blind.<br><br>once again i will say that i am not saying that ALL of society has to be homosexual. I believe it is only natural for any society to consist of both homosexuals and heterosexuals. A society with only homos will die out due to lack of reproduction, BUT a society with only heterosexuals will in time grow at an alarming rate until it can no longer sustain itself, and then it WILL decend into anarchy, and self-destruct.</div>

It's the belief that heterosexual or mixed sex relationships are somehow better than same sex relationships.<br><br>It's the belief that only straight people should be allowed to marry or raise families. It's the idea that lesbian, gay and bisexual people are demanding "special status" when they ask for basic civil rights such as the right to safety at work, in the home or on the street. Heterosexism allows straight couples to walk down the street holding hands, whilst same sex couples are accused of "flaunting" their sexuality by doing the same thing.<br></div>

From the book of genesis in the bible which is self-explanatory:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1 Genesis:<br><br>26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, <strong>and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." </strong><br><br>27 So God created man in his own image,<br>in the image of God he created him;<br><strong>male and female he created them.</strong><br><br>28 God blessed them and said to them, <strong>"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground." </strong><br><br>29 Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the groundÂ—everything that has the breath of life in itÂ—I give every green plant for food." And it was so.<br><br>31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morningÂ—the sixth day.</span><br><br>In 2 Genesis:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">18 The LORD God said, <strong>"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</strong><br><br>19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field.<br><br><strong>But for Adam [h] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs [i] and closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib [j] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. </strong><br><br>23 The man said,<br>"This is now bone of my bones<br>and flesh of my flesh;<br>she shall be called 'woman, [k] '<br>for she was taken out of man."<br><br><strong>24 For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. </strong><br><br>25 The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</span><br><br><strong>In my view, Adam, Eve and the serpent are all equally at fault for disobeying GOD and challenging his authority, which is why all three were given their due punishment. All three have a active part to play in men's fall from grace, neither of them can blame the others more. From verses 18-24 above, we know that GOD's will for man is to have a woman as his helper and companion, and this stand remain unchanged throughout the whole bible. </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In 3 genesis:<br><br>8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"<br><br>10 He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."<br><br>11 And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"<br><br>12 The man said, "The woman you put here with meÂ—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."<br><br>13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"<br>The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."<br><br><strong>14 So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this,<br>"Cursed are you above all the livestock<br>and all the wild animals!<br>You will crawl on your belly<br>and you will eat dust<br>all the days of your life.<br><br>15 And I will put enmity<br>between you and the woman,<br>and between your offspring [a] and hers;<br>he will crush [b] your head,<br>and you will strike his heel."<br><br>16 To the woman he said,<br>"I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing;<br>with pain you will give birth to children.<br>Your desire will be for your husband,<br>and he will rule over you."<br><br>17 To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,'<br>"Cursed is the ground because of you;<br>through painful toil you will eat of it<br>all the days of your life.<br><br>18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you,<br>and you will eat the plants of the field.<br><br>19 By the sweat of your brow<br>you will eat your food<br>until you return to the ground,<br>since from it you were taken;<br>for dust you are<br>and to dust you will return." </strong></span><br></div>

From the book of genesis in the bible which is self-explanatory:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1 Genesis:<br><br>26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, [b]and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." </span></strong><br><br>27 So God created man in his own image,<br>in the image of God he created him;<br><strong>male and female he created them.</strong><br><br>28 God blessed them and said to them, <strong>"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground." </strong><br><br>29 Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the groundÂ—everything that has the breath of life in itÂ—I give every green plant for food." And it was so.<br><br>31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morningÂ—the sixth day.<br><br>In 2 Genesis:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">18 The LORD God said, <strong>"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</strong><br><br>19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field.<br><br><strong>But for Adam [h] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs [i] and closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib [j] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. </strong><br><br>23 The man said,<br>"This is now bone of my bones<br>and flesh of my flesh;<br>she shall be called 'woman, [k] '<br>for she was taken out of man."<br><br><strong>24 For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. </strong><br><br>25 The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</span><br><br><strong>In my view, Adam, Eve and the serpent are all equally at fault for disobeying GOD and challenging his authority, which is why all three were given their due punishment. All three have a active part to play in men's fall from grace, neither of them can blame the others more. From verses 18-24 above, we know that GOD's will for man is to have a woman as his helper and companion, and this stand remain unchanged throughout the whole bible. </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In 3 genesis:<br><br>8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"<br><br>10 He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."<br><br>11 And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"<br><br>12 The man said, "The woman you put here with meÂ—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."<br><br>13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"<br>The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."<br><br><strong>14 So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this,<br>"Cursed are you above all the livestock<br>and all the wild animals!<br>You will crawl on your belly<br>and you will eat dust<br>all the days of your life.<br><br>15 And I will put enmity<br>between you and the woman,<br>and between your offspring [a] and hers;<br>he will crush [b] your head,<br>and you will strike his heel."<br><br>16 To the woman he said,<br>"I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing;<br>with pain you will give birth to children.<br>Your desire will be for your husband,<br>and he will rule over you."<br><br>17 To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,'<br>"Cursed is the ground because of you;<br>through painful toil you will eat of it<br>all the days of your life.<br><br>18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you,<br>and you will eat the plants of the field.<br><br>19 By the sweat of your brow<br>you will eat your food<br>until you return to the ground,<br>since from it you were taken;<br>for dust you are<br>and to dust you will return." </strong></span><br>[/b]</blockquote>you should now better than to quote me the bible. i do not trust the bible to be accurate, hence i reject your so-called evidence, because u cannot prove these writings are true or not.</div>
