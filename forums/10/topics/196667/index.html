            <div class='col-md body'>For example, how about replying to the following argument to change the present "autocratic leadership" to collective leadership offering accountability and good corporate governance checks and balances:-<br><br>A strong foundation is essential if not critical to put right what were wrong in our society.<br><br>Such a strong calls for in-depth philosophical socio-political conceptualisation of what constitute the primary forces of progress - is it leadership or is it motivation of the masses or facilitation of entrepreneurship and creativity.<br><br>The latter is diametrically alternative to the former. So far the former is the system handed down to citizens up to this date. Under leadership system of government, leaders regard themselves as supreme in ideas and concepts, insights or foresights which are not capable of accountability and mass participation and implementation.<br><br>Sad to say, ideas alone could only work to a certain degree. Leadership system is only good in hinting at foresights and insights and ideas but not very effective in implementations.<br><br>The alternative to leadership is mass participation but mass participation depends greatly and critically on democratisation, facilitation and empowerment. The latter was diametrically opposed to leadership as leadership is often a closed system unable to open up to scrutiny and accountable processes.<br><br>Accountability processes lead to empowerment and mass participation. Democratisation is a facilitator for mass participation where the most able are chosen by results and effectiveness and knowledge application in the actual works and performances not assumptions based on academic abilities measured at mid-teen to mid-20s.<br><br>Democracy holds the promise for mass participation where every citizen is given a level playing field to prove his or her worth based on results not predestined to lower subsistence.<br><br>Processes hold the key. Toyota Production system and many others allow the whole company to become successful and not just the CEOs or the board.<br><br>Our leaders are too self-centred and too proud to admit their fundamental errors about assumptions made on leadership. They have to open up and allow more ordinary people to prove their worth in every field and let real contributions come from every one so that there will be greater knowledge application throughout all sectors and not just the limited talents defined by their narrow perception.<br><br>At the micro-level every one will compete on entrepreneurship depending on factors like diligence, energy, passion and these will be facilitated by a government which understand mass participation and how results are obtained and not by the present closed-system leadership.<br><br>The next wave of progress for Singapore will quite unlikely to come from leadership as practised to date here or any tweaking of autocracy to make it look democracy at work.<br><br>The next wave of progress for Singapore will not come from any cultural or free-market factors as these are not being supported by a free-market lighter regulation environment.<br><br>The opening up or loosening of accountable governing processes will allow more people of practical and proven abilities to come forward and to take a shot at the existing exclusive employment and business opportunities open only to scholars or elites of leaders' own choice which in many past cases did not seem to work.<br><br>We need a few elites and scholars specialised in certain areas of works but not all the elites to dominate the senior government or civil service employment and business opportunities with artificial controls, rules and impediments created by pro-leadership system.<br><br>Empowerment is the next most powerful tool of government after leadership and both must tango. It is the twain that never parts.<br><br></div>

Are such claims based on real hard facts or only something rhetorical, conceptual and based only on assumptions.<br><br>How about examining the leadership concept and assumption to see whether it has worked or will work better in the future?<br><br>What do our leaders want of our society? Do they want to build a society where people are given equal opportunities, without all the controls and regulations to suit their own narrow purposes of stability for their own party dominance. Are they able to build a more cohesive society free from all the tax-and-recover corporations to build the state surpluses thereby drying up the liquidity of the private sector economy?<br><br>Do our leaders recognise it is inherently wrong and immoral to double-charge people on lands and triple-charge them on vehicles as posted in other threads.<br><br>Or do our leaders define our objectives as including building of a more cohesive and economically equal society with level playing field for all?<br><br>Have our leaders undeer their concept and assumption of leadership after 40 years of so-called leadership brought about a better and more satifying life of the people. Instead, what we are seeing is the average wages of the lower 80% of workforce dropping 30 % from the 1980s/1990s and their property values dropping horribly by 30% (excluding interest) from their peak in 1994-1995.<br><br>They are continually being over-taxed, over-discriminated by pro-elite and pro-foreign job and investment policies based on leaders' assumptions of what work and what don't work.<br><br>Apart from the initial years from 1965 to 1970s, our leaders have achieved any significant leadership success such as in their ability to upgrade and restructure the earlier industrialisation strategy to one that is capable of competing with the bests or the better ones among Asian tigers, Finland and Switzerland.<br><br>After claiming such leadership talents and paying themselves million-dollar salaries have our leaders really made the impact as the most talented leaders with re-positioning of the economy to the next level of value-adding and technology-driven model as announced in 1990s?<br><br>The last two recessions basically saw our leadership-centred system sliding into a state of denial with a general despair as minister after minister kept telling the citizens they could not do anything about structural unemployments or competitions from China and India except to wait out for world recovery. They were full of advice to workers to restructure their skills, but kept mum about their lack of signal successes in the last two economic restructuring exercises.<br><br>Leaders must have been spending much time and public monies on the Economic Restructuring Exercises previously announced in the 1980s-1990s. What they have finally admitted during the last two recessions were these ER exercises could not work and workers had better to re-train themselves to avoid unemployments and massive retrenchments seen in the period 1997-2002. Their own Skill Retraining agencies like SPRING obviously confirmed in seminars which I attended that their skill retraining of workers did not work.<br><br>The leaders only recognised that top-down leadership would not work well for Singapore in the last two ERC recommendations. They only then recognised after so many years that leadership policies of all kinds could not work and there have to be freeing up of regulatory control environment to bring about greater entrepreneurship and greate economic competitiveness among the people.<br><br>I attended a "Management Excellence" workshop organised by SPRING in 2003 and asked the question: "Has SIA our icon management model of Singapore implemented any Management Excellence, processes but none of the officials present in this workshop were able to answer me this question.<br><br>I also asked: "Has the Singapore government succeeded in its skill trainings and re-training over the past many years?" claimed to be one of the leaders' major policy push for many years. SPRING officials present in that workshop admitted frankly that the skill program of the past 20 years have failed to work as desired.<br><br><blockquote>Quote:<br>Fact No 2: Democracy is not a motivative force for creativity and entrepreneurship. If it is creativity and entrepreneurship will be worthless commodity because they will be as common as the many democratic nations in the world! Creativity and entrepreneurship thrives out of needs and necessities not anything else. Idleness and complacency are the devil's workshops. </blockquote>Is the above-stated proposition that democracy will not bring about creativity or entrepreneurship based on facts or assumption? You have to substantiate such a statement. As far as logic goes, men's creativity and entrepreneurship work best when there are lesser controls to prevent them from achieving at their best. Democracy affords such freedoms of choices that enable and empower people to strive and thrive on their own individual bests in skills, businesses and professions.<br><br>The ERC recommendations for the period 1997-2002 included many proposals to free up unnecessary leadership-centred regulatory controls but up to now nothing has been heard of success or progress in implementation.<br><br><blockquote>Quote:<br>Fact No 3: There is no system that is totally free and can come out with anything good over short/long period of time. Even evolution theory postitulates evolutionary processess operates according to some rules without a controller/designer/architect (God) which spans millions of years to move in a certain direction(new species formed) Economists advocates free market mechanism but also need a govt to control by fiscal and monetary policies and other incentives.<br><br>I also wish that you are aware of the difference between soft creativity and hard creativity which is solely my understanding. Hard creativity are real stuff like scientific/technological discoveries invention and innovations and they really contribute to all people's welfare rich or poor. Soft creativity is the lesser and much easier to achieve (arts and literary ideas) and serve to bring satisfaction and estacy to human emotions and excitement who already have their stomachs filled. Freedom is a necessary but not the sufficient conditions for such soft creativity to flourish because if the persons are fettered with religious/political values they would not be able to espouse pornography/ic arts, obsene dance moves/songs/fashions/sports/etc. There is no such encroachment of ethics on scientific/technological research except on embryo research and rightly so. There is another very cheap but totally worthless creativity like just being different even no value added at all eg like spelling american/british spelling of some words, right/left hand drive, etc. </blockquote>In examining whether we need a continuing extrapolation of the past leadership autocratic system of governance or to open up the whole system to facilitate mass participation with leveling of playing fields to all citizens, we should not keep deceiving ourselves that leadership has worked. It has not worked too well since the 1970s when our long-awaited economic restructuring were largely deferred, postponed or shelved by respective ministers in charge.<br><br>If our ER plans of the 1990s have indeed worked we would have seen our overcoming some of the protracted problems with creativity, entrepreneuship of our own domestic sector of the economy which the government of late is only beginning to recognise.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Quote:<br>as posted at www.findSingapore.net/forumlife_science2 wrote:<br>The Straits Times, Friday, June 16, 2006<br><br>Why Partisan Upgrading Strategy should go<br><br>By Chua Mui Hoong, Deputy Political Editor<br><br>Recent comments over the votes-for-upgrading issue from government leaders are confusing to voters, but suggest there is more ambivalence to the issue.<br><br>It's not surprising that the signals have been so mixed, becasue it is one issue which politically beneficial to the ruling party from a party-political point of view, but which is pretty indefensible on any other grounds.<br><br>The issue throws into a sharp relief the dilemma the People's Action Prty Government faces:<br><br>---- between its desire as a political party to engage in partisan moves that help assure it of political longevity, and<br>------ its desire to be a government for all that aims to be "inclusive", bringing non-partisan elelments to advance the country together.  </blockquote>Leadership concept being such raison detre of our leaders, it is not a surprise that after 40 years, they still cannot forego their claim of such ability and cannot differentiate between leadership bias and what people really want.<br><br>It is common sense that people do not live by bread alone. People want to have a say and partake in diverse social, economic and cultural and religious activities as an integral part of nation building.<br><br>Through taking part in such activities afforded by a more accountable and committed government people will better realise their needs and aspirations in nation building.<br><br>Many people have already given their view that PAP should not be overly-pragmatic with their own interests or efficiency and be more rounded and balanced in governing the country.<br><br>People have already these views objectively from crisis to crisis, from forum to forum, from one election to another. But their views seem to have been completely overwhelmed and superseded by overly pragmatic government policy concerned only with its own economic gains and surpluses to the exclusion of every other important issue in nation building.<br><br>Such a state of narrow pragmatic governance has in small part been contributed by a compliant press that failed to report objectively being too wary over government's remonstrations over past criticism and the so-called crusading reporting by the press.<br><br>Just look at the type of forum letters published and rejected and make a comparison between the two. I myself have tested the editor's objectivity in choice of forum letters for publication but was sad to observe that where I have toned down disagreements with government, my letters had been published. Wherever I wrote on issues like "proposed review of the constitution" or criticising government on leadership and corporate governance my letters had been sidelined.<br><br>The press editors were simply too afraid or reluctant to publish opinions of the more direct and vocal challenges to existing policies of the government.<br><br>A more objective press would have concluded that people have objected to PAP's linking of estate upgrading to voting enticements long ago. But being a subservient press, such views were suppressed and made to look like a real problem which needs to be understood with hypocrtic choruses of the new MPs and ministers that "no party in the world" would server the opposition wards first. People do not agree with such PAP's view as it would be using the taxpayers' monies for its own party political purpose which is not right.<br><br>If I am not wrong, a public survey of some sort has indicated that Singaporeans do not rate bread and butter as no. 1 issue in voting and rather their concern is over accountability of government.<br><br>Government should reflect the people's wishes and aspirations and stop trying to analyse views subjectively and at the end cover up real issues and problems which have happened to postponing solutions to NKF problems for years.<br><br>As a world-class government, our leaders should know they should serve the citizens and not themselves or their party interest. They should quickly abandon all cooption, depolitisation and machination of the grassroot organisations and work for the interest of all citizens.<br><br>All estate's upgrading should be based on age and other objective criteria and not those ambivalent processes as mentioned by minister Mah Boh Tan.<br><br>The press should not be told to stop crusading for anyone when it is merely reflecting the wishes and aspirations of citizens or their views and criticisms which might be contrary to the wishes of the autocratic leaders.<br><br>The signal from the ground is: people are not too concerned with estate upgrading or bread and butter issues but wanted government to be fair and accountable and humble in serving people's needs and aspirations.<br><br>Instead, people has been sidestepped in all the press reporting with hardly any of their true views and desires expressed.<br><br>Under authoritarian rule, it has been the same "leader is right" and the same tax-and-corporatisation policy for years to recover all costs with much over-charging on essential services. That is why there was much uproad and uphappiness over the NKF's practice to create surpluses to no end.<br><br>It will be essential to understand where the real problem with our system is. Self-centredness affects the leadership system resulting in much hypocrisy.<br><br>It is essential for the press to marshall the courage and determination to be objective and not seek to cloud issues with hypocritic reports over and over without solutions. Finally if leadership can be improved with accountability and better service to the people, people will not doubt cooperate as long as the government is not reversing to tighter controls and autocracy which will only check on growth and vibrancy of the economy and uplifting of potential of the people.<br><br>In a society where the press is controlled, there will be skimping of issues and justifications of problems and prolonged delays in uncovering problems as seen in NKF.<br><br><blockquote>Quote:<br>Those who read political tea leaves think they discern different strands of thought on this issue among PAP leaders.<br><br>Some espy in Prime Minister Lee Hseien Loong glaimpses of potential "reformer" or at least change agent.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew is viewed as someone steeped in party battles of the past, who would not allow the PAP to embark on a path that may weaken its grip on power.<br><br>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong is known as a master tactician. He was, after all, the one who implemented the votes-for-upgrading strategy which helped the PAP stave off the slide of votes to the opposition for a decade.  </blockquote>Long long ago, had our press been independent, our government would have seen better light and realised the importance of practising good corporate governance. Today our press is still seen as serving the government and will only skirting real problems and issues instead of telling problems as they are. I do hope the press will take up this challenge.<br><br>It is the symptom of failure of the leadership system that they cannot practise good policies and ensure their well-executed implementations.<br><br>The use of taxpayers' monies for estate upgrading of all Singaporeans according to certain evaluation processes like age and obsolescence should have been settled long long ago and be referred to as a problem.<br><br>Now it is made to look like it is acceptable to upgrade PAP wards first with many politicians trying to put up justifications for such a narrow-minded immoral policy.<br><br>Common sense and Logic speak louder than anything else in this situation.<br><br>Under leadership system, Goh Chok Tong has been unable to make much changes to the pro-elite political structure which has only resulted in non-implementation of many good empowerments of the people. It is natural too that Lee Hsien Loong to be constrained by leadership expectation which is more a case of proving worth of the leadership and its talents and narrower interest of the one-party rule.<br><br>The change ahead is a big challenge, one requiring the leaders to embrace all Singaporeans to build a more inclusive and cosmopolitan society.<br><br>All the talk about building an open and accountable government will be of no use if our leader cannot change his fear about democracy or its likelihood of disorders and breakdown of society. PM Lee of late was seen to be reversing some of his own inauguration speeches made on this issue and is now questioning the western practices of democracy.<br><br>Many countries practising democracy and accountability have continuously been governed with success. Our leaders should look to such countries for role model and not be too afraid or paranoid about a few instances of lack of success in democratising the country.<br><br>Our leader should look at the possibility of supplementing or complimenting leadership and not let leadership override the whole system of governance as is being practised currently.<br><br><blockquote>Quote:<br>In the recent election, he and PAP candidates reviived the strategy for Hougand and Potong Pasir, promising $180 million of upgrading projects if voters tossed ou the opposition there and voted in the PAP. Voters did not bite the carrot offered.<br><br>But while indieividal PAP leaders may appear to have slightly different, nuanced positions on this issue, the truth is more likely to be that they were all in broad agreement over the votes-for-upgrading strategy in the 1997 and 2001 elections.<br><br>And if General Election 2006 was anything to go by, probably some top PAP leaders are now ambivalent about the strategy.<br><br>PM Lee said after the election the PAP had to review its stratey in oppoisiton wards and rethink how to win them back.<br><br>SM Goh praised Hougand and Potong Pasir voters for loyally sticking with their opposition incumbent MPs rather than "chasing after every goodie which we offer them".<br><br>Has the votes-for-upgrading strategy come to the end of its time?<br><br>The strategy has attracted controversy since it was first announced in 1992. This was then-prime minister Goh Chok Tong served notice that wards which supported the PAP would be given priority for then-highly popular programme to upgrade, or improve, Housing Board estates using government funds.<br><br>The announcement met with a negative response, and died down. In the 1997 General Election, however, it was revived and became a central plank of the PAP strategy.<br><br>Vote for the PAP, and your constituency will get ahead in the upgrading queue - was the message to voteers. On the eve of Polling Day in 1997, Mr Goh went one step further, saying the Government would look at voting patterns by precincts (each precinct is a cluster of about 10 to 20 HDB blocks) in deciding which neighbourhoods to upgrade first.<br><br>The votes-for-upgrading strategy was used in the 1997 and 2001 elections, helping the PAP romp home with 65 and 75 per cent of the votes respectively.<br><br>Never popular, it has drawn more intense criticism this time round.<br><br>As Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim notes, reflecting the view of critics of the policy, the Government is using taxpayers' money for partisan purpose.<br><br>Another writer to the Straist Imes Forum page this week argued that the Government is mixing up its fiduciary duty as a government to all citizens, with ist interest as apolitical party.<br><br>Criticism of the strategy can be summed up thus:<br><br>It's unfair as it deprives oppoisiton voters of benefits from government funds which should be available to all; and<br>it's partisan as the Government is using taxpayers' money for party-political ends.<br><br>The PAP's argument has been to retreat to realpolitik. The line from a succession of National Development ministers, including Mr Mah Bow Tan in an interview with The Straits Times last week, has been consistent: Funds are limited; allocation has to be on some criteria; support for the PAP's programme has to be one such criterion.<br><br>As MM Lee said in April during a television forum with young journalists when the issue was discussed:<br><br>" Look, ask yourself - does any government help the opposition to displace itself?"<br><br>" You mean to tell me in America or Britain they gave benefits to alll constituencies equally? At the same time or, worse, favour the opposition?<br>No, you favour your supporters because you want to retain them as your supporters."<br><br>The issue has arisen again, after Mr Mah's statement last week that all wards will get their lifts upgraded by 2015 - but that PAP wards will still go first.<br><br>MPs new and old have also spoken up on the issue, defending the PAP's line that resources have to be allocate, adn there is nothing wrong with allocating reources by partisan means.<br><br>But if you take this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, Singapore will become truly horrific country, indeed.<br><br>After all, all government resources are finite. Will the PAP Government one day decide to ration, say health care, or education, on the basis of support for the PAP?<br><br>Imagine the arguments thus:<br><br>The health budget is finite. Resouces to build new hospitals have to be allocated, and will be given to PAP wards first henceforth.<br><br>Or for Education:<br><br>New schools will be built in PAP wards first, and opposition wards will be LAST in the queue.<br>(Question: Has any new school been built in Hougang in the last 15 years, or the Potong Pasir in the last 22, since they fee to opposition hands?)<br><br>Or maybe the arguments will go down to the micro levels:<br><br>Hospital beds are finite in number, and PAP supporters will get priority.<br><br>You can just imagine the howls of outrage and cries of "unfair!" from voters.<br><br>I'm not for one moment suggesting the PAP will go down that road any time soon, or even ever. I raise these extreme examples to make the point that it's necessary to go back to first principles to debund the votes-for-upgrading strategy.<br><br>In other words, the PAP Government should strop using this as an election strategy, not because it no longer works in winning votes - but because it is based on unsound principle in the first place. and sets a dangerous precedent for allocating government resources.<br><br>In reviewing the votes-for-upgrading tactic, the PAP has to think less a political party and more as a national government.<br><br>The strategy may have been helpful to PAP the political party through the 1990S AND EARLY 2000s.
