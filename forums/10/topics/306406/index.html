              <p>sigh</p>
              <p>I would like to point out that the current "good life" you're having is probably due to the stop at two policy. It was a policy to produce short term gains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It doesn't work in the long run. But population control can boost economies. Just look at china.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Current economic degeneration can also be looked at as "regression to mean".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, if you don't like the beggers, stop giving money to them. If you've ever given money, you have only yourself to blame for encouraging them. God knows there are local beggers too.</p>

              <p>Another splendid example of how we are being screwed by Chinamen...</p>
              <p>First SZ industrial park,then all the kways at Geylang and all the CHinese women vs Singaporean husbands, and now even beggers....</p>
              <p>For sure, I won't give to them no more.  I would rather keep the money to help fellow Singaporeans....we help them and they laugh their way to the bank and think Singaporeans so gulliable.</p>

              <p>I just can't put my finger down to it, but I think just brandishing the sterotypical title branding people from China as possessing a certain characteristic or causing X social problems just isn't the way to go. Furthermore, can we really place the source of such instances of social dysfunctionality upon policy dictated by our government? Or should we consider a broader view, that the world is changing and borders that once secured comfort zones for whole populations of people are steadily becoming the thing of the past? We can't deport the Chinese, we can't just kick them out, it just does not work that way, eveyone knows that. A reactionist attitude towards this issue, which has been favored by certain politicians, would result in a backlash in our relationship with the main land and hence having wider implications for our purse strings. Rather, let us place the onus on ourselves, upon how we as a society deal with such problems.</p>
              <p>Recently my aunt, who slought her way through life, died suddenly. Within days of her death, a china woman took her place and as she did not leave a will, obviously the china woman reaped the fruits of her labor. I was disgusted and angry, as were my relatives for you can imagine the emotional hurt that all of us felt when we heard of the news. Naturally, we linked the situation to the larger picture, and many held the view that this was yet again another instance of china women being cheap. Hell, she was old enough to be his daughter. But that is not the point. I wondered, if there was stricter policy to prevent the entrance of chinese nationals, could my aunty's toil been rightly preserved? Or for a fact, was stricter policy even possible given the loopsided nature of international relations?</p>
              <p><br>I do not know. But one thing I know is that if we remove the veil of nationality and sterotypical characterization, there still remains the human instinct for survival based upon our own social situations. As such, we as individuals band together for a common cause, with a common culture should agenda to embalish such behavior as culturally unacceptable, for the survival of our tribe, for the survival of us as individuals. Brash accusations and brandishments just would not do, they are farcical and useless. Rather, if one from our soceity should embody such a transgression upon his or her own kind, he or she should be outcasted. Only with such a mental edge can we as a society preserve our diversiveness and social fabric.</p>
