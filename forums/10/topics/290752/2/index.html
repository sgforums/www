            <div class='col-md body'>Ngiam questions need to boost S'pore's population<br><br>SINGAPORE: If former Permanent Secretary Ngiam Tong Dow had his way, Singapore would think twice before beefing up its population to 6.5 million people.<br><br>In a candid interview in the People's Action Party's latest Petir newsletter, Mr Ngiam - while stressing that "my role is to give an alternative, not an opposing view, to government policies" - questions the rationale behind the new target. Singapore doesn't need numbers, it needs talent, he said.<br><br>Pointing out that managing the population is the main challenge facing Singapore, the 70-year-old said: "If we do it wrongly, it will change our economic and social system."<br><br>Some 40 years ago, while serving on the Economic Development Board (EDB), he and others had studied the question of an "optimum size" for an industrial country.<br><br>Said Mr Ngiam: "We looked at successful small countries such as Sweden, Norway and Israel. They each had a population of six million. So we said Singapore needed to have six million people."<br><br>But given the technological advances and rising educational levels, Singapore "no longer needs numbers now but more quality", he added.<br><br>Mr Ngiam said he was told that the number "was based on Gross Domestic Product growth of six per cent a year".<br><br>"A back-of-the-envelope calculation would show this comprises a 2-per-cent increase in population and 4-per-cent growth in productivity. But if we can increase our productivity by more than 4 per cent, we can still have 6-per-cent growth, but with fewer people who are highly productive."<br><br>He stressed the need to appeal to people's hearts. "Otherwise Â… Singapore will become just a six-star hotel where guests stay in good times and flee when times are bad. We will never become a nation," he said.<br><br>His vision: Set up a think tank to "think strategically" on top of tactics such as dual-citizenship and a more broadly-defined concept of National Service. "For instance, a foreign Singaporean living overseas should have no voting rights and less national service obligations."<br><br>The Government could even invite former citizens for "a month-long holiday" to advise policymakers on areas in which they have specialist knowledge. Said Mr Ngiam: "Do you know Chinese Nobel Prize winners are invited to China to teach for three months?"<br><br>"Our population policy should be more emotional ... You don't say to Singaporeans who are no longer citizens, 'You come back, we have a job for you'. You say, 'What about contributing your knowledge to Singapore? Better still, you want a job, we give you a job'." - TODAY/ym</div>
