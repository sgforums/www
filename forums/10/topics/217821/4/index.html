My father used to run his own bus transportation business and it was a booming business back in the 70s. We move from living under another relative's home to a HDB, from 2 rooms to 4 rooms, to private and then to landed.<br><br>That is, until the govt decided that there are too many buses services available and the reason is that they feel it is confusing to the public. So they started to restricted operators license and one by one, my father's friends were forced to shut down their business in favor of SBS. Not long after, it was our turn.<br><br>Then a few years later, we had only 2 operators in Singapore - SBS and TransIsland. The people at the bus association found out that TranIsland retain their operator license because the one of the major shareholder was MM's brother-in-law.<br><br>During the years while we are still in business, our buses are new and well maintained. Our fares are considerably lower than SBS. We had to shut down not because it was not profitable but because the govt use regulation as a tool to help state owned business kill competition.<br><br>This is the reason why my families have always been supporters of the opposition.</div></blockquote>If this was the truth.....then our God is selfish and greedy as well.  Incredible!!!</div>
