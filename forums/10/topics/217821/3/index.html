I just dun like the media's (which is, ahem, under government's control) way of <strong>covering</strong> this matter up. So how are we going to know whether the person (the one lost his life in this incident), and those whom he left behind, need any form of help?<br><br>I think (just a speculation, JUST A SPECULATION) if anyone who chose the same way to end his/her own life happen to live in any opposition's SMC, it will hit the headlines for at least a week.</div>

It coexist with us for 10 years already. The Indonesian government dun do things, can a common Singapore citizen write a letter to the Indonesian president? If they can't, how do you expect a citizen to express his / her frustration to the Indonesian president? Through gahmen. When the gahmen didn't exert enough pressure for any changes to happen, who can we complain to? Like what the Indonesians did, praying for rain?<br><br>Bus fare: Well, it's all within the gahmen's control about the bus fare. With a few company monopolize the Singapore transport market, profits are guaranteed. So why is there a fare hike when there are profits?<br><br>RGS (linked with the next problem): Every parents want the best for their children. So it is naturally that competitions for a prestigious school come out. Being in a a prestigious school will bring benefits like having a chance to become an elite. But sometimes, it's the brand name symptom at work. But after one (a common peasant [I dun like to use this word]) had calmed down, they will realise that there is nothing another person can do about admitting their children into the school. So, it's a baseless accusation.<br><br>Elite-saga (linked with the previous question): Well, the moment one is branded as an elite of the society, that person must bear the burden of helping with those who can't study as well as them, who are not as fortunate as them. Not to put on a smug face and say, "your life sucks because you sucks". And which body imbue us with this kind of mentality? Yours truly, the Gahmen.<br><br>People commit suicide (linked with the next question): I don't care when rich man commit suicide. Yes, it will be news but it is will be just a gossip, something like coffe talk, you say it today and you'll forget it tomorrow. But if someone commit suicide because of poverty, it's something worth look into. When our Gahmen boost to have a safety net, why did Mr Tan Jee Suan still wants to commit suicide? When things happen, it tells a problem. It's to tell our Gahmen that some people are not within the safety of the net and fell through a hole, SOMETHING must be done to mend the hole.<br><br>FT (linked with the previous question): If you still have the, "your life sucks because you sucks" mentality, I dun think we need to discuss this. The policy of welcoming FTs unconditionally, is putting a strain to our middle to lower income group. They dun feel secured. They live in fear of losing their job. When one live in fear / stress, how can they procreate? Since our own citizen cannot meet the population replacement requirement, then we have to rely on FTs. But FT's arrival puts stress to the salaried class, they hesitate to have babies and a vicious cycle wil go on. So who are the person unconditionally welcomes FT? Again, Yours truly, Gahmen.<br><br>Virtually all the problems (minus the haze, I think Gahmen also a bit, only a bit, LPPL), sad to say, our Gahmen took a large part in it. Are you implying that we should suffer in silence, reach a point when the Singaporean can't take it anymore and take up arms to overthrow the government in a coup (not a bloodless one for sure)?

Or we want to see the Gahmen change their mindset, be more "citizens-orientated" and preserve the stability of the region?<br></blockquote>It is Singaporeans that need a change of mindset. The needs of the economy has changed, as the President said in his speech. If you want good salaries, you have to go into knowledge-based industries like biomedical sciences, digital/IT and water technologies, where the government is also pumping the funds into. Unskilled workers will have to compete with the bottomfeeders and they will inevitably lose out to cheap foreign workers. Don't blame the government: upgrade yours skills and be prepared to accept jobs you previously would not. There are shift jobs in wafer fabs that Singaporeans still avoid because they have to wear protective clothing and work long shifts.<br><br>The bus fares in Singapore are far lower and the service better than those in the West. If you think you can do better, go ahead and start a private bus company. The government will not complain if you can run all the routes (including the money-losing unpopular routes) and make ends meet.</div>

Was reading Zaobao.com on this, and they were telling people with information to come forward......so maybe even the police also not sure what's wrong.<br><br>If the media really wants to black this out, then don't need to put it on online news. A few columnist also expressed concern that if too much report will also cause other people to follow suit. So like that also cannot blame government or media what.<br><br>Government may not be perfect, but pls don't anyhow anyhow shoot leh, make us look very stupid.</div>
