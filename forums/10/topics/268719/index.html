A PM who gave himself so much increment, his performance must be 90% to 95% excellent.  Mediocre performance is not accepted.  Did this present PM reflect on his performance before giving himself so much increment (undeserved)?<br><br>With that sort of pay they are getting and they way they project themselves, it is justified for the people of singapore to expect 90% to 95% excellent performance from the present ruling party.<br><br>If can't attain, then it is better for them not to receive such huge lump sum of pay.
