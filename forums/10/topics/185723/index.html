            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever thought why these new candidates joined the PAP, instead of the opposition? Most probably they want to win at first try in the GE. As WP chief Low Thia Kiang had said, <strong>"My conviction is that politics is a process, you come in for a long haul &amp; don't expect instant success, especially in the opposition. If first-timers want to win at first try, they should join the PAP &amp; stand in a Group Representation Constituency."</strong> The new PAP candidates prefer to stick with the tried &amp; tested method. They wouldn't want to risk by taking a ride on the wild side. Time will tell if they are of service &amp; credible to the Singaporeans. I wish that they'll help stop the PAP government from implementing any more stupid policies. <strong>What the PAP government thinks that whatever they did is for the good of Singaporeans, might not be necessarily be good for Singaporeans. Please, do not try to be a smart aleck &amp; implement all kinds of arrangements &amp; policies without asking the people for their opinions first.</strong></div>
