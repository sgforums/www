              Singapore Committee yet producing nothing of remaking to show for
              results.
              <br> <br>When asked why he cannot remake Singapore by lowering costs of
              living in the annual Remaking Singapore conference in 2002, he merely
              sidestepped the questions by giving some excuses like costs are fixed
              and variable and the many costs are beyond the control of the
              government.
              <br> <br> The he moved to other topics like youth and culture which do not remake Singapore up to now.
              <br> <br>So what good can a million-dollar minister do if he only shows off
              and talk smart but are unable to prove his effectiveness in
              implementing changes or policies announced after so many meetings and

              <p>Cost of commodities may have gone through the roof and reaching for the sky - unfortunately the Government has made it worst by levying a 50 percent {??} tax on fuel, and increase of GST by 2 percent  at the worst possible time in 2005-2006.</p>
              <p>It is within the control of the Government to reduce or remove the fuel tax that will have a ''global effect'' on all other commercial operating costs in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The controversial increase of the GST - from 5% to 7% - could be reverted, as the Singapore treasury is not hard-up for money.</p>
              <p>If Hong Kong can grow their reserves without these controversial taxes that increase the social burden onto Singaporeans, why should this Government not respond to ease the present situation for Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Should we then see these stubborn position as the continued accumulation of funds that will become annual budget surplus to be transferred to GIC and Temasek - so as to plug the gapping holes from their poor investment decision that has drained away billions from the Singapore Reserve ?</p>

              <p>More gripes and gripes. You advocate removal of taxes on oil? The reason oil prices have spiraled up beyond the "tipping point" is that demand has been inelastic of prices. Oil prices were previously expected to level off at $100 because demand was supposed to have tapered off due to consumers switching to alternatives such as public transport and car pooling, or basically changing their behavior to minimize oil consumption. That has not been the case. Now we have Goldman Sach's analyst forecasting oil prices to reach US$150-200 per barrel as they don't expect consumer behavior to change until prices hit those new marks. So you want to continue to add more stress into the demand side of the equation by lowering taxes to make gasoline effectively cheaper? Remember, oil is a non-renewable resource. OPEC is already stretched with even the Saudis having difficulty increasing production while Russia which was supposed to be a bright light in the storm has been disappointing in terms of production growth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All that subsidies or price caps achieve, as seen in China and Indonesia, is eat into government revenues and cultivate a culture that ever more regards cheap oil as a birthright. I think Singapore has done a great job in balancing car affordability and gasoline prices to make car ownership a priviledge one has to work hard for. One need only look at the minimal traffic jams on our throughfares and compare them to other cosmopolitan cities to see the difference that well thought out city planning has achieved. And can you even give thanks to a government that has planned out one of the best internal public transport systems in the world. Most of our buses are clean and airconditioned, while the MRT runs efficiently and on time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You complain about GST. Well good luck finding another developed country in the world where the income tax rate is as low as in Singapore. Other than the oil rich countries of the world, or HK (where social services are non-existent and the rich-poor disparity is startling), very few countries that offer the ammenities that Singapore does (such as community centers every few km, public swimming pools, well developed public transport, advance and subsidized education systems, as well as significant spending in military and defense budgets) have such a low taxable base.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You talk about the local needy? You must be kidding. Yes, there are alot of the hard luck stories you occasionally come into contact with, but affordable housing, food, and education is within the means of most of the populace. More so I believe than in the US, Indonesia, Malaysia or any of our south east asian brethren. I don't presume to know too much about the needy, but I presume my taxes and contributions to charity do somehow go to alleviate some of their needs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stop bitching and asking the government to take care of your every need. Make more so you don't have to ask for a handout everytime you face headwinds. Singaporeans already have a stereotype of loving to complain yet being unable to think for themselves. Don't make the stereotype into a reality.</p>

              <p>I think despite the worsening situation globally, Singapore has done a great job treading the thin line between maintaining a good quality of life while remaining competitive in the global marketplace. Remember, the only asset that Singapore as a nation has is a good port and efficient government. Otherwise, we'd be just a poor cousin of Malaysia...</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>More gripes and gripes. You advocate removal of taxes on oil? The reason oil prices have spiraled up beyond the "tipping point" is that demand has been inelastic of prices. Oil prices were previously expected to level off at $100 because demand was supposed to have tapered off due to consumers switching to alternatives such as public transport and car pooling, or basically changing their behavior to minimize oil consumption. That has not been the case. Now we have Goldman Sach's analyst forecasting oil prices to reach US$150-200 per barrel as they don't expect consumer behavior to change until prices hit those new marks. So you want to continue to add more stress into the demand side of the equation by lowering taxes to make gasoline effectively cheaper? Remember, oil is a non-renewable resource. OPEC is already stretched with even the Saudis having difficulty increasing production while Russia which was supposed to be a bright light in the storm has been disappointing in terms of production growth.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The objective of the high tax on fuel consumption in Singapore is to discourage the easy ownership of cars, which unfortunately do not address the fact that it will also increase the cost to the business community providing essential services to consumers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Reducing or removal of the fuel tax is different from subsidising the cost of fuel, as it will still be pegged to the international oil price that dictates its final pump prices.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Everyone knows that oil is a non-renewable resource, but is there any known alternative available to Singapore, and is the Singapore Government actively encouraging the search or R&amp;D towards alternative to oil ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>All that subsidies or price caps achieve, as seen in China and Indonesia, is eat into government revenues and cultivate a culture that ever more regards cheap oil as a birthright. I think Singapore has done a great job in balancing car affordability and gasoline prices to make car ownership a priviledge one has to work hard for. One need only look at the minimal traffic jams on our throughfares and compare them to other cosmopolitan cities to see the difference that well thought out city planning has achieved. And can you even give thanks to a government that has planned out one of the best internal public transport systems in the world. Most of our buses are clean and airconditioned, while the MRT runs efficiently and on time.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"> Is anyone calling for price fixing by having the fuel tax reduced or removed ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The tax approach is available to the Singapore Government in a direct way to help in lowering the cost of living for Singaporeans, as it will have a trickle down effect that reaches every Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">What is the use of the best internal public transport system when the Citizens become broke ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Is the best internal public transport system of any use when the Citizens cannot afford to travel due to the high costs of living and have to cut down on all kinds of expenses that include unnecessary travel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This will eventually affect the bottom lines of the public transport services as they will surely see a drop in passenger numbers - leading to a call for fare increases to compensate for revenue losses but cleverly disguised as higher operating costs.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You complain about GST. Well good luck finding another developed country in the world where the income tax rate is as low as in Singapore. Other than the oil rich countries of the world, or HK (where social services are non-existent and the rich-poor disparity is startling), very few countries that offer the ammenities that Singapore does (such as community centers every few km, public swimming pools, well developed public transport, advance and subsidized education systems, as well as significant spending in military and defense budgets) have such a low taxable base.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"> You are only looking at one aspect of the tax system in Singapore - only from the income tax. Have you not considered that this Government has impoverished the AVERAGE Singaporeans - {the $1000 to $3000 income group} - by taking a major part of their monthly income through a plethora of tax regimes which haunt every aspect of consumer life in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Yes, the income tax in Singapore is seemingly low, have you tried adding all the taxes that this government imposed on all kinds of services and utilities consumed</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">At least the Swedish Government is more honest and by taxing a fixed sum upfront and provide all services to its Citizens from cradle to grave - which explains for Sweden's ability to renew its own population numbers compared to Singapore's failure in self-renewal despite the supposedly low tax environment, and have to rely on the import of foreign talent to sustain population renewal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Surely the Swedish Government is more talented than those in the Singapore Government ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You talk about the local needy? You must be kidding. Yes, there are alot of the hard luck stories you occasionally come into contact with, but affordable housing, food, and education is within the means of most of the populace. More so I believe than in the US, Indonesia, Malaysia or any of our south east asian brethren. I don't presume to know too much about the needy, but I presume my taxes and contributions to charity do somehow go to alleviate some of their needs.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"> Affordable housing by whose standards ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">What kind of housing does Singaporeans get for the money that is paid ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The Singapore Dollar is supposedly managed by the Government to be stronger in exchange rate and so as to be able to purchase raw materials to help lower the cost of living - {in terms of housing, transport, utilities and food}; yet despite this fact, our cost of living is higher then that in Malaysia, Thailand and Hongkong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Do not be too presumptious to believe that your small contributions in terms of taxes paid will help the needy, as this Singapore Government is less charitable than you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">It does not take too much of your presumptious effort to know how much can you truly give to charity that will be of any effect to alleviate their needs, when the numbers are constantly manipulated in census, which do not capture the data concerning the homeless.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Stop bitching and asking the government to take care of your every need. Make more so you don't have to ask for a handout everytime you face headwinds. Singaporeans already have a stereotype of loving to complain yet being unable to think for themselves. Don't make the stereotype into a reality.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Unfortunately, you poor sighting of my text resulted in you seeing bitching and not understanding the essence of my post.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Try to be less condescending and presumptious and you will at least get some grip on reality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Is anyone asking for a handout, or are you simply fixxated by a single point of view driven home by repeated propaganda ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Look, Understand, Think. - it does not burn too much of your energy, which surely you can afford to renew, or do you need to cut down on your charity ?</span></p>

              <p>Understood Atobe, perhaps I was a little hasty in saying "bitching". No reason why we have to resort to personal attacks and that was admittedly hitting below the belt. But to respond to your queries:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) Lowering the gas tax essentially means lowering the price of fuel at the pump. I understand the difference between subsidies and removal of taxes, but in both cases you are stimulating relative demand. I do not argue prices may not continue to increase if oil prices increase, but you're essentially rewarding those who use fuel and removing an impt revenue source. Do you not understand the same debate is flaring in the US, where every economist in the land has derided Hillary's campaign promise to revise fuel taxes. Same rules here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) As to you thinking of a breakdown in public transport systems due to singaporeans not able to take buses/mrts... Well the substitution effect of those choosing to take public transport over their now much more expensive automobiles have actually helped increase ridership. As to R&amp;D for fuel alternatives to oil... are you serious? You want Singapore to fund research for this when supernations like the US as well as private investments are already channeling billions into alternative energy research?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c)when talking about welfare services you use Sweden as a comparison, well you state that "they take a fixed sum up front." Feel free to move to a country which takes just a hair under 50% of GDP in taxation income. I'll be happy to take the 20-25% income tax and GST anytime over that... Hidden taxes? Ummm GST is as crystal clear as you can get... Also, please note that Sweden is much larger than Singapore, has a hinterland which is resource rich. Do we also have cheap hydropower to draw upon?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>d)affordable housing for all. By this I don't mean everyone can afford to buy a HDB flat. That's not a god given right, but the Singapore gvt has subsidized public housing so having a place to live in while difficult for poorer income groups, are still within their reach. But as always, gvts cannot and should not cater to the lowest common denominator otherwise you end up with a welfare state like the US with its attendant problems</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, let's agree to disagree. I personally feel Singapore has done a great job by all the relevant benchmarks. Everyone has their own opinions and all the data spouted here won't change most who are committed to their viewpoints, be it yours or mine.</p>

              <p>the notion of affordable housing is fast becoming a myth here in singapore. the question of subsidized housing pegged to market rate is flawed. that variable is adjustable to suit the government's intent and purposes.</p>

              <p>When the party failed to solve problems like rising housing costs and utilities and transportation it will have to come up with red herrings like youngpap or woman-pap or post-65 MPs to create hope or expectations but without the intention to throw up real good people or talents.</p>
