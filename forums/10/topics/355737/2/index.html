              <p><strong> Half-blind man nearly lost everything to China bride</strong><br><br>First, she threatened to get the police to arrest him if he refused to marry her. When he finally relented, she made him sign a document willing his home and all his assets to her.<br><br>Mr Liang, 62, who is blind in one eye, told a Shin Min Daily News reporter that he first met the China woman at a coffee shop near his home in 2004. His wife had passed away ten years earlier in 1994.<br><br>He said that she came up to him and introduced herself as a beautician from China and said that she wanted to be his friend.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The woman, who is 11 years younger than Mr Liang, told him that she was a divorcee, and that her ex-husband and daughter are in China.</strong></span><br><br>Mr Liang said that the woman was very nice to him when they first met.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> However, things took a drastic change three months later.</strong></span><br><br>"She told me that she wanted me to marry her. Should I refuse, she would report me to the police, accusing me of treating her badly and cheating her of her feelings."<br><br>As he had no knowledge about the penal code, Mr Liang took the China woman's threats for real and agreed to the marriage. He also listened to her instructions, asking him to keep his children in the dark about the nuptials.<br><br>"It was only at the Registry of Marriages did I realize that we needed two witnesses." Mr Liang told Shin Min, "I called my daughter, telling her I needed her as my witness, but she refused."<br><br>In the end, Mr Liang managed to get a male relative and a friend of the China woman's to witness their marriage registration.<br><br>It was only months later that Mr Liang's children learned of their father's marriage.<br><br>Despite acceding to her request, Mr Liang found that married life was no better. His new wife refused to work, and constantly asked him for money.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>When his salary as a cleaner failed to satisfy his wife's needs, Mr Liang found himself asking his daughter for money.</strong></span><br><br>The former cleaner also blamed his new wife for his partial loss of sight. Mr Liang said that he was suffering from glaucoma and cataracts, but his condition was in check as his daughter would take him to the doctor regularly.<br><br>When he remarried, his China wife assumed the responsibility, but failed to bring Mr Liang for treatment after the first time. By 2008, Mr Liang lost all sight in his right eye and was unable to work.<br><br>According to a doctor's report, Mr Liang's loss of sight was attributed to the neglect of his condition.<br><br>In early 2007, Mr Liang's new wife forced him to sign a document written in English.
