              <p>FORMER Singaporean lawyer Gopalan Nair was found guilty on Friday of abusing police officers and disorderly behaviour.</p>
              <p>The 58-year-old former Workers' Party candidate was convicted
                          on 2 charges, after an <span style="color: #ff0000;">18-day trial,</span> of using expletives on police
                          officers at the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Race Course Road on
                          July 4 2008.</p>
              <p>He was found guilty of behaving in a disorderly manner by
                          gesticulating with his hands and shouting at the place that evening.</p>
              <p>The prosecution asked the court to jail Nair, now an American
                          citizen, on the first charge of using abusive words because of<span style="color: #ff0000;"> the
                          racial nature of the abusive words used,</span> his lack of remorse and his
                          conduct during the trial.</p>
              <p>The case was adjourned to the afternoon for Nair to respond.</p>
              <p>He can be fined up to $5,000 or jailed for up to one year.</p>
              <p>For disorderly conduct, the maximum penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 or a jail term of up to one month.</p>
              <p>Nair has a previous conviction of contempt of court for which he was fined $8,000 in 1991.</p>
              <p>He told the court the conviction was irrelevant for the present
                          proceedings as it arose from an election rally speech he made as a WP
                          candidate at Bukit Merah.</p>
              <p>He is also facing trial next week for allegedly insulting two High Court judges.</p>

                                      against one of the Malay officers, he (Nair)continued to be uncooperative
                                      and persisted in his abuse.</p>

                                      asked for my particulars and that I said I had none, and that I had
                                      shouted expletives at him. Kang then says he asked me why I knocked
                                      his car. He then says that I shouted to the Malay officer that he
                                      is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Malay bastard"</span>.</p>

              <p>Cause hard to settle... Nair telling the truth, than the police officer is guilty of false allegation. so need more time to settle.</p>
              <p>for some murder case, if got murder weapon, witness and motive, can chop chop settle. if murderer confess, don't even need to go to trial, just wait for sentencing.</p>
              <p>so amount of time always varies from time to time.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              As for Mr. James Leong, I have this to say. I have begun to know him
              pretty well since it took 18 days of trial. He is a good man at heart;
              there is no doubt about it. If he had his way, there is no doubt he
              would have acquitted me immediately. But alas he is weak. He cuts a
              pathetic figure. A man, because of his circumstances, having to do
              things that he does not really want to do. He knows that his employment
              as a judge in the Singapore courts depends on the patronage of Lee Kuan
              Yew and his friends. He also knows that Lee demands his judges to
              punish political opponents of the government. And therefore to keep his
              job as a judge, he has no choice but to find me guilty. The sentence
              imposed upon me, and the timing of the dates of the sentencing were, in
              all probability, all decided for him by the Minister for Law in
              consultation with Lee Kuan Yew and his friends.<br> <br> But I have to
              say this of Judge Leong. He was polite and treated me with respect
              throughout the trial. He was both courteous and decorous. I only wish
              one day, this man will have the courage of his conviction either to
              tell this government in no uncertain terms that he is not a politician,
              and if they wish dirty work to be done, they should find someone else.
              And if the government refuses, he should just walk out like a
              self-respecting man, with his head high on his shoulders and with his
              pride intact. Alas, that may be too much to ask in the fear ridden
              island of Singapore.</blockquote>

              <p>While many Americans have been focused lately on online censorship in China, few 
              have noticed a similar practice in other countries such as Singapore. That 
              island state is a parliamentary republic in theory, but has really been run by 
              one dominant party in its history of independence since 1965 (see a Singapore 
              historical timeline <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1148137.stm">here</a>).</p>
              <p>The mainstream media is strictly controlled by the government, and one 
              political party — the People’s Action Party (PAP) — has had complete control of 
              all centers of government. The country infamously practices caning of citizens 
              who break certain laws, and executes drug smugglers. (Amnesty International <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA360012004?open&amp;of=ENG-SGP">reports</a> Singapore has the highest execution rate per capita in the world.) And recently, 
              its Minister of Communication and Arts, Balaji Sadasiva, announced that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4882746.stm">blogs and podcasts 
              would be shut down</a> if they ran overt political content in the runup to the 
              May 6 election.</p>
              <p>Immediately, the move was denounced by the free expression rights group 
              Reporters Without Borders. “Once again the Singapore authorities are showing 
              their determination to prevent the holding of a genuinely democratic debate on 
              the Internet,” <a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=16935">the 
              group said</a> in a statement. And the Internet crackdown was aimed squarely at 
              two new media platforms — blogs and podcasts — that have been embraced by 
              opposition parties such as the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) to get around 
              censorship in other media.</p>
              <p>The Singaporean government has won over residents with a powerful economic 
              engine that rivals Western European powers. And in recent years Singapore has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3512498.stm">relaxed its ban</a> on 
              chewing gum — in order to win a free trade agreement with the <span class="caps">U.S </span>— and it has allowed the showing of the movie “Brokeback 
              Mountain” despite laws against homosexuality. So just how serious is this new 
              regulation, and will political speech by bloggers and podcasters be chilled now 
              that elections have been set for May 6?</p>
              <p>One Singaporean blogger, Soci, who writes for the very political group blog, 
              <a href="http://singabloodypore.blogspot.com/">Singabloodypore</a>, was defiant 
              in a comment on a <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/5208-9595-0.html?forumID=1&amp;threadID=19555&amp;messageID=376357">related 
              story</a><br>on <span class="caps">ZDN</span>et:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This blog — Singabloodypore — is not registered with the Singaporean 
              government, has never been asked to register, and if invited to register would 
              <span class="caps">NOT </span>register. I Soci also intend to post material of an 
              “explicitly political nature” during the elections and will gladly show 
              videocasting and podcasting of election rallies, speeches etc. of opposition 
              candidates.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And indeed they have been showcasing just that on the group blog. But in many 
              cases, these bloggers and the dozens of others that write about Singapore are 
              anonymous or operate from outside the country. Chris Myrick, who pens the <a href="http://www.asiapundit.com/">Asia Pundit blog</a>, lived in Singapore until 
              February 2005. He was unsure how much the new regulation would chill speech 
              online.</p>
              <p>“Most Singapore bloggers stay pretty much within limits - there are only a 
              small handful of political blogs and even those will stay away from certain 
              issues (nepotism) or the authors will remain anonymous,” Myrick told me via 
              email. “I have no doubt that the Singapore government would prosecute an 
              individual for breaking the ban. It tends to be the methodology of the state to 
              make an example of people (i.e., the three bloggers who were last year <a href="http://singaporeangle.blogspot.com/2005/09/two-charged-with-sedition-for-racist.html">sentenced 
              for sedition</a>).”</p>
              <h3>Government explains the crackdown</h3>
              <p>I queried Singapore’s Ministry of Communication and the Arts (MICA) to get 
              more insight into the new rules for blogs and podcasts and they directed me to 
              <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060415_385386.html">a detailed <span class="caps">Q&amp;A</span></a> between government minister Lee Boon Yang and the 
              Straits Times. Here’s one telling exchange:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Q. Why is streaming of explicit political content through podcasts or 
              videocasts not allowed but posting of party manifestos and texts of rally 
              speeches allowed for political parties? What is the worry? </strong></p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>Podcasts and videocasts…have a greater impact because of the nature of the 
              medium. They have the greater power to influence. Hence, we do not allow 
              podcasts and videocasts for election advertising, just as we do not allow party 
              political films and videos. The Internet has its own unique characteristics 
              which require special attention. The Internet is ubiquitous, fast and anonymous. 
              Once a false story or rumour is started on the Internet, it is almost impossible 
              to put it right. Despite its usefulness, the Internet is chaotic and 
              disorganised, with many half-truths and untruths masquerading as 
              facts…</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>To help bring some order to this chaotic environment, we have made it a 
              requirement for political parties and individuals who use websites to propagate 
              or promote political issues to register with the Media Development Authority 
              (MDA). This promotes accountability and also ensures personal responsibility for 
              comments made on the Internet.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Soci at Singabloodypore was quick to <a href="http://singabloodypore.blogspot.com/2006/04/new-media-same-rules.html">read 
              between the lines of this <span class="caps">Q&amp;A</span></a>, analyzing the 
              underlying meaning of each passage. Soci’s take on the comment above from the 
              minister: “The Internet is a threat to our domination of the national mind set.”</p>
              <p>While the minister makes a strong case about the way misinformation spreads 
              online, there are more transparent ways of countering that than blocking off 
              speech completely. For instance, the government could make its own case online, 
              or try to open up a debate with oppositional views.</p>
              <p><img class="left" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/files/Alex%20Au%20of%20Yawning%20Bread.jpg" alt="Alex Au of Yawning Bread.jpg" width="200" height="202"></p>
              <p>Alex Au (pictured here), who blogs about gay rights in Singapore at <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/">Yawning Bread</a>, told me that freedom of 
              speech in Singapore exists to a certain point.</p>
              <p>“The freedom available to Singaporeans is quite wide,” Au told me via email. 
              “However, there is a climate of fear that the government can clamp down anytime. 
              There have actually been very few instances of arbitrary clamping down, but the 
              fear persists, and thus a lot of people in Singapore, including bloggers, 
              self-censor to some extent. With the passage of time, there is increasing 
              confidence that freedom of speech on the Internet is pretty wide. The more years 
              that pass without incident, the more confidence people 
              gain.”</p>
              <p>Au says that in the sedition cases last year, the language used online by the 
              three people who were prosecuted was “extremely gross, full of expletives and 
              deliberately provocative,” rather than an intelligent discussion. So Au feels 
              that the government was drawing the line between measured discussion of issues 
              and inflammatory speech.</p>
              <p>In the recent crackdown of blogs and podcasts, Au thinks the government’s ban 
              is very narrow in covering blogs that “persistently promote a political line” — 
              leaving broad political discussions alone. I asked him if he thought the 
              government might act against bloggers in the next couple 
              weeks.</p>
              <p>“No I don’t,” he said. “I think the government may want to create the 
              impression that they will clamp down, in order to get people to tremble in their 
              socks and self-censor anything critical that they may have to say about the 
              government. But the government probably knows that the Internet is not (yet) a 
              mass medium that can move large numbers of voters, so to really take action 
              would be overkill. In any case, the junior minister did say in Parliament that 
              politics can be discussed, just that unless one is identified as a political 
              party, one shouldn’t go around promoting any particular party or 
              candidate.”</p>
              <p>As Singapore is a trade partner to the West, how the Western media portrays 
              the Singaporean government is important to them. So that means that bloggers and 
              journalists who bring attention to the recent crackdown could help the <span class="caps">PAP </span>reconsider taking action.</p>
              <p>“Bringing the world’s attention to authoritarian instincts of this 
              government, making them a little of a pariah on account of their policies, 
              embarrasses them greatly,” Au said.</p>

              <p>What do you think? Is the Singaporean government going too far in threatening 
              bloggers and podcasters? Is there something that we as outsiders can do to 
              support the bloggers and podcasters who are worried about being arrested or 
              blocked from speaking their minds?</p>
              <p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: The Singapore Elections Department has 
              ordered the Singapore Democratic Party to remove its podcasts in accordance with 
              the election restrictions, <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/204846/1/.html">according 
              to Channel NewsAsia</a>. As of today, April 26, there is now a message on the <a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/"><span class="caps">SDP’</span>s 
              website</a> saying: “The <span class="caps">SDP’</span>s podcasts are suspended 
              due to an order by the Election Department. We apologize for the termination.”</p>
              <p>However, the text of a recent podcast remains <a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlecheepodcast.html">posted on the 
              site</a>. In the podcast, <span class="caps">SDP’</span>s Dr. Chee Soon Juan rails 
              against the government’s methods of crushing the <span class="caps">SDP’</span>s 
              campaign for the elections. “[The <span class="caps">PAP</span>] bans podcasting 
              knowing full well that we had set up our podcast last year specifically so that 
              we can better reach out to voters in this election…Everywhere that we go for our 
              walkabouts, undercover police agents are on hand to harass us and issue us 
              warnings.”</p>
              <p>This is not shaping up to be a truly free election in Singapore. The <a href="http://singabloodypore.blogspot.com/">Singabloodypore</a> blog continues 
              to give timely updates on happenings there.</p>

              <p>WHEN the death knell sounded on a 10-year-old <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Law’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Law">law</a> that imposes a total ban on <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘political film’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/political%20film">political 
              films</a> two weeks ago, film-maker Martyn See cheered.<br><br>The move marked 
              the biggest effort in 20 years by the Government to loosen its hold on political 
              expression here, declared the 39-year-old.<br><br>As a mischievous tribute, he 
              pulled together 100 films on local politics, compiling them on his blog a week 
              after Prime Minister <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Lee Hsien Loong’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Lee%20Hsien%20Loong">Lee 
              Hsien Loong</a> said in his Aug 17 National Day Rally speech that an outright 
              ban on political films was no longer sensible.<br><br>The 100 short clips - 
              'films' is too formal a term to describe them - are the work of assorted groups 
              and individuals, most with a decidedly anti-establishment stance.<br><br>They 
              include two by Mr See which did not make the censor's cut. One is on <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Singapore’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Singapore">Singapore</a> Democratic Party (SDP) chief Chee Soon Juan and the other on former political

              plans to re-submit them to the Board of <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Film Censors’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Film%20Censors">Film 
              Censors</a> once the ban on political films is formally eased - 
              likely early next year - just to test the new system.<br><br>He wants to do so 
              because the prospective change comes with caveats: Films which are partisan or 
              give a distorted and slanted impression will still be off-limits.<br><br>His own 
              view is that there should be no caveats. 'If it is not sheer stupidity to 
              continue enforcing bans on these films when they can be viewed at a click of a 
              mouse, I don't know what is,' he wrote on his blog.<br><br>How did he come to be 
              such a fighter against Section 33 of the Films Act, which bans party political 
              films?<br><br>Political awakening<br><br>ATTRIBUTE it to a second political 
              awakening that came in the wake of the 2001 <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘general election’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/general%20election">general 
              election</a>.<br><br>He had had a first awakening back in the mid-1990s, when a 
              photocopy of a banned book came his way.<br><br>The book was To Catch A Tartar, 
              written by former solicitor-general <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Francis Seow’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Francis%20Seow">Francis 
              Seow</a>, describing his detention under the Internal Security Act in the late 
              1980s.<br><br>'My eyes were opened to the darker side of the PAP's history,' he 
              says.</p>
              </div>
              <p><br>'I read it from cover to cover. I 
              felt...frightened, depressed and angry at the same time.'<br><br>His hitherto 
              placid political outlook changed then, but it was only later - after the 
              November 2001 election - that he was really roused into action.<br><br>What 
              caught his attention was Dr Chee Soon Juan heckling then prime minister Goh Chok 
              Tong about an alleged loan to former Indonesian president Suharto.<br><br>'Chee 
              Soon Juan got hammered very badly. I wondered, is this guy as bad as the media 
              made him out to be? So I decided to check him out myself,' he says.<br><br>A few 
              months later, in 2002, he asked to meet Dr Chee.<br><br>For the next two years, 
              he 'interviewed' the SDP leader regularly, visited him at his home and his 
              office, and observed him when he staged public protests - filming all the 
              while.<br><br>He had reams of footage but no film, until Mr Lee Hsien Loong was 
              sworn in as Prime Minister in 2004.<br><br>Mr Lee's inauguration speech, 
              promising the opening up of civil society, inspired him to compile his shots 
              into a 28-minute film which he titled Singapore Rebel.<br><br>He submitted it 
              for screening at a film festival. But the film never made it past the 
              censors.<br><br>It was deemed 'party political', and banned under Section 33 of 
              the Films Act.<br><br>He was questioned four times over 15 months by the police 
              and even had his video camera seized.<br><br>'They dropped the investigation a 
              couple of months after the 2006 general election. I guess they wanted to watch 
              if I would participate in the election,' he says.<br><br>He never did. But he 
              continued to produce politically incorrect films.<br><br>Singapore 
              Rebel<br><br>MR SEE titled his directorial debut Singapore Rebel. Although about 
              Dr Chee, it sums up Mr See himself - someone bent on capturing alternative 
              politics on celluloid.<br><br>He began his film-making career nearly 20 years 
              ago, right after national service, learning the ropes of video editing in 
              production houses. Along the way, he became a freelance video editor, working 
              for renowned local directors such as Mr Eric Khoo and Mr Jack Neo.<br><br>He 
              spends 90 per cent of his time doing such work to 'pay the bills', but the 
              remaining 10 per cent is now consumed by his passion - making films on local 
              political issues.<br><br>While being questioned by the police over Singapore 
              Rebel, he produced another film, on former political detainee Said Zahari. This 
              was also banned.<br><br>His latest, on Dr Chee and the protests he staged during 
              the IMF-World Bank meetings in 2006, however made the cut. Speakers' Cornered 
              was given an NC-16 rating and screened at the Substation on July 26 this 
              year.<br><br>Despite the overwhelmingly pro-opposition - especially pro-SDP - 
              angles in his films, he insists he is not an opposition supporter or 
              sympathiser.<br><br>He says: 'I fill a vacuum created by the media when they 
              don't cover opposition politicians or political dissidents. I consider myself a 
              citizen journalist, not a Michael Moore type of film-maker.'<br><br>Asked why he 
              bothers to submit his films for classification when he can upload them on 
              YouTube, he deadpans that the law requires it.<br><br>The more compelling reason 
              is that he wants to push the envelope in the area of political 
              expression.<br><br>'Who better to do that than me,' he says, 'since I'm already 
              over the OB markers. I want more film-makers who want to document the political 
              scenes to emerge.'<br><br>In this, he has found a following of sorts.<br><br>Mr 
              Ho Choon Hiong, 33, first heard about Mr See when Singapore Rebel was banned 
              three years ago.<br><br>He was among a group of 12 film-makers who wrote to the 
              Government then, asking for greater clarity as to what constituted a party 
              political film.<br><br>The incident led to him meeting Mr See.<br><br>Their 
              subsequent exchanges emboldened him to capture on celluloid assorted scenes of 
              political activism in Singapore.<br><br>Unlike Mr See, he was introduced to 
              politics early by his father, who used to be a student activist at Chinese High 
              School in the 1960s.<br><br>Like Mr See, however, his political interest was 
              stoked by the 2001 polls and Dr Chee.<br><br>After meeting Mr See, he produced a 
              plethora of very short films, on topics ranging from the 2006 election to 
              protests by Myanmar nationals in Singapore. He sent six to the film censors for 
              classification in May.<br><br>'I have to take a few steps and hope to be 
              undeterred more and more,' says the film studies graduate from Ngee Ann 
              Polytechnic.<br><br>'I want to put my own perception of truth out.'<br><br>So 
              far, his 'films' have been ignored by the authorities.<br><br>A prolific 
              activist<br><br>NOT so for Mr Seelan Palay, 24, another amateur 
              film-maker.<br><br>He had his film, One Nation Under Lee, seized by officials 
              from the Board of Film Censors as it was being screened in a hotel 
              recently.<br><br>The reason: It had not been passed by the censors.<br><br>His 
              first effort - detractors panned it as a slide show rather than a film - it 
              portrayed Singapore as lacking in press and political freedom, and tightly 
              controlled by Mr Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Point out that One Nation Under Lee is 
              decidedly one-sided - it takes potshots at the Government while hailing Dr Chee 
              as a hero - and he insists he has no political agenda.<br><br>He isn't 
              politicised by anyone either, he insists.<br><br>'I learnt everything from 
              reading, out of personal interest,' says the activist.<br><br>CITIZEN 
              JOURNALIST<br><br>'I fill a vacuum created by the media when they don't cover 
              opposition politicians or political dissidents. I consider myself a citizen 
              journalist, not a Michael Moore type of film-maker.'<br>-- Film-maker Martyn 
              See<br><br>He has been involved at various times with the Vegetarian Society, 
              the Animal Concerns Research &amp; Education Society, and the now defunct SG 
              Human Rights Group.<br><br>Earlier this year he attended rallies by Hindu 
              protesters in Kuala Lumpur, and upon his return to Singapore, decided to mount a 
              one-man protest fast outside the Malaysian High Commission.<br><br>He also takes 
              part in protest actions organised by the SDP occasionally.<br><br>He is not a 
              troublemaker, he insists. He is just doing what he believes in.<br><br>Nothing 
              to fear<br><br>WHAT keeps the trio going?<br><br>'Our conscience pricks us,' 
              says Mr Ho. He sees it as his duty to document what he believes gets sidelined 
              by the mainstream media.<br><br>The trio use the same counter when you point out 
              that their version of 'truth' sometimes takes an extreme slant. Others have 
              noted that it was the publicity over the banning of some of their films, rather 
              than the quality of the films themselves, that made the public more keen to view 
              them.<br><br>But they are not perturbed.<br><br>For Mr See, his mission is 
              simple.<br><br>'I live by the Singapore Pledge. I live by the Constitution that 
              guarantees freedom of expression, association and assembly,' he says.<br><br>And 
              he aims to guard these freedoms by showing that there is nothing to 
              fear.<br><br>The other two, less articulate about their aims, appear to go with 
              the flow as acolytes of Mr See, enjoying the thrill of defiance every once in a 
              while.<br><br>They are all drawn to Dr Chee, whom they see as championing 
              freedom of expression and provoking the Government with his illegal public 
              protests.<br><br>Still, they say, they have no intention of joining the SDP or 
              any political party. Ironically, they fear being hemmed in by party 
              discipline.<br><br>Mr Palay, for instance, will tell you that he supports the 
              SDP's cause but has no wish to sign on as a member.<br><br>Have they made an 
              impact on the political scene? They believe so, pointing to more local 
              film-makers who remain anonymous but, like them, upload political-type films on 
              YouTube.<br><br>They also claim some credit for the Government's decision to 
              consider lifting the ban on political films.<br><br>It was, they say, the 
              banning of Mr See's Singapore Rebel that sparked a debate on the relevance of 
              the Films Act.<br><br>Future films<br><br>FOR now, the three men have film ideas 
              that they hope will see the light of day.<br><br>Mr Palay wants to do a film on 
              the unspoken rule limiting use of dialects in films.<br><br>Mr Ho is aiming to 
              do documentaries on two women: Dr Chee's wife, and his own long-lost Malaysian 
              nanny whom he is still trying to locate.<br><br>As for Mr See, he has two 
              targets too. One is the reclusive former political detainee Chia Thye Poh. The 
              other is Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>In the latter film, he wants to 
              trace the People's Action Party's formation and rise to the pinnacle of power in 
              Singapore.<br><br>Why do a film on the PAP when its story has been told so many 
              times before? 'It is a compelling story,' he says.<br><br>So are they really 
              rebels with a cause?<br><br>Says Mr See: 'There's definitely a purpose to what 
              we're doing. I see it as lessening the climate of fear here.<br><br>'I want more 
              film-makers like me to emerge, wanting to document the political scenes in 
              Singapore.'<br></p>
