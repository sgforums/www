              <p>Permanent residents are flocking to serve in grassroots organizations that they have to be put on the waiting list at the Geylang Neighborhood committee due to a little-known cap of 15 per cent of the grassroots committee members who can be PRs.</p>
              <p>According to a report by TODAY, there are 1,360 PRs now serving as grassroots leaders, comprising 4.6 per cent of the 29,400 grassroots leaders in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This number is almost double the reported number of PR grassroots leaders serving in November 2007 and four times the number in August 2000.</p>
              <p>Minister of Community, Youth and Sports revealed lately that there 4,500 new citizens who are serving as grassroots organizations in various estates.</p>
              <p>All the grassroots organizations in Singapore such as the Residents’ Committees and Community Clubs are under the control of the People’s Association (PA), a quasi-PAP organization headed by none other the Prime Minister himself.</p>
              <p>A PA spokesperson told TODAY that “the involvement of PRs in community work helps build better understanding between PRs and Singaporeans.”</p>
              <p>For example, in Yew Tee, a group of PRs from China help to promote interest in Chinese language by volunteering to teach the Chinese Classics weekly in the community club.</p>
              <p>The percentage of grassroots leaders who are Singaporeans versus new citizens and PRs is not known.</p>
              <p>PRs are probably more keen to join grassroots organizations than locals because of the perks which come along with it.</p>
              <p>Besides helping them expand their social network in Singapore and to boost their chances of getting a citizenship if they have plans to settle down here, their children will also get priority in enrollment in primary schools.</p>
              <p>As a result of Singapore’s liberal immigration policy, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>The ruling party has been courting the newcomers with goodies to make them feel welcomed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>A $10-million dollar Community Integration Fund is launched to help the new citizens integrate into Singapore society.</p>
              <p>Since immigrants will usually vote for the government which has given them the opportunity to start life afresh in their adopted homelands, the increasing number of new citizens will have an impact in future elections.</p>
              <p>Over at Geylang Neighbourhood Committee which has already hit its quota for PRs, the PR grassroots leaders play an important role in getting their friends involved in community activities.</p>
              <p>The committee serves an area between Geylang Lorong 22 to 42, which is just a stone-throw away from Singapore’s famous red light district.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><div id="post_message_3201539"><strong>Cap on PRs leads to waitlist at grassroots<br><br>by Leong Wee Keat<br>05:55 AM Dec 07, 2009</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE - It is a little-known cap. No more than 15 per cent of grassroots committee members can be permanent residents. <br><br>And with more PRs taking on roles as grassroots leaders, the situation at Geylang Neighbourhood Committee could repeat itself in other areas.<br><br>It had to have a "waitlist" for PRs wanting to serve as grassroots leaders after PR membership reached the cap.<br><br>"We have a few (PRs who wanted to join), but because of our quota, we asked them to help and join our activities first," said committee chairperson Fu Chuan San.<br><br>The situation has eased as two of the four PR members have become citizens.<br><br>Some 1,360 PRs are now serving as grassroots leaders, comprising 4.6 per cent of the 29,400 grassroots leaders here, a People's Association spokesperson told MediaCorp.<br><br>This number is almost double the reported number of PR grassroots leaders serving in November 2007 and four times the number in August 2000.<br><br>With the rate of growth in PRs rising faster last year than those for citizens and foreigners, the social integration benefits of housing quotas and citizenship tests, for example - most recently raised in Parliament last month - are increasingly being debated.<br><br>When asked by MediaCorp about the grassroots quota for PRs - when it was introduced and how many grassroots organisations had reached it - the PA spokesperson replied: "The cap was introduced to maintain a good balance and mixture between Singaporeans and PRs in grassroots work."<br><br>But the PA "is quite flexible" about making exceptions, noted Member of Parliament Lim Wee Kiak, an adviser to Canberra grassroots organisations.<br><br>Offering a possible explanation for the quota, he said: "The cap is a device just to make sure that we're not suddenly overwhelmed by one committee taken over by PRs or new citizens only."<br><br>Including those who serve as Integration and Naturalisation Champions, there are about 4,500 new immigrants in grassroots leadership, Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had told Parliament.<br><br>Singapore PR Sreekanth APV, who joined the Woodlands Community Club Indian Activity Executive Committee in March, feels that the cap is "not out of place".<br><br>"PRs are not citizens. So, from that point of view, such a cap can be understood," said the 39-year-old from India. "Maybe the time for reviewing the cap is when you can't find enough Singaporeans to be grassroots leaders, and you find more PRs who want to be involved in grassroots work (see sidebar)."<br><br><br><strong>Making their presence felt</strong><br><br>So how have PRs made an impact at the grassroots level?<br><br>According to the PA spokesperson: "The involvement of PRs in community work helps build better understanding between PRs and Singaporeans."<br><br>In Yew Tee, for example, a group of PRs from China help to promote interest in Chinese language by volunteering to teach the Chinese Classics weekly in the community club.<br><br>But it's not always smooth sailing for PR grassroots leaders. <br><br>Mdm Zhang Min, who serves in Canberra Zone 1 Residents' Committee, has encountered language and cultural differences with locals.<br><br>Mdm Zhang, who came to Singapore from China nine years ago, was chided once by a Singaporean after making several calls trying to arrange delivery of dumplings to his house. He called her a troublesome Chinese national.<br><br>"Later, he called to thank me and apologise," said Mdm Zhang. "Maybe there were some language differences between us."<br><br>Over at Geylang Neighbourhood Committee, PR grassroots leaders help to rope in their friends for community activities, said Mdm Fu.<br><br>The committee serves an area between Geylang Lorong 22 to 42, which with its many private condominiums has a relatively high concentration of PR and foreign residents. <br><br>Last month's Deepavali celebrations drew more than 300 residents, and one PR grassroots leader brought 60 friends to the event.<br><br>"If you can encourage PRs and new citizens to join our activities, it's better," said Mdm Fu, who has been a grassroots leader for almost 40 years. "It will make them feel more Singaporean."<br><br>MP Halimah Yacob feels that the 15-per-cent cap should not be viewed "as an inhibiting factor but more to ensure that grassroots leaders are representative of the population profile".<br><br>PRs now make up more than 10 per cent of the total population.<br><br>"The cap, in my view, will not have an adverse impact on integration as a lot depends on the reach and types of events organised to cater to the needs of both Singaporeans and immigrants," added Mdm Halimah.<br><br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC091207-0000028/Cap-on-PRs-leads-to-waitlist-at-grassroots"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC091207-0000028/Cap-on-PRs-leads-to-waitlist-at-grassroots</span></span></a></div></div>
