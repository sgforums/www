Quality of local management is another. Thereafter, there are no channels to express as bosses in Singapore have no pressure to listen, neither is applying licence for a mini-strike frivolously granted (which is not all that bad). Hence, workers will turn themselves off and just do their work. The egg is returned to the chicken when boss finds that with bo-chap workers, there is no potential to diversify job scope.<br><br>What you say is true. I am not pro-strike for unnecessary reasons. I am merely highlighting the TNP report in comparison with another labour statistic. The last strike that happened in 1986, the bill was about $60,000.

It can be speculated that a one-party dominant govt may be starting to lose its grip, that NTUC no longer has the usual swagger it conducts itself with.<br><br>Similarly, a country which strikes all the time will suddenly set investors rolling if it is non-strike for a month.<br><br>This is how fickle-minded investors or existing customers can be as to the situation. And anyone who permits a strike (NTUC chief) has to weight the options carefully, at the same time, ensure that regardless of the outcome, there will be no row with the cabinet.<br><br>The direct terms 'right' and 'wrong' refer to issues which may or may not be negotiable. Let's face it, people complain for all kinds of reasons. You will always have union heads who conjure up enough dissatisfaction among the ranks over meagre issues. For example, if the economy slumps and companies exercise the MVC component in order to save jobs, and people are upset over the drop in salary and want to strike, then it would be a <strong>WRONG</strong> (no wait ...STUPID) reason.<br><br>As for right, there are plenty of tenable arguments. But most of them can be candily discussed at union level and then corporate level. All this avoids demonstrations.<br><br>Only when all avenues are exhausted do extreme measures take precedent.<br><br>Whether SG has benefited from a non-strike status is for everyone to gauge. Less disruptions mean a solid foundation for corporates to build and improve. On the flip side, many will cast a doubt whether companies have solicited govt aid in legislating numerous MOM directives to their beneift such as lower medical benefits or reduced leave, but then again, that is for the employee to judge.<br><br></div>

However, I'll clarify my take: if CiPRI is doing research first and then sharing its results with the political parties concerned, that's ok; if CiPRI is basing its research on the whims and fancies of the political parties, that is it is streamlining its research projects to suit partisan demands, then that is a definite no-no. I think the test for which condition CiPRI is currently in is this research question: Assess fully the political parties in Singapore and their respective policy lines. If CiPRI can do this question without shwoing bias in its analysis for/against any party in Singapore, then it has maintained its credibility.<br><br>3) You misunderstand me: "partisan" in my context means "sliding [CiPRI's] research to suit the interests of political parties".<br><br>4) Does PERC have much credibility in Singaporeans' eyes?<br><br>5) Ya, I'm not unrealistic. Clearly, you need politicians to implement the changes. But instead of turning too much into an activist group, despite the fact that membership is largely activist, why don't you leave the politics to the politicians and focus on research. Let the politicians use the research in whatever way they want, but let none of their interests get in the way of CiPRI's research focus.<br><br>6) Neither do I, which is why I believe CiPRI should be kept firmly out of the influence of any political party, especially WP; I noted your statements about having tensions with your WP mates regarding CiPRI's work: do you think perhaps that in the long-term, a future Chief Researcher or perhaps even you yourself might fall victim to these pressures, and in so doing, compromise CiPRI's character? No offence, but this is politics - I think.<br><br>I'm not advocating a pro-PAP stance for CiPRI - that would be absolutely nonsense, since it certainly won't add to the amount of knowledge we can get now from government sources. But neither do I wish CiPRI - as a concerned citizen - to adopt a wholly anti-PAP view, as it might be possible that the PAP does still have some good points, despite its obvious weaknesses.<br><br>Aft) btw, I actually think that if CiPRI could get government sponsorship, it would be good for it. haha<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But I do believe that it should seek to outclass ISEAS, IPS, IDSS and all the other government think-tanks.

Less-educated folk (no offence to anyone here) will not be able to see through her arguments, and so will not understand. I mean, given that she is allowed to be printed in the ST, it shows that the censors have very naively assumed that she praises the Ruling Party after her incident in 1994.<br><br>CSJ is much more active, but he is also much less subtle, which makes him incur the MIW's wrath more easily.<br><br>SO, both approaches have their good and bad points; I guess we should find somewhere in between: hmmm, is there anything that the MIW in their ivory towers wouldn't understand, but that the common folk would?<br><br>the pikamaster</div>
