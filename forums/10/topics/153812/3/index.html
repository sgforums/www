Singaporeans should not be too critical of his performance. Given a chance anyone (remember earlier comments made by MM about wooden GCT) anyone aan contribute in his or her own way. The problem is those who are critical of him may be people afraid of speaking the truths.</div>

Indeed, we welcome more of her spicy articles in ST. If just a handful could raise talking point abt the ruling party to a fever pitch, imagine the response to a consistent flow of them.<br><br>Remember that she does not belong to any political party and hence is in the best position to claim zero political agenda. This position is best reflected by everyone in this forum who represents the people but have 'no strings attached'.<br><br>With the govt only too eager to act against 'bluntness', perhaps offering a subtle 'nudge' (to borrow Vivian Balakhrisnan's words) in the right direction may be more prudent and 'face-saving'.</div>
