No point quibbling over whether or not ITE students should have such beautiful campuses or not - like I said earlier, one of the reasons why the Simei ITE campus is so magnificent is because the government wants to upgrade the image of ITEs in general, and do away with the "ITE-students-are-stupid" stigma that is attached to ITEs.
