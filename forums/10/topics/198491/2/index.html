Money can never be "enough," much less when you have outright access to it in a perfectly "legitimate" environment. Thus the statement postulated by the government that high salaries help to combat corruption is little more than a simple excuse that is simplistically simplified for supposed simple minds like us.<br><br>Good job to the JC girl.

Why challenge Gayle over issues of the past? Issues that are no longer relevant <span style="color: red;"><strong>today</strong></span>? Are we not discussing about politics of TODAY? Is not that the precise concept of Lau Lee's personal  vision of governace?<br><br>Dwelling in past glories are the beginnings of decadence, the failure of today's generation of leaders to perform and produce results in the here and now.<br><br>To dig up the past as cannon fodder and bask in exploits long ago merely speak volumes of the inept talents and capabilities of our leaders despite their propaganda to the contrary.<br><br>They recruit their MP-elects virtually unopposed; they have the pick of the crop, plus they have the added incentive of openly criticising alternative candidates and name-calling; politics of the gutter as proclaimed by Lee Senior from the start.<br><br>And they get away with it. There seems to be a lop-sided form of fairness applied: one for the alternatives and one for the ruling party.<br><br>So when the issue of pay is brought up, it invariably strikes a chord with most level-headed singaporeans.<br><br>What kind of super-scale pay is warrented to protect against corruption? When is it considered too much? What is the formula for calculating a minister's pay? How does our PM justify the dollar value of our ministers and top civil servants?<br><br>Worst of all, why are all these items considered OB markers and not open for discussion?<br><br>Like upgrading, these are taxpayers' monies being used indiscriminately. Equivalent leaders of 1st world countries earn a pay nowhere near as high as ours; and as Gayle like so many before us pointed out, these countries are just as clean and well-run.<br><br>And just so you wake up from your fantasy world, an NSF's pay is peanuts compared to the premier of CHINA. The progress package was our own money being used to subtly and unethically 'buy' our votes. And if you think the success and safety of Singapore was achieved solely on the basis of our 2 million-dollar PM and not the hard work of Singaporeans, then you are surely one myopic citizen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, we are comfortable now because of all his initiatives in the past.<br><br>But does it means, we now are internally indebted? Such that we pay endlessly ever increasing costs???<br><br>Comfortable, yes. But many cannot sleep at night, even in their cosy aircon rooms. Some, even decided not to use aircon anymore, while some, are at wits end not being able to find a job after having been retrenched!<br><br>The boom years are all but history. Eversince the asian crisis, our leaders haven't really got us out of the woods. W're still in the woods!<br><br></div>
