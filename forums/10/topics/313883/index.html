              <p>I'm no fan of white supremacy in USA but let's face it, in current times does a black leadership only for the blacks have what it takes to take America into the next level;?</p>
              <p>Obama pastor <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yd4OaIVRkc">Wright </a>in his church seems to take an extreme stance in race and American politics..if colored folks do not like White americans take on white nationalism then obama pastor should not harp on black power...2 wrongs doesn't make it right..what do you guys think?</p>

              you must have just woken up, this issue is old...obama gave a speech worthy of a state of the union address on race relations in the usa....wright wasn't thrashing the whites but rather raising the injustice of the blacks, but he's old school and his perception was that of the 60's / 70's......
              
              in any case, america is too fragmented these days, hispanics will become the top minority in terms of numbers in less than  a decade or so, asians alone will account for 10% to 12% in the same time, so whoever is trying to play the race card will eventually be cast aside...
              
              for now, its the rich whites who controls the politics and will do so for some time, i am quite sure obama will not go beyond this nomination contest because the money politics within the dems favor hill-bill......regardless who becomes president, the damaged done by bush is almost irreversible....

              <p><em>Just as Classical culture spread westward from the Greeks who
              created it to the Roman peoples who adopted and changed it, so Europe's
              culture spread westward to the New World, where it was profoundly
              modified while still remaining basically European. </em></p>
              <p><em>The central fact of
              American history is that people of European origin and culture came to
              occupy and use the immensely rich wilderness between the Atlantic and
              the Pacific...</em></p>
              <p><em>...The structure of financial controls created by the tycoons of "Big
              Banking" and "Big Business" in the period 1880-1933 was of
              extraordinary complexity, one business fief being built on another,
              both being allied with semi-independent associates, the whole rearing
              upward into two pinnacles of economic and financial power, of which
              one, centered in New York, was headed by J. P. Morgan and Company, and
              the other, in Ohio, was headed by the Rockefeller family. </em></p>
              <p><em>When these
              two cooperated, as they generally did, they could influence the
              economic life of the country to a large degree and could almost control
              its political life, at least on the Federal level. The former point can
              be illustrated by a few facts...</em></p>

              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em> The character of any society is determined less by what it is
              actually like than by the picture it has of itself and of what it
              aspires to be. </em></p>
              <p><em>From this point of view, American society of the 1920's
              was largely middle class. Its values and aspirations were middle class,
              and power or influence within it was in the hands of middle-class
              people...</em></p>
              <p><em>...In American politics we have several parties included under the
              blanket words "Democratic" and "Republican." In oversimplified terms,
              as I have said, the Republicans were the party of the middle classes,
              and the Democrats were the party of the fringes. </em></p>
              <p><em>Both of these were
              subdivided, each with a Congressional and a National Party wing. The
              Republican Congressional Party (representing localism) was much farther
              to the Right than the National Republican Party, and as such was closer
              to the petty-bourgeois than to the upper-middle-class outlook. The
              Democratic Congressional Party was much more clearly of the fringes and
              minorities (and thus often further to the Left) than the Democratic
              National Party...</em></p>
