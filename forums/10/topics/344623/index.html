              <h1>Mugabe's Biggest Sin: Anglo-American and Chinese interests clash over Zimbabwe's strategic mineral wealth</h1>
              <p><em>By F. William Engdahl<br> Global Research, July 30, 2008 <br> <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=9707">globalresearch.ca</a></em> <br><br> Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe, presides over one of the
              world's richest minerals treasures, the Great Dyke region, which cuts a
              geological swath across the entire land from northeast to southwest.
              The real background to the pious concerns of the Bush Administration
              for human rights in Zimbabwe in the past several years is not Mugabe's
              possible election fraud or his expropriation of white settler farms. It
              is the fact that Mr. Mugabe has been quietly doing business, a lot of
              it, with the one country which has virtually unlimited need of
              strategic raw materials Zimbabwe can provide–China. Mugabe's Zimbabwe
              is, along with Sudan, on the central stage of the new war over control
              of strategic minerals of Africa between Washington and Beijing, with
              Moscow playing a supporting role in the drama. The stakes are huge.
              <br><br>Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe is a very very bad man.
              This we all know from reading the newspapers or hearing the
              pronouncements of George W. Bush, earlier Britain's Tony Blair and more
              recently Gordon Brown. In their eyes he has sinned badly. They charge
              that he is a dictator; that he has expropriated, often with violence,
              the farms of whites as part of land reform; they claim he rigged his
              re-election by vote fraud and violence; that he has ruined the economy
              of Zimbabwe.
              <br><br>Whether Robert Mugabe deserves to be in Washington's honor
              roll of villains alongside Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Milosevic,
              Ahmadinejad, and Adolf Hitler, however, it is not the reason Washington
              and London have made Zimbabwe regime change priority number one for
              their Africa policy. <br><br> What his sin is seems to have more to do with his attempts to get out
              from under Anglo-American neo-colonial serfdom dependency and to pursue
              a national economic development independent of the International
              Monetary Fund and World Bank. His real sin seems to be the fact that he
              has turned to the one nation that offers his government credits and
              soft loans for economic development with no strings attached—The
              Peoples' Republic of China. <br><br> Western media accounts conveniently tend to omit the second major party
              to what is a huge tug of war between Anglo-American interests and China
              to get control of Zimbabwe's vast mineral wealth. We should keep in
              mind that for Washington there are always "good dictators" and "bad
              dictators." The difference is whether the given dictator serves US
              national interests or not. Mugabe clearly is in the latter category. <br><br> <strong>Cecil Rhodes' legacy</strong> <br><br> Zimbabwe is the name of what under the era of British Imperialism a
              century ago was named Rhodesia. The name Rhodesia came from the British
              imperial strategist and miner, Cecil Rhodes, founder of the Rhodes
              scholarships to Oxford, and author of a plan for a vast private African
              zone, to be chartered from the Queen of England, from Egypt to South
              Africa. Cecil Rhodes created the British South Africa Company, modeled
              on the East India Company, along with his partner, L. Starr Jameson of
              Jameson Raid notoriety, to exploit the mineral riches of Rhodesia. It
              controlled what was later named Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Southern
              Rhodesia-Nyasaland. The model was that the British Government would
              assume all risks to militarily defend Rhodes' looting while Rhodes and
              his London bankers, above all Lord Rothschild, who was a close
              associate, would assume all the gains of the business. <br><br> Rhodes, a seasoned geologist, knew well that there was a remarkable
              geological fault running from the mouth of the Nile at the Gulf of Suez
              south through Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, down through today's Zimbabwe on
              to South Africa. Rhodes had already instigated several wars to gain
              control of the diamonds of Kimberly and the gold of Witwatersrand in
              South Africa. This geological phenomenon he, as well as enterprising
              German explorers, had discovered in the 1880's. They named it the Great
              Rift Valley. <br><br> Rhodesia, like South Africa after the bloody Boer wars, was settled by
              white settlers to secure future minerals gains for allied interests of
              the City of London, mainly those of the powerful Oppenheimer family and
              their gold and diamond enterprises in the region. <br><br> In 1962 when Africa was undergoing the wave of national liberation from
              colonial rule, a wave calculatedly supported by "non-colonial power"
              Washington, Rhodesia was one of the last bastions, along with former
              British colony South Africa, of white Apartheid rule. Whites in
              Rhodesia constituted only 1-2% of the total population so their methods
              of holding on to power were rather ruthless. <br><br> White supremacist Prime Minister, Ian Smith, declared Rhodesian
              independence from Britain in 1965 rather than agree to the slightest
              compromise on race or power sharing with black nationalists. Britain
              got UN trade sanctions imposed to force Smith to buckle under. Despite
              sanctions, there was considerable support from conservative business
              interests in London. Britain's Tiny Rowland, head of the Lonrho mining
              conglomerate, secured the bulk of his African profits from Rhodesian
              copper mining and related ventures under the Smith regime. The City of
              London knew very well what riches lay in Rhodesia. The question was how
              to secure enduring control. Smith's Rhodesian backers had little
              interest in giving it all to London. <br><br> Following a long and bloody struggle, in 1980 the leader of the black
              African Popular Front coalition, Robert Mugabe, overwhelmingly won
              election as the first Prime Minister of a new Zimbabwe. Twenty eight
              years later, the same Robert Mugabe is under escalating attack from the
              West, especially Zimbabwe's former colonial master, England, including
              strong economic sanctions designed to bring the country to the brink of
              collapse, to force him to open the economy to foreign (read
              Anglo-American and allied) investment. Ironically, the issue seems not
              all that different from the Ian Smith era: London and US control of the
              resources of the rich land, and Zimbabwean efforts to resist that
              control.
              <br><br> <strong>The Great Dyke</strong> <br><br>Within Zimbabwe, a portion of the rich Great Rift is called the
              Great Dyke, an intrusive geological treasure zone running over 530
              kilometers from the northeast to the southwest of the country, in
              places up to 12 kilometers wide. A river runs along the fault and the
              region is volcanically active. Here also lie vast deposits of chromium,
              of copper, platinum and other metals.
              <br><br>The US State Department, as well as London, is aware of the
              vast minerals and other riches of Zimbabwe. It states in a recent
              report on Zimbabwe, <br><br> "Zimbabwe is endowed with rich mineral resources. Exports of gold,
              asbestos, chrome, coal, platinum, nickel, and copper could lead to an
              economic recovery one day...The country is richly endowed with coal-bed
              methane gas that has yet to be exploited. <br><br> With international attractions such as Victoria Falls, the Great
              Zimbabwe stone ruins, Lake Kariba, and extensive wildlife, tourism
              historically has been a significant segment of the economy and
              contributor of foreign exchange. The sector has contracted sharply
              since 1999, however, due to the country's declining international
              image.(sic). <br><br> <strong>Energy Resources</strong> <br><br> With considerable hydroelectric power potential and plentiful coal
              deposits for thermal power station, Zimbabwe is less dependent on oil
              as an energy source than most other comparably industrialized
              countries, but it still imports 40% of its electric power needs from
              surrounding countries--primarily Mozambique. Only about 15% of
              Zimbabwe's total energy consumption is accounted for by oil, all of
              which is imported. Zimbabwe imports about 1.2 billion liters of oil per
              year. Zimbabwe also has substantial coal reserves that are utilized for
              power generation, and coal-bed methane deposits recently discovered in
              Matabeleland province are greater than any known natural gas field in
              Southern or Eastern Africa. In recent years, poor economic management
              and low foreign currency reserves have led to serious fuel shortages."
              <br><br>In short, chrome, copper, gold, platinum, huge hydroelectric
              power potential and vast coal reserves are what is at stake for
              Washington and London in Zimbabwe. The country also has unverified
              reserves of uranium, something in big demand today for nuclear power
              generation. <br><br> It is clear of late that so long as the tenacious Mugabe is running
              things, not the Anglo-Americans, but rather the Chinese, are Zimbabwe's
              preferred business partners. This seems to be Mugabe's greatest sin.
              He's not reading from the right program as George W. Bush's friends see
              it. His real sin seems to be turning East not West for economic and
              investment help.
              <br><br> <strong>The Chinese connection</strong> <br><br>During the Cold War China recognized and supported Robert
              Mugabe. In recent years as China's search for secure raw materials
              escalated its foreign diplomacy, relations have become stronger.
              According to the Chinese media, China has invested more in Zimbabwe
              than any other nation.
              <br><br>Already back in July 2005 as Tony Blair turned the sanctions
              screws tighter on Zimbabwe, Mugabe flew to Beijing to meet with the top
              Chinese leadership, where he reportedly sought an emergency loan of
              US$1 billion and asked increased Chinese involvement in the economy. <br><br> It began to bear fruit. In June 2006 state--owned Zimbabwean businesses
              signed a number of energy, mining and farming deals worth billions of
              dollars with Chinese companies. The largest was with China
              Machine-Building International Corporation, for a $1,3bn contract to
              mine coal and build thermal-power generators in Zimbabwe, to reduce
              Zimbabwe's electricity shortage. The Chinese company had already built
              thermal-power stations in Nigeria and Sudan, and had been involved in
              mining projects in Gabon.
              <br><br>In 2007 the Chinese government donated farm machinery worth
              $25 million to Zimbabwe, including 424 tractors and 50 trucks, as part
              of a $58 million loan to the Zimbabwean government. The Mugabe
              administration had previously seized white-owned farms and gave them to
              blacks, damaging machinery in the process. In return for the equipment
              and the loan the Zimbabwean government will ship 30 million kilograms
              of tobacco to the People's Republic of China.
              <br><br>Other Zimbabwe-China agreements included a deal between the
              Zimbabwe Mining Development and China's Star Communications, forming a
              joint venture to mine chrome, with funding from the China Development
              Bank. Zimbabwe also agreed to import road-building, irrigation and
              farming equipment from the China National Construction and Agricultural
              Machinery Import and Export Corporation and China Poly Group. Zimbabwe
              also relies on China for imports of telecommunications equipment,
              military hardware and many other critical items it can no longer import
              from the west because of the British-led sanctions.
              <br><br>Relations have become so important that Zimbabwe's police have
              a dedicated "China desk" to protect Chinese interests in the country.
              <br><br>In April 2007 the chairman of China's top political advisory
              body, Jia Qinglin, head of the National Committee of the Chinese
              Peoples' Political Consultative Conference, flew to Harare to meet with
              Mugabe. It was a follow-up to the 2006 Beijing China-Africa Cooperation
              Summit where the Chinese government invited the heads of more than 40
              African states to discuss relations. Africa has become a diplomatic and
              economic priority for China and its economy. <br><br> At that time, Beijing got an open invitation to help develop dormant
              mines in the country. The deputy speaker of Zimbabwe's parliament
              called for more Chinese investment in the country's mining sector,
              according to China's Xinhua news agency. Zimbabwe's mining laws were
              changed to allow the government to reallocate mining claims that were
              not being exploited. <br><br> Mining generates half of Zimbabwe's export revenue. It is the only
              sector in the country that still has foreign investors after the
              collapse of the main agricultural sector. Western companies with mining
              claims in Zimbabwe were not exploiting them. "We would appeal to the
              Chinese government to come in full force to exploit these minerals,"
              Zimbabwean Deputy Parliamentary Speaker, Kumbirai Kangai said to the
              official Xinhua.
              <br><br>Kangai assured potential Chinese investors that they would not
              expose themselves to legal action if they took over claims held by
              Western companies. <br><br> A few months after, in December 2007, Chinese company, Sinosteel
              Corporation, acquired 67 percent stake in Zimbabwe's leading
              ferrochrome producer and exporter Zimasco Holdings. Zimasco Holdings is
              the fifth largest high carbonated ferrochrome producer in the world. It
              used to produce 210,000 tons of high-carbon ferrochrome per year,
              nearly all of it along the mineral-rich Great Dyke, accounting for 4
              percent of global ferrochrome production.
              <br><br>Zimasco has also the world's second largest reserves of
              chrome, after South Africa. It was formerly owned by Union Carbide
              Corporation, now part of Dow Chemicals Corp.
              <br><br> Oh, oh! Alarm bells went ringing in London and in Washington at that news.
              <br><br>China clearly views Africa as a central part of its strategic
              plan, most notably for its oil reserves and vital raw materials such as
              copper, chrome, nickel. The continent is also at the same time becoming
              an important region for Chinese manufactured exports. But the raw
              materials battle is at the heart, and the real reason by all accounts,
              why Washington recently decided to form a separate Africa Command in
              the Pentagon. <br><br> Controlling China's economic emergence is an un-stated strategic
              priority of United States foreign and military policy and has been
              since before September 11, 2001. The only delicate point in the
              business is the fact that China, with well over $1.7 trillions of
              foreign exchange reserves, most believed in form of US Treasury
              securities, could trigger a complete dollar panic and further collapse
              of the US economy should she decide for political reasons it were too
              risky to continue holding its hundreds of billions of US dollar debt.
              In effect, by buying US Government debt with its trade surpluses, China
              has been indirectly financing US policies counter to Chinese national
              interest such as the Iraq war, or even the $100 million or so annually
              that Condi Rice's State Department spends on Tibet. <br><br> China is refusing to play by the rules of the Anglo-American
              neo-colonial game. It does not seek IMF or World Bank approval before
              dealing with African countries. It makes soft loans, regardless who
              might be running the country. In this it does nothing different from
              Washington or London. The Chinese see American influence in Africa less
              entrenched than in the rest of the world, thus offering unique
              opportunities for China to pursue its economic interests. <br><br> It may or may not be cynical. It may be Realpolitik. If it results in
              the ability of certain African countries to use China as a political
              counterweight to the one-sided Anglo-American domination of the
              Continent, that itself could be a major benefit to Africans depending
              on how they use it.
              <br><br>Clearly, it has been extremely positive for Chinese access to
              vital economic minerals for its economy as well as oil from places such
              as Darfur and southern Sudan, or Nigeria. <br><br> Mineral wealth has once more put Africa on center stage of a battle for
              mineral riches between East and West. This time, unlike during the Cold
              War era, however, Beijing is playing with far more assets, and
              Washington with far less.

              <p>Frankly i find this massive inflation rather strange, the world has never exactly ran short of very very bad men but you don't see their currency devaluing this badly. Sure Mugabe isn't an angel but he can't have been an idiot to be able to stay as President through all this unrest. </p>
              <p>Only Weimar Germany after WWI had their currency hit so badly but Zimbawe hasn't fought any wars and had to pay massive reparations.It hasn't been hit by any major natural disasters, short of those caused by the inflation itself (Chlorea, famine)</p>
              <p>A country's currency is only as valuable depending on how governments and Forex traders are willing to pay for them. I'm sure Mugabe's favoring China has something to do with its currency being devalued to this extent.</p>
