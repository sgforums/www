            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>="Johnnian"][quote="robertteh"][quote="acotis"]Robertteh,<br><br>It is dangerous to generalise like you did. You speak as if you are very sure of the internal budgetting of the government. Are you? Do you actually gather information on their accounts and after much tabulation realise that the taxes are actually used more to cover losses? No offence, but i find it hard to accept your argument. If you have detailed evidence, please provide them.</blockquote>Robertteh<br>Dangerous - based on whose perception? Is it not dangerous to deny problems or access to assets as requested by ex-president Ong Teng Cheong in that problems will become greater if there is no accountability and transparency on asset management on the part of government.<br><br>Is it not more dangerous if people cannot see what is being done to their monies with clearly established facts and good corporate governance?<br><br><blockquote>Taxes are meant to cover the government's operational costs. They fund a range of support services that the government provides for the citizens. Some goes to helping the poor break the poverty cycle, for example. Theres no free lunch in this world. By using the phrase "double taxation" you have just insinuated that the government spends too much in access for too little in return. Can you prove that? </blockquote>Robertteh<br>Lands acquired by the government under the Land Acquisition Act belong to the people. If so, has the HDB the morality to charge HDB Flats at or close to market values plus inclusion of land costs again. Is this not double charging for land or double taxation?<br><br><blockquote>I appreciate a good argument. If it is well supported, I will have no choice but to concur. But unproven claims do not make a good argument.</blockquote>Robertteh<br>For the rest of major policy errors please visit page 11 of "Definition of True Democracy" thread of www.sgforums.com under "Speakers' Corner". I have given many suggestions with facts to Feedback Unit since 2001 such as the danger to produce many educated unemployed under persistent academic education system etc. I have also pointed that it is wrong for government to compete against people for business in the domestic sector of economy. Many other suggestions are awaiting their attention and I hope they will consider citizens' views and make changes.<br><br>So I do not just criticise wrong policies but I am giving them suggestions. Do not get me wrong that I am anti-government or criticising without facts.<br><br><blockquote>Did they includes land cost? I dunno, still young havnt buy HDB yet. So you means when we buy the HDB flat ... there is a sub fee on the land itself ? Is the fee huge? or its just the maintenance fee of the land rather than the requisition of the land?<br><br>If it is the maintenance fee of the land, then how much ? Our surroundings is actually quite nice with garden etc. I dont mind paying that maintenance.</blockquote>Robertteh<br><br>The first principle in any human progress is without doubt openness, discussions and deliberations as it is only when majority of citizens are interested to contribute to the governance that there could be the best solutions and choices that lead to progress and competitiveness.<br><br>Singapore leaders have been promoting a system to cultivate the bests of crop of the cream. Fair enough, we need to motivate people to study hard and excel there is no disagreement with such a system of meritocracy.<br><br>However, such a system may be too narrow that tend to confine to promotion of the academics and public administration without broad-based practical knowledge application and related entrepreneurship and creativity in the population.<br><br>Singaporeans have been denied of many opportunities to train the people to excel in applying practical knowledge applications and innovations. The great number of elites produced by our academic system of education have not upgraded our competitiveness or entrepreneurship or nurturing of a more innovative and knowledge application society.<br><br>Many academicians produced are now joining the rank of the unemployed because there do not possess the passions or drive or other practical abilities to become economically competitive or create jobs. This failure of our academic education system is very clear for all to see.<br><br>The one-party system is anti-progress and anti-mass participation in knowledge application.<br><br>Today the leaders still cannot see their own lack of understanding of what work in the actual world. They are still persisting in their past shortcomings and all the academic assumptions. They are the ones to have to change before the moribund economy can turn around.</div>

They now can only keep talking about educations, importing more outside talents and not knowing enough how to make the citizens pursue innovations and knowledge application to develop their own strengths and resources to the fullest.<br><br>Can they do something more practical - motivate all citizens with lesser talks about their own kind of academic excellence. Go and promote practical knowledge application and innovations across the whole population. But more people must understand and ask for such change then the government will change.</div>

They will be postponing solutions to problems by such system of selective comparison with worse countries while avoiding comparison on an apple-to-apple basis. Their selective comparison has been their hallmark of governing the country so far.<br><br>Unless citizens understand the importance of objective comparisons,they will be confused by all the claims.
