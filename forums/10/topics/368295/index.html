              <p><strong>The Star Online, 15 Jul 2009, FINTAN NG</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Economists: Jump in Singapore’s GDP one-off</strong></span><br> <br> PETALING JAYA: Singapore may have seen some stabilisation in economic
              numbers following a big jump in its second-quarter gross domestic
              product (GDP) by 20.4% on an annualised basis,<span style="color: red;"><strong>but it will not be sustainable as the country’s economy is still reliant on exports.</strong></span><br> <br> Economists believe the country’s economic recovery, as with the rest of
              Asia would hinge on demand for the region’s exports from the G3 nations
              comprising the United States, Japan and the European Union.<br> <br> Standard Chartered Bank economist Alvin Liew said given the way
              Singapore’s economy was structured; with a reliance on exports, there
              would still be a decline for the year although it had stabilised
              compared with the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter this year.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>He said Singapore’s second quarter
              GDP growth was the exception rather than the rule compared with the
              rest of South-East Asia because a substantial portion of the
              manufacturing sector comprised pharmaceuticals.</strong></span><br> <br> Singapore’s trade and industry ministry released the country’s GDP data
              yesterday that showed pharmaceuticals helped to boost growth in the
              second quarter with manufacturing falling only 1.5% year-on-year
              against a contraction of 24% in the previous quarter.<br> <br> Besides the positive picture in manufacturing, <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>construction rose 18% while services dropped 5.1%.<br> </strong></span> <br> “Pharmaceuticals make up more than 20% of Singapore’s manufacturing
              sector, with the exception of Japan, that’s not the case for most of
              Asia,” Liew told StarBiz.<br> <br> Both United Overseas Bank Ltd economist Ho Woei Chen and
              Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd treasury research and strategy head
              Selena Ling said the <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>performance of the pharmaceuticals segment was not representative of the economy.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>“It’s very difficult to see as the figures are very volatile and swing from month to month.<br> <br> “If we take the segment out, the electrical and electronic segment is still contracting as there’s no demand,”</strong></span> Ho said.<br> <br> She has revised the GDP figures for the year upwards to a contraction of 5% compared with a drop of 7.5% earlier.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“We’re still seeing a fall in the
              services sector due to a lack of domestic demand. Only the financial
              services segment is supporting the sector but the rest of the sector is
              still down,” </strong></span>Ho said.<br> <br> Ling said there could be any number of reasons for the jump in
              pharmaceutical output. “It could be due to the A (H1N1) flu pandemic,”
              she said.<br> <br> She added that given the low base in the second-half of last year, it
              was likely that there would be a recovery at the end of this year.<br> <br> Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley Research analysts led by Tan Deyi said in a
              report that with the second-quarter GDP advance estimate, the first
              half was now tracking at a contraction of 6.7% year-on-year.<br> <br> “We’re marking to market our 2009 GDP forecast from minus 10%
              year-on-year to minus 5% year-on-year to take this into account,” she
              said.<br> <br> Tan said that the forecast for the year incorporated a gradual
              turnaround in the non-pharmaceuticals segments but also assumed a
              certain normalisation of pharmaceuticals output in the second half.<br> <br> “With the bottom now behind us, the focus has shifted from how deep and how long to what kind of recovery,” she said.<br> <br> --------------------------------<br> <br> <strong>Latest update @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
