            <div class='col-md body'>the letter has a typical sporean style of writing (or speaking for the matter)....<br><br>even if her intent is good, she cannot help herself and added the `prizes' she acquired or could acquire along the way; MBA's, BMWs...etc....<br><br>what's wrong with `we could acquire a bigger car but opted for a smaller one, paying in cash'...or `we are both educated with high employability...", etc.?<br><br>her intent is to push home the point of being savvy with money, not her background. being savvy with money unfortunately has got nothing to do with how much education u have. it's common sense. it is the malaise that the gahmen has inculcated in sgporean minds that is causing the issue today.<br><br>i dun know if u notice, but speaking with some colleagues here, they will say, "wait, let me drive my beemer over" instead of `car'. or conversations with long lost frens who r keen to know where u live and what car u drive now...<br><br>we are so friggingly brainwashed into going for aspirational material thing that i shudder to think what our future generations will become.<br><br>younger kids hv mobile now, but that's not it. it's what mobile they have is what matters....which destination of hols u take, further the better, got snow will score more muffin points....<br><br>even if we meant well, we cannot help but add a touch of material bull$hit along the way to push home a personal point that they belongs to the `haves' and it's just that they r not flaunting it...and just how pathetic is that?</div>
