                                faiths, says Vivian<br> By Goh Chin Lian<br> A Cabinet minister yesterday appealed to religious leaders to speak up

                                 said such rebuttals of offending remarks will assure people from other 
                                religions that the offensive views were not held by the religion's 
                                mainstream.<br> <br> Doing so also avoids a clash if religious leaders from another faith 
                                join in the fray.<br> The minister was addressing about 300 participants of the National 
                                Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle (IRCC) workshop yesterday,

              It's insulting to the opposition; dangerous in the unnecessary 
                                paranoia it belies in a ruling Prime Minister; and divisive in it's 
                                establishment of the precedence it sets that politicians are ought to 
                                play sides, not for the good of the nation, but for the benefit of their
                                 own supporters, pockets and prestige.<br> <br> Politics in Singapore has gone down the drain.<br> <br> The 'Business of Leadership', once a hallowed profession in Singapore 
                                has since become a 'family business' where profit ranks above principle,
                                 where power surpasses the people, where market monopoly seems the name 
                                of the game.<br> <br> Singapore is not a nation, it's not a country. Singapore is a family 
                                business. <br> <br> Of all the subsidiaries in the land, what its leaders and Ministers are 
                                paid is pegged to what the most financially successful CEOs/ 
                                professionals of the land are paid in any one year. <br> <br> Maybe that's why [quote]<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/206313/1/.html">PM Lee says countries worldwide respect and admire

              <p>Why will a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm"><strong>‘Drama Queen’</strong> </a>- who is at the same time a confirmed <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Narcissist"><strong>“narcissist”</strong></a> - be such a pessimist towards politicians and politics ?</p>
              <p>Is there some drama to be expected at the end of its preference to wait out the situation, and let the drama unfold by itself ?</p>
              <p>Without politics can society function ?</p>
              <p>The morals of politicians depend as much on the community - that set the political standards that are to be tolerated and accepted - as it is for each and every indiviudal that are members of the community of citizens.</p>
              <p> When citizens prefer to sit on the fence and let the situation rot - it will also end up in the gutter that it allows to exist without any effort to make things better for itself.</p>
