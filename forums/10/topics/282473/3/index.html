As for simplistic trolls who have nothing better to do then to make fun of people's comments in order to raise your thread counts (could be a silly reason but a viable one for fools as such), please rest assure that I will do anything within my means to get you kicked out. Learn to show respect for others and others will respect you. Or carry on reading your favorite papers and keep your peace.<br><br>To all folks, sorry I was away on an overseas trip these few months.

            <div class='col-md body'>I consider myself half Burmese and half Singaporean because I lived 10 years in Burma and 10 years in Singapore. (I'm now in America and I'm 23. I left Singapore when I was 20.) My heart fiercely burns in patriotism for Burma <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> Singapore.<br><br>Obviously, this is a topic close to my heart. I cry thinking about it.<br><br>After reading some of your replies, I feel quite dejected.<br><br>Like I always knew, some people really don't care and talk about us like we're nobodies - trash. It feels... really terrible. What I'm pleading with you all is this...  please..... don't. It really hurts. It hurts more than the military gunning us down.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ceecookie:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmph..cant be bothered with a Third World nation.As agreed,no point using sanctions...i rather the Americans just use the nuclear bombs to destroy Burma once and for all</div></blockquote>Destroy Burma? What about the innocent people who are the majority? Everyone, suprisingly inhumane as it is, this is the mindset millions of people have of Burma. Burma's such a hassle; It's such a nuisance. Just wanna wipe it away and get it done and over with. I mean, you've got enough problems in your daily life already. Don't need more. Everyone hates to hear our cries. Like flies, they just wanna smash us with their palms.<br><br>I really need the help of everyone. <span style="font-style: italic;">We</span> really need the help of everyone. Because most people are just standing and watching, pretending not to know it or comforting themselves that it's okay to ignore it because it's not their country and we're strangers. But the truth is we are all connected to one another.<br><br>I mean, it's been too long. It's time to set us free. Please God, set us free. I'm sooooo tired of being in a prison. Mental or physical.<br><br>I personally don't ask for anything except to acknowledge us. Acknowledge this problem. Talk to a friend. Tell your family. Think about it to yourself. For one second a day. Or a nano second. Anything. By that, even if I die, at least I know that I was once in your heart and you thought about me. Just don't close one eye and pretend living like nothing's happening to us.<br><br>Thank you all for reading. That helps too.<br><br></div>
