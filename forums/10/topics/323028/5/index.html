              <p>The rule of thumb for property investment is Location, Location and Location. And property investment is about capital appreciation and rental income. Hence by buying something cheap, i can assure you that your rental returns will also cheap. What sort of rental ROI are you getting for your property right now? I am expecting at least a 4-5% from my investment property and my mortgage interest is about 3.0% per year.</p>

              <p>The rule of thumb for property investment is Location, Location
                  and Location. And property investment is about capital appreciation
                  and rental income. Hence by buying something cheap, i can assure
                  you that your rental returns will also cheap. What sort
                  of rental ROI are you getting for your property right
                  now? I am expecting at least a 4-5% from my investment
                  property and my mortgage interest is about 3.0% per year.</p>
              <p>Singapore dollar has appreciated against the US$ by over 30% in
                  the last 2 years or so, if I have investment in US
                  real estate, I would have easily lost about 50% of
                  the real value in Singapore Dollar term. Care to explain why
                  investing in US is a smarter move?</p>
              <p>Btw, when did you enter the real estate market? And as
                  a student how did you managed to get mortgage loans? Did you take
                  up subprime loans?  </p>

              <p>The Singaporean dollar however depreciated against the Australian dollar. I would love to go back shopping now if I wasn't so busy because it is so cheap now. I remember a time when AUD equalised against SGD.</p>
