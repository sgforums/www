              than anything me and my parents can imagine and you are below the
              age of 30.</p>
              <p>You claim that your first property is worth US$70,000, so I am

              meltdown?</p>
              <p>Contrary to what you are saying the subprime crisis does affect
              everyone in USA and the world. subprime &gt; credit crisis

              <p><br>i may be naive, but at least i am not as childish as you are.</p>
              <p>so what if jojo claimed this and that. if you are really amatured adult, you'll ignore it. Anyways, i judged you based on your previous posts. you are really very childish. FYI, i can read and understand whats going on, i am not that naive.</p>
              <p>When i ,mean that you are finding fault is not about you trying to figure out what jojo's multiple properties are. Look at yourself, you are finding loopholes in anything others that oppose you said. Thats finding fault.</p>
              <p>Anyways, how am I lying to you? BS? I assume that its a vulgarity and I am mature enough to let it go and forgive you.</p>
              <p>One more point. I see that you love to ask for others for evidence for this and that claim, but when others asked about yours, you keep avoiding them or giving excuses or change to another topic. Whats up with that?</p>

              <p>You claim that you own multiple properties in US, then I am sure you must be the best person in this forum to share with us <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your views</span> on the real estate situation in America. You claim that not everyone is affected by subprime, with that I assume you are also trying to tell us that your property investment is still healthy, hence I am asking you which property (beside manhattan luxury apartment) is not affected by subprime meltdown.</p>
              <p>You also claim that your property investment is beyond me and my parent's imagination, now I am asking you how BIG (TUA) is your property investment in US.</p>
              <p>Btw, this thread is about below 30 owning multiple property, so can you please stop making those insults and remarks? Are you finding it hard to back up what you said? If you are, you can always tell me so that I will stop asking you further question about your property investment in the United States of America.</p>

              <p><br>i may be naive, but at least i am not as childish as you are.</p>
              <p>so what if jojo claimed this and that. if you are really amatured adult, you'll ignore it. Anyways, i judged you based on your previous posts. you are really very childish. FYI, i can read and understand whats going on, i am not that naive.</p>
              <p>When i ,mean that you are finding fault is not about you trying to figure out what jojo's multiple properties are. Look at yourself, you are finding loopholes in anything others that oppose you said. Thats finding fault.</p>
              <p>Anyways, how am I lying to you? BS? I assume that its a vulgarity and I am mature enough to let it go and forgive you.</p>
              <p>One more point. I see that you love to ask for others for evidence for this and that claim, but when others asked about yours, you keep avoiding them or giving excuses or change to another topic. Whats up with that?</p>
