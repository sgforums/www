              <p>Jojo,</p>
              <p>1) we are talking about property investment, why are you switcing to income? As a property investor, how can you not be affected if your investment property value continue to slide and your neighbour house are being foreclosed by banks?</p>
              <p>2) Surrounding is not location? A seaview is not location? near to Shopping mall and school is not location?</p>
              <p>3) you mean all your invesment properties which spread across few states are fully paid with your saving and you are a student under the age of 30. You TUA KANG BOH? </p>
              <p>4) You are afraid to tell us because you are afraid that I will blow your cover right?</p>

              <p>It is possible to own multiple properties before age 30. I own 2 and I am hitting 30 soon.One in the city and one in the subrural side of Australia. 2 is still a multiple.</p>
              <p>In the US, property prices are actually far cheaper. The cost of  mercedes benz in Singapore could get you a nice property in middle class suburb.</p>

              <p>If she buys in rural and suburban  areas bordering  their USA state capital city zones, she can own at least 4 properties easily. If she had got into the market early, she could own at least 7 before she is 30.</p>
