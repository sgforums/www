              <p>Thats where you are wrong. Investing in property it is always
              about location and the reason why certain property commmand a
              higher price than the rest is not because it is overpriced, it
              is because there is a demand for such property and there is good
              rental returns.</p>
              <p>Buying low doesnt mean it is cheap, because when you sell it
              will still be low.</p>
              <p>For example, an apartment at Ardmore area was priced at around
              S$1500 psf before the recent property boom and it shot up as high
              as S$3,300 within 2 years. Do you get to see similar rise in
              cheap Mass market property?</p>
              <p>Good guess, but wrong one.  </p>

              <p>The problem with your thinking is that you limit yourself to just <strong>tiny</strong> Singapore, where developments are already saturated.</p>
              <p>In land rich countries. There are still plenty of development potentials and opportunities.</p>
              <p>Obviously you've never heard of land banking.</p>
              <p>Some people just buy a piece of empty land out in the boonies.</p>
              <p>When the developers comes. The value of that piece of land goes up many times.</p>
              <p>Many people earn money that way, but it is a risky deal.</p>

              <p>Jojo,</p>
              <p>1) we are talking about property investment, why are you
                              switcing to income? As a property investor, how can you not be
                              affected if your investment property value continue to slide and
                              your neighbour house are being foreclosed by banks?</p>
              <p>2) Surrounding is not location? A seaview is not location? near
                              to Shopping mall and school is not location?</p>
              <p>3) you mean all your invesment properties which spread
                              across few states are fully paid with your saving and you are a
                              student under the age of 30. You TUA KANG BOH? </p>
              <p>4) You are afraid to tell us because you are afraid that I
                              will blow your cover right?</p>

              <p>I never say if fully paid.. I said the appreciation has covered the cost.. so even if I sell now.. I make no loss. If I rent out.. I no need money out my pocket..this part you don understand ah ? I think you very hopeless.</p>
              <p>So what if you know ? can you verify???? You're starting to seem like an autistic kid.</p>

              I'm only trying to explained that seems most people purchased their property with loans , it eventually made it look like a liability. In sg context the risk of devalued property is not common but in countries such a malaysia, US and europe the risk is quite enimient... Can you see the what happening to the US now? <br></blockquote>

              <p>1) we are talking about property investment, why are you switcing to income? As a property investor, how can you not be affected if your investment property value continue to slide and your neighbour house are being foreclosed by banks?</p>
              <p>2) Surrounding is not location? A seaview is not location? near to Shopping mall and school is not location?</p>
              <p>3) you mean all your invesment properties which spread across few states are fully paid with your saving and you are a student under the age of 30. You TUA KANG BOH? </p>
              <p>4) You are afraid to tell us because you are afraid that I will blow your cover right?</p>
