              <p>Actually I can answer A, B , C (indirect).</p>
              <p>A. If  one didn't take out 100% mortgage but instead covered it by at least a 40% deposit , one won't be hit by subprime crisis. USA is a country with alot of people living on credit and there are alot of <strong>high risk borrowers (meaning  - income sucks and credit history is sh*t) </strong>who hope to refinance their loans later. They got hit by the real estate devaluation. That is my simple understanding. For those with cash to buy out these people , they will make the money quickly. With some crisis , there will be people who lose everything and there will be people who make a quick buck as the noveau riche.</p>
              <p>B. It is not all about location. Anyone who has a real estate property knows that well enough.</p>
              <p>C. She could be studying part-time? She could have other investments? I remember that she said something about inheritance, correct me if I am wrong. Usually inheritance money can be used to invest ....so she could have easily financed a mortgage if she had a fair amount. Cash is always good, you know?</p>

              point my point.</p>
              <p>a) You claim that not everyone is affected by Sub-prime crisis
              and yet you cant name me a place in america where the
              property prices have not been affect by subprime meltdown</p>
              <p>b) You claim the investing in property is not about location in
              American and there are other factors. But you are not able to tell
              us what are these factors</p>
              <p>c) You claim that you invest in multiply properties in several
              states and you are a student studing in USA. And yet you cant tell
              us how you managed to secure so much mortgage loans as a
              student.</p>
              <p>d) You cant even tell us when exactly did you enter the US
              property market</p>

              <p>If you borrowed 1 million from the bank to finance a property and the market went down, your loss is 500k and you still have to pay <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 million plus interest</span> to your bank. You cannot sell the property because you will still be in debt to the bank . The bank usually raise interest rates when here is too much borrowing - that is because the bank has to borrow from someone else to lend you money.  In some countries, how interest rates are raised are regulated but in the USA , it is a free for all issue.</p>
              <p>When we talk about a high risk borrower  , the value of their assets is far less than the amount they borrowed and their job cannot pay for the mortgage let alone the interest. Combined with a devalued market price , they still will be in debt to the bank even after they sell all their assets and the property. That is the making of a bankrupt .</p>
              <p>Now when a person has already paid 100% of the property value using their OWN money, their loss is personal . They  do not own the bank money. They can just hammer their heads against the wall.</p>
              <p> </p>

The bank usually raise interest rates when here is too much borrowing - that is because the bank has to borrow from someone else to lend you money.  In some countries, how interest rates are raised are regulated but in the USA , it is a free for all issue.</p>
              <p>When we talk about a high risk borrower  , the value of their assets is far less than the amount they borrowed and their job cannot pay for the mortgage. Combined with a devalued market price , they still will be in debt to the bank even after they sell all their assets and the property. That is the making of a bankrupt .</p>
              <p>Now when a person has already paid 100% of the property value using their OWN money, their loss is personal . They  do not own the bank money. They can just hammer their heads against the wall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is as simple as I can explain it. <strong>As for B , if you own property for investment, you should have known what other factors to consider.</strong></p>

              <p>Basically what you are saying is that investors should only be concern if they are in debt and it is ok if the value of their hard earn money which they put into investment has devalued by 50%.</p>
              <p>Am I right?</p>
