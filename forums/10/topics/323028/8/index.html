              <p>Yeap. Cheap bargains - buy from those foreign investors who have to sell because they cannot afford to fork out mortgage payments. The key is to tell them the price you want to pay  with a take it or leave it attitude.</p>

              <p>Thats where you are wrong. Investing in property it is always about location and the reason why certain property commmand a higher price than the rest is not because it is overpriced, it is because there is a demand for such property and there is good rental returns.</p>
              <p>Buying low doesnt mean it is cheap, because when you sell it will still be low.</p>
              <p>For example, an apartment at Ardmore area was priced at around S$1500 psf before the recent property boom and it shot up as high as S$3,300 within 2 years. Do you get to see similar rise in cheap Mass market property?</p>
              <p>Good guess, but wrong one.  </p>

              <p>I tink u are missing my point.</p>
              <p>Overpriced does not mean expensive, it means priced above it's inherent value. I tink you have to be clear about that.</p>

              <p>I think £ Ä¬ €Ú° has a disease called "the man with a hammer syndrome" described by Charlie Munger.</p>
              <p>People behave irrationally when they have a couple models of how the world works,
              and then apply everything to that model.  "To the man with a hammer, every problem

              <p>£ Ä¬ €Ú° thinks that everyone are losing money in properties due to the subprime issue.</p>
              <p>An advice to £ Ä¬ €Ú°:</p>
              <p>Better to have
              lots of tools in the toolbox. If not, this leads to confirmation bias. </p>

              <p>How can you compare a potential asset(house) vs a sure liability(car)?</p>
              <p>Potential asset as in selling the house at a higher valuation or earning positive rental income after all monthly expenses. If not, your house will be a liability.</p>
              <p>I have nothing to say if you are refering to a car rental company as an asset. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
