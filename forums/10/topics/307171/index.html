              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Singapore
              				Democrats <br>10 Feb 08 </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Former Singapore
              				solicitor-general and Law Society president Mr Francis Seow filed
              				an affidavit in support of the SDP in the lawsuit against Mr Lee
              				Kuan Yew and son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Lees sued the
              				Singapore Democrats and its executive members over an article
              				which the party published drawing parallels between the NKF
              				scandal and the way the PAP runs Singapore. <br><br>The High
              				Court awarded the Lees the case without giving the SDP a fair
              				trial despite the fact that the defendants had filed their
              				defence and raised the fact that there were disputes in fact and
              				law.<br><br>The judiciary will now decide how much the Lees have
              				to be paid in damages in a hearing. Mr Seow filed an affidavit
              				last week as a witness for the Singapore Democrats. In it, he
              				refuted the claims made by the Lees that they are worth the
              				amounts they claim (see below). <br><br>Earlier, the SDP and two
              				other defendants Ms Chee Siok Chin and Dr Chee Soon Juan, filed
              				their <a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlenkflawsuit26.html"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Affidavit
              				Evidence in Chief</span></a>, stating that the reputations
              				of the Lees have inflated by the system they control. <br><br>Mr
              				Seow has stated that he stands ready to be cross-examined at the
              				hearing. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Affidavit of
              				Mr Francis Seow<br><br></strong>I, Francis T Seow, do hereby make oath
              				and say as follows:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.
              				I am a witness for the defendants in this suit.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2.
              				I was the former Solicitor-General of Singapore and the former
              				President of<br>the Law Society of Singapore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3.
              				As the former Solicitor-General, I have some knowledge of how the
              				Government works under the Lee Kuan Yew (LKY). From my
              				interactions with him, there is no doubt that LKY is bent on the
              				total control of the Singaporean society.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4.
              				The use of the Internal Security Act (ISA) to quarantine and
              				rehabilitate his political opponents, the wholesale subjugation
              				of the print and broadcast media, the prohibition of public
              				protests, and ironically the use of defamation laws have all had
              				one effect: To silence opposing views in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5.
              				I was one of his victims. I was arrested and detained without
              				trial under the ISA for opposing LKY's ways and his autocratic
              				policies. My experience under detention is recounted in my book
              				<em>To Catch A Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's Prison</em> published by the prestigious Yale University Southeast Asia
              				Studies. Pertinently, no one, not even the ever-litigious Lee
              				Kuan Yew, has challenged the accuracy of what I had related in my
              				book.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6.
              				During my imprisonment I was told during my interrogators that
              				they were going to neutralize me and that I should give up my
              				idea of going into politics:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"So,
              				you think, you can take on and bully the second-generation
              				leaders? Well, our job is to make sure that you do not succeed.
              				We are here to neutralize you. You know, to neutralize you! For
              				your infomatioon, Lee Kuan Yew is running for another term. And
              				you will be locked up here for at least two years, if not more.
              				So, where will you be? You can give up all your ideas of going
              				into politics." (Francis T Seow, To Catch A Tartar: A
              				Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's Prison published, Yale University
              				Southeast Asia Studies, 1994).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7.
              				If the State can treat the country's former solicitor-general in
              				such a contemptible manner, how much more can it intimidate the
              				ordinary citizen â€“ such is the persecution of dissenters
              				and opponents of the PAP Government?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8.
              				When his political opponents and dissidents are persecuted few
              				would dare join the ranks of the opposition, much less stand for
              				elections. Given such an arrangement it is no wonder that the PAP
              				is repeatedly returned to power. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9.
              				When such an undemocratic practice is in place, how does the
              				plaintiff claim that he is the duly elected leader of Singapore?
              				And yet, Lee Hsien Loong (LHL) pretends that he operates in a
              				democracy and claims that his position in the Government is a
              				mandate given by Singaporeans. He has inherited the system put in
              				place by his father.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">10.
              				The effulgence with which the media speaks of the plaintiff is
              				not without contrivance. Journalists and editors who have been
              				critical of LKY and the system he devised have been detained
              				without trial, and newspapers that have demonstrated an
              				independent streak have been closed. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">11.
              				Legislation has been passed to prohibit news organizations
              				without Government control from being established. The Singapore
              				Press Holdings which publishers all of Singapore's newspapers is
              				chaired by Tony Tan, LKY's protÃ©gÃ© and former
              				deputy prime minister. Dr Tan's predecessor is Lim Kim San, a
              				former cabinet minister and loyal friend of LKY.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">12.
              				With the media in the hands of LKY and those close to him, it is
              				not possible for a balanced view of LHL to emerge.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">13.
              				There is no getting away from the fact that the political system
              				that the PAP has devised in Singapore is not a democratic one. In
              				fact the PAP Government thrives on fear. LKY himself boasted
              				that: "<em>If nobody is afraid of me, I'm meaningless."</em> (Lee Kuan Yew, <em>The Singapore Story: The Man and His Ideas, </em>1998). </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">14.
              				Only those operating within the PAP system will agree that the
              				system is not designed to inflate the plaintiff's reputation and
              				to curtail opposing views. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">15.
              				Given such a climate of fear and intimidation, there can be only
              				be praise of the plaintiff. His critics, especially the prominent
              				ones, have all been silenced. Given such a scenario, LHL's
              				reputation is based on his own opinion and those of his minions.
              				This is no way to assess a plaintiff's reputation especially in a
              				court of law.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.99in; margin-right: 2.15in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">16.
              				To obtain a reliable and valid assessment, a broader spectrum of
              				views and opinions must be sought especially from persons/groups
              				who are not within the control of the Singapore Government. </span></p>
