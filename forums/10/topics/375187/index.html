              <div><br></div>
              <div>September 11, 2009</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span>Jim Rogers talked about US dollars while
              he was attending the China International Financial Services Conference
              (CIFSC) held in Guangzhou on September 10, 2009.<br><br>Rogers believes
              that the last 50 years is U.S. government's journey into a huge debt
              and the U.S. government's decision-makers are still repeating this
              mistake. <br><br>Measures taken by countries to rescue the economy is
              continuously printing banknotes, which will lead to inflation (except
              energy prices), and this process will not be interrupted unless there
              are more banks close down. <br><br>Europe and the United States
              government have fallen into the vicious cycle of "issue bonds -
              inflation - issue more bonds – inflation again". I will not buy more
              United States Treasury bonds because the government is constantly
              printing more banknotes. The world will never be a lack of U.S.
              dollars. I will buy oil, minerals and stock of those companies which
              are engaged in the real economy. <br><br>US dollar economy has
              encountered major problems, the dollar index fell to a new low, and it
              will continue to fall. If the dollar rebounds in the future, I will
              sell all the U.S. dollars. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My whole family has moved to live in Asia.
              The story of the United States is over. A new story belongs to China.</strong></span><br><br>With
              regard to the U.S. Treasury bonds, Rogers thinks that both the U.S.
              bond market bubble and the crisis are growing. He could not tell when
              and how the bubble will burst, but he thinks lending money to creditors
              for 30 years and only takes 3% to 4% annual interest rate is a very
              unreasonable. </span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span>In the short term, because there are more people to buy
              U.S. Treasury bonds, interest rates will be cut for a short time, but
              on the long run interest rates will surely rise. Therefore, China
              should further expand the U.S. Treasury holdings, or else China will
              suffer losses. </span></div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>Jim Rogers is an american citizen, but once he sees that U.S is of no use to him as an investor, he shifts his whole family to the next best place to make money. If China is of no use to him, he will move house again.</div>

              <p>Jim Rogers is now a Singapore citizen. But he already made clear, several times, that his ultimate destination will be China. He will move to, where the money is. <br><br>His loyalty is not nationhood, fellowman, idealism but money, money and money. But read any futurist book, clearly the US will be in the decline.

              <p>Get a grip.</p>
              <p>The reason why US had to print more money is because rich assholes like him are hoarding money either at home or in private banks, causing a shortage of US dollars around the world.</p>
              <p>The only way to force out these rich bastards is to print more US dollars to ease the shortage and demand for trade.</p>
              <p>When the US govt does that, selfish bastards like him saw the US dollar sinking as the value gets lesser with each new printing, which is a good thing for the ordinary people, as demand for cheaper US goods and tourism will rise, creating more employment, resulting a general recovery.</p>
              <p>Of course he now claims all kinds of bullshit against the US govt. His selfish hoarding on US dollars' value had sunk.</p>
              <p>US is a modern consumerist society. When they have money, they will spend, and will result in the world's general recovery. For those who think US will sink, think twice. How much do you think Kansas, one of the numerous foodbelt of US, will be worth, if put on sale(IF bankrupt, and a heavy IF) ,  to oil rich desert barran land govts? </p>
              <p>Jim Rogers is just another greed filled selfish capitalist cowboy without a damn to the american people, and am certainly no angel, and a disgrace to our citizenship.</p>

              <p>Which comes first - the egg or the chicken?</p>
              <p>The US govt is only administrators of the American People, and had been eversince they booted the repressive colonial brits out. They can pass laws and regulate biz enterprises, but ultimately, biz owners had always gotten a free hand in how they run their biz.</p>
              <p>With their money, comes power to manipulate events within the administration, as seen by their strong lobby groups. Fortunately, the US have a robust political system despite of its flaws, made up of decent and matured people, and had been capable of stopping the worse excesses of such manipulation by powerful corporate biz industrial complexes from time to time.</p>
              <p>But still, such manipulators had a free hand in the market place, for US is not a communist state, and it was these money grabbers' greed that led to our current financial crises. These capitalists are no angels for sure. They may donate some of their gains, but when compared on PERCENTAGES based on their total asset value, it is only akin to a few cents to the common laymen who is donating in dollars.</p>
              <p>They are not Robin Hood. Nor am I calling for socialism or communism. I believe that there must be an element of greed in order for economies to thrive, to feed the masses. But capitalist manipulators and assholes such as Jim Rogers wants the whole cake for himself, heck if he cant swallow it all, he would rather let it rot, as shown by his despicabilities to sell US dollars now after hoarding it when the world needs it most. He is part of blame, and people like him - a large part.</p>

I will not buy more United States Treasury bonds because the government is constantly printing more banknotes. The world will never be a lack of U.S. dollars. I will buy oil, minerals and stock of those companies which are engaged in the real economy.<br><br>US dollar economy has encountered major problems, the dollar index fell to a new low, and it will continue to fall. If the dollar rebounds in the future, I will sell all the U.S. dollars. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My whole family has moved to live in Asia. The story of the United States is over. A new story belongs to China.</strong></span><br><br>With regard to the U.S. Treasury bonds, Rogers thinks that both the U.S. bond market bubble and the crisis are growing. He could not tell when and how the bubble will burst, but he thinks lending money to creditors for 30 years and only takes 3% to 4% annual interest rate is a very unreasonable.</span></div>

              <div><span>In the short term, because there are more people to buy U.S. Treasury bonds, interest rates will be cut for a short time, but on the long run interest rates will surely rise. Therefore, China should further expand the U.S. Treasury holdings, or else China will suffer losses.</span></div>
