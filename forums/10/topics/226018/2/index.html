The good time for Singapore had past, face the fact that job is difficult to find here for high paid professional. The only way is to lower expectation and life still goes on. Enough of hearing the problem the gahment had, we can't expect them to spoon feed us. The crisis we r facing is a long term one, I dun expect the good time to come back again.</div>
