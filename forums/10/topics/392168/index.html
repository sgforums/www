              <p>I'm a resident of this particular condo, Baywater located within the Bedok Reservoir proximity. Recently, I have been greatly disturbed by this ongoing construction work happening at the Waterfront Key, which is situated just beside my residential area. I was informed that there's a particular rule stating that all construction works ought to stop by 7pm. The time now is 2.23am and the construction team are still contributing to the loud noises despite them having receive the fines from the NEA.</p>
              <p>This turmoil started when I was having a family dinner at around 7 in the evening. When our gathering ended at 11pm, the noise still persisted on. As a result,my father called up the police and in return, they wanted us to call up the NEA; claiming that they are not in charge of such cases (they said that they only take charge of HDB cases, which I don't quite get what they're driving at).</p>
              <p>We then turned to the NEA to complain about this matter. Though the authorities did look up into the matter and had issued fines (which is of accordance to their standard procedures), the construction works continued.</p>
              <p>After 4-5 calls made to the NEA and 2 calls to the police, nothing beneficial to us was done to put an end to the problem. As such, we decided to make a final call to the police. I was very frustrated and questioned the person in-charge whether the police force would step into this matter as the NEA remains incapable of resolving the issue. She answered me, saying that the police can only refer the case to the NEA and blah blah blah...The most absurd thing was that she can even giggle a little, and after which told me that I should go to the media or the MP (Mr George Yeo) to get this problem solved. Well is this even a JOKE? It's torturous for us to having to endure the noise DAY AND NIGHT. My parents still have to work the next day and how in the world can we get to sleep given by the amount of noise the construction site made?</p>
              <p>I feel very puzzled about this whole matter. Why can't the police force step in and help resolve this problem?</p>

              <p>One other alternative, which may be more effective, is to complain directly to them, to the builders.</p>
              <p>I saw you said you live in a condo. You can discuss this problem among the residents. I am sure a lot of them are also disturbed.</p>
              <p>You guys can ask your resident committee to handle this problem. Ask the committee guys to approach the builders and complain to them. Make them understand their noise is disturbing the nearby residents.</p>
              <p>This can work.</p>

              <p>if no construction, many will go joblesss, not just workers but
              suppliers, traders,  bosses, banks, etc etc will loose
              out...hope you all understand. Construction is part of the wheel
              churning our economy ya.</p>
              <p>The traffic junction outside my house had been dig, re dig, and
              dig again, once i walked by with my dogs, i asked the foreman, a
              singapore indian man supervising a nos of FWorkers working like
              shit there..." why keep digging, patch here, then dig there, then
              dig up again and patch again, my car have to bump up and down, so
              what are you trying to do???</p>
              <p>The indian guy being shaken my my question, politely smiled and
              said "Pretty girl, what to do, we have to earn a living ya, so dig
              here and there lor"</p>

              <p>Otherwise, you will have a lot of construction workers doing nothing especially since the 2 IRs are almost complete. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
