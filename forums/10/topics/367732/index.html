              <h1>Will the release of secret documents allow the real story of the Batang Kali massacre to be told?</h1>
              <p>Malaya, 1948. In one of the most controversial incidents in British
                  military history, 24 unarmed civilians were killed by a platoon of
                  Scots Guards. Now the release of secret documents means the real story
                  may be told at last</p>
              <p><em>11 July 2009</em></p>
              <p class="font-null">In her recurring nightmare Tham Yong's fiancé is
                  calling her from the spirit world to go back to the river to look for
                  survivors. She can see the pained expression on his face and his
                  outstretched arms beckoning her to return to the scene of a massacre
                  that wiped out every adult male in their village.</p>
              <p class="font-null">The images which still haunt the 78-year-old grandmother are as vivid now as 
                    they were when Britain's colonial war in Malaya first broke upon this small 
                    settlement of Chinese rubber-tree tappers, 45 miles north-west of the 
                    capital, Kuala Lumpur. "I have other bad dreams too," says Tham 
                    Yong. "I dream that the British want to kill me. I tell them that we 
                    are good people, we are all innocent, but the soldiers just keep repeating 
                    that we must be bad people and we must die."</p>
              <p class="font-null"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Just three years after the end of the Second World War, Commonwealth forces 
                    were again heavily engaged in a bitter jungle war – this time against a 
                    small army of Chinese communists whose attacks on Britain's industry and 
                    rubber-tree plantations threatened to overthrow colonial rule. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="font-null">Sixty-one years later, Tham Yong says she cannot forget the night <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a patrol of 
                    16 Scots Guards crept into her village in search of an elusive enemy whose 
                    hit-and-run tactics had won them early successes over the much larger 
                    British forces. Acting on military and local intelligence, the patrol had 
                    been briefed that settlements around Batang Kali were being used as a "bandit" 
                    supply centre. When the soldiers left the village on the afternoon of 12 
                    December 1948, 24 Chinese civilians, including Tham Yong's fiancé, were 
                    dead. All were unarmed and all had been shot while trying to escape. There 
                    were no wounded and it was thought that there had been no survivors. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="font-null">These facts were largely undisputed at the original inquiry. But the 
                    circumstances in which the Guardsmen opened fire with such devastating 
                    results remain hotly contested. The British Army has always maintained that 
                    the soldiers fired when the men ran away.</p>
              <p class="font-null">But there is a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>growing body of evidence to suggest that the shootings at 
                    Batang Kali were in fact a pre-planned massacre carried out in cold blood 
                    either as part of a covert shoot-to-kill policy or out of a determination to 
                    take revenge for the killing of three British soldiers executed during a 
                    communist ambush a few days earlier. </strong></span></span>Two unsatisfactory investigations, one 
                    in 1948 and a second in 1970, have failed to settle these two very different 
                    accounts.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Now secret documents uncovered by lawyers acting for the families of the 
                    victims of Balang Kali have prompted the British Government to take a fresh 
                    look at the possibility of opening a third and full inquiry into the alleged 
                    massacre. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One set of papers reveals that the British authorities in Malaya 
                    in 1948 had considered a proposal for introducing a policy of mass 
                    executions to deter Chinese civilians from aiding the insurgents. </strong></span></span>A second 
                    batch of correspondence shows how an attempt in 1970 by Scotland Yard to 
                    investigate Batang Kali was undermined by Foreign Office advice given to the 
                    then Director of Public Prosecutions which warned that any Chinese witnesses 
                    would be unreliable and likely to make up accounts to support claims for 
                    compensation.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Today, the site of the killing – a 15-acre clearing in the forest – has 
                    changed radically. The rubber trees which fringed the settlement have been 
                    replaced by more profitable palm oil plantations and there is no trace of 
                    the kongsis [traditional meeting halls]. A new development of luxury housing 
                    overlooks the area. But the river and the British-built bridge are as they 
                    were when the soldiers arrived at the village 61 years ago.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Tham Yong still lives close to Batang Kali, where she enjoys the company of 
                    her grandchildren, many of whom have gathered in her simple four-room 
                    bungalow to celebrate the recent engagement of her grandson. But it is with 
                    mixed emotions that she approaches this family occasion – for her own 
                    betrothal to Zhang Shi, a young rubber-tree tapper, was brutally cut short 
                    when British soldiers gunned him down along with 23 other men in the attack 
                    on Batang Kali.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Her anger seems as raw today as it was 61 years ago, when as a 17-year-old she 
                    found herself being questioned by British soldiers about her alleged 
                    involvement in the communist insurgency. Now crippled and confined to a 
                    wheelchair, it is evident that life has not been easy for her. Lifting a 
                    plaster covering a small hole in her throat, she explains that her croaky 
                    voice is the result of an 18-year battle with oesophageal cancer.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"I can still see the faces of the British soldiers. When I heard the 
                    shots I knew none of the village men would survive. The way in which they 
                    were killed was so pitiful. I don't think there has been a day since the 
                    soldiers came that I have not thought about what they did to him."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Tham Yong was born in Gaozhou, in China's Guang-Dong Province, in 1931. When 
                    she was four her family sent her to Malaya – now part of Malaysia – to live 
                    with relatives working in the profitable rubber plantations which were 
                    helping to prop up the British Empire just before the start of the Second 
                    World War.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Under Chinese custom, when Tham Yong reached the age of 14, she was sold to 
                    the family of Zhang Shi as his fiancé. A few months before the end of the 
                    war Zhang Shi and his extended family moved to the Sungai Rimoh Rubber 
                    Estate, which was located in Batang Kali in the district of Selangor. The 
                    plantation was owned by a well-known British planter, Thomas Menzies, who 
                    provided Chinese rubber tappers and their families with a place to sleep, 
                    food and a meagre wage in return for working on his 650-acre estate. In 
                    those days, the simple accommodation for the Chinese tappers at Batang Kali 
                    was arranged around three communal huts. Working conditions were tough, 
                    especially for the women, who were expected to do their fair share of rubber 
                    tapping as well as to clean and cook and bring up their children.</p>
              <p class="font-null">In the early evening of 11 December 1948, Tham Yong was chopping firewood in 
                    one of the huts. She remembers how the peace was shattered by the arrival of 
                    the British patrol: "The British soldiers came into the kongsi with two 
                    Chinese detectives and a Malay detective. The detectives were also armed. 
                    One of the Chinese detectives shouted at us to stop what we were doing and 
                    go outside. The soldiers were pointing their guns at us ... They pushed us 
                    outside."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Later that evening the huts were full of women and children. "My 
                    mother-in-law and I were forcibly herded by the British soldiers to another 
                    kongsi," she recalls.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Ominously, the British soldiers had separated the men and held them in another 
                    hut. Tham Yong says she started to cry, prompting an exchange with one of 
                    the detectives. "Don't cry, I'm not arresting you," the Chinese 
                    detective told her, trying to calm the women. Tham Yong asked: "If you 
                    are not arresting us, why are you dragging us out? You ask me whether I have 
                    seen any communists – I don't even know what they look like. Even if you 
                    kill me, I can't tell you anything because I haven't seen them. You said 
                    that there are many communists in the area. But I haven't seen any – I've 
                    just seen rubber tapping."</p>
              <p class="font-null">As she stood outside, she says she overheard a conversation between Luo 
                    Hui-Nan, one of the male tappers, and a detective. She claims that when the 
                    soldiers discovered he was in possession of a permit to collect durian, the 
                    distinctive Malay fruit with a pungent smell, they automatically assumed he 
                    must be using it secretly to supply the communists.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"One of the British soldiers said he was a bad man. 'Take him away and 
                    shoot him,' he said. 'Tell him to go over by the wood pile and tell him to 
                    stand up straight.' When he stood up straight he was shot in the back. They 
                    left his body on the road just in front of me."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Next the soldiers turned their attention to Chong Foong, the brother of Tham 
                    Yong's fiancé, who was standing over the body. One of the Chinese detectives 
                    demanded to know whether he knew Luo Hui-Nan. When Foong said he did know 
                    him, the detective took his revolver and fired three shots close to his head 
                    to try to scare him. Chong Foong fainted and collapsed on the ground. An 
                    attempt to bring him round by pouring cold water over him failed, so he was 
                    carried back into the kongsi and slung over a wooden bench.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Chong Foong later attributed the fact that his life was saved to his loss of 
                    consciousness. He was the only tapper among the 25 men rounded up by the 
                    Scots Guards that night to survive the killings.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Early the next morning, Tham Yong remembers British soldiers ordering her 
                    fiancé and the other men locked inside the other hut to move down the stairs 
                    and assemble outside. She recalls: "They were all unarmed, and dressed 
                    in their working clothes. They were walking, and not running away at all. I 
                    saw the men being led out into different groups and all of a sudden I heard 
                    gunshots from about five different places nearby. After the firing stopped, 
                    the soldiers set fire to all three kongsis. They poured kerosene on the 
                    wooden parts of the huts and then fired shots at them to start the fire. We 
                    were then driven away from the village."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Wong Then Loy, now 69, was only nine years old when he was told by his father, 
                    the local gravedigger, to accompany him to Batang Kali. It was a week after 
                    the shooting and the scene confronting the father-and-son gravediggers was 
                    deeply shocking. This is the first time Wong Then Loy has told his story.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"The police had given us some cloth treated with chemicals to put over 
                    our faces, so we knew whatever we found was going to be bad," he 
                    recalls. "When we got there I remember the stench of the flesh. There 
                    were three bodies across the other side of the river, then another three on 
                    our side. The others were scattered over the site. All the bodies had 
                    started to decompose and some of them had been badly burnt. They were in 
                    such a bad state that it was impossible to say how they had been killed."</p>
              <p class="font-null">One of the corpses was grotesquely disfigured. Wong Then Loy says the body of 
                    the rubber tappers' supervisor, Lin Tian Shui, was missing his head. "We 
                    were told to go and look for his head downstream ... but after a few hours 
                    of looking, we couldn't find it."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Wong Then Loy's account of a decapitated body corroborates stories of a grim 
                    method employed by British patrols hunting Chinese communist fighters at 
                    this time. Because the soldiers had to march deep into the jungle to engage 
                    the enemy, it was difficult to carry the bodies back for identification. 
                    Instead they got used to bringing back the severed heads of communist 
                    suspects. Jungle warfare in Malaya was a brutal business and years spent 
                    fighting the Japanese deep inside Malaya's interior had left elements of the 
                    British army desensitised to such violence.</p>
              <p class="font-null">It was during the war against the Japanese that Britain had helped to train 
                    and arm the Chinese guerrilla units as part of its desperate struggle 
                    against an enemy which had swept through Burma, Borneo and Malaya. Their 
                    successes had earnt them medals handed out by the grateful and beleaguered 
                    British forces. But once the military pendulum had swung back in favour of 
                    the Commonwealth forces and Japan's imperial armies had been defeated in the 
                    east, Malaya fell back into British hands.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Before the war, Malaya had proved its worth as a colony rich in copper and 
                    rubber. But five years of fighting had drained Britain of its own resources 
                    and had left the country close to bankruptcy. The newly elected Labour 
                    Government under Clement Attlee had conceded that while the sun may have 
                    already set on many of the conquered colonies of the British empire, Malaya 
                    was too valuable an economic jewel in the East to let go. Crucially, Attlee 
                    was supported by America's President Truman, who feared the rise of 
                    communism in South-east Asia.</p>
              <p class="font-null">But Britain dithered, and for the first few months after the war, Malaya was 
                    left to manage its own affairs. This vacuum encouraged the three million 
                    Chinese-Malay, who had been discriminated against under British rule, to 
                    believe that they would at last win the right to self-determination – and 
                    they began to organise themselves into a strong political force.</p>
              <p class="font-null">The returning British had no interest in working with their former allies, and 
                    so, when confronted by the nascent Chinese-Malay independence movement, 
                    London ordered its forces to crush the rebellion before it could get 
                    properly established. The Chinese communists were driven out of the towns 
                    and back into the jungles where they had launched their offensives against 
                    the Japanese. Under the charismatic leadership of Chin Peng, the communists 
                    now directed their insurgency against British colonial rule, targeting the 
                    rubber plantations and tin mines.</p>
              <p class="font-null">It was the killing of three British rubber planters in June 1948 that 
                    triggered Britain's decision to declare the conflict an "Emergency" 
                    and put the colony on a war footing. But in war-weary Britain, a new 
                    conflict in the Far East was very unpopular. The élite jungle-fighting units 
                    deployed against the Japanese had largely been wound down, requiring the 
                    bulk of the army to be reinforced with inexperienced conscripts.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Thus it was that the platoon of 16 Scots Guards which set out from its 2nd 
                    battalion's advanced headquarters at Kuala Kubu on 11 December consisted 
                    almost entirely of National Servicemen. Their orders were to advance to the 
                    remote settlement of Sungei Remok Estate, Batang Kali, where intelligence 
                    suggested there was a communist presence. What else was said about the 
                    mission has not been disclosed. But all the soldiers would have been acutely 
                    aware of the murder of three Hussars, ambushed that week by insurgents who 
                    poured petrol over the men and burned them alive.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Unusually, the Batang Kali patrol was not led by an officer but a 22-year-old 
                    Lance-Sergeant, supported by a much older Sergeant who had seen action 
                    during the Second World War, fighting the German army in Greece. These two 
                    were the only professional soldiers among the platoon. Since none of the men 
                    spoke Cantonese or Mandarin, a Chinese and a Malay detective accompanied the 
                    patrol.</p>
              <p class="font-null">The soldiers told an inquiry established a few weeks after the killings that 
                    they had arrived at the village in the early hours of the evening in the 
                    expectation of encountering enemy "bandits". But the scene they 
                    encountered was something much more mundane. The heavy rains that week meant 
                    the Chinese rubber tappers had not been able to work on the plantations and 
                    collect any more valuable latex from the trees. When the soldiers arrived 
                    they found the villagers busy gathering wood for the fires needed to cook 
                    the evening meal. This tranquil scene was shattered when the soldiers burst 
                    in and took control of the village. They separated the men from the women 
                    and with the help of their Chinese translator conducted interviews with all 
                    the villagers. According to the 1948 inquiry, conducted by Sir Stafford 
                    Foster-Sutton, the Chinese men were all detained as potential sources of 
                    intelligence, rather than combatants. They were kept as prisoners while the 
                    Sergeants decided what to do with them next. The Foster-Sutton inquiry 
                    concluded that the deaths were the result of a mass escape by the Chinese 
                    who had tried to flee into the jungle.</p>
              <p class="font-null">It was not until 22 years later – in 1970 – that the official account of how 
                    24 unarmed men had been killed by British gunfire began to unravel. The war 
                    in Vietnam was dominating the headlines in the British media and led to 
                    liberal commentators calling into question the UK military's role in its own "Vietnam" 
                    in Malaya. A number of the Scots Guards, haunted by their own experiences 
                    during the Emergency, had given statements to a Sunday newspaper suggesting 
                    that the deaths at Batang Kali were not the result of a failed break-out but 
                    were cold-blooded executions. Headlines compared the killings to the My Lai 
                    massacre in Vietnam, where American soldiers had slaughtered somewhere 
                    between 347 and 504 unarmed citizens in the south of the country, all of 
                    them civilians – mostly women, children and elderly people. There were calls 
                    for an official explanation of the Batang Kali killings, and the Labour 
                    government agreed to set up an inquiry headed by a senior Scotland Yard 
                    detective.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Detective Chief Superintendent Frank Williams was well known to the public as 
                    the policeman who had hunted down the "Great Train Robbers". Now 
                    he and his team were given the job of exploring the events of 11 and 12 
                    December 1948. This would involve tracing all the members of the Scots 
                    Guards platoon and taking fresh statements from them. Some of the Guardsmen, 
                    now civilians and free from the constraints of military discipline, had 
                    changed their accounts of what happened at Batang Kali. At least one of the 
                    soldiers turned the official version of the shootings on its head and told 
                    the detectives that the platoon had been ordered to shoot the Chinese.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Williams now concluded that the investigation could only be properly completed 
                    after a visit to the site of the killings and interviews taken from the 
                    Malaysian witnesses. He told the office of the then Director of Public 
                    Prosecutions that it was his intention to go to Malaysia as soon as 
                    possible. But political events intervened. In the 1970 General Election, 
                    Harold Wilson's Government was ousted from power and replaced by a new Tory 
                    administration led by Edward Heath. The Tories were less enthusiastic about 
                    digging up alleged atrocities from Britain's colonial past that might shame 
                    the nation. Williams was asked to make his report without further delay and 
                    without collecting the vital witness testimonies from the villagers. Shortly 
                    afterwards, the Attorney General, Sir Peter Rawlinson, made an announcement 
                    to Parliament saying that there was "no reasonable likelihood of 
                    obtaining sufficient evidence to warrant criminal proceedings". The 
                    case was therefore closed.</p>
              <p class="font-null">What Rawlinson meant by his assertion about the state of the evidence has 
                    never been made clear. After all, Williams, the detective heading the 
                    investigation, regarded his work as unfinished business.</p>
              <p class="font-null">It has taken almost 40 more years for ministers to look at the case again. The 
                    London law firm Bindman &amp; Partners has unearthed vital new documents 
                    that suggest the Heath Government may have been prejudiced by their 
                    officials who had advised them in the case.</p>
              <p class="font-null">A letter written by a senior official in the Foreign Office to the Director of 
                    Public Prosecutions shows why the Attorney General thought there was "no 
                    reasonable likelihood of obtaining sufficient evidence". The 
                    correspondence reads: "When the Batang Kali allegations were made 
                    public earlier this year, they formed headline news in Malaysia for several 
                    days. If the presence of a British investigating team now became known, the 
                    Malaysian press would be sure to give its activities close, and, possibly 
                    embarrassing, attention. In theory it might be feasible to limit publicity 
                    by avoiding public announcements. But it would be virtually impossible if 
                    the team wished to take evidence in the area of Batang Kali itself."</p>
              <p class="font-null">The High Commission in Malaysia was also concerned over "local 
                    difficulties" which they said "might complicate the normal problems" 
                    connected with taking eye-witness statements 22 years after the event. The 
                    official wrote: "In making enquiries among Malaysian villagers the team 
                    may find it difficult to establish with certainty the credentials of 
                    witnesses claiming first-hand knowledge. In addition, the number of 
                    first-hand accounts could multiply if there were any suggestion that 
                    possible compensation claims might have some chance of success. Furthermore, 
                    villagers' powers of recall are rarely accurate."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Successive British Governments have partly been able to quell interest in 
                    further inquiries because there has been so little support for an 
                    investigation in Malaysia. The Malaysian Government has also tended to treat 
                    the claims</p>
              <p class="font-null">made by survivors and the families of Batang Kali as something of an 
                    embarrassment. Many Malaysians supported the Emergency and actively assisted 
                    in crushing the minority Chinese rebellion. When reports first emerged of 
                    the shooting of 24 Chinese communists at Batang Kali, most Malays celebrated 
                    it as an important victory in the conflict. After Malaysia was granted 
                    independence in 1957, Malayan ministers, who owe their own positions of 
                    power to the legacy of colonial rule, have been reluctant to open an inquiry 
                    into the killings.</p>
              <p class="font-null">But now a group of Chinese-Malay businessmen and lawyers, some of whom were 
                    badly treated during the Emergency, are funding a legal case which is being 
                    prepared for the High Court in London on behalf of the families of those 
                    killed at Batang Kali.</p>
              <p class="font-null">In the face of this legal action the Foreign Office has agreed to reconsider 
                    its decision not to hold a full inquiry into the alleged massacre. And last 
                    week, Foreign Office officials met representatives from the Chinese-Malay 
                    community and British lawyers to discuss how to take their grievances 
                    further.</p>
              <p class="font-null">But for the survivors and witnesses of Batang Kali, time is running out – and 
                    any inquiry may soon come too late. Tham Yong's husband, Chong Foong, whose 
                    brother (and her finacé) Zhang Shi had been killed at Batang Kali, was the 
                    only male living in the village to survive the attack. He died last year, 
                    leaving Tham Yong as the only adult witness to the events of Batang Kali.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Since her husband's death last year Tham Yong has begun wondering how 
                    differently her life would have turned out if her fiancé had survived the 
                    killings. What might have happened if the soldiers had let Zhang Shi live 
                    and the couple had married as their families had intended?</p>
              <p class="font-null">"After the shooting we survivors were left without clothing, a home or 
                    any money. We had nothing and had to rely on others for support. We were 
                    very sad because all these people who had been killed were innocent. They 
                    were not communists, nor had they seen any communists, yet they were killed."</p>
              <p class="font-null">One week after the alleged massacre, the police allowed the women to return to 
                    the plantation estate to identify and claim the corpses. "I found the 
                    body of my fiancé with that of many others. We took him away and buried him. 
                    One of the corpses was Lin Tian Shui, who had been beheaded. I later heard 
                    that a Malay lady saw his head and threw it into the river. The head was 
                    swept away by the current of the river."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Tham Yong finally married Chong Foong in 1951. "It has not been easy for 
                    me, not easy at all. What I have always wanted, and all I have ever wanted, 
                    is for the British Government to admit to this massacre, to say sorry and 
                    pay me some compensation."</p>
              <p class="font-null">And what of the British soldiers who carried out the killing? "Are they 
                    alive?" she asks. When told that eight of them are living out their 
                    peaceful retirements in Britain, Tham Yong says: "I have no hostility 
                    towards them. They know what they did. But now is the time for them to ask 
                    their Government to do the right thing."</p>

              <h2>“A Subaltern Perspective on History” (äººä¸‹äººçš„åŽ†å�²è§‚): Reading Fang Zhuang Bi’s (æ–¹å£®å£�) Memoir</h2>
              <p><strong>Sai Siew Min</strong></p>
              <hr>
              <p>To write the history of the Communist Underground or the Left-wing
              movement in post-war Singapore demands more than simply filling in the
              blanks of the existing dominant narrative with authentic voices of
              erstwhile participants hitherto <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>denied their right of articulation by
              the hegemonic Singapore state. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>It also demands resisting the temptation
              to flip the dominant story around, championing the cause of the
              so-called “losers” and turning them into heroes who have arrived
              decades too late on the historiographical scene in contemporary
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>In late 2006, the memoir of Fang
              Zhuang Bi, who <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singaporeans have come to believe, was the Number One
              man in the Singapore Communist Underground was published.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Written in
              Chinese, Fang’s memoir provides some clues for a historian or any
              student of Singapore history on the task of reconstructing the position
              of the Communist movement in post-war Singapore. If Fang’s memoir is
              anything to go by, the most critical insight that it affords is the
              realization that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the idea of a recoverable authentic voice from the
              Communist Left is a pipe dream.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>One fundamental historiographical question confronting any scholar
              or student investigating this topic is not that concerned with the
              recovery of untainted “facts” or ascertaining who had been “right” or
              “telling the truth”.</p>
              <p>For too long, historiography in Singapore has been
              dominated by a particular genre and practice of history that idealizes
              and therefore aspires to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>a</em>political historical truth. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The practice of history in Singapore, naturalized by the general <em>a</em>politicization
              of Singapore society from the 1970s onwards, failed even to recognize
              how the production of ideas about knowledge (epistemology) and power
              are thoroughly intertwined.</p>
              <p>By this, I do not mean that the dominant
              state deliberately produces historical falsehood in a conspiratorial
              fashion. Instead, the state draws strength from demanding of itself and
              its detractors nothing less than “the truth” and certainly persecutes
              in the name of “truth” which it understands as decidedly monosyllabic.</p>
              <p>These fundamental attitudes and beliefs about epistemology, shared by
              non-state agencies such as the mainstream media and the academia in
              Singapore, encourage a particular understanding of the very nature of
              the historiographical inquiry.</p>
              <p>History is concerned with the search for
              an objective truth about the past, and some narratives are more right
              than others. Posed in this manner, scholars, students and ordinary
              citizens can pretend that we may leave out the whole process by and
              through which historical truth is produced in contemporary Singapore
              society.</p>
              <p>The production, practice and dissemination of historical truth
              which is after all, embedded in the entire apparatus of knowledge
              production in Singapore society is thereby taken out of the
              Knowledge/Power grid.</p>
              <p>Fang’s memoir does not begin as most autobiographies do with the
              moment and place of his birth. Chapter one reads almost like a preface.
              It is perhaps not a matter of chance that Fang begins his memoir with
              an interrogative gesture. He declares himself an “ordinary Singaporean”<a title="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></span></span></a> <em>and </em>a
              “subaltern” in Singapore society.</p>
              <p>In an important move which should be
              evaluated not for its veracity or bias but for its interrogation of
              Singapore historiography, Fang names his particular perspective of
              history — the narrative that he is about to present in his book “a
              subaltern perspective on history” (<span style="font-family: SimSun;">äººä¸‹äººçš„åŽ†å�²è§‚</span>):</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I live in Singapore, in the lowest rung of its social
              and political life. I breathe the air of the lowest rung of its social
              and political life. Therefore, I believe I reflect the voices of those
              from the lowest rung of society and politics in Singapore: “a subaltern
              perspective on history”. </strong></span></span>The “subaltern” (“<span style="font-family: SimSun;">äººä¸‹äºº</span>”)
              refers to those who have been oppressed or trampled on. My feelings and
              my perspectives will therefore, diverge in every way from those of “Mr
              Elite” (“<span style="font-family: SimSun;">äººä¸Šäºº</span>”<span style="font-family: SimSun;">å…ˆç”Ÿ</span>).<a title="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In pre-World War Two Singapore, Fang describes himself as not a
              legal subject of the British colony and thus labels himself a “Third
              Class Being”. After the war, Fang being Chinese-educated was not
              proficient in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>English which was the official language of the British
              governmen</strong></span></span>t and hence, the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>dominant language of colonial society. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Although citizenship issues had emerged into the forefront of post-war
              politics in Malaya and Singapore, Fang writes that he was still living
              in a colonized society. He thus labels himself a “Second Class Being”.
              In the struggle against the anti-colonial movements, the British turned
              Fang into a “terrorist” and a “criminal of the nation”. In social and
              political terms, he was classed together with the criminals.</p>
              <p>Even after
              Singapore achieved independence first in 1963 and then again in 1965,
              Fang remained a “criminal” in the eyes of the ruling People’s Action
              Party government, a fate he describes as being pushed into the
              “nineteenth level of hell”<a title="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></span></span></a>. For the next thirty years, Fang describes himself as a “fugitive” and an “outcast from Singapore”.<a title="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></span></span></a></p>
              <p>I am not too concerned with Fang’s reconstruction of his “street
              credentials” or how genuine they are. Rather, I am interested in
              exploring what Fang’s bold assertion of “a subaltern perspective on
              history” can do for the state of historiography in Singapore. I suggest
              we should read the memoirs and life stories of Left-wing historical
              personalities like Fang’s not because they give us an innocent and
              authentic portrayal of the <em>other </em>side of the story which
              somehow, make our knowledge of the past more complete.</p>
              <p>Such a chimera
              of historical truth can only be accomplished if we willfully ignore how
              Fang’s subaltern narrative is shot through with the valance of
              contemporary historical discourse straining to re-connect with a past,
              the logic of which is already beyond the comprehension of Fang’s
              readers in present day Singapore.</p>
              <p>Moreover, to read and evaluate Fang’s memoir merely as testimony
              from an erstwhile participant who had really “been there and done that”
              misses the double move he is making when he asserts from the outset
              that his narrative is a reconstruction of his life story <em>as well as </em>an
              interrogation of dominant historiography. Giving himself different
              labels to mark his subaltern position —“Third-Class Being”,
              “Second-Class Being”, “fugitive”, “outcast” and<span> </span>“a quarter of an intellectual” (<span style="font-family: SimSun;">å››åˆ†ä¹‹ä¸€çš„çŸ¥è¯†åˆ†å­�</span>)<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <a title="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn5"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</span></span></a></span> —Fang’s self-descriptions of subalternity re-visits the workings of the
              Knowledge/Power grid. What were the forces shaping Fang’s
              transformation into a subaltern? How has historiography abetted this
              transformation? Fang’s challenge raises the important question of how a
              “subaltern perspective on history” is produced within the Singapore
              context.</p>
              <p>What can such a “subaltern perspective on history” do for Singapore
              historiography? A focus on the subaltern <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>helps to reverse the elitist
              bias of political history and the practice of elitist politics in
              Singapore. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Thus far, the mainstream and dominant narrative about
              political events in post-war Singapore — now rapidly transmuted into
              “national history” and taught to students in Singapore schools — <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>has
              suppressed completely the lower/under classes and their politics. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Uncannily similar to the state of South Indian historiography prior to
              the intervention of the Subaltern Studies Collective in the 1980s,
              post-war Singapore history depicts colonial and nationalist elites as
              the primary agents of change. In fact, Ranajit Guha’s<a title="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></span></span></a> critique of Indian historiography would be equally applicable to Singapore:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The historiography of Indian nationalism has for a long
              time been dominated by elitism — colonialist elitism and
              bourgeois-nationalist elitism…Both these varieties of elitism share the
              prejudice that the making of the Indian nation and the development of
              the consciousness-nationalism which confirmed this process were
              exclusively or predominantly elite achievements. In the colonialist and
              neo-colonialist historiographies those achievements are credited to
              British colonial rulers, administrators, policies, institutions and
              culture; in the nationalist and neo-nationalist writings — to Indian
              elite personalities, institutions, activities and ideas.<a title="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[7]</span></span></span></a></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>While the archetypal subaltern in Guha’s sense is the peasant
              insurgent who stood for a heterogeneous under-class in Indian society â€•
              peasants, low-caste communities, widows — and does not include
              self-styled representatives of these groups such as the Indian Left,
              conceptual debates emerging from within the Subaltern Studies
              Collective connect subaltern subjectivity to the ideological
              reproduction of dominance. The subaltern is not a ready-made category
              cast in stone as a consequence of economic inequalities. The subaltern
              in any society is an ideological product of above all, the hegemonic
              order which works to secure and naturalize the identity of dominant
              groups.</p>
              <p>Thus, historians from the Subaltern Studies group read the
              voluminous texts produced by dominant institutions, often the only
              available evidence of subaltern activities to reconstruct, albeit not
              in the manner of positivism, the “consciousness of the subaltern”. One
              methodological implication of such reading for the subaltern is not to
              champion the cause of the down-trodden or to make the historical
              account more true and complete, but to examine the ground, always power
              laden, through which historical agents take their place in history. In
              the words of Shahid Amin, a member of that research collective:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It is, I feel, quite important for any historian of the
              subaltern classes to investigate the discursive practices within which
              statements by the police, administrators, judges, and by the accused
              themselves, are produced. This is required not in order to discern
              bias, rectify it and thereby arrive at an untainted, proper narrative
              of things pasts, unsullied by the context within which such a narrative
              was produced: that would be to indulge in a pointless positivist
              venture. It is necessitated by the fact that <em>most statements about the dominated are produced in well-defined fields of power.</em> The way out does not simply lie in the search for new sources for new
              history, for the issue of reading evidence as text is not brought to a
              close by the discovery of new testimonies, new depositions. It is posed
              afresh with every such discovery.<a title="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[8]</span></span></span></a> (my emphasis)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Following Amin, the subaltern in history is not a saviour of truth.
              The subaltern appears in history as a figure who is defined through
              his/her unequal relationships with the dominant order.</p>
              <p>When Fang Zhuang Bi names himself the subaltern <em>par excellence</em> in Singapore’s history, he does so self-consciously as a
              counter-reaction to mainstream interpretations of post-war history put
              forth by the ruling government in Singapore, in particular, that of
              Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew as well as that presented in the
              widely-circulated book <em>The Tiger and the Trojan Horse</em> by
              Dennis Bloodworth. Fang’s lengthy riposte takes up the whole of chapter
              one.</p>
              <p>For this reason alone, Fang’s subaltern perspective on history
              cannot be read literally for what it reveals about the genuine voice of
              “the other” in Singapore history. Fang’s deliberate positioning as a
              subaltern only makes sense in relation to the mainstream interpretation
              of post-war history he now challenges. Speaking in the voice of the
              subaltern enables Fang to pierce through existing historical accounts
              from which he has been exiled. Taking on the subject positioning of the
              subaltern in retelling his story enables Fang to speak from his current
              position as “a fugitive” and “outcast” of Singapore society.</p>
              <p>Fang’s description of how he was politicized and chose to go Left
              illustrates perfectly how the subaltern is defined through his/her
              unequal relationships with the dominant.</p>
              <p>According to Fang,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> his
              political awakening took definite form only at the precise moment when
              he felt the sheer force of detention without trial enacted by Emergency
              laws. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Fang shatters a couple of Singaporean historical myths when the
              Number One Communist in Singapore recounts his years in school. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fang
              remembers his days in Chinese High School, surprisingly as years he
              spent <em>outside</em> the political circle. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He was not politicized
              through the usual channels of student organizations and study groups in
              Chinese High</strong></span></span>, attributing his absence from student activism to the dire
              economic straits his family was in. Driven by the need to earn a living
              and study at the same time, Fang was fleeting in and out of school.
              Student politics was a luxury he could ill afford.</p>
              <p>Also surprising is
              the time he spent in an English-medium school i.e. Saint Andrew’s
              School (after he graduated from Chinese High and was teaching at a
              Chinese-medium primary school) where, Fang reveals, he once managed to
              top the class in “Scripture”! Fang recounts these years in school as
              time he spent drifting, and without a definite direction in life.</p>
              <p>Fang muses that had he not been subjected to a classic Kafka-like
              detention one day by the Special Branch on the prowl for Communists and
              their sympathizers, which then triggered off an existential crisis in
              him, he would have continued with his studies at Saint Andrew’s School,
              ending up half-English-educated and maybe even realize his ambition of
              becoming a civil engineer:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>For how long was I detained, there is no way to be sure,
              about ten days to half a month! Life’s hardships, psychological
              struggles, physical pain do not have too huge an impact on me. I have
              always been able to be at ease in my surroundings and adapt myself to
              circumstances. I was young and full of vigour. I had huge reserves of
              energy and an appetite for life. I was driven by the will to succeed in
              life. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yet, it was precisely at such a difficult moment, my body locked
              away in a prison cell that I was terrified to realize I did not have a
              definite direction in life at all! Where was my future? What should I
              do next? How should I move on? I simply had no answers to these
              questions. … It was precisely that dark and dingy prison cell,
              precisely the air that stank of animals crowded into terrible living
              conditions, precisely that kind of hopeless situation where one’s fate
              was in the hands of another, that finally pushed me, and there within
              me the search for a new direction in life was awakened.<a title="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn9"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[9]</span></span></span></a></strong></span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Fang’s subaltern perspective on history throws up a blind spot in
              Singapore historiography i.e. the character of Singapore’s
              anti-colonial movement. Fang argues that between the 1950s and 1960s
              have been so sorely misrepresented in the dominant narrative as a clash
              between “the Communists” and “the non-Communists” it was as if the
              anti-colonial movement never really happened. Such a characterization
              transforms the anti-colonial movement into a power struggle between the
              Communists/Left and the “non-Communists”, to whom the British chose to
              transfer power, leaving the latter’s interests and legacy in post-war
              Singapore completely un-problematized:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Was the anti-colonial struggle by the people of
              Singapore merely a matter of mutual killing amongst the Communists, the
              Left-wing and a couple of socialists? All that had nothing to do with
              the British Empire and the British colonial authority? Were the British
              Empire and the British colonial authority innocent by-standers?<a title="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn10"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[10]</span></span></span></a></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Who were the real enemies of the anti-colonial movement? What were
              the objectives of Singapore’s anti-colonial movement? What were the
              Communists, the Left and the non-Communists fighting for? Fang’s
              critique points to the need to move beyond partial accounts of
              Singapore’s anti-colonial history offered by self-professed
              “non-Communist” protagonists.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>His critique points to the marked absence
              of the Communist and Left-wing movement in Singapore’s anti-colonial
              history that the British colonial authority was so anxious to suppress <em>and </em>to
              which, the “non-Communists” owed the raison de’tre for their political
              existence.</strong></span></span> Against the backdrop of the Cold War and coercive Emergency
              laws, the label “non-Communist” is itself revealing of the real need to
              define a political stance vis-à-vis “the Communist” for a particular
              audience.</p>
              <p>As for the characterization that the Communist movement was a
              “terrorist” movement, Fang rejects this as language the British had
              used deliberately to discredit the Communist movement. He was
              particularly upset that the label “ex-Communist Terrorist” was still
              imposed on him in independent Singapore, way after Singapore’s
              anti-colonial struggle was over:<span> </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>On 25<sup>th</sup> September 1995, in two letters the
              Home Affairs Ministry had issued me, my comrades and I were labeled
              three times as “ex-Communist Terrorists”. Readers can imagine my
              indignation. If the British colonial authority called us “Communist
              Terrorists”, so be it. They were the enemies and nothing good would
              come out from their mouths. But if the People’s Action Party government
              calls us “Communist Terrorists”, it would be intolerable. If I had
              accepted this label, it would be tantamount to admitting that opposing
              British colonization, opposing the Japanese invasion, fighting for
              national independence and the glorious and great liberation of the
              people constituted “terrorist activity”.<a title="_ftnref11" name="_ftnref11" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/subaltern/#_ftn11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[11]</span></span></span></a></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In the end, after writing to the Singapore government, Fang managed
              to get the Home Affairs Ministry to re-issue the letters, dropping the
              label “Communist Terrorist” and using in its place, the more accurate
              term “Communist Member”.</p>
              <p>In Fang’s subaltern perspective, the anti-colonial movement was an
              unequivocal political struggle between the Communists, the Left-wing
              and the people on one side, and the British Empire on the other. The
              “three-cornered fight” featured in the dominant narrative between the
              Communists/the Left, the British and the “non-Communists” who inherited
              power from the British only demonstrates in retrospect to Fang the
              extent to which the anti-colonial struggle had been hampered by enemies
              from within and without.</p>
              <p>Fang’s revelations about the inner workings of
              the Communist movement when it operated underground in Singapore
              underscored what a mammoth task it was fighting the colonial machinery,
              especially its capacity for capture, persecution and punishment,
              incidentally a point Chin Peng’s memoir also brings across.</p>
              <p>The grand
              conspiracy of Communist subversion certainly sounded more plausible in
              the British “prose of counter insurgency” than in the memoirs of these
              two Communist leaders. Fang, for example, seems to have spent a great
              deal of time dodging arrest or trying to figure ways of printing and
              disseminating Communist propaganda under arduous circumstances.</p>
              <p>It would be easy to dismiss Fang Zhuang Bi’s memoir as the voice of
              a disgruntled loser if we read him simply as an erstwhile participant
              of events in the 1950s and 1960s in Singapore. It would be far more
              difficult, however, to dismiss his interrogative gesture directed at
              the state of post-war Singapore historiography. Fang’s subaltern
              subjectivity, ever sensitive to the implication of power in the
              production of history, raises a different set of issues than “the
              search for an objective truth” sanctioned by the practice of positivist
              historiography. The subaltern has written back.</p>
