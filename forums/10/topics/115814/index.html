            <div class='col-md body'>Why they take so long to take action ? Members sleeping ?<br><br><strong>WP seeks feedback on casino </strong><br><br>THE Workers' Party is seeking feedback on the casino proposal as it intends to have the issue debated in Parliament, the party said in a statement yesterday.<br><br>The views will help the opposition party in 'formulating its policy position on the casino and gambling in general', said the statement by second assistant secretary-general James Gomez.<br><br>Describing it as a 'unique opportunity' for Singaporeans to be involved in policy formulation, it added: 'They will have an opportunity to air their viewpoints on the type of Singapore we and our children want to grow up in.'<br><br>The statement said various arguments have been put forward by Singaporeans on the casino proposal, from the economic benefits arising from tourism to the social fallout caused by gaming.<br><br>It also noted that the Government invited potential investors to submit concept plans by the end of this month for an integrated resort that could feature a casino - and that it was still undecided whether to proceed with the idea.<br><br>The Government has said that it wants to hear all views before making up its mind and that it will not rush into making a decision.<br><br>The Workers' Party statement said the March 5 public consultation exercise will be held at its headquarters at 216-G Syed Alwi Road, #02-03, from 2pm to 5pm.<br><br>The statement added that the public can also send views via e-mail to pcc@wp.org.sg or in writing to PO Box 15, Toa Payoh Central Post Office, Singapore 913101.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shouldn't the public be educated, consulted and approve before inviting contractors to submit their design and concept plans?<br><br>Seems like in SG it works this way round:<br>1. Inform the public of Merits of Casino (jobs creation, etc)<br>2. Taking public feedback |at the same time| Inviting tenders / concept design<br>3. Using media to counter negative comments |at the same time| Improvements on design after evaluating the comments by public<br>4. Find ways to suppress concerns of moral issues by saying that control measures are in place<br>5. Finally Approval of Casino by saying concerns of public are overblown as Singaporeans can be trusted to think and make the right decision<br><br>Yeah, we can think and if I want to gamble, why the hell will I get myself restricted? I might as well go Genting or other regional casinos. Cheaper and better conversion for food and leisure. There are many Casinos around the region here. What kind of idiotic tourists come all the way to SG just to gamble? sheesh!<br><br>If we are trusted to be matured and responsible, then let us decide, just stop trying to alter our views, afterall, we are able to think, we know what is right and wrong. If they try to, then they are not trusting us, if they do not trust us, then it proves that we are not able to think and be responsible... then why the casino?<br><br>Funny that the SG Government (Ministers as well) is involved in this trying to convince the public and inviting tenders, I supposed Casinos in other countries are not managed so deeply by their own Govt as in SG.<br><br>Let Singapore be known as an important hub for air/sea travel as well as business and prospects... the land of opportunity. Not a gambling hub and a land of moral deficiency.<br><br>Lastly (forgive my ignorance if I am mis-informed) whose money will be used for this building and if it is the people's, then do we get a share as well?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I have the feeling once Workers' Party announced it will be addressing the casino issue, SDP supporters (not SDP) feared they will be grilled on their silence.<br><br>Hence, they try to distract people from this possible grilling by attacking with the aim of discrediting Workers' Party's efforts.<br><br>It is unfortunate that their supporters are so narrow-minded.<br><br>I wonder if SDP supporters have changed their world view that Workers' Party is their opposition, not the PAP.<br><br>SDP stands for Singapore *Democratic* Party. If they have a liberal stand that support a casino, their supporters should advise the party to take a stand for the casino.<br><br>They may find themselves with pro-casino sympathisers.<br><br>There is nothing to be shy about it.

            <div class='col-md body'>As posted to feedback unit:-<br><br>The pro- and anti-casino population at the moment is about half-half with a slight majority in favor of casino.<br><br>The anti-casino lot have given their views very strongly based on social and moral considerations.<br><br>The pro-casino lot have given their views in two ways:<br><br>(1) Gambling is already too deeply entrenched in Singaporeans so having a casino now does not necessarily mean souls will be sold to casino.<br><br>(2) Casino provides an opportunity to avoid the S$2.0 billion gambling losses to flow out of the country. There are new economic opportunities to develop based on our incomparable excellent location.<br><br>In view of Dr. Tony Tan's considered view that we should not rush into making a decision and Mr. George Yeo's caution, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan will have to show that indeed: (a) economic pluses will be overwhelm all the social ills to convince the anti-casino lot to give it a try. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Words and rhetorics alone of Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan will not serve the purpose. To wait till the packaged proposals to be submitted by the operators too may not be that all convincing to the anti-casino people who are very passionate in their views.<br><br>Dr. Tony Tan is right. Until Dr. Balakrishnan is able to put forward a comprehensive economic plan to show how Singapore will benefit from having a casino in terms of how many jobs created and which industries will be correlated or integrated to draw on casino factor to stimulate growth, we really should not proceed with the decision of having a casino yet.<br><br>There is a need to approach the decision from an overall new economic plan, incorporating factors other countries or casinos have not considered as otherwise our future generations may blame on all of us if things go terribly wrong.<br><br>Our scholars do not as yet put up such a comprehensive plan to show how to prevent social problems and even overwhelm them with many many benefits through creative and entrepreneur governance which ministers lately have been promoting.</div>

Even though we have not gone public over the casino issue, it doesn't mean that there isn't debates or discussion within the party over the issue. Like PAP itself, we do have people with very different views in our party.<br><br>The casino forum is aimed specifically at the issue with good timing. 5 March is just a week after the deadline of submission of proposals. One month before PAP govt make its stand. This is a strategical movement with great considerations on the timing. We don't just waste bullets shouting out everyday.<br><br>What I am telling you here is that we are no "MAD DOG Politicians". We are prepared to give two different perspectives during the forum and seek opinions from the public.

If you lived in Vegas and the government wanted to build a casino, you can move to a different town where there is none of that. Same for Genting. It is easy to relocate if you don't like having a casino nearby. In Singapore's case, we can't run away. It is right at our doorstep, no matter where we go.</div>
