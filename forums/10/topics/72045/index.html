As we know, and as proven by many countries, elitism is an insidious form of attack that would tear Singapore apart inside out. Raffles Junior College, and the typical Rafflesian we know, are ultra smart but also ultra xialan, ego and definitely proud. Raffles Junior College, founded in 1985, inherited its 180 years of rich tradition from Raffles Institution. A premier and top junior college, RJC stands out not only in academic performances but also in CCAs and sports (So? Does that mean these people have the right to be so hao lian and act like as if the country owe those smartasses something?) To highlight elitism in Singapore, let me reaffirm my stand with the following statistic:<br><br>[Percentage of 4A(s) among total school population in A'level 2003]<br>1) Raffles JC: 51.3% [* broke record in Singapore's A'level history by going past the 50% mark (So scary hor!) ]<br>2) Hwa Chong JC: 41.8% [* Lost to RJC by 9.5% (approx. 10%) ]<br>3) Victoria JC: 30.6% [* Lost to HCJC by 11.2% (approx 10%)]<br>4) National JC: 20+% [* 20+% but exact figures unknown]<br>5) Temasek JC: 14.5%<br><br>Look at the percentage of 4A(s). RJC has clearly proven itself to be a chao-ji super crazy college with mad results. And look at these statistics. This is an example of social polarisation. Each college has a difference of approximately 10% for the top 3 jcs (see the vast difference?). Who would have thought that a college can actually have 1 in 2 students flushing with 4 straight As? Now let me present another set of statistics. The list of colleges with the number of students who acheived 4 A'level Distinctions, 3 S paper Distinctions, 2 A0 Level A1(G.P and MTL) [Total of 9As]<br>1) Raffles JC [Kwek Li Ern Joy &amp; Tan Shin Eik]<br>2) Hwa Chong JC: Zero<br>3) Victoria JC: 1 [Chen De Feng Clarence]<br>4) National JC: Zero<br>5) Temasek JC: Zero<br><br>******************************************<br><br>Now what's this controversy about a neighbourhood-school boy who dated a RGS girl? RJC guys do not condone it. Yes, they do not wish other Singaporeans from neighbourhood schools to date their girls. And RJC girls will smirk if you tried to approach them or something (They don't want to stick with a redneck for the rest of their lives.) Now you know how sucky these people are. RJC people are : HAO LIAN, XIALAN, SMART, INTELLIGENT... they definitely love to despise and look down on other people.<br>So the bottom line is: Next time you see a RJC person, don't hesitate.

            <div class='col-md body'>to think again, it is a hatemail, but not really dumb - on second thoughts.<br><br>the threadstarter did make a generalization, which implies that while the elitist schools do produce such "haoliao" ,"xialan" student, there are also exception like one that replied. how true such i statement is we wouldn't know, though we do know that a few of such "xialan students" from the elite schools had did things to put their schools in a slightly bad name.<br><br>the (elitist) system is both good and bad like anything else, a double-bladed sword. the system drives, motivates (whichever way they use is not of concern here) the students to do their best, for themselves or the school. on the downside, not every teenager is hard-working, free of family problems, free of depression etc and even lesser are as intelligent. in this system, only the best would get to the top - those who are intelligent, who can work-hard, physically and psychologically healthy, or i might even include socially and spiritually healthy etc - only the best get to the top.<br><br>***please note that these should be taken no more than generalizations.<br><br>Thus are many other reasons why there are masses remaining in the lesser schools. Sometimes, students who "didn't make it" are despised. The reasons why teenagers can't make it doesn't necessary mean that they are unintelligent, unhealthy etc...and they are "worthless to the society". Note the inverted commas. Once I was in a conversation with 2 girls who were from the elite schools. Suddenly, we went into the topic concerning our education system. Both of them unanimously remarked that students who "didn't make it" were "stupid", "unintelligent"...while i was able to make them understand my point that student falling short of the mark are due to many reasons...they maintained that whatever reasons for the "failure", arguing proves to be pointless. Because such people are "useless to the society".<br><br>They were unable to see that people not making the mark, doesn't imply that they would become useless. To put it in a more humane way, everyone is human, even if unintelligent, even when on can't attend a top school. Economically, socially, everyone is integral to the society...by drawing lines, applying labels only serve to create conflict. From conflict, anything can happen.<br><br>My point is of bringing up the conversation I had with the 2 students, is to say that:<br>1. whether or not one attends top schools is not important. Neither are people who are not as endowed/wealthy any less useful.<br>2. people deserve respect, intelligent or not, rich or not, healthy or not.<br>3. practice restraint when applying labels, especially when the label is potentially hurtful or even derogatory like "stupid", "useless"<br>4. the elitist themselves should be aware that not everyone is as fortunate as they are - of being wealthier, brought up in loving families, more intelligent...<br>5. be sensitive to other peoples feelings. even when practicing restraint doesn't make you any money, oneself becomes a better person, more likable, more approachable. it can open many doors [without knobs]<br>6. if you can, understand that there are people who are borned into troubled families which greatly affects a person's ability to perform - Freudian psychology. note that being aware of and to understand are 2 different things.<br><br>Finally, people tend generalize...read not too much into it; it is what it is - a generalization.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Al i can say is, the most successful entrepreneurs in Singapore are not from RJC. Some of them are school dropouts... I've got a cousin doesn't even have an N level cert, sec 3 dropout. And he is now a boss of his own company... So i dun see RJC people as smart, haolian, xialan, intelligent or watever.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think the important point, and one that has already had something of an airing before, is that these arrogant and inept twits are probably going to end up wielding huge and unjustified influence over our lives.<br><br>They're going to get hotloaded into powerful administrative and political positions, via government scholarships and the like, by a political elite that in all likelihood graduated from the same school and harbours the same arrogant, elitist and highly presumptuous attitudes as them. It's true, many of them are nothing but petty bureaucrats in reality, worthless in the commercial world...but this means that the fact that the idiot government is going to be giving them the keys to the nation is even more disturbing. We're going to be ruled over by people who will probably not only treat us like peasants, but also do an incompetent job of running the country. So, we're doubly screwed.<br><br>That, if anything, in my humble opinion, is the reason why this whole immature and infantile attitude on the part of a lot of Raffles people is something worth paying attention to. Countries like the UK and France have had, and continue to have, raging debates about their own parallel situations, where arrogant, cloistered and ineffectual eunuch mandarins from schools like Eton / Winchester and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration run the country from top to bottom. The dangers here are far from illusory.<br><br>This is only to be expected of any country that was set up by academic over-achievers and chao-muggers, and therefore had its power structures monopolised by these people.<br><br>The only real remedy for this that I have seen so far? Go into the private sector, and make it really big. Even civil service / government eunuchs have to bow to pressure from mighty commercial interests these days, particularly in Singapore. This, I suspect, is at least a partial explanation for the ancient Raffles-ACS rivalry; the Raffles people believe they have the mandate of heaven to rule, but they get really peeved when they realise they have to play toady to the rich sons of commercial / merchant families or self-made, successful businessmen.<br><br>As I think we can generally agree, the fact that these private sector powers favour things like a more liberal lifestyle, more vibrant nightlife, etc has been the singular greatest factor responsible for even the slight opening-up of Singapore that we've seen in the last few years.<br><br>So, the plan is: go commercial; get rich and protect your fellow citizens at the same time. Sounds like a good life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually Hwa Chong Junior College was first for the past few years. In 2002 they got 49.2 % of the cohort with 4 As too, with Rjc lagging quite far behind. So frankly i dont really see how they are pulling away from the rest.Its just a cycle, some years they do exceptionally well, some years they dont. Just my two cents..</div>

How on earth does that translate to arrogance? As for the dating topic, those responses could well have been proliferated by the very bigots who wrote that mail you attached.
