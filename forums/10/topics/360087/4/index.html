              <p><span class="postbody">LOCAL businessman Oei Hong Leong - dubbed the
                  'man with the Midas touch' -<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> lost a whopping $1 billion on foreign
                  exchange and US Treasury bond transactions last year</strong></span>. <br> <br> While he has fully paid off these losses, he is now suing Citigroup's
                  private banking arm in the High Court for negligence and
                  misrepresentation, legal documents seen by The Straits Times reveal. <br> <br> Mr Oei claims that the bank - with which he has a 30-year relationship
                  - repeatedly gave him an inaccurate picture of his trading exposure,
                  causing him to take on more positions than he would have otherwise done
                  so. <br> <br> When he knew the full extent of his exposure, he felt he had no choice
                  but to close his positions - at an extremely volatile time last October
                  - thus suffering massive losses. <br> <br> It is not clear how much of a beating Mr Oei's net worth has taken, but
                  he was ranked Singapore's 29th richest man by Forbes last year with a
                  net worth of only US$210 million (S$308 million). Forbes bases its
                  listing on stakes in publicly traded companies and in private company
                  filings. <br> <br> Ironically, Mr Oei has become the latest high-profile victim of the
                  financial crisis because he was trying to reduce his exposure. <br> <br> In 2007, he believed that the global economy would experience a
                  downturn and decided to trim his trading positions, his statement of
                  claim says. <br> <br> Meanwhile, he told his private bankers that he wanted to maintain a margin surplus of about US$100 million. 
                  <br> <br> This is cash placed with a bank and clients can trade up to several
                  times that amount. If the trades run up losses, this margin has to be
                  topped up. <br> <br> Following a change of relationship manager last year, Mr Oei dealt
                  mainly with two assistants in the private banking department, whom he
                  would call to check on the balance on a daily basis. <br> <br> Read the full story in The Straits Times today.</span><span class="gensmall"><br></span></p>

              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal;">Thriving Norway Provides an Economics Lesson</span> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">OSLO — When capitalism seemed on the
              verge of collapse last fall, Kristin Halvorsen, Norway’s Socialist
              finance minister and a longtime free market skeptic, did more than
              crow.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">As investors the world over sold in a
              panic, she bucked the tide, authorizing Norway’s $300 billion sovereign
              wealth fund to ramp up its stock buying program by $60 billion — or
              about 23 percent of Norway ’s economic output.
              <br> <br>“The timing was not that bad,” Ms. Halvorsen said, smiling with
              satisfaction over the broad worldwide market rally that began in early
              March.</span> <br> <br> The global financial crisis has brought low the economies of just about every country on earth. But not Norway. 
              <br> <br> With a quirky contrariness as deeply etched in the national character
              as the fjords carved into its rugged landscape, Norway has thrived by
              going its own way. When others splurged, it saved. When others sought
              to limit the role of government, Norway strengthened its
              cradle-to-grave welfare state.
              <br> <br>And in the midst of the worst global downturn since the Depression,
              Norway’s economy grew last year by just under 3 percent. The government
              enjoys a budget surplus of 11 percent and its ledger is entirely free
              of debt.
              <br> <br>By comparison, the United States is expected to chalk up a fiscal
              deficit this year equal to 12.9 percent of its gross domestic product
              and push its total debt to $11 trillion, or 65 percent of the size of
              its economy.
              <br> <br>Norway is a relatively small country with a largely homogeneous
              population of 4.6 million and the advantages of being a major oil
              exporter. It counted $68 billion in oil revenue last year as prices
              soared to record levels. Even though prices have sharply declined, the
              government is not particularly worried. That is because Norway avoided
              the usual trap that plagues many energy-rich countries. <br> <br> Instead of spending its riches lavishly, it passed legislation ensuring
              that oil revenue went straight into its sovereign wealth fund, state
              money that is used to make investments around the world. Now its
              sovereign wealth fund is close to being the largest in the world,
              despite losing 23 percent last year because of investments that
              declined.
              <br> <br>Norway’s relative frugality stands in stark contrast to Britain,
              which spent most of its North Sea oil revenue — and more — during the
              boom years. Government spending rose to 47 percent of G.D.P., from 42
              percent in 2003. By comparison, public spending in Norway fell to 40
              percent from 48 percent of G.D.P. <br> <br> “The U.S. and the U.K. have no sense of guilt,” said Anders Aslund, an
              expert on Scandinavia at the Peterson Institute for International
              Economics in Washington. “But in Norway, there is instead a sense of
              virtue. If you are given a lot, you have a responsibility.”
              <br> <br>Eirik Wekre, an economist who writes thrillers in his spare time,
              describes Norwegians’ feelings about debt this way: “We cannot spend
              this money now; it would be stealing from future generations.” <br> <br> Mr. Wekre, who paid for his house and car with cash, attributes this
              broad consensus to as the country’s iconoclasm. “The strongest man is
              he who stands alone in the world,” he said, quoting Norwegian
              playwright Henrik Ibsen.
              <br> <br>Still, even Ibsen might concede that it is easier to stand alone
              when your nation has benefited from oil reserves that make it the
              third-largest exporter in the world. The money flowing from that black
              gold since the early 1970s has prompted even the flintiest of
              Norwegians to relax and enjoy their good fortune. The country’s G.D.P.
              per person is $52,000, behind only Luxembourg among industrial
              democracies.
              <br> <br>As in much of the rest of the world home prices have soared here,
              tripling this decade. But there has been no real estate crash in Norway
              because there were few mortgage lending excesses. After a 15 percent
              correction, prices are again on the rise.
              <br> <br>Unlike Dublin or Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where work has stopped on
              half-built skyscrapers and stilled cranes dot the skylines, Oslo
              retains a feeling of modesty reminiscent of a fishing village rather
              than a Western capital, with the recently opened $800 million Opera
              House one of the few signs of opulence.
              <br> <br>Norwegian banks, said Arne J. Isachsen, an economist at the
              Norwegian School of Management, remain largely healthy and prudent in
              their lending. Banks represent just 2 percent of the economy and tight
              public oversight over their lending practices have kept Norwegian banks
              from taking on the risk that brought down their Icelandic counterparts.
              But they certainly have not closed their doors to borrowers. Mr.
              Isachsen, like many in Norway, has a second home and an open credit
              line from his bank, which he recently used to buy a new boat.
              <br> <br>Some here worry that while a cabin in the woods and a boat may not
              approach the excesses seen in New York or London, oil wealth and the
              state largesse have corrupted Norway’s once-sturdy work ethic.
              <br> <br>“This is an oil-for-leisure program,” said Knut Anton Mork, an
              economist at Handelsbanken in Oslo. A recent study, he pointed out,
              found that Norwegians work the fewest hours of the citizens of any
              industrial democracy.
              <br> <br>“We have become complacent,” Mr. Mork added. “More and more
              vacation houses are being built. We have more holidays than most
              countries and extremely generous benefits and sick leave policies. Some
              day the dream will end.”
              <br> <br>But that day is far off. For now, the air is clear, work is
              plentiful and the government’s helping hand is omnipresent — even for
              those on the margins.
              <br> <br>Just around the corner from Norway’s central bank, for instance,
              Paul Bruum takes a needle full of amphetamines and jabs it into his
              muscular arm. His scabs and sores betray many years as a heroin addict.
              He says that the $1,500 he gets from the government each month is
              enough to keep him well-fed and supplied with drugs.
              <br> <br>Mr. Bruum, 32, says he has never had a job, and he admits he is no
              position to find one. “I don’t blame anyone,” he said. “The Norwegian
              government has provided for me the best they can.”
              <br> <br>To Ms. Halvorsen, the finance minister, even the underside of the
              Norwegian dream looks pretty good compared to the economic nightmares
              elsewhere.
              <br><br>“As a socialist, I have always said that the market can’t reg
              ulate
              itself,” she said. “But even I was surprised how strong the failure
              was.” </span></span></p>

              Economics Lesson</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">OSLO — When capitalism seemed on
              the verge of collapse last fall, Kristin Halvorsen, Norway’s
              Socialist finance minister and a longtime free market skeptic, did
              more than crow.<br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">As investors the world over sold
              in a panic, she bucked the tide, authorizing Norway’s $300 billion
              sovereign wealth fund to ramp up its stock buying program by $60
              billion — or about 23 percent of Norway ’s economic output.<br> <br> “The timing was not that bad,” Ms. Halvorsen said, smiling with
              satisfaction over the broad worldwide market rally that began in
              early March.</span><br> <br> The global financial crisis has brought low the economies of just
              about every country on earth. But not Norway.<br> <br> With a quirky contrariness as deeply etched in the national
              character as the fjords carved into its rugged landscape, Norway
              has thrived by going its own way. When others splurged, it saved.
              When others sought to limit the role of government, Norway
              strengthened its cradle-to-grave welfare state.<br> <br> And in the midst of the worst global downturn since the Depression,
              Norway’s economy grew last year by just under 3 percent. The
              government enjoys a budget surplus of 11 percent and its ledger is
              entirely free of debt.<br> <br> By comparison, the United States is expected to chalk up a fiscal
              deficit this year equal to 12.9 percent of its gross domestic
              product and push its total debt to $11 trillion, or 65 percent of
              the size of its economy.<br> <br> Norway is a relatively small country with a largely homogeneous
              population of 4.6 million and the advantages of being a major oil
              exporter. It counted $68 billion in oil revenue last year as prices
              soared to record levels. Even though prices have sharply declined,
              the government is not particularly worried. That is because Norway
              avoided the usual trap that plagues many energy-rich
              countries.<br> <br> Instead of spending its riches lavishly, it passed legislation
              ensuring that oil revenue went straight into its sovereign wealth
              fund, state money that is used to make investments around the
              world. Now its sovereign wealth fund is close to being the largest
              in the world, despite losing 23 percent last year because of
              investments that declined.<br> <br> Norway’s relative frugality stands in stark contrast to Britain,
              which spent most of its North Sea oil revenue — and more — during
              the boom years. Government spending rose to 47 percent of G.D.P.,
              from 42 percent in 2003. By comparison, public spending in Norway
              fell to 40 percent from 48 percent of G.D.P.<br> <br> “The U.S. and the U.K. have no sense of guilt,” said Anders Aslund,
              an expert on Scandinavia at the Peterson Institute for
              International Economics in Washington. “But in Norway, there is
              instead a sense of virtue. If you are given a lot, you have a
              responsibility.”<br> <br> Eirik Wekre, an economist who writes thrillers in his spare time,
              describes Norwegians’ feelings about debt this way: “We cannot
              spend this money now; it would be stealing from future
              generations.”<br> <br> Mr. Wekre, who paid for his house and car with cash, attributes
              this broad consensus to as the country’s iconoclasm. “The strongest
              man is he who stands alone in the world,” he said, quoting
              Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen.<br> <br> Still, even Ibsen might concede that it is easier to stand alone
              when your nation has benefited from oil reserves that make it the
              third-largest exporter in the world. The money flowing from that
              black gold since the early 1970s has prompted even the flintiest of

              tripling this decade. But there has been no real estate crash in
              Norway because there were few mortgage lending excesses. After a 15
              percent correction, prices are again on the rise.<br> <br> Unlike Dublin or Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where work has stopped on
              half-built skyscrapers and stilled cranes dot the skylines, Oslo
              retains a feeling of modesty reminiscent of a fishing village

              Icelandic counterparts. But they certainly have not closed their
              doors to borrowers. Mr. Isachsen, like many in Norway, has a second
              home and an open credit line from his bank, which he recently used
