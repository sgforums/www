              <p>The banks are insolvent, their liabilities far exceed their assets. The Federal Reserve is also bankrupt. The greedy bankers in cohort with the shadowy Feberal Reserve have conned the world.  <br> <br>Go and read the book The Shadow Money Lender" by Malaysia Mathias Chang. He is a Malaysian of Chinese descent. He is a Barrister of 31 years standing and once served as the Political Secretary to the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. He is the author of three bestsellers, “Future FastForward”, “Brainwashed for War, Programmed to Kill”, and “The Shadow Money-Lenders and the Global Financial Tsunami”, published in the US and in Malaysia.</p>

              <p><strong>CNBC David Faber described Temasek sale of BOA as “one of the worst investment” for one single fund</strong></p>
              <p>“A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">$4.6 billion loss on a $5.9 billion dollar investment</span></strong>. TPG lost $2 billion really quickly on Washington Mutual, but this one guys, is right up up there, as <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">one of the worst investment during this period for one single investment fund</span></strong>.”</p>
              <p>Now, what does the Lee family think of this latest investment loss?</p>
              <p><strong>Ho Ching, Temasek’s CEO, wife of Prime Minister Lee and daughter-in-law of MM Lee:</strong></p>
              <p>“No. I think if you want to run life with regret, you will end up doing very little.” (when asked if she had any regrets about leaving Temasek, Reuters 6 February 2009, <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idINTRE5152VT20090206"><span style="color: #a91b33;">source</span></a>)</p>
              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew, GIC’s Chairman, father of Prime Minister Lee and father-in-law of Ho Ching:</strong></p>
              <p>“When we invest, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">we are investing for 10, 15, 20 years.</span></strong> You may look as if you are making a big loss today, but you have not borrowed money to invest. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">You will ride the storm, the company recovers, your shares go up</span></strong>.” <strong>(CNA, 7 February 2009, </strong><a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=1909"><strong><span style="color: #a91b33;">source</span></strong></a>)</p>
              <p><strong>Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore, husband of Ho Ching and son of MM Lee:</strong></p>
              <p>“Both Temasek and GIC are professional investment organizations, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">highly regarded around the world for their track record.</span></strong> Management hired all over the world. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Boards are competent and experienced.</span></strong> They pursued <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">sustainable returns over the long term</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">avoided excessive risk-taking for short-term gains</span></strong>. Thus we have achieved good long term returns through ups and downs in the global economy and market cycles.” (in a speech on 21 October 2008, <a href="http://72.14.235.132/search?q=cache:4kwvgzMPl84J:www.channelnewsasia.com/annex/PM%27s%2520NIR%2520speech.pdf+Lee+Hsien+Loong+%2B+investment+losses&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=sg"><span style="color: #a91b33;">source</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Since we are investing for the long-term, why did Temasek sell of its stake in BOA so early and at such a low price? In less than a year, it lost 83% of its initial investment in Merill Lynch!</p>
              <p>Is Temasek pursing “sustainable returns” over the long term by pulling out so early from BOA? Does Ho Ching still have “no regrets” over such a disastrous loss? Of course she won’t, since the money is not from her own pockets.</p>
              <p>Does Singapore still has a future when its SWFs are bleeding our precious reserves dry with such ill-judged investments?</p>
              <p>Imagine using the $4.6 billion dollars to help ordinary Singaporeans tide over the current economic turmoil by subsidizing medical bills, providing retrenchment benefits and paying for the education of needy students.</p>
              <p>The government kept telling the people that we should be self-reliant and not develop a clutch mentality. It is not as if it has no means to help the less fortunate in society. It is so filthy rich that it is able to blow billion dollars away in an instance without blinking an eyelid!</p>
              <p>In her latest speech as Temasek’s CEO, Ho Ching said:</p>
              <p>“We <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">must do things today with tomorrow clearly in our minds</span></strong>. The story of Temasek is likewise a journey, each generation doing things yesterday and today with tomorrow very clearly in our minds – to make a difference to our fellow men and women, to support and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">build a future where Asia and Singapore can realise their full potential for their people</span></strong>, and to put in place the foundation for a better tomorrow.” (read her speech <a href="http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/media_centre_news_speeches_120509.htm"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Forget about Asia, Madam Ho. Haven’t you caused enough trouble in Thailand? Obviously the investment decisions made by you during your tenure did not take the future into account. How else can you explain the terrible losses suffered by Temasek from the purchase of Shin Corp, ABC learning and now Merrill Lynch?</p>
              <p>The Singapore government must account to the people immediately on the latest loss by Temasek since it is a corporate entity fully owned by the Ministry of Finance which is in turn financed completely by taxpayers’ monies.</p>
              <p>It is a shame that the PAP pay only lip service to transparency and accountability and continue to demand us to pay them exorbitant salaries only to screw up big time, again and again.<br><br><a href="http://sgblogs.com/entry/cnbc-david-faber-described-temasek-sale-worst-investment-single-fund/341689">http://sgblogs.com/entry/cnbc-david-faber-described-temasek-sale-worst-investment-single-fund/341689</a></p>

              <p><strong>Bank of America Shares Shot Up 74% After Temasek Sold It's Stake</strong></p>

              <p><strong>The New York Times, 18 May 2009 <br> </strong> <br> <strong>Wall Street Warms Up to Bank of America</strong> <br> May 18, 2009, 11:13 am <br> <br> Kenneth D. Lewis may have gotten a rebuke from shareholders last month,
              but he was getting votes of confidence from Wall Street on Monday.
              Upbeat assessments from analysts at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs lit a
              fire under shares of Bank of America, the banking giant where he is
              chief executive — and was chairman until a few weeks ago, when
              shareholders voted to remove him from that latter post. <br> <br> At first glance, the enthusiasm might seem to come at a strange time.
              Banking regulators just told BofA to raise nearly $34 billion,
              suggesting it was the most anemic of the 19 financial institutions that
              endured the government’s stress tests. <br> <br> But some analysts think Bank of America’s efforts to raise the capital
              are proceeding well. If that overhang clears up, it could ease the
              pressure that has been weighing on the company’s stock price. <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">Analysts at Goldman raised BofA from “neutral” to
              “buy” and added the company to their so-called conviction list of
              recommended stocks. Analysts at Citigroup kept a “buy” rating on the
              shares but had positive things to say about the integration of BofA and
              Countrywide, the troubled mortgage lender it recently bought, as well
              as its capital-raising plans</span>.</strong> <br> <br> BofA is using “at-the-market” stock sales to raise a large part of its
              additional capital cushion. That means the shares are quietly dribbling
              out in unknown quantities. Reading the tea leaves — and watching the
              volume of BofA stock trades — analysts at Citi, led by Keith Horowitz,
              estimate it has already raised $3 billion to $4 billion from selling
              new stock. <br> <br> In addition, Bank of America raised an estimate $4 billion after taxes
              from the recent sale of part of its stake in China Construction Bank. <br> <br> The biggest unknown appears to lie in BofA’s plan to convert about $16
              billion in institutionally held preferred stock into common. If BofA
              can offer a price that is above the equivalent price of the common
              shares, it will minimize the dilution for current shareholders, the
              analysts said. <br> <br> The analysts’ comments may be gratifying to Mr. Lewis, who endured some
              heated attacks at last month’s meeting from shareholders who lost
              money. <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">But Temasek, the investment arm of Singapore,
              could be feeling a bit of seller’s remorse. The fund recently reported
              selling its entire stake in BofA — at an enormous loss, by all accounts
              — some time before March 31. </span><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Since then, BofA’s stock is up about 74 percent.</span></span></strong> <br> <br> ------------------------- <br> <span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Latest updates at Singapore News Alternative</strong>: <br> <br> 1.
