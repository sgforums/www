              <p>I think the most urgent step to take now is to increase the pay of Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>He now only earns 2.7 million as minister mentor.</p>
              <p>In private sector as lawyer, he can with ease earn at least 4 million.</p>
              <p>He is losing out in money by staying on as MM and chairman of GIC.</p>
              <p>GIC already lost about 50 billion but he is still there to shoulder the burden.</p>
              <p>Look at Ho Ching after the billions of losses, already stepped down.</p>
              <p>As a reward, I propose increase Lee Kuan Yew's annual pay to 25 million.</p>

              <p>At this moment, close down of casino would mean closing them altogether, so do you think our leaders are so cork up to close it down?</p>

              <p>Dun worry, let heaven decide. It had struck the merlion as the first warning to them, and if they still dun wake up, the next one maybe the dome of city hall. Good luck.</p>
