              <br> * May have lost over US$1b: Reuters calculations
              <br> * Had converted 13.7% stake in Merrill Lynch into BOA</span> <br> <br> SINGAPORE - Singapore state investor Temasek sold its entire stake in
              Bank of America (BOA) during the first quarter of this year, taking a
              hit on its investment as it refocuses on emerging markets. <br> <br> 'We have divested our shares in Bank of America,' a Temasek spokesman said. 
              <br> <br> Temasek held 188.8 million BOA shares after it said in early January it
              had converted its 13.7 per cent stake in Merrill Lynch &amp; Co into
              BOA stock. <br> <br> At that time, its stake in BOA was worth around US$2.6 billion, or US$13.7 a share. 
              <br> <br> A source briefed on the deal told Reuters the shares were sold for
              between US$2.53 and US$14.81 during the first quarter of this year. <br> <br> Assuming an average price of US$8.67, Temasek may have suffered a loss
              of over US$1 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Temasek
              declined to provide the average selling price of its BOA shares. --

              <p> </p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has defended the impending salary
              increase for ministers and told its critics to have <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“a sense of
              proportion” </strong></span></span>when debating the issue.</p>
              <p>Lee said that for the average family earning S$1,500 or S$3,000 a
              month, the proposed salary increase might be an astronomical figure.</p>
              <p>“But for people in government like me, having to deal with these
              sums of money which we have accumulated through the sweat of our brow
              over the last 40 years, you have to pay the market rate,” he told the
              Singapore media covering his visit to Australia published in The
              Straits Times today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise, he said, the top talent in public sector would join the private sector.</p>
              <p>“<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And then you’ve got an incompetent man and you’ve lost money, by the billions. </strong></span></span>So get a sense of proportion”.</p>
              <p>Singapore cabinet ministers are currently drawing S$1.2 million
              salary a year but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said recently that the
              amount was below the benchmark of S$2.2 million, and should be
              increased in order for the public sector to attract and retain talent.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee described as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“absurd” for Singaporeans to
              quarrel over the amount the ministers should be paid.</strong></span></span> “You know, the
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cure for all this talk is really a good dose of incompetent
              government,</strong></span></span>” he said.</p>
              <p>The total cost to pay ministers and other office holders is now at
              S$46 million a year, which Lee said, amounted to about 0.13 per cent of
              the government’s total expenditure.</p>
              <p>“We are quarrelling about whether we should pay them S$46 million or
              S$36 million, or better still S$26 million. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So you save S$20 million
              and jeopardise an economy of S$210 billion? What are we talking about?”
              said Lee.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The proposed salary increase has attracted debate among Singaporeans who are against the move.</p>
              <p>But Lee told them: “I say you have no sense of proportion; you don’t
              know what life is about. And just think, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what would your apartment be
              worth with a poor government and the economy down?”</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Asked on his salary, Lee, said <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he earned S$2.7 million a year as Minister Mentor.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>“<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A top lawyer, which I could easily have become, today earns S$4
              million. </strong></span></span>And he doesn’t have to carry this responsibility. All he’s got
              to do is advise his client. Win or lose, that’s the client’s loss or
              gain.”</p>

              <p>Actually the reporter was wrong in his estimation of Temasek's loss in the purchase of Merrill Lynch turned Bank of America purchase. The reporter's estimated loss was based on the conversion (the stake that Temasek got when Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America). Temasek plough in US$ 6 billion for Merrill Lynch and it got US$ 2.6 billion for Bank of America. Where's the other US$ 3.4 billion? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The purchase of Merrill Lynch was for USD 4.4 billion, they made further purchases of Merrill Lynch on Feb 2008 and July 2008, all of which approximated to USD 6 billion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>188.8 million shares x US$8.67 (average price) = US$ 1.64 billion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>This translates to a loss of US$ 4.36 billion for Temasek if you track back to Merrill Lynch purchase.</strong></p>

              <p><br>Excuse me, dun blame my aunty hor, she already relinquished her position, and now a new former NY top banker is at the helm of temasek. What do you want some more from her,...to apologise to all of you, the stakeholders and the shareholders. Come on men, nobody ask you to invest in temasek, if you really wants to invest in bank, why focus on US banks??? why not local and BOC?? people are making money out of asian banks, and you guys are concentrating on those ailing US bank??? You are wrong side of the game boys, and you should know why temasek is pulling out. Lost nevermind, but dun lose face by dying from stupidity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me tell u that from internal sources that i gathered, when the economy recover, china will be the next economy superpower, even the americans are investing in them, but the worrying part is the geo politics and social stability of China, she may just go havoc due to increasing disparity between the rich and poor.</p>

                  apologise to all of you, the stakeholders and the shareholders.
                  Come on men, nobody ask you to invest in temasek, if you really
                  wants to invest in bank, why focus on US banks??? why not local and
                  BOC?? people are making money out of asian banks, and you guys are
                  concentrating on those ailing US bank??? You are wrong side of the

              <p>Yes, agreed, if you make hundreds of billions in your OWN business you have every right to lose everything. If you are accountable to shareholders which are you citizens, that's an entirely different issue. But then again, since when does PAP have to be accountable to her citizens.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the hundreds of billions are made through monopoly businesses and IPO launches, through which citizens are made to pay inflated prices for usage, after deriving the profits from her citizens the PAP detaches itself from her citizens and say the profits belongs soley to PAP, it has nothing to do with the citizens. Food for thought, to whom does the profit belong to? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
