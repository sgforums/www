            <div class='col-md body'><p>12 October 2009<br><br>Dr Teo Ho Pin MP<br>Bukit Panjang<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>I read with dismay your response to my email of 8 October 2009 asking you to support the residents of Bukit Panjang by not allowing the privatisation of the Fajar wet market that will result in the increase of market prices.<br><br>Your reply that you have simply conveyed the residents' views to HDB is a cop out. What the residents want is your unequivocal support that their livelihoods will not be jeopardised and that pricess will not be increased as a result of the sale of the wet market to Sheng Shiong.<br><br>An MP represents the views and interests of his constituents. All you have done is to be a postman. Surely residents of Bukit Panjang deserve better - an MP who is willing to stand up for them, not one who simply conveys messages.<br><br>We call on you to pull your head out the sand even as this controversy rages on. As an MP you need to assure residents that you will not allow the sale of the wet market to lead to increase of prices of food items and daily necessities.<br><br>I look forward to your response.<br><br>Gandhi Ambalam<br>Chairman<br>Singapore Democratic Party </p></div>

              <p>Is it a surprise that none of the Alternative Parties have taken any interests with the plights of the people in this Constituency ?</p>
              <p>MP Teo has certainly played it safe but simply paying lip service that is the minimum to be done by an impotent MP - unless he can get the higher echelon to weigh in behind his effort.</p>
              <p>Only when the position of the "albino Gorilla" is threatened will there be any reaction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The same situation was encountered by the residents at Seletar Estate, Mimosa and Nim Garden area - when demolishing plan was announced for the only wet market at the corner of the Yio Chu Kang and Jalan Kayu cross road.</p>
              <p>The reason given by the URA was that the area is being planned for redevelopment and a new wet market is planned at the Senkang-Hougang area, which is more then 6 kilometers away.</p>
              <p>The market was demolished within a year of the announcement, and the land remained quiet for the last four years, with no construction activity or bill board of any new project.</p>
              <p>The residents at Seletar Estate, Mimosa and Nim Garden areas will remember this unkind act in the next Election.</p>

              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Finally a opposition party try to gain
              points with people but of all from SDP. There are many many domestic
              problem other then this wet market problem the local people face
              every day but where are the opposition when we need them for the past
              4 years? at Toa Payoh for example, the town council removed a rain
              shelter 2 years after used it for only 2 years old at this old blk
              136 for en-block and also at this old blk 145  there is garden which
              town council rebuild only for 1 year before the whole place
              en-blocked, now the new hdb flats occupy this place,  but this waste
              of money if T C know there are going to en-block why rebuild the
              garden and build the rain shelter for the first place? I know Toa
              Payoh is always walk over for PAP  but why waste our money? I stay at
              Toa Payoh since 1971. If PAP is no longer care about the people why
              we should vote for them?</p>
