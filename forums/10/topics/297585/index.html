If it is broken such as by taking of monies from by the public fund that law is broken.<br><br>There is no implied excuse that the government once elected can do anything like paying themselves from the public fund above the contracted salaries.<br><br>It should not be made less of a crime just because people have voted them to be the government. In voting them there are 33.3 % of citizens who did not agree to elect them to be the government in the first place. Of the 66.7% who voted them the opposition wards did not vote them nor the walk-over wards vote them. There is no implied authority that any one can break or circumvent the law by taking monies from the public funds of any amount over and above the prior contract of appointment.</div>
