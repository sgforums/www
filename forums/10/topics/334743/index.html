              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Singapore's parliament voted on Tuesday to amend the city-state's constitution to allow the government more access to the country's reserves to cope with a faltering economy, local media reported. <br><br>The changes to the constitution will allow the government to draw on more returns from investing the reserves, so that its income can keep pace with rising expenditure, reported the pro-government newspaper The Straits Times on its website. <br><br>Official flash estimates showed this month that Singapore's economy contracted at an annualised rate of 6.3 percent in the third quarter after seasonal adjustments, pushing the export dependent economy into recession for the first time since 2002. <br><br>'We have the resources to do this and we have the resilience to see ourselves through,' Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was quoted by The Straits Times as telling parliament. <br><br>Lee also said that the government was preparing measures to help businesses, families and workers cope with the downturn. <br><br>State broadcaster ChannelNewsAsia reported that the extra funds would be spent on research and development projects and medical care for the aged. <br><br>CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the move gave the government more options to deal with a gloomy economic outlook. <br><br>'It will give them the flexibility to use the funds for a rainy day and I think a rainy day may be upon us,' Song said. <br><br>The global financial crisis has led Singapore to announce last week it will guarantee all local and foreign currency deposits in banks, finance companies and investment banks operating in the city-state with immediate effect, backed by S$150 billion ($101.5 billion) government reserves. <br><br>Economies across <a class="iAs" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal! important; FONT-SIZE: 100%! important; PADDING-BOTTOM: 1px! important; COLOR: darkgreen! important; BORDER-BOTTOM: darkgreen 0.07em solid; BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent! important; TEXT-DECORATION: underline! important" href="/forums/10/topics/">Asia</a> are set to slow this year as the financial crisis threatens to push developed nations into recession, depressing demand for Asian exports.</p>

              <p>Since Singapore became independent in 1965 - after being evicted from Malaysia - the country was under the leadership of PAP's LKY for more then 20 over years, followed by the annointed PAP's GCT.</p>
              <p>Throughout the 40 odd years of PAP rule, and through the economic downturn of 1987, as well as 1997 - and even 2002 - there was sufficient annual Government surplusses under the guidance of Finance Ministers : Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lim Kim San, Hon Hsui Sen, and Dr Richard Hu - to help tide Singapore over those critical periods.</p>
              <p>Why is it critical now that this Government had to dip into the Reserves to face the current economic downturn ?</p>
              <p>Why were questions not asked concerning the whereabouts of all the accumulated annual Goverment Budgetary Surplusses since the 1970s and transferred to the GIC and Temasek ?</p>
              <p>Has the investments made by the GIC and Temasek resulted in losses so severe that the Reserves must be drawn now - even with all the verbal assurances given by PM LHL that the approval is made now even though the chance of drawing is slim ?</p>

              <p>Despite the experience as an Officer in the Kempetai during WW-2, and as the Chief of Singapore's ISD for the better part of 20 years, our dear President-Elect has little experience to watch over our Financial Reserves.</p>
              <p>Not only has he no experience, but also has little power after the more experienced LKY - who survived the war as a Japanese Interpreter - had redrafted his original plans to have an Elected Presidency given sufficient powers to block any raid into our Reserves.</p>
              <p>The late President-Elect Ong Teng Cheong had tested the powers given to the Elected President's office by simply asking for the full accounting of the Reserves that his Elected Office was supposed to keep watch.</p>
              <p>Somehow, that seemingly reasonable and simple request had brushed the feathers on the wrong side, and was followed by the trimming of the powers to the Elected President's ablity to be in any position to block any raid into the Reserves.</p>
              <p>The use of the Reserves was supposed to be guarded by two keys - one held by Parliament, and the other by the Elected President.</p>
              <p>What is the use of a Second Key held by an Elected President, when his key cannot even be inserted into a keyhole that seems to be blocked by another lock - and with this new un-announced key and the First Key both being held by the Ruling Political Party dominating a Parliament ?</p>
              <p>The farce appears to thicken.</p>

              <p>Fund domestic consumption ?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans will be lucky if we get to see even a little drop from this $150 Billion that this Government had so cleverly manouvered out from the hands of the Elected President.</p>
              <p>It is ingenious of PM LHL to declare that there is little chance of this amount being used, and that it will help to hold it on stand-by and not allow legislative process to delay its availability when needed.</p>
              <p>With a PAP dominated Parliament that is controlled by the Party's Whip - can there be any Parliamentary delays when there is a need for the funds by this PAP Government ?</p>
              <p>All the "double talk" is characteristic of the PAP Leadership, can we trust the statements that have been so cleverly designed for public consumption ?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Rethink Singapore's economic growth model, says don</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">SINGAPORE should relook its economic growth model in an era
                  of tighter government regulation and multilateral oversight that could evolve
                  in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Professor Linda Lim from the Ross School of Business,
                  University of Michigan, told the Singapore Economic Policy Conference yesterday
                  that the growth model that has served Singapore may be out of place in a
                  changed environment.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Prof Lim said the growth strategy - the 'EDB (Economic
                  Development Board) model of give them a tax break and they will come' - has
                  both tried to do too much and <strong>achieved too little in terms of
                  delivering high and secure incomes and living standards.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>'We've 40 years of savings and repressed
                  consumption, so do we throw it at UBS and Citigroup and lose 60 per cent of the
                  value, or do we use it for ourselves?'</strong> said Prof Lim, a Singaporean
                  and a frequent contributor to The Straits Times.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Instead of letting the state make big bets on a few
                  major, capital-intensive, projects dependent on foreign capital, labour and
                  skills in which they have no intrinsic comparative advantage, it might be
                  worthwhile to consider releasing capital and talent to local entrepreneurs</strong>,
                  she said.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">These people can innovate and create value in smaller but
                  nimbler locally rooted enterprises, she added.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Prof Lim said that <strong>a national government, for
                  example, should not use domestic savings to create employment
                  disproportionately for foreigners simply in order to claim success in
                  establishing a particular sector of its choosing that may not be validated by
                  underlying market forces. </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Singapore, she said, can become a 'global model' for
                  environmentally-friendly buildings and lifestyle.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Other clusters of 'regionally integrated' economic
                  activities might be in the creative fields of traditional and modern Asian and
                  Western arts and culture.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another cluster is social and health services in, for
                  example, developing policies, systems, products and services for an ageing population,
                  Prof Lim said.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">'Don't think of yourself as an outpost of a declining
                  empire, or a second Shanghai or a second Boston. <strong>Why not be a first
                  Singapore?'</strong> she told the audience of economists and academics.</p>

              <p>oh please do you seriously think they would go and fund local enterprises....all these years they refuse to acknowledge the govt sectors has crowd out local human resources and drive up wage inflation. They were so focus on building giant state own enterprises.</p>
              <p>To most of you who read news about the US stock market that dominate the news  who think economies are currently really bad.</p>
              <p>But did you know that housing sales has pick up all time high at 5%......while price continue to fall the market is correcting itself..... if you look at the mircro level the small business are doing well.....it is the fortune 500 - 1000 that are cutting jobs.</p>
              <p>At time of recession it is the singapore own company that hold the fort. Not MNC.</p>

              <p>Singapore govt are quick to point out what is going to happen.....that is a trade LKY handed down, but current ministers are lazy in deriving tangible solution.  They take short cut and quick action and claim as efficient and paste gold on their face, but they never thought about fundamental problems persist.</p>
              <p>they dominate political arena so that they can social engineer the population to achieve certain direction that would benefit the big corporates. Over the years singaporean perspectives are so rigid and limited.</p>
              <p>And now in the mid of financial crisi they expect singaporean to create successful organization over night? while sg has been a culture of FDI.</p>
