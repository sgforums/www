I fell on my left side on the floor, near the exit doors.'<br><br>Madam Soh claimed she also hit one of the metal grabbing poles in the bus as she swung backwards.<br><br>Madam Soh in hospital after surgery on her fractured wrist. The polyclinic doctor had told her she didn't need an X-ray, she said. -- Picture: GAVIN FOO<br>She said the driver may not have noticed her, but after she fell, he didn't ask how she was. Instead, he said that old women like her should be more careful.<br><br>Two elderly men offered to help her, but she declined as she 'wanted to get up on my own', she said.<br><br>Standing up, she felt her left leg and arm aching.<br><br>About 15 minutes later, before alighting in front of Eunos MRT station, she noticed her left eye was swollen.<br><br>Around 1pm, when the pain persisted, she went to a nearby polyclinic with her grandson.<br><br>'The doctor checked my blood pressure and seemed to rush through the examination. He gave me some tablets for my high blood pressure, some Panadol and a cream to apply on my bruises.<br><br>'I asked him if I needed an X-ray, but he said my injury was not serious and gave me a letter for me to return to the clinic for review in two weeks' time,' she said.<br><br>Her condition did not improve the next morning, so Miss Kwek took her mother, with her left arm bandaged, to East Shore Hospital.<br><br>An X-ray showed that Madam Soh had a fracture in her left wrist.<br><br>Miss Kwek said: 'The specialist said she needed an operation immediately to prevent any deformity to her limb and surgery was done later that day.'<br><br>She said her mother was in stable condition and may need further treatment for her left eye and leg.<br><br>DRIVER SUSPENDED<br><br>An SBS Transit spokesman earlier said they weren't aware of the incident as nobody had reported it.<br><br>Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit's director of corporate communications, asked to speak to Miss Kwek to get more information.<br><br>She said in a statement that its staff members have visited Madam Soh in hospital and 'are assisting her'.<br><br>Ms Tan said the organisation takes a firm view on such matters.<br><br>'All bus captains have been told that they must stop and enquire should any passenger hurt themselves on board.<br><br>'The bus captain has been suspended from driving with immediate effect and we will take the appropriate disciplinary action, including possible termination, pending outcome of the investigation,' she said.<br><br>Miss Kwek was grateful for the visit by SBS Transit.<br><br>She said: 'The bus captain should have been more concerned for my mother and her condition after she fell. He did not even apologise or checked on how she was.<br><br>'Old people are frail and when they fall, they can have many injuries that are not immediately visible.<br><br>She was also puzzled why the polyclinic doctor had paid scant attention to her mother's injuries.<br><br>'Why did the doctor not do an X-ray scan for my mother?' Miss Kwek asked. 'She had to ask for it.'<br><br>A spokesman for SingHealth Polyclinics also visited Madam Soh in hospital and said it would investigate the case.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The bus driver "didn't know".. that is a lame excuse.  It's pure common sense that the elderly are much more prone to injuries.. plus anyone operating a public transport vehicle should have been taught how to handle such situations.  Doesn't the public bus company require their drivers to go through safety training?  Or have they stinged on that in favour of "cost cutting"?</div>
