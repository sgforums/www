            <div class='col-md body'><br>With the current population size, Hospitals already cannot cope with the rising numbers of Dengue cases. What will happen when we reach 6.5 million? What lame excuses do you think the government will come up with?<br><br>As at present, they haven't yet come up with any solutions to curb and control Dengue every year, what bright ideas do you think they will have in handling a population size of 6.5 million? I know they are VERY profficient in counting their Taxes and revenues for themselves, but doubt they can think of a solution without copying from some other countries...<br><br>Multi-million dollar salaried Rice Bins!<br><br>===================================================<br><strong>Feeling the strain<br>Rising dengue causing bed crunch; minister says elective surgery may be postponed </strong><br><br>Tan Hui Leng<br>huileng@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>AS THE number of dengue cases increase, the bed crunch at public hospitals here may get worse, warned Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.<br>.<br>In a deja vu of the dengue outbreak in 2005, Mr Khaw said elective surgery cases, which are non-emergency, would be rescheduled if dengue cases in hospitals hit an unmanageable level.<br>.<br>"For planning purposes, I just assume we'll get a repeat of 2005, so we have to gear up for that," he said at a dental event yesterday.<br>.<br>"The last few weeks' data is not that optimistic."<br>.<br>Last week, the dengue outbreak hit epidemic levels of 381 cases, up from 349 the previous week.<br>.<br>So far, the disease has killed three elderly men in Singapore.<br>.<br>As of Monday, dengue patients occupied 113 public hospital beds, or about 2 per cent of the total 5,267 beds in service. Currently, about 70 per cent of dengue patients are admitted to the hospitals.<br>.<br>"All public hospitals are actively monitoring dengue admissions and discharges to manage the bed situation, and this may include cutting back on elective surgery," said a Ministry of Health spokesperson.<br>.<br>Assuming a worst-case scenario of more than 500 dengue cases a week, this would mean more than 400 hospital beds "clogged up" by dengue , she added. This is about the size of Alexandra Hospital.<br>.<br>Public hospital occupancy rates range from 82 to 90 per cent now.<br>.<br>Two years ago Â— when dengue hit a record 14,210 cases and 25 deaths Â— up to 300 beds were taken up by dengue patients in the peak periods.<br>.<br>Changi General Hospital, which at one time had registered over 100 per cent occupancy, opened another ward and made arrangements to transfer patients in stable condition to neighbouring St Andrew's Community Hospital.<br>.<br>It was forced to postpone or refer to other hospitals some 22 per cent of its elective surgery cases between 13 July and 12 Aug 2005.<br>.<br>If hospital resources are strained by dengue patients again, the "only practical way" is to reschedule elective surgery, said Mr Khaw, adding that life will then be "very miserable and inconvenient" to affected patients.<br>.<br>"I hope we never reach such an extent but we can't tell," he said.<br>.<br>Mr Khaw also touched on how Singaporeans can expect to benefit from lower costs of dental treatment from next January, when amendments to the Dentists Act kick in.<br>.<br>This is because dental therapists will be able to move out of school dental clinics to the private sector.<br>.<br>"Dental care is a wide spectrum of activities and much of the simpler work can be done by staff like dental hygienists. That helps reduce costs," he said.<br>.<br>Some 230 dental therapists, some of them graduates from Nanyang Polytechnic, now serve the primary and secondary schools here.<br>Rising dengue causing bed crunch; minister says elective surgery may be postponed<br></div>

If yes, and nothing is done, then it is the government's fault.<br><br>Otherwise, like what I said earlier in this thread, there is no need to wait for the government to take action. YOU can take the initiative. The government cannot possibly deploy enough personnel to check all the drains in the country. If you happen to spot a potential mosquito breeding site, you can simply call NEA to alert them, rather than do nothing and wait for the NEA to suddenly get the inspiration to come down and check themselves.<br><br>Eliminating this dengue threat is not solely the government's responsibility. It's our responsibility too. If there are Aedes mosquitoes breeding in your home or backyard, it's as much, if not more, your fault than the government's.

If yes, and nothing is done, then it is the government's fault.<br><br>Otherwise, like what I said earlier in this thread, there is no need to wait for the government to take action. YOU can take the initiative. The government cannot possibly deploy enough personnel to check all the drains in the country. If you happen to spot a potential mosquito breeding site, you can simply call NEA to alert them, rather than do nothing and wait for the NEA to suddenly get the inspiration to come down and check themselves.<br><br>Eliminating this dengue threat is not solely the government's responsibility. It's our responsibility too. If there are Aedes mosquitoes breeding in your home or backyard, it's as much, if not more, your fault than the government's. Don't try to push the blame for something which is your responsibility.</div></blockquote>Do u really need to point finger at me and blame me for what I mentioned above?  YOu are being very one-sided, you can't for the sake of siding and defending the "good" govt you go on to blame others for the dengue fever.  I am in no fault.  As it is there are people from NEA going round to check on the environment.  If these people are not doing their job, you blame the resident for not reporting.  Even if you want to side the "caring" govt, you need not resort to be so unfair.<br><br>Don't point fingers at the residents!!!</div>

I mentioned earlier, nobody from the authority has done anything to the still drain water for long.  It is either negligence or they couldn't be bothered.  If they are so into taking measures against dengue at all times, they will not neglect or don't bother about this.  Surprise I have got dakkon_blackblade said that if I did not alert the authority then it is the govt's fault.  hey, they have people going round to check on the environment and if they don't want to do anything, why blame me if I did not alert the authority.  It is not my fault!!!<br><br></div>
