It is precisely because of the prudent, conservative, risk-averse approach we take on a day-to-day basis that when someting like SARS comes along, the government is able to step in and do what needs to be done.”<br>He reiterated that it is important to to take a “longer-term prudent approach past one electoral cycle” as the thing at stake was the “social public good”. <br>- CNA/xy</td>

              <p>Point is, I think PAP is entangling itself in confusion, hoping to win some votes in the process whilst <strong>neglecting the poor at the same time</strong>: a situation that will most likely hit them hard in years following.</p>
              <p>In any case, prefunding what is already double prefunded really doesn't make any sense, and that is why I think the format of Medishield-life resembles more likely a ponzi scheme...</p>
              <p>For neglecting the poor, regardless of religion, PAP folks are only attracting themselves lots of bad karma...</p>
