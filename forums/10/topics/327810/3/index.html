              <p>andrew, we are well aware of the ways of the despots.     Those of us who are able to vote will definitely vote them out.   The only regret is some are living in the GRCs.   </p>
              <p>Some of us are doing our part on web or in our own personal ways expose the despots.   Many in Singapore are still brainwashed by them.</p>

              <p>It is because of the sacrifice of people like him that the depots are forced to pay out more of the public money they grabbed, back to Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>CSJ has no vision and that goes the same with the rest of the other opposition parties members.</p>
              <p>The reason why they don't have any vision for the governance of Singapore is because they hide too regularly in their offices and doesn't socialise much with the citizens unless there's going to be an upcoming election. That's the time where they start to come out of their caves and tries to gather support.</p>
              <p>To be a successful opposition, the members have to be more active than the ruling party in socialising with the citizens, blending into their crowds. Only then, they will be able to HEAR the voice of the people and only then will they be able to produce a suitable vision for the governance of Singapore based on the voice of the people.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, people doesn't want to do things that are difficult and probably hasn't been tried and done before. However, that's where their problems lies. They do not understand the true meaning of being in politics and the responsibilities and burdens of the people in the country.</p>
              <p>Nothing is easy, if the opposition really wants to run the country. They will need to prove to the citizens that their vision is the vision of the people, and not vision of their own party.</p>
              <p>Until that happens, I will support the current ruling party of Singapore.</p>

              no seriously... i do not believe that even if LKY dies, anything is going to change. i believed that long ago but looking at our oppositions and our PM's iron fist, i came to realised that though our MM still has certain power, he no longer really runs the country. 
              
              he seems to have lost a lot of strength and age really has caught up with him. plus knowing his intelligence, he would have let his son consolidated power long ago. so even if we support Dr. Chee and Dr. Chee bounces back, nothing will change to our political system.
