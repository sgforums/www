              <p>i gues u should go back into the history lessons and look at
              obama's campaign...and also a good thought about MM Lee's
              words..</p>
              <p>look into history when MM Lee came up into politics and became
              the opposition of his time..the government wasn't on his side...but
              he has a belief..and he made it without asking the government for
              funds or support..u wan an opposition..?that's the opposition
              that's strong enough to guardian this country..i'm glad he made
              it..think of the kind of situation this little fragile country will
              be in if someone else takes over..we would be in trashed up
              economics and politics..u wan to live in a country like what's
              happening at our neighbour..?</p>
              <p>look at Obama's campaign..and look at him...he's amazing as a
              governor..he has what it takes...he proved himself that he has the
              support of the people..and he need not get the support from the
              government..he improvise and adapt..if we have such an opposition
              with such capabilities..maybe things would be very much
              different..maybe u should be asking...if the opposition is so
              good..and if the people like him so much and trust that he can make
              a difference in financial and economics term...y does he need so
              much support of the government..?people make the country..if people
              support him..he wouldn't have a problem..and if he's asking for the
              help of the government..would u help someone who is opposing u..?or
              would u prove u can do better..?if u're holding a 0.5mm thin sheet
              of glass that guardians millions of lives..would u let someone else
              hold it?knowing that u can guardian it better than that someone
              else..?if u wanna hold it..prove that u can hold it better..and
              these millions of lives will</p>
              <p>and think about MM Lee's words..he is a wise man who brought
              singapore from almost nothing to have such amazing economics
              today..u wanna talk about economics..u're kind of off ur limits
              isn't it..?study economics..</p>
              <p>MM Lee said that having such a government now only makes sure
              that when a opposition realli takes over in Singapore..we would be
              sure of its abilities..and we can be sure our future is secured
              more than ever..if the opposition can't make our lives better and
              make the economics of this country better...then i think it's
              better off we stick with this government..coz we're still advancing
              at 8% GDP growth a year..and that's after so many years...</p>
              <p>that's all for now..gtg..u ponder on it..~</p>
