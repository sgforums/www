              <p>Jeyaretnam<br>Up the political ante<br>It’s his sheer presence, rather than his new party, that is stirring up opposition hopes for the next election - if he stands.</p>
              <p>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Apr 22, 2008<br><br>Surprisingly, the return of Singapore’s veteran opposition figure has evoked less online interest than the international press.<br><br>But it has not devalued the importance of the re-emergence of Mr. JB Jeyaretnam, one of the most colourful and articulate politicians here at a time when the political temperature is rising.<br><br>It has boosted the opposition’s hope of making a bigger inroad in the 2011 general election, provided he himself contests in it.<br><br>But the registration of his new Justice Party has not been greeted enthusiastically in the opposition-sympathetic Internet for a number of reasons.<br><br>For one thing, many bloggers are too young to know much about the 82-year-old opposition figure or his past record, including his fierce battles with Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>With the mainstream media rarely mentioning him for so many years – except for his troubles - young Singaporeans have grown up ill informed of JBJ’s colourful history.<br><br>There are other reasons for the lukewarm response, including the following: -<br><br>- His proposed Reform Party is viewed as too dependent on 0ne man – an 82-year-old not renowned for organisation or recruitment abilities. His reform platform doesn’t much appeal to non-English speaking masses, which are simply worried about bread-and-butter issues.<br><br>- Knowing the ways of the government, Singaporeans do not expect a quick or smooth approval of the party.<br><br>- Mr. JBJ has not said he will contest in 2011; if he doesn’t, few people believe his party will make any significant inroad on the political scene.<br><br>- The fragmented opposition needs good politicians, not another party. Merely adding one more may actually intensify the division, rather than unite them to oppose a giant.<br><br>If Mr. JBJ runs the new party the same way he did with the old Workers Party, it will not work. He is a strong debater not a natural leader who can rally people.<br><br>These are the negative factors.<br><br>The positive points of this old warrior are twofold.<br><br>First, his determination and fearless record of raising ‘sensitive’ issues publicly have earned him much respect to those who know (or even disagree with) him.<br><br>Secondly, Mr. JBJ’s tough debating skills are proven, matched only by his long-time political rival, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, and these are needed to augment the opposition role of checking the People’s Action Party’s power.<br><br>A JBJ in Parliament will be unpalatable to the PAP, which will find it hard to pitch most of its younger leaders to engage and win any toe-to-toe verbal slugging with him. They just don’t have the experience.<br><br>The Senior Minister and possibly a handful others may have the skills to match his sharp tongue.<br><br>The man’s return, however, could be a badly needed boost to the morale of the opposition when it comes to debating a growing list of pressing problems facing Singapore.<br><br>In short, the biggest impact is JBJ himself, not his Reform Party – not yet, anyway.<br><br>The proposed Reform Party will serve to provide him with a political platform, which the mainstream media can ignore only at the cost of its own credibility.<br><br>At any rate even if it blacklists him, the Internet will keep the public informed. Politics could be entering a more exciting phase.<br><br>Some Singaporeans are already relishing the prospect of a JBJ contesting in Tanjong Pagar against Mr. Lee Kuan Yew (provided both men feel up to it).<br><br>The Law of Nature will decide this.<br><br>In 2011 Lee will be 87 years old and JBJ, 85, which means that TIME is the common enemy of both fighters.</p>

              <p>I hope he knows his Achille's heels. He is a good debater, he should stick to issues, and make the younger Cabinet Ministers shit in their pants.</p>

              <p>Though I find that alot of oppositions on our government in this forum is uncalled for and sometimes, funny and plainly for the sake of it, JBJ is one opposition I really respect along with Mr Chiam. I met JBJ many years ago at City Hall where he was selling his books. It was my Birthday that day and I was intrigued and I stop to talk to him and he talked to me for that few short minutes! I bought his book and I got him to autograph the book and he duly obliged.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here is a man, who has fame and riches and a career but yet he gives it all for his ideals all just to aim to provide a better home for all singaporeans. Not all his actions are right but at least, he do not just TALK in a forum, he actually do something about it. He has my respect. I will always remember that pair of eyes when I talked to him, a kind man but a pair of eyes that say he will fight till he dies.</p>

              <p>Lets hope he leads the Reform Party as a reformed man, and wisely attack PAP policies, and make them cringe, not attack PAP ministers and give them an opportunity to sue. As a learned gentleman, he should discredit  the idea, not discredit the man.</p>

              <p>JBJ thinks in English, he is witty and thinks fast on his feet.</p>
              <p>LTK thinks in Chinese, his thoughts needs to be translated into English, and therefore there is a time lapse.</p>
              <p>He who is hesitates is lost., in a debate.</p>
              <p>In the past years LTK as an MP did much more for his constituents, than JBJ did when he was a MP for Anson. What the point of having a fast mouth, when little is accomplished. Rhetorics is entertaining, but results is wanted.</p>
              <p>Better to be slow with results, than to be fast and do repairs.</p>
