Later, Goh CT demanded public apology, which Ong TC did.<br>Think Goh CT also said that Ong TC was not medically fit for 2nd term presidency, but Ong TC actually wanted to continue.<br></blockquote>One of the first things Ong did when he became the Singapore President was requesting a government White Paper to list down in clear and specific terms, the responsibilities of a President.<br><br>When the White Paper was produced, he took to question, among other things, one such responsibility listed: protection of Singapore's financial reserves. According to press reports, Ong wanted to know what he was supposed to protect in his Presidential capacity, and requested for a full inventory of government assets and reserves from the government. The inventory list was never produced, as the authorities dawdled, claiming insufficient resources to compile such a list.<br><br>Ong became a little frustrated and made public statements about being prevented by ministers and bureaucrats from carrying out his Presidential duties. That move riled more than a few feathers within the government, and the latter withdrew their support for Ong to carry on a second term as the President, citing his ill health.<br><br>Ong insisted to have been given a "clean bill of health" by external medical professionals, and initially intended to run for a second term. However, the wife came down with cancer and her deteriorating health was one of the reaons that prompted Ong to relinquish his Presidential duties to spend more time with her. He made his decision public during a press conference before the 1999 Presidential elections and Nathan was sworn in after a walkover victory.</div>

She passed away before the presidential polls. Her illness had been kept under wraps for quite a while. The Speaker had covered the President's duties on a few occasions when the latter accompanied her for medical treatment in the US. Although her illness was not specified, my mother suspected Mrs Ong had cancer and was receiving chemotherapy because she appeared to be wearing a wig during her public appearances.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by PoRen:<br>It was a different story from what Goh Chok Tong said loh.<br>Goh said after the medical report came out, the Cabinet had a discussion and deemed Ong TC unfit to carry on medically. But Ong said he is medically fit. Goh said the Cabinet saw a glass half-empty, while Ong saw a glass half-full.</blockquote>One would think that if Ong did not go out beyond his ceremonial duties to request for the inventory list of government assets, he may still be residing in Istana today -- with or without the lymphoma. Some observers may comment that he was put there by the powers that be to allow then-Second DPM Lee Hsien-Loong a faster ascension to First DPM, but they never expected him to pose difficult problems for the government.</div>
