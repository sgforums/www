            <div class='col-md body'>I am all for the govt using a portion of their reserves to subsidise good healthcare for the citizens.<br><br>One thing that bugs me no end is the fact that we have 'C' class wards in hospitals here.  Have you ever visited someone who's staying in that dreaded 'C' class ward before?  It's pretty depressing!!  There are 7-8 beds to a room, the place is usually warmer, because of the close proximity, various noxious odours waft through the room when procedures and what-not are being done, there's very very little 'privacy', etc etc.<br><br>I would love to see the money being used to build better wards for patients and eradicate the 'C' class wards altogether.  Imagine what that dreadful environment does to patients' psychological and emotional well-being, and don't forget the nurses and doctors who have to work there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  It's common knowledge that the poor nurses who work in such wards often have to sacrifice their breaks because they have too many patients to take care of.  How do you expect quality healthcare when everyone's overstretched but nobody wants to admit it and address the issue??   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Developed countries do not have wards that segregate you based on how much you can pay.  The 'C' class ward is unheard of altogether.<br><br>Surpluses that are left over after a decent amount has been pumped in to activities that will help generate more income and savings, improve living conditions, etc. should also be used to subsidise nursing homes.  There's now a crazy situation whereby families of patients who are slated for nursing homes do not cooperate by playing 'delay' tactics, simply because it's 'cheaper' for the patient to remain in a public acute hospital, than move to a nursing home.  This creates a situation where public acute hospitals face full or close-to-full occupancy status, and it really is a waste of resources!  Imagine, an acute hospital, being used as a nursing home!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Solve the problem once and for all, by generously subsiding nursing homes!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It's scary when a family member falls ill with a chronic condition because medical bills stack up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Imagine, if mom or dad falls ill and they do not have a Medisave account or if they have already depleted theirs, you, as their child, will have to use yours.  If we're talking about chronic illnesses, they usually come with a 'domino effect' where sooner or later, you get a host of other related medical conditions as well, and it's usually never isolated to just ONE medical problem.  That means, $$$, and plenty of it!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  So, you use your own Medisave to pay for them, then, what's going to happen when *knocks on wood ... you grow old and realise that your Medisave account had been substantially knocked out by then?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  It's a 'legacy' we pass on to the next generation and the next, and the next...  And with real inflation setting in, the situation will worsen.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>If we have no surpluses left after chanelling it to areas of priority, then, there's nothing to say.  However, if we DO have surpluses that can result in a better standard of living for all, including our elderly, our sick and our infirm, I wonder, why not??<br><br></div>

It simply means Singapore is no longer a country. The government as shown in HDB change of function from housing provider to status of private developer will continue to be using anti-welfarism name to enable them to collect as much monies as possible to showcase to the world of their so-called successful leadership but more importantly it is to justify paying to themselves the world's highest government salaries. That's why I have my doubt MOH will conduct the COI into the excessive salaries and bonuses paid to their favoried charade charity and other NGO heads.<br><br>Is any talent really required in collecting maximum monies and revenues from the people while telling people: "Don's expect free lunch, welfarism or hands-out" as MND was famously noted for telling the HDB flat buyers.<br><br>People are mature not to ask for hands-outs but they certainly do not expect the reverse - using the anti-welfare psychology to enable all the ministries in making obscene profits, monies and surpluses causing the backlash or reverse - high costs of living and doing business.<br><br>One forumer in Feedback Unit has been suggesting that the government in building its surplus is actually like the goose laying the golden egg. His idea is : when the surplus of the government is sufficiently high it can be used to generate endowment returns at S$billions to help citizens.<br><br>I would say that the reverse is the case here. Government in creating for themselves all the profits and surpluses from HDB methodology of double-charging on land through HDB flat sale is killing their own goose (people ability to make monies and overall business viability) that lays the golden eggs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's quite easy to simply say; just take care of your health so that you won't become a liability later down the road. But hey, have you ever heard of inherited deseases like diabetes, heart deseases which passes on from generation to generation? There is no way one can stay 100% healthy once you grow old - pass the age of 40.<br><br>If a person under circumstances is not able to find gainful employment from between 50 to 62 (the retirement age whereby you will receive monthly payouts from your CPF Retirement Fund), and is unfortuante enough to come down with some permanent medical condition such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, then that person is likely to spiral down with his or her ailment. The government urges us to take care of our health, to prevent illness, to treat early and prevent deterioration of health, but on the other hand, they refuse to let people who are pass 55, nearing 62 years of age, who has medical conditions to treat their ailment to keep from getting worst. The present Policy that only the crippled or "incapacitated" are allowed to receive early payments from their Retirement Fund is nothing but REDICULOUS!<br><br>What the hell can $300 per month do then, when you are bedridden or in a vegetative state??? Well, yes, you could possibly pay for the daily transport of a person (not necessarily a maid much less likely a nurse) to just come stand by the bedside of the "incapacitated" person, only.<br><br>If anything, I say the CPF's policies are NONSENSICAL. They are only interested and proficient in protecting their Policies, rules, regulations, and whatever red tapes they weave on a daily basis. They don't give a CRAP, whether you are able to make money to fund your medications!<br><br>Let me ask you people, can someone age 58-59 find gainful employment in Singapore to fund his or her own medical needs? Don't tell me about choosiness, or level of pay. Just think, use your brains; for someone with a medical condition to stand all day long or walk all day, or do manual menial tasks all day, for a measly few bucks monthly. Wouldn't the meaning of life disappear into thin air? If someone this old, can find a job in Singapore to fund his or her medical needs monthly, I'd say that will be the day that pigs can fly in Singapore!!!<br><br>In Singapore, you don't need to be in a vegetative state to be considered "incapacitated". Just being old, is enough. YOu will not be able to find decent paying jobs performing decent tasks to pay for upkeeping your health. The very mindset of employers in Singapore, INCAPACITATES anyone who is above 40 and has a medical condition. Even when one is healthy, once you hit your 40s, it's hard luck time! NOBODY WANTS YOU!!!<br><br>Living and making a living in Singapore, SICKENS ME!!! Wellfare for citizens has gone down the drain!<br><br></div>
