              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Forget philosophy, Shotgun.  Let's talk reality here.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure how many lawyers you know, but if you knew a few
              you could well realise that they're not the brightest creatures at
              the best of times.  As such, courts tend to operate by a
              "bullshit baffles brains" policy.  As H L Mencken once said,
              "A court of law is a place in which Jesus Christ and Judas Iscariot
              would be treated as equals - with betting odds slightly in favour
              of Judas".</p>
              <p>That being the case, I'd recommend saving a lot of heartbreak by
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> trying to find
              and justify any association whatsoever between law and
              justice.  To be blunt, they're simply not smart enough to be
              capable of handling justice.  What they're reduced to is a
              wiggling about in a straightjacket comprising of a rigid set of
              rules dressed up in the pomp of the legal profession.</p>
              <p>In this case, it comes down to answering a simple question: "Was
              this fellow found with a sufficient quantity of drugs for the death
              sentence to be passed?", and the answer is yes.  Beyond that,
              asking a judge or a lawyer to contemplate anything to do with the
              case is as good as asking a housefly to perform algebra.</p>

              <p>Precisely my point, Shotgun - they would hang the retard.  Yes, they're that unimaginative.</p>
              <p>Also, the presumption that possession is for the purpose of trafficking is by definition the presumption of guilt.  It's there in black and white that the courts do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> work upon the principle of innocent until proven guilty, so if you expect them to, you're only setting yourself up for heartbreak.</p>

              <p><strong><em>A DISGRACED lawyer, detained indefinitely without trial under a ministerial order, on Thursday lost his final bid to be freed.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Since September 2005, Edmund Wong Sin Yee, 49, has been held under
                  the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, which allows for those
                  suspected of criminal activities to be detained without trial.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>To order such detention, the Home Affairs Minister has to be
                  satisfied that it is necessary 'in the interests of public safety,
                  peace and good order'.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wong was accused of being a leader in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a drug syndicate that smuggled
                  ketamine from Malaysia to Taiwan and from Malaysia to China through
                  Hong Kong between early 2004 and April 2005</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>T<span style="color: #ff0000;">he order to detain him has been extended twice, for 12-month periods each time.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Wong went to the High Court to challenge the detention but this was rejected by Justice Tan Lee Meng last September.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>On Wednesday, he appealed to the Court of Appeal, which gave its decision on Thursday to uphold the lower court's judgment.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Wong's instructed counsel, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim, </span>had asked for his release on grounds that the detention order was unlawful.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Mr Yim argued that Wong's alleged activities were done outside
                  Singapore but the Act applied only to crimes committed within the
                  country.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>He contended that Wong's Constitutional rights had been violated
                  because he had not been told the grounds of his detention until 15 days
                  later.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Mr Yim also argued that the detention was unreasonable because
                  witnesses are available to testify against Wong in a proper trial.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>'My client is happy to stand trial. He's happy to face charges and
                  if convicted by a court of law... he's happy to serve his sentence,' Mr
                  Yim said on Wednesday.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>But the Court of Appeal rejected the arguments on Thursday.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Justice Andrew Phang, delivering the court's decision, agreed with
                  Justice Tan's interpretation of the Act: that the threat to public
                  safety, peace and good order<span style="color: #ff0000;"> did not necessarily have to result from
                  criminal activities in Singapore.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>The court also agreed that the detention order was valid even assuming Wong was not told of the grounds.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Finally, the court found no basis that the minister had exercised his discretion irrationally.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Wong, who is divorced with two children, is allowed to see immediate family members twice a month.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>The next review of his detention order is expected to be in July next year.--EOQ</em></strong></p>

                  debate is about. Is the people high on drugs and jumping out of 20
                  storey buildings classified as dying from direct consumption of
                  drugs?</p>

              <p>She jumped out a window because she was the ex-wife of your ex-husband because she took up modelling and hooked up with some traffickers? That has absolutely nothing to do with drugs, all you did was somehow tie drugs into the anecdote. Did she jump out the window because she was high? No. I asked for an instance where somebody has jumped out a window because he/she was stoned and you failed to provide one. Like I said about skythewood's claims about marijuana causing people to do things like that, you won't find an instance when that has happened.</p>
              <p>If somebody goes to work drunk then he should be prepared to face the consequences of it, if that person gets fired for it would you blame alcohol or the person for getting drunk? Blaming marijuana for causing people to not be able to work is just as stupid as blaming alcohol for someone getting fired for turning up to work drunk.</p>

              <p>Ah yes, a Hollywood comedy film is truly solid evidence. Well have you seen Die Hard? It's awesome, look at how police officers can single-handedly take down dozens of terrorists. Have you seen The Curious Case of Benjamin Button? Look at how people how are born backwards and grow younger instead of age normally have such a hard time fitting in with the rest of society, we need the government to spend money on campaigns to encourage tolerance of backwards aging people.</p>
