              <p>No I am not okay with that and that is why there are legal age restrictions on potentially harmful substances and surely it is the parents' responsibility to educate their children about the dangers of such practices and throwing the kid in prison certainly isn't the way to go about it. However, if it were an adult sniffing that glue then it's entirely his choice and none of us, not even the government, should tell him otherwise.</p>

              <p>Talks of Obama legalizing marijuana? so what? And I doubt it,
              give me some source indicating that.</p>
              <p>It is definitely legal in Netherland, does that mean we should
              follow them?</p>
              <p>drunk people are irritating. We can still deal with them as long
              as they don't do incredibly stupid things. Drug addicts are
              harmful. If they stay one corner and smoke their weed, no one will
              really bother with them. But more likely than not, they are
              unemployed because their addiction makes them very inefficient at
              their job, as they are very stoned.</p>
              <p>And they are so addicted they they will do stupid and harmful
              things. Like rob a bank, or deal drugs to other people, in order to
              get some drugs.</p>
              <p>It is evident that drugs and it's withdrawal effects is harmful
              to society. Very harmful, more than that of macdonald's and smoking
              and alcohol.</p>
              <p>If you want to fight for individual freedom and step away from
              totalitarism, go fight for the rights of gay people or something.
              arguing in favour of drugs is not the way.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Well firstly, if we wish to better deter people from using drugs we <strong>should</strong> follow the Netherland's drug policy as they have a relatively low rate of drug use compared to coutnries with much harsher laws such as the UK and United States.</p>
              <p>As in the case of alcohol vs marijuana, it has been shown that alcohol is worse for your health, has a much higher potential for addiction and does cause violence in some. Marijuana on the other hand has no physical addictive properties, isn't anywhere near as bad for you and does not incite violent behaviour in those who use it.</p>
              <p>It is only a small percentage of drug users in general who do get addicted and do harmful things and as for the withdrawal effects, withdrawal from alcoholism is much worse than withdrawal from heroin, I know this from the personal experiences of a friend who is an ex-police officer who had to oversee addicts.</p>
              <p>From your post it is obvious that you know little, if not nothing about that which you are arguing against, ask any police officer in the world and they will tell you that a drunk person is much more dangerous than someone who's stoned.</p>
              <p>Having said all this, your argument has no basis and relies on the usual scare tactics employed by anti-drug propaganda by painting drugs as completely addictive, violence causing items of death.</p>

              <p>Well firstly, if we wish to better deter people from using drugs
              we <strong>should</strong> follow the Netherland's drug policy as
              they have a relatively low rate of drug use compared to coutnries
              with much harsher laws such as the UK and United States.</p>
              <p>As in the case of alcohol vs marijuana, it has been shown that
              alcohol is worse for your health, has a much higher potential for
              addiction and does cause violence in some. Marijuana on the other
              hand has no physical addictive properties, isn't anywhere near as
              bad for you and does not incite violent behaviour in those who use
              it.</p>
              <p>It is only a small percentage of drug users in general who do
              get addicted and do harmful things and as for the withdrawal
              effects, withdrawal from alcoholism is much worse than withdrawal
              from heroin, I know this from the personal experiences of a friend
              who is an ex-police officer who had to oversee addicts.</p>
              <p>From your post it is obvious that you know little, if not
              nothing about that which you are arguing against, ask any police
              officer in the world and they will tell you that a drunk person is
              much more dangerous than someone who's stoned.</p>
              <p>Having said all this, your argument has no basis and relies on
              the usual scare tactics employed by anti-drug propaganda by
              painting drugs as completely addictive, violence causing items of
              death.</p>

              <p>unfortunately, i am quite acquinted with the singapore police force, and i know how the drug addicts is like, compared to drunk bastards.</p>
              <p>who cares about the health issue of the abuser of drugs or alcohol? why do you keep bringing this up? the point is how they will affect others and society, not how they will destroy themselves.</p>
              <p>Holland has lower drug abusers? how will they compare to singapore?</p>
              <p>Do you understand what i am saying? drug is bad for society, just like alcohol and cigeratte is bad for society. And it is definitely worst. Why don't you start your argument from there? try asking any police officer in the world who will they prefer to deal with, drug junkies or drunk bastards.</p>

              <p>My point is that drugs do not directly affect others, it affects the individual. I don't see what's so hard for you to grasp.</p>
              <p>I do understand what you're saying but you are completely factually incorrect, especially in the instance of cannabis. Marijuana is not worse than alcohol and cigarettes, this point has been made by researchers and it was just last year that British scientists actually ranked drugs on a scale according to factors including its affect on society, potential for addiction, effects on health, etc. and marijuana was below alcohol. How is it that alcohol is legal yet marijuana, which is far less harmful, isn't?</p>
              <p>I have, and any police officer in the world would much rather deal with someone who's stoned than somebody who's drunk. An alcoholic is violent, someone on marijuana isn't.</p>
              <p>Perhaps instead of presenting an argument comprised completely of rhetorical questions try actually addressing some of my points. It's not an argument if it says nothing.</p>

              <p>It is a new year, yet the opinion of a braggart remains like the same old joke.</p>
              <p>How did you come to the conclusion that Singaporean's favor the Death Sentence - let alone its retention ? </p>
              <p>Were Singaporeans ever consulted by this Government on any Laws passed - let alone the death sentence ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The one and only consultation that was ever made to Singaporeans was the ONE and ONLY <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_Merger_Referendum_of_Singapore">Merger Referendum  </a>concerning Singapore's entry into Malaysia - and even that Referendum was skewed to guarantee ONLY ONE result that fulfills LKY's purposeful ambitions. </p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option A</strong>: All Singapore citizens would automatically become citizens of Malaysia, and Singapore would retain a degree of autonomy and state power, such as over labour and education. Singapore would also get to keep its language policies, such as to retain using all four major languages, <a title="English language" href="/wiki/English_language"><span style="color: #002bb8;">English</span></a>, <a title="Mandarin Chinese" href="/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Mandarin</span></a>, <a title="Malay language" href="/wiki/Malay_language"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Malay</span></a> and <a title="Tamil language" href="/wiki/Tamil_language"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Tamil</span></a>. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option B</strong>: Singapore would become a <a title="Federation" href="/wiki/Federation"><span style="color: #002bb8;">federal</span></a> state like that of the other eleven states, with no more autonomy than the other states would, thus ceding control over issues such as labour and education policies to the federal government in <a title="Kuala Lumpur" href="/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Kuala Lumpur</span></a>. This also meant that there would be less multilingualism - only English and Malay would be used for official purposes, and possibly education. Only those born in Singapore or descended from the Singapore-born would become citizens of Malaysia. There would also be proportionate representation in Parliament from Singapore. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option C</strong>: Singapore would enter on terms no less favourable than the Borneo territories, <a title="Sabah" href="/wiki/Sabah"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Sabah</span></a> and <a title="Sarawak" href="/wiki/Sarawak"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Sarawak</span></a>, both whom were also discussing merger with Malaysia. This was to ensure that Malaysia would not discriminate along racial lines, as that would mean discriminating against Sabah and Sarawak, which were predominantly <a class="mw-redirect" title="Bumiputra" href="/wiki/Bumiputra"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Bumiputra</span></a> as well. </li>
