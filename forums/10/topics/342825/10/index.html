              <p>To read this and wonder about how someone can suggest I found
              cannabis powder and suggest its marijuana, and then to suggest that
              marijuana cannot be a powder, but mentioned its possible to be a
              powder, and now that it cannot be a powder to suggesting it cannot
              be a powder.</p>
              <p>So say the person that cannot deal with truths then.</p>
              <p>I cannot say I've never asked that you can verify the sources of
              my story.</p>
              <p>I also cannot say I've never tried to be reasonable and
              polite.</p>
              <p>But I can say some people just want to win their argument at all
              cost, heck care the people that is in the real world.</p>

              <p>Please stop trying to defend yourself. You did not know that cannabis is the same as marijuana and that just says it all about your knowledge of the topic.</p>
              <p>I never said marijuana comes in powder form, it never does. It can be ground up but not to a fine powder.</p>
              <p>Not only that, you've failed to address every single one of my points so I wouldn't call what you're doing arguing at all.</p>

              <p>Credentials don't mean a thing, fact is all your information comes from extremely biased personal observations which would be of little or no use. Not only that, for you to suggest that I have no experience with drugs is presumptuous and not to mention completely incorrect.</p>
              <p>As for showing insight to actual drug users, well that won't be too hard considering I am one, myself and so are a lot of my friends and yes, many experts do agree with my stance on drugs. Just a quick google and you'll see that most scientists who've looked into the implications marijuana has on health find that it's nowhere near harmful enough to have such punitive laws against. </p>

              <p>Well, Hashish is pretty much a more concentrated form of marijuana. Minus the leaves and stuff. Its more like an oil form after extracting them from the buds or leaves. Now normally people dun use buds or skunks to do it cause.. its just a waste , and it smokes n tastes better the way it is, in bud form.So when trimming the plants, the left overs u gather alot and a big ammount n u extract the THC out to become hashish. Further refinement can take away more of the impurities to have the Golden Oil.. slurp!! Which tastes like crysthenum&lt;-- however u spell it. N its the bomb.</p>
              <p>As for bush , it pretty much means outdoor. So, outdoor if left in the wild becomes wild n normally wild.. so it does not have the yield of a skunk which is normally indoor or hydro and u take good care of it.. love it like ur own baby, nurture it and when ur baby grows up, nice and strong, its skunk... that sticky icky icky.. =D</p>
              <p>Now hash can be turned into powder form if dried up after u extract it and yes u can sprinkle it on ur cigarette or on ur marijuana. Normally it gives u a body and head stone. So the difference of what kind of stoneness depends on it being higher in sativa or indica. So most Marijuana has sativa n indica, it just depends on the ration hence many difference strains of marijuan.</p>
              <p>oh man.. talking about this is making me salivate...</p>
