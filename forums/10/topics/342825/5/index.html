              <p>Not only that, the percentage of users who die as a direct result from drugs are much higher for easily attainable over-the-counter pharmaceuticals than most illicit drugs. It is just plain idiocy to allow pharmaceuticals such as Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride (DPH; brand name Benadryl) and Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine).</p>

              <p>No one is talking about openly smoking marijuana , its disrespectful to non-smokers and there are children around , But i dont think there is anything wrong with in door smoking , like holland and other countries in the world , they always tolerate smoking of cannabis in doors , even in perth they allow you to grow 2 plants per home.</p>
              <p>The issue here is , a 20yr old chap is going to get hanged for a plant .  , He has a mother , who gave birth to him ,who gave you the right to play god and take a man's life  if you were talking about herion or some harsh drugs , i might still understand why ppl want him hanged , but its for marijuana a plant  .</p>
              <p>A Chronic Marijuana smoker , An Alcholic and a dude who smokes 30sticks of cigarate a day , who has it worst?? You wont know unless you do a crititcal research about it  .</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The problem is that hanging the courier is
              ineffective in limiting drug supply; There is an endless number of
              stupid, ignorant or desperate people willing to courier
              drugs.  The way to prevent drug trafficking is to bring the
              masterminds to justice or to stop demand.  Taking the life of
              the courier will have zero net effect on the drug market. 
              It's disingenuous.</span></span></p>
              <p>The people STILL willing to risk their lives are those probably
              unaware of the consequences and dire repercussions, but when we
              sentence that one to death, you can see how strict we are. No net
              effect? Why don't you go try trafficking here in Singapore? Tell me
              you're not in the least affected by such harsh sentences. This is
              not just a measure against people who already are willing to make
              sacrifices (by sending themselves to death) but also a warning to
              every other Singapore citizen, PR, and even people overseas to say
              that we do not tolerate drug trafficking. </p>
              <p>The demand for something will always be there. We cannot stop
              the demand for something without boycotting it. Drugs are right in
              an addict's face. Tell me how he or she can resist the temptation
              or anything of the sort to take it. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Last thought, state-sanctioned death penalty
              is still murder.  'Should have known better' in no way
              justifies taking somebody's life.</span></span></p>
              <p>Death penalty may be murder, but it is murder called for by him
              or herself. By trafficking drugs and play a part in distributing
              it, are you not committing homicide when people die of drug
              overdose or addiction? If you can kill others, then murder through
              the fore-mentioned death penalty is fully warranted because it is
              clear this should have come! You chose it. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> What is the point of having judges who
              can not decide on sentencing?</span></span></p>
              <p>Judges sentence based on the circumstances, with what the law as
              a guide. They do not bend the law by sentencing just as they
              like. </p>

              <p>No one is talking about openly smoking marijuana , its
              disrespectful to non-smokers and there are children around , But i
              dont think there is anything wrong with in door smoking , like
              holland and other countries in the world , they always tolerate
              smoking of cannabis in doors , even in perth they allow you to grow
              2 plants per home.</p>
              <p>The issue here is , a 20yr old chap is going to get hanged for a
              plant .  , He has a mother , who gave birth to him ,who gave
              you the right to play god and take a man's life  if you were
              talking about herion or some harsh drugs , i might still understand
              why ppl want him hanged , but its for marijuana a plant  .</p>
              <p>A Chronic Marijuana smoker , An Alcholic and a dude who smokes
              30sticks of cigarate a day , who has it worst?? You wont know

              <p>Well assuming they all consume a large amount of their respective drug (yes, alcohol and tobacco are considered drugs too) on a daily basis then the alcoholic would have extremely noticeable short-term health effects, the smoker would get minor, more chronic symptoms and the chronic marijuana smoker would be the least affected.</p>

              <p>Over the last 20 years, has the incidence of drug addiction been reduced since the supposed reduction in drug couriers, or has there been a consistent number of arrests and drug busts despite the stringent laws ?</p>

              <p>I managed to come to the conclusion that prescription drugs kill a higher percentage of its users than illegal drugs by comparing the number of deaths vs estimate percentage of population using those drugs. The number of deaths are reported here:</p>
              <p> <a href="http://rinf.com/alt-news/business-news/prescription-drugs-kill-300-percent-more-americans-than-illegal-drugs/4837/">http://rinf.com/alt-news/business-news/prescription-drugs-kill-300-percent-more-americans-than-illegal-drugs/4837/</a></p>
              <p>and also on other websites which collect statistical data on the subject. Compare it to the estimated drug usage (easily found on Google, no need for me to link) and you'll see for yourself.</p>

              <p>No one is talking about openly smoking marijuana , its
              disrespectful to non-smokers and there are children around , But i
              dont think there is anything wrong with in door smoking , like
              holland and other countries in the world , they always tolerate
              smoking of cannabis in doors , even in perth they allow you to grow
              2 plants per home.</p>
              <p>The issue here is , a 20yr old chap is going to get hanged for a
              plant .  , He has a mother , who gave birth to him ,who gave
              you the right to play god and take a man's life  if you were
              talking about herion or some harsh drugs , i might still understand
              why ppl want him hanged , but its for marijuana a plant  .</p>
              <p>A Chronic Marijuana smoker , An Alcholic and a dude who smokes
              30sticks of cigarate a day , who has it worst?? You wont know
              unless you do a crititcal research about it  .</p>

              <p>what about 40 year old people? they don't have mothers? at what age is it ok than? if you want to include the age in your argument, than let's debate at what age will it be ok.</p>
