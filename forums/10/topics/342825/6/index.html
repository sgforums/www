              <p>Even more evidence to support the fact that you now almost nothing about that which you are so desperately arguing against (by arguing I mean posing rhetorical questions, which although shouldn't be considered a cohesive argument, is probably the closest you'll ever get). Please explain how marijuana destroys lives. It's non-addictive, has never directly killed anyone, does not incite violence and doesn't cause cancer. So how does it destroy lives?</p>

              <p>Because without a trial, then it is not justice.</p>
              <p>Even if it may seem that the man's guilt is obvious, you still
              need a trial to determine unambiguously that he truly is guilty.
              For all you know he may well have left his luggage unlocked and
              unattended for a while and some shady fella may slip drugs into the
              luggage. The trial process is there to determine whether or not
              that is the case.</p>
              <p>That's the whole purpose of the trial - to truly determine the
              guilt or innocence of a person. So if someone chucked a pack of
              cannabis into your luggage, at least the trial gives you the chance
              to fight back on that defence!</p>

              <p>So dude, what is justice? Sorry to get philosophical, but this is an important question.  </p>
              <p>What is justice when the punishment when the guilt has already been determined?  There were precedent cases where the Judge was not totally convinced that the trafficker was truly aware that he was trafficking drugs but was hanged anyway because the "law" demanded it. In these cases, ambiguity of guilt  = guilt.  Not innoncence.  That is justice?</p>
              <p>Only one thing can save a person's ass when it comes to this.  That is, for CNB to testify that the "purity" of the drugs carried is considered to be below the requirements for the death penalty. </p>

              <p>You asking me that in terms of philosophy or what?</p>
              <p>Off the top of my head, ideally speaking, the legal system should be one that serves the cause of Justice.  Then that leaves only the matter interpreting Justice.   The Laws should then reflect such an understanding of what Justice is, in that society.  </p>
              <p>There is a problem with the current drug laws that reverses the "innoncent until proven guilty".  This to me is a double standard.  It is not "fair" that trafficking cases should be met with the "guilty until proven innoncent" standard, resulting in a mandatory death penalty, regardless of circumstance.  </p>
              <p>I guess what I'm saying is that, we don't achieve Justice by just being Kantian about laws. The laws themselves ought to be fair, and not holding double standards on people.  Justice cannot hold one set of scales for one type of case, and another set of scales for another type.  There is something fundamentally wrong with a mandatory death penalty, coupled with a guitly until proven innoncent approach. </p>

              <p>Forget philosophy, Shotgun.  Let's talk reality here.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure how many lawyers you know, but if you knew a few you could well realise that they're not the brightest creatures at the best of times.  As such, courts tend to operate by a "bullshit baffles brains" policy.  As H L Mencken once said, "A court of law is a place in which Jesus Christ and Judas Iscariot would be treated as equals - with betting odds slightly in favour of Judas".</p>
              <p>That being the case, I'd recommend saving a lot of heartbreak by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> trying to find and justify any association whatsoever between law and justice.  To be blunt, they're simply not smart enough to be capable of handling justice.  What they're reduced to is a wiggling about in a straightjacket comprising of a rigid set of rules dressed up in the pomp of the legal profession.</p>
              <p>In this case, it comes down to answering a simple question: "Was this fellow found with a sufficient quantity of drugs for the death sentence to be passed?", and the answer is yes.  Beyond that, asking a judge or a lawyer to contemplate anything to do with the case is as good as asking a housefly to perform algebra.</p>
