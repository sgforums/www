              <p>Ah yes, a Hollywood comedy film is truly solid evidence. Well have you seen Die Hard? It's awesome, look at how police officers can single-handedly take down dozens of terrorists. Have you seen The Curious Case of Benjamin Button? Look at how people how are born backwards and grow younger instead of age normally have such a hard time fitting in with the rest of society, we need the government to spend money on campaigns to encourage tolerance of backwards aging people.</p>

              <p>Correlation does not imply causation. Just because she jumped out a window when she was high doesn't mean marijuana caused her to do it. Well a man killed himself while wearing a yellow striped shirt, certainly yellow striped shirts cause people to jump off buildings. See the fallacy of your logic? She probably did it for reasons such as problems with relationship, money, etc.</p>

              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;"><strong>Fact:</strong> Marijuana does not cause people to use hard drugs. What the gateway theory presents as a causal explanation is a statistic association between common and uncommon drugs, an association that changes over time as different drugs increase and decrease in prevalence. Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug in the United States today. Therefore, people who have used less popular drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and LSD, are likely to have also used marijuana. Most marijuana users never use any other illegal drug. Indeed, for the large majority of people, marijuana is a terminus rather than a gateway drug.</p>

              <p>Anyway, that ciggies found inside the ciggie box next to the dead body.</p>
              <p>It was inside the ground floor of a room of a HDB 3 room flat.</p>
              <p>We were radioed to go over and take over from 3 other officers because its the Puasa period and 2 of that 1st group of officers need to go break fast.</p>
              <p>We were told the person died of piles.  (Incredulous and a bit of mirth there.)</p>
              <p>We got there when the sky is just darkening. (Officers came out to greet us and tell us the same thing, I was warned not to smile or laugh too much.)</p>
              <p>Was introduced to the deceased and the 2 person in that same flat.  One is the deceased g/f, the other the g/f's grandmother.</p>
              <p>We were given the deceased's nric card for safekeeping.  And me being the only female, with secretarial training is always the one to have to do logsheet and recording down details.</p>
              <p>The NRIC card shows a plump good looking man with fair skin in his 30s. (maybe all nric photos make us looks fair.)  NRIC and picture was new, less then a year before the death.</p>
              <p>We took a look at the deceased and all of us sobered up real quick.  Deceased is skinny and dark till dark chocolate skin.  (Skinny as in can see the bones.)</p>
              <p>Officers left, and I continued on taking down details.</p>
              <p>Much later, my partners in the room with the deceased found two ciggie boxes, in it are the hand rolled ciggies.</p>
              <p>They took them out to where I was at the kitchen writing to show me.  One took some on his tongue to confirm that the powder inside is cannabis.</p>
              <p>Then we called over the deceased g/f and asked her about the deceased medical condition.  The g/f nearly snatched those ciggies away and claim she does not know about them.</p>
              <p>We anywhere radioed back the officers to come back on what they missed.</p>
              <p>(In all fairness, the g/f has a hoarse voice and slightly wondering eyes.  She might have abused other drugs before resorting to cannabis because its untrace-able.  And that deceased might have been starving himself to save money for his cannabis ciggies since he was unemployed.)</p>

              <p>One thing to prove your account above completely bogus - marijuana doesn't come in powdered form. Secondly, how do you assert that the cause of death was from marijuana overdose (which can't happen) from that tale? Oh the deceased was skinny and unemployed so surely there is no other explanation than that he was starving himself to save money for cannabis as there is no other reason why someone could be underweight and unemployed. Stop jumping to conclusions.</p>

              <p>Babe,</p>
              <p>stop confusing medical facts to relationship facts.</p>
              <p>Lets suggest you like horror movies. After some time, will you keep watching the same time of horror movies of the same storyline, or you will want something a bit more different and exciting where you dont know when that ghoul is going to suddenly pop up?</p>
              <p>Or a movie with some extra psychotic killer in that ghost horror movie?</p>
              <p>Look at Aliens movies, the aliens evolved right?</p>
