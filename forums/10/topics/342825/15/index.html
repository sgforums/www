              <p>I don't see the connection but as I remember it, imposing the law restricting the use of all chewig gum essentially took money out of the Singaporean economy by causing all Singaporeans to purchase their gum overseas, most frequently Malaysia, and bringing them over the border.</p>
              <p>The law was revised in 2004 which allowed gum of therapeutic value to be imported.</p>

              <p>I do have a stigma of meeting up with complete strangers who

              <p>Well if statistics, medical journals and scientific publications
              aren't enough for you then I'm afraid you will never be convinced
              of anything and you are just being stubborn and refusing to accept
              my evidential support. So far you have done nothing but deny, deny,
              deny without properly addressing my points or presenting a
