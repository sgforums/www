              <p>I do understand that drugs would require regulation if legalised. However, to prevent crimes involving drug use such as driving while under the influence, laws enforcing a minimum age to purchase drugs as with alcohol and tobacco, making it illegal for supplying minors with drugs and imposing extremely harsh penalties for harming others while under the influence which would apply to driving under the influence whether or not anyone is actually harmed.</p>
              <p>Even though another form of crime will increase, those crimes are actually unlawful and should be punished as opposed to the previous injustice of having many harmless and responsible drug users prosecuted.</p>
              <p>Despite what many may think, obtaining drugs even in Singapore is extremely easy, by no means do you have to be desperate. You wouldn't even have to associate with drug lords, just small-time dealers at the very bottom of the chain, you can even get some from people you don't know by just asking around in clubs.</p>
              <p>The reduction of demand could be done through the introduction of warning labels on legally sold drugs much like with cigarettes and the harder drugs such as heroin could be controlled by requiring doctor's permission for its medical use. I don't see why we need to reduce the demand of lighter drugs such as marijuana as it isn't as dangerous as those legal drugs sold openly such as alcohol and tobacco.</p>

              <p>I've already pointed out multiple benefits of legalisation, six
              in total if I remember correctly.</p>
              <p>Responsibility with social drugs has already been learned by
              regular society, alcohol is considered a social drug and the
              attitudes regarding would then apply to marijuana. I have been
              living in Singapore a long time and will continue to until I finish
              school and I've definitely been here long enough to have
              experienced the amount of recreational drug use although it isn't
              as common among teens as other countries, recreational drug use is
              more widespread amongst the young adult demographic especially
              those who go clubbing.</p>
              <p>Statistically, the United States has had increasing levels of
              drug use despite adopting tougher drug laws and the Netherlands has
              not experienced rising levels despite more lenient laws and the
              legalisation of marijuana; the Netherlands now reap the benefits of
              decriminalisation which I have mentioned earlier.</p>

              <p>I agree with you on the part of learning responsibility.</p>
              <p>However, have you considered how much harm this "social drugs" would inflict on our society? Have we have not enough alcohol addicts to deal with already? Must we legalize more drugs so that people can have more options to get high and cause more trouble.</p>
              <p>I believe that the consumption of marijuana is less a threat to the society compared to alcohol. People are stoned rather than mad. But i also believe that both marijuana alcohol does harm to the human body. So should we legalise more options for people to harm themselves?</p>
              <p>Besides, what may work for a liberal western society may not work for our more conservative asian society.</p>

              <p><br>Instead of using a straw man argument, perhaps you should actually have a look at the drug policy of the Netherlands and its statistics on drug use as well as alcohol prohibition in the United States during 1920 to 1933.</p>
              <p>Rape and drugs are completely different, people are deterred from drugs because of the risks involved. How many people can you honestly say would love to do drugs but can't because it's illegal and were it not, they would definitely use drugs?</p>

              <p>Drugs aren't just people harming themselves, if you choose to put it that way then unhealthy food is just a way for people to harm themselves. It is the individual's choice whether or not he wishes to deal with the medical consequences of drug use and I don't see why you or the government should have a say in it.</p>
              <p>Please rid yourself of all typically Singaporean preconceptions of drugs. People who get high rarely cause trouble and even if they do, there are already non-drug related laws being enforced.</p>

              <p>Sure not every person can be responsible, but the second they endanger someone else by cause of being under the influence, they will be prosecuted for the appropriate crime committed e.g. assault.</p>
              <p>Another part of regulation would be to enforce harsher punishment for those committing crimes while under the influence to act as a further incentive for responsible drug usage.</p>
