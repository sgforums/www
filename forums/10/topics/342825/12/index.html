              <p>I cannot tolerate this barbarism any longer. Those of you who agree with sentencing this man to death are either in support of Singapore's oppressive laws or are severely misinformed. Cannabis is a harmless drug, it is an unhealthy Big Mac compared to alcohol and tobacco. Why it is still illegal is beyond me but hopefully that would change as there have been talks about Obama possibly legalising marijuana and perhaps the rest of the world will follow suit if the U.S. takes a stand against this outdated law founded on corporatism and racism.</p>
              <p>Drugs may ruin lives but it should be the individual's choice who he or she wishes to live his/her life. The government should have no say in it, it may not be entirely healthy but you don't see people being prosecuted for eating too much McDonald's. This goes beyond the argument of corporal punishment or the death penalty, this is an affront to individual freedom and a step towards complete totalitarianism.</p>

              <p>Wow... 12 pages of discussion.</p>
              <p>Seriously guys, don't you see this discussion (flame war) will never end? Even if manage to convince people with your views, at the end of the day, it still means nothing.</p>
              <p>Singapore laws classified marijuana as a banned drug and so it shall be. Nothing can change that fact, besides only certain part of the world classified it as not part of banned drugs. Majority of the world still classified it as one, so why should Singapore bend it's rules for the minority?</p>
              <p>Heck, if Singapore wants to, she can even classified sweets as drugs, what can you do about it? Don't like it, migrate then, stay away from Singapore.</p>
              <p>Our laws is released to the public, not like it is undisclose. So there is no excuse for you to break it and no reason for you to whine about it when you get caught for it. If you don't want to get into trouble with the laws, just stay away, simple as that.</p>
              <p>Btw, It makes no sense comparing marijuana against junk foods (macdonald), because I don't see people eating marijuana for lunch.</p>
              <p>If majority of the Singaporean are not whining about the law, I don't see why there's a need to change it. Afterall, we are the ones living here, not those people in other countries shouting for human rights when their country is in a mess.</p>

              <p>Cannabis buds can be milled into a flour after they're dried. I can only speculate why the dead person VK mentions used it. It could've be crack for all we know, but I'm not privileged to the knowledge of their flavours.</p>
              <p>Pot smoke has a sweet smell. Don't indulge in it for too long, or at least don't get called up for drug testing, because it lingers for up to a month in the body. It's a hallucinogen and also a stimulant, which is why it's banned in sports (read up about what happened to Tomas Enge if you're not convinced), and possibly why it's controlled.</p>
              <p>Side question: I wonder if you feel the same about LSD, given that it was placed even lower on the chart in the same Lancet journal. <em>It can be fatal</em>, but we've already discounted the harm to self caused by such narcotics.</p>
              <p>Until such a time where cannabis usage and abuse become acceptable practices the way alcohol consumption is, respect the laws of the land. Yeah, it also seems stupid to cover my arms and legs in some Islamic states, but if I don't then it's a risk that I take and I know the consequences. Fly into any (or many, if I'm wrong) country in this region and you're warned about the penalties for drug trafficking. The Ghanaian chap took his chances and he has been charged accordingly.</p>
              <p>If you're not happy with that, then take a risk with salvia or poppers. But don't expect folks to sympathise with you online if a more osbcure law can be used to prosecute you for using them.</p>
