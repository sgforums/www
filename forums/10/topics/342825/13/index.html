              <p>Cannabis buds can be milled into a flour after they're dried. I
                  can only speculate why the dead person VK mentions used it. It
                  could've be crack for all we know, but I'm not privileged to the
                  knowledge of their flavours.</p>
              <p>Pot smoke has a sweet smell. Don't indulge in it for too long,
                  or at least don't get called up for drug testing, because it
                  lingers for up to a month in the body. It's a hallucinogen and also
                  a stimulant, which is why it's banned in sports (read up about what
                  happened to Tomas Enge if you're not convinced), and possibly why
                  it's controlled.</p>
              <p>Side question: I wonder if you feel the same about LSD, given
                  that it was placed even lower on the chart in the same Lancet
                  journal. Sure, it's cut with other drugs that can make it fatal,
                  but we've already cast aside the harm to self caused by such
                  narcotics.</p>
              <p>Until such a time where cannabis usage and abuse become
                  acceptable practices the way alcohol consumption is, respect the
                  laws of the land. Yeah, it also seems stupid to cover my arms and
                  legs in some Islamic states, but if I don't then it's a risk that I
                  take and I know the consequences. Fly into any (or many, if I'm
                  wrong) country in this region and you're warned about the penalties
                  for drug trafficking. The Ghanaian chap took his chances and
                  he has been charged accordingly.</p>
              <p>If you're not happy with that, then take a risk with salvia or
                  poppers. But don't expect folks to sympathise with you online if a
                  more osbcure law can be used to prosecute you for using them.</p>

              <p>LSD isn't cut with other drugs. It isn't even cut. It's a liquid soaked into sheets of blotter paper. You would be hard pressed to find it mixed with any other drug.</p>
              <p>It may not be acceptable practice in Singapore but it is in a lot of other countries. However, we should not let what is 'acceptable' dictate our laws. It perpetuates conformity and inhibits diversity, not only that but certain 'acceptable' practices may not be right. While on the topic of Islamic states, a lot of their methods or corporal punishment are inhumane but acceptable so they certainly need changing.</p>
              <p>This perfectly illustrates the problem with certain drugs, it's almost traditional to perceive them in a negative light as its been preached to us by our parents, the media, government campaigns, etc. that we no longer question what we've been told about them. Much like the practices of Islamic states, they've been integrated into our society but we must be rid of them as it prevents advancement and intellectual development.</p>
              <p>I don't see why we should adhere to a law if it is baseless and ultimately unlawful. You may argue that the rules are made known so it is one's fault if he/she breaks them, but you fail to question the rule itself.</p>

              <p>Singapore laws classified marijuana as a banned drug and so it
              shall be. Nothing can change that fact, besides only certain part
              of the world classified it as not part of banned drugs. Majority of
              the world still classified it as one, so why should Singapore bend

              <p>If majority of the Singaporean are not whining about the law, I

              <p>Well it's easy to take a stance of apathy if it doesn't affect you but we must think of the greater good and those who are affected by it.

              <p>I think all drugs should be legalised as criminalisation has proved to be an ineffective method of prohibition. Drugs are so easily obtainable that if anyone truly wanted them, they'd be able to get them. The reason why people don't do drugs is not because it's illegal but because of the effects on one's health.</p>
              <p>A good example of the ineffectiveness of prohibition is when the United States banned alcohol. What resulted was not a reduction in alcohol consumption but largescale production of moonshine or illegally manufactured alcohol which was dangerous as it wasn't under any health and safety regulations and the country also experienced a surge in crime.</p>
              <p>The case is exactly the same with drugs, prohibition does nothing but fund organised crime and makes drugs even more dangerous as they can't be enforced by health regulations which apply to legal pharmaceuticals.</p>
              <p>The notion that you could be killed for doing something which has no direct effect on others is ludicrous, these 'victimless crimes' need to go. What's worse is the perpetuation of anti-drug propaganda by the government and media. When somebody commits a crime while under the influence we instantly blame the drugs. We don't blame alcohol for drunk driving accidents, we blame the users irresponsible use of the substance.</p>
              <p>It's a waste of tax payers money to fund the war on drugs and that money ends up with criminal organisations and drug lords who run their business through violence and other vices.</p>

              <p>In reply to the first paragraph of your post, if Singapore were
                                      to change its laws against marijuana it would pioneer a step in the
                                      right direction. Just because the majority aren't doing it doesn't
                                      mean that's the way it should be, it's quite the opposite.</p>
              <p>Well it's easy to take a stance of apathy if it doesn't affect
                                      you but we must think of the greater good and those who are
                                      affected by it. Not only that, Singaporeans are very complacent
                                      about political matters as they've been bred that way. With the
                                      current government it's hard to think there's any way for us to
                                      create change.</p>

              <p>Because, like I stated in my post above in reply to Kuali Baba, prohibition doesn't work. That's why instead of banning alcohol as well, we should decriminalise all drugs.</p>
              <p>The benefits of legalising drugs are as follows:</p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> It allows politicians to address the real issues behind drugs, responsible drug use is done recreationally whereas problematic drug abuse and addiction are directly linked with poverty. It is through decriminalisation that we would be able to rectify these issues.</p>
              <p><strong>2.</strong> Criminal organisations are funded by the illegal trade of drugs. Legalisation starves them of the income required to run their activities.</p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> Because prohibition is ineffective, our tax money is going to waste on the war on drugs. With legalisation our money will be better spent elsewhere. Much of the prison population is there for drug-related crimes as well. Legalisation would free up our prisons and again, less of our tax money will go towards the maintenance of such facilities.</p>
              <p><strong>4. </strong>Like all items, the price of drugs is determined by supply and demand. Because of its high demand which is satiated by an unregulated illegal market, drugs are very expensive and thus encourages some to resort to crime to fund their habit. Legalisation would enable us to determine a much lower market price.</p>
              <p><strong>5. </strong>Drug addicts would more actively seek help without fear of legal retribution as surveys have shown that many addicts would be willing to seek help if not for the possibility of prosecution.</p>
              <p><strong>6.</strong> Drugs would have to comply with health regulations imposed on consumables. Thus drug companies which would be able to legally produce those drugs would have to issue health warnings, etc. and also create unadulterated drugs which are a big problem.</p>
              <p>And other reasons which I can't think of right now because it's 3 in the morning and I'm tired as shit.</p>

              <p>I think all drugs should be legalised as criminalisation has
              proved to be an ineffective method of prohibition. Drugs are so
              easily obtainable that if anyone truly wanted them, they'd be able
              to get them. The reason why people don't do drugs is not because
              it's illegal but because of the effects on one's health.</p>
              <p>A good example of the ineffectiveness of prohibition is when the
              United States banned alcohol. What resulted was not a reduction in
              alcohol consumption but largescale production of moonshine or
              illegally manufactured alcohol which was dangerous as it wasn't
              under any health and safety regulations and the country also
              experienced a surge in crime.</p>
              <p>The case is exactly the same with drugs, prohibition does
              nothing but fund organised crime and makes drugs even more
              dangerous as they can't be enforced by health regulations which
              apply to legal pharmaceuticals.</p>
              <p>The notion that you could be killed for doing something which
              has no direct effect on others is ludicrous, these 'victimless
              crimes' need to go. What's worse is the perpetuation of anti-drug
              propaganda by the government and media. When somebody commits a
              crime while under the influence we instantly blame the drugs. We
              don't blame alcohol for drunk driving accidents, we blame the users
              irresponsible use of the substance.</p>
              <p>It's a waste of tax payers money to fund the war on drugs and
              that money ends up with criminal organisations and drug lords who
              run their business through violence and other vices.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Ahh but don't you realise that regulation is also part of legislation, and that producing items that don't conform to the regs would be criminal too? So as you as you tinker with the laws, one form of crime decreases while another increases - driving under the influence, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, etc.</p>
              <p>When people commit offences or do stupid things, we also blame the drugs because the users lose their ability to make rational decisions whilst under the influence. I'd be amazed if someone tried to preach the anti-drink-driving message to a tanked pubgoer.

              <p>Because, like I stated in my post above in reply to Kuali Baba,
              prohibition doesn't work. That's why instead of banning alcohol as
              well, we should decriminalise all drugs.</p>
              <p>The benefits of legalising drugs are as follows:</p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> It allows politicians to address the real
              issues behind drugs, responsible drug use is done recreationally
              whereas problematic drug abuse and addiction are directly linked
              with poverty. It is through decriminalisation that we would be able
              to rectify these issues.</p>
              <p><strong>2.</strong> Criminal organisations are funded by the
              illegal trade of drugs. Legalisation starves them of the income
              required to run their activities.</p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> Because prohibition is ineffective, our tax
              money is going to waste on the war on drugs. With legalisation our
              money will be better spent elsewhere. Much of the prison population
              is there for drug-related crimes as well. Legalisation would free
              up our prisons and again, less of our tax money will go towards the
              maintenance of such facilities.</p>
              <p><strong>4.</strong> Like all items, the price of drugs is
              determined by supply and demand. Because of its high demand which
              is satiated by an unregulated illegal market, drugs are very
              expensive and thus encourages some to resort to crime to fund their
              habit. Legalisation would enable us to determine a much lower
              market price.</p>
              <p><strong>5.</strong> Drug addicts would more actively seek help
              without fear of legal retribution as surveys have shown that many
              addicts would be willing to seek help if not for the possibility of
              prosecution.</p>
              <p><strong>6.</strong> Drugs would have to comply with health
              regulations imposed on consumables. Thus drug companies which would
              be able to legally produce those drugs would have to issue health
              warnings, etc. and also create unadulterated drugs which are a big
              problem.</p>
              <p>And other reasons which I can't think of right now because it's
              3 in the morning and I'm tired as shit.</p>

              <p>Most of these points are addressed in my last reply, with the addition of the following.</p>
              <p>- Syndicates are fluid and they'll find other ways of earning revenue irresponsibly. Legislation alone isn't enough to curb their power and you'll simply make enforcement more complicated, while spending additional money on education and rehabilitation.</p>
              <p>- Addicts here can check themselves into halfway houses. Unfortunately, they don't a whole lot of support.</p>

Even if you want to bring in something that is offensive but for own usage, you must declare it before travelling and seek permission.</p>

              <p>Ahh but don't you realise that regulation is also part of
              legislation, and that producing items that don't conform to the
              regs would be criminal too? So as you as you tinker with the laws,
              one form of crime decreases while another increases - driving under
              the influence, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, etc.</p>
              <p>When people commit offences or do stupid things, we also blame
              the drugs because the users lose their ability to make rational
              decisions whilst under the influence. I'd be amazed if someone
              tried to preach the anti-drink-driving message to a tanked pubgoer.
              It's this loss of judgment (one of those things that makes us

              <p>I do understand that drugs would require regulation if legalised. However, to prevent crimes involving drug use such as driving while under the influence, laws enforcing a minimum age to purchase drugs as with alcohol and tobacco, making it illegal for supplying minors with drugs and imposing extremely harsh penalties for harming others while under the influence which would apply to driving under the influence whether or not anyone is actually harmed.</p>
              <p>Even though another form of crime will increase, those crimes are actually unlawful and should be punished as opposed to the previous injustice of having many harmless and responsible drug users prosecuted.</p>
              <p>Despite what many may think, obtaining drugs even in Singapore is extremely easy, by no means do you have to be desperate. You wouldn't even have to associate with drug lords, just small-time dealers at the very bottom of the chain, you can even get some from people you don't know by just asking around in clubs.</p>
              <p>The reduction of demand could be done through the introduction of warning labels on legally sold drugs much like with cigarettes and the harder drugs such as heroin could be controlled by requiring doctor's permission for its medical use. I don't see why we need to reduce the demand of lighter drugs such as marijuana as it isn't as dangerous as those legal drugs sold openly such as alcohol and tobacco.</p>
