              <p>I believe it would make no difference and that the personal risk to the users' lives and freedom is already an effective dampener on demand.  There's just too much personal risk to even consider taking drugs in Singapore, for the vast majority of rational Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>A fantastic first step would be stop supporting the masterminds: http://www.singapore-window.org/1020naus.htm . It's utterly pointless to hang misled 20 year-olds while doing high-level business with the source.</p>

              <p>So you swallowed everything that is written in that biased piece of diatribe against the government? :) They should bring evidence and make their allegations instead of hiding behind the mask of anonymity.</p>
              <p>Nobody made me God but God made me a Singaporean and I have a right to decide how our laws should be.</p>
              <p>Singapore's location makes it convenient for drug traffickers. Continue to hang traffickers regardless of their sex, age and nationality and we will send a clear message to drug traffickers (and I agree there will always be traffickers): whatever you do, stay away from Singapore!</p>

              much as I feel that the death penalty for smugglers is harsh, I have to
              say that it has, for the most part, worked as a deterrent for smart
              people. Most people smart enough to think for themselves would be able
              to figure out that bringing drugs into Singapore =&gt; death penalty
              =&gt; not worth the risk.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there are still stupid idiots out there who cannot see the logic, and are willing to risk their life for $$$. Lots of people have been in desperate situations as well, but not all of them turned to drug smuggling.</p>
              <p>If you don't like Singapore's laws with regards to drugs, then don't bring drugs here. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>If there is any tragedy in this story, then it is that the smuggler was just too stupid to understand something so logical.</p>

              <p>I have two problems with the death penalty for drugs.</p>
              <p>1. The mandatory death penalty ignores ALL mitigating factors.  In particular, the assumption of intent.  If you are caught with more than 15 grams of heroin then the law assumes that you *are* a drug courier.  There is no way to argue that it's for personal use as the charge has been automatically laid. Not even the judge can over-rule this assumption.</p>
              <p>Worse, being ignorant of what you're carrying is not taken into consideration. Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi was hanged in 2007 in spite of the judge having doubts that he even knew he was carrying heroin.  That, in my personal belief, is just wrong.  The law should not work on assumptions of intent.</p>
              <p>2. I don't believe killing the couriers will solve anything.  There is an endless supply of ignorant, stupid or desperate people to bring the drugs in.  Hanging a person in order to keep Singapore drug-free when it doesn't actually do so is disingenuous.</p>

              automatically laid. Not even the judge can over-rule this
              assumption.</p>
              <p>Worse, being ignorant of what you're carrying is not taken into
              consideration. Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi was hanged in 2007 in spite of
              the judge having doubts that he even knew he was carrying
              heroin.  That, in my personal belief, is just wrong.  The
              law should not work on assumptions of intent.</p>
              <p>2. I don't believe killing the couriers will solve
              anything.  There is an endless supply of ignorant, stupid or
              desperate people to bring the drugs in.  Hanging a person in
              order to keep Singapore drug-free when it doesn't actually do so is
              disingenuous.</p>

              <p>1. when caught with more than 15 grams of heroin, EVERYONE will say it is for personal use.</p>
              <p>2. killing the couriers will deter other people from becoming couriers. It cannot solve things as completely as getting the mastermind. But the deterence is there. Saying that it doesn't help is... presumptious.</p>

              <p>I cannot tolerate this barbarism any longer. Those of you who agree with sentencing this man to death are either in support of Singapore's oppressive laws or are severely misinformed. Cannabis is a harmless drug, it is an unhealthy Big Mac compared to alcohol and tobacco. Why it is still illegal is beyond me but hopefully that would change as there have been talks about Obama possibly legalising marijuana and perhaps the rest of the world will follow suit if the U.S. takes a stand against this outdated law founded on corporatism and racism.</p>
              <p>Drugs may ruin lives but it should be the individual's choice who he or she wishes to live his/her life. The government should have no say in it, it may not be entirely healthy but you don't see people being prosecuted for eating too much McDonald's. This goes beyond the argument of corporal punishment or the death penalty, this is an affront to individual freedom and a step towards complete totalitarianism.</p>

              <p>Talks of Obama legalizing marijuana? so what? And I doubt it, give me some source indicating that.</p>
              <p>It is definitely legal in Netherland, does that mean we should follow them?</p>
              <p>drunk people are irritating. We can still deal with them as long as they don't do incredibly stupid things. Drug addicts are harmful. If they stay one corner and smoke their weed, no one will really bother with them. But more likely than not, they are unemployed because their addiction makes them very inefficient at their job, as they are very stoned.</p>
              <p>And they are so addicted they they will do stupid and harmful things. Like rob a bank, or deal drugs to other people, in order to get some drugs.</p>
              <p>It is evident that drugs and it's withdrawal effects is harmful to society. Very harmful, more than that of macdonald's and smoking and alcohol.</p>
              <p>If you want to fight for individual freedom and step away from totalitarism, go fight for the rights of gay people or something. arguing in favour of drugs is not the way.</p>
