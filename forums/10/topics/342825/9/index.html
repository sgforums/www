              <p>I'm totally amazed by the discussions.</p>
              <p>From "is death sentence neccessary" to " which drug is not as harmless then the others". So what if the drug Cannabis is less harmful? Does it make the death sentence less unneccessary. There's a reason as to why a law is made. And why other countries as well prohibits drugs. Its just that singapore takes a much more tougher and intolerable stand as regards to this issue.</p>
              <p>I agree, 20 yrs old is a little too young to be hanged. But if you are trying to debate in the direction as to whether drugs (or specific drug) are less harmful, or may not be as harmful as alcohol etc, then there's no point arguing anymore. I repeat, there is a reason as to why people classified drugs as dangerous, so as to all your reasons trying to say its not, its totally redundant and useless.</p>
              <p>So what if Marijuana is not addictive? A 2007 study by the Canadian government found cannabis smoke contained more toxic substances than tobacco smoke. and other bad effects as well. Take a look at wikipedia. Anyway, i'm not here trying to debate whether marhuana itself is bad or what. I agree with you that human rights is important. But i do not feel that our singapore government is in any way trying to interfere in human rights? At least I'm a singaporean, i don't feel that. If you want total human rights, then we might as well abolish all laws in all countries, because we got the freedom to do what we want right? Then police will be redundant isn't it? Cause, when people kill, its their choice!</p>
              <p>That should be a boundary and an extent to everything. Yes, i agree s'pore stance is tougher, but if singapore wants to made it a death penalty, then you jolly well have to abide with it. If you are in s;pore, you have to abide with our rules. Just like when you are in school, you have to abide with school rules. I should say, singapore has done a good job in deterring drug activities in singapore.</p>

              <p>One thing to prove your account above completely bogus - marijuana doesn't come in powdered form. Secondly, how do you assert that the cause of death was from marijuana overdose (which can't happen) from that tale? Oh the deceased was skinny and unemployed so surely there is no other explanation than that he was starving himself to save money for cannabis as there is no other reason why someone could be underweight and unemployed. Stop jumping to conclusions.</p>

              <p>stop confusing medical facts to relationship facts.</p>
              <p>Lets suggest you like horror movies. After some time, will you
              keep watching the same time of horror movies of the same storyline,
              or you will want something a bit more different and exciting where
              you dont know when that ghoul is going to suddenly pop up?</p>
              <p>Or a movie with some extra psychotic killer in that ghost horror
              movie?</p>
              <p>Look at Aliens movies, the aliens evolved right?</p>

              prohibits drugs. Its just that singapore takes a much more tougher
              and intolerable stand as regards to this issue.</p>
              <p>I agree, 20 yrs old is a little too young to be hanged. But if
              you are trying to debate in the direction as to whether drugs (or
              specific drug) are less harmful, or may not be as harmful as
              alcohol etc, then there's no point arguing anymore. I repeat, there
              is a reason as to why people classified drugs as dangerous, so as
              to all your reasons trying to say its not, its totally redundant
              and useless.</p>
              <p>So what if Marijuana is not addictive? A 2007 study by the
              Canadian government found cannabis smoke contained more toxic
              substances than tobacco smoke. and other bad effects as well. Take
              a look at wikipedia. Anyway, i'm not here trying to debate whether
              marhuana itself is bad or what. I agree with you that human rights
              is important. But i do not feel that our singapore government is in
              any way trying to interfere in human rights? At least I'm a
              singaporean, i don't feel that. If you want total human rights,
              then we might as well abolish all laws in all countries, because we
              got the freedom to do what we want right? Then police will be
              redundant isn't it? Cause, when people kill, its their choice!</p>
              <p>That should be a boundary and an extent to everything. Yes, i
              agree s'pore stance is tougher, but if singapore wants to made it a
              death penalty, then you jolly well have to abide with it. If you
              are in s;pore, you have to abide with our rules. Just like when you
              are in school, you have to abide with school rules. I should say,
              singapore has done a good job in deterring drug activities in
              singapore.</p>

              <p>Hardly, marijuana can be ground up but that still does not mean it comes in powdered forms. Even after thorough grinding it will not have the consistency to be considered a powder. So your tale is still highly unlikely and probably made up.</p>

              <p>To read this and wonder about how someone can suggest I found cannabis powder and suggest its marijuana, and then to suggest that marijuana cannot be a powder, but mentioned its possible to be a powder, and now that it cannot be a powder to suggesting it cannot be a powder.</p>
              <p>So say the person that cannot deal with truths then.</p>
