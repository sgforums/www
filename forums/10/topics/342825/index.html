              SINGAPORE, Jan 3, 2009 (AFP) - A 20-year-old Ghanaian has been sentenced to death in Singapore for trafficking 2.6 kilograms (5.73 pounds) of cannabis, the Straits Times reported Saturday.
              ADVERTISEMENT
              The High Court convicted and sentenced Chijioke Stephen Obioha on Tuesday after a 21-day trial held last year, it said.
              Under Singapore's tough anti-drug laws, the death penalty is mandatory for anyone caught trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin, 30 grams of cocaine or 500 grams of cannabis.
              The death penalty is carried out by hanging.
              Narcotics officers arrested Obioha in April 2007 following a surveillance operation. He had come to Singapore in 2005 to try out for a football club, the report said.
              He was not hired but remained in the city-state working as a middle man for electronics goods dealers. His immigration pass expired in January 2007.
              Human rights groups have strongly urged Singapore to abolish the death penalty, but the government maintains that it plays a key role in keeping crime down and is a strong deterrent to organised crime gangs.
              In December 2004 Singapore hanged a 25-year-old Australian drug runner Nguyen Tuong Van, despite appeals for clemency by then Prime Minister John Howard.
              Two convicted African drug traffickers were put to death in 2007 after their appeals for clemency were turned down and despite protests from the United Nations and rights activists.

              <p>sure, human rights group can appeal. prime minister of australia can appeal. even president of USA appeal with regards to micheal fay caning case.</p>
              <p>But if Singapore respond to any of this appeal without good reason, than Singapore will just be another push over. The message is clear. don't do drugs here.</p>

              <p>so... if the death penalty is removed, the drug supply will remain the same?</p>
              <p>you are right in the sense that getting to the root of the problem is to get the mastermind. but that is kind of hard. the other way is to make sure that everybody is damn scared to work for the mastermind, ain't it?</p>
              <p>keeping scums in prison and waste taxpayer's money... just let them die.</p>
              <p>maybe you will  prefer a first world country like america who is more humane. like their invasion of another country, torturing of prisoner of war...</p>
              <p>or like britain, who have too many convicts in jail, and have to release them early to make more room repeatedly...</p>

              <p>Bring the masterminds to justice? Agree with that. Hang the masterminds after we have extracted information from the courier. Hang one courier, that's one courier less for the masterminds.</p>
              <p>No mitigating factors need to be considered in drug trafficking. The crime is heinous enough to deserve death...period.</p>
              <p>The laws of the land must reflect the customs and norms of the people. The majority of  Singaporeans favour the retention of the death penalty...who are you to tell us how our nation should be governed? What a joke!</p>

              <p>I was trying to bring the point across that the US, just like in the War of Terror, is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing. Just like in the Vietnam War, the CIA ran drug routes out of the Golden Triangle to the US. Then in Afghanistan, when the Taliban came to power, they were able to destroy opium cultivation. However, when the US invaded, opium production resumed and Afghanistan is now the world's largest supplier of heroin ( with market share of about 90%). And who is the world's largest consumer of illegal drugs?</p>
