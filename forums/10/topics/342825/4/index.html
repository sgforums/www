              <p>Because without a trial, then it is not justice.</p>
              <p>Even if it may seem that the man's guilt is obvious, you still need a trial to determine unambiguously that he truly is guilty. For all you know he may well have left his luggage unlocked and unattended for a while and some shady fella may slip drugs into the luggage. The trial process is there to determine whether or not that is the case.</p>
              <p>That's the whole purpose of the trial - to truly determine the guilt or innocence of a person. So if someone chucked a pack of cannabis into your luggage, at least the trial gives you the chance to fight back on that defence!</p>

              U guys dont realise that this dude is only 20yrs old and its for marijuana !!!! You dont hang ppl for a farking PLANT  , that has not caused any direct death (overdose) to anyone in History!!!!  Fark man thank god im not in singapore now , Goverment kills ppl for a plant and majority of its citizen who doesnt have any compassion.
              
              How can a normal human being dont mind a death of another ?  I will rather be friends with a dude who smokes marijuana then talk to a typical Singaporean !!! Booo BoO Booo
              
              Some ppl might say , marijuana is a gateway drug to harsh chemical drugs , fark that rubbish , A person who has not tried a certain 'Thing' will also assume something , which is always Wrong

              <p>I cannot tolerate this barbarism any longer. Those of you who
              agree with sentencing this man to death are either in support of
              Singapore's oppressive laws or are severely misinformed. Cannabis
              is a harmless drug, it is an unhealthy Big Mac compared to alcohol
              and tobacco. Why it is still illegal is beyond me but hopefully
              that would change as there have been talks about Obama possibly
              legalising marijuana and perhaps the rest of the world will follow
              suit if the U.S. takes a stand against this outdated law founded on
              corporatism and racism.</p>
              <p>Drugs may ruin lives but it should be the individual's choice
              who he or she wishes to live his/her life. The government should
              have no say in it, it may not be entirely healthy but you don't see
              people being prosecuted for eating too much McDonald's. This goes
              beyond the argument of corporal punishment or the death penalty,
              this is an affront to individual freedom and a step towards
              complete totalitarianism.</p>

              <p>The people STILL willing to risk their lives are those probably unaware of the consequences and dire repercussions, but when we sentence that one to death, you can see how strict we are. No net effect? Why don't you go try trafficking here in Singapore? Tell me you're not in the least affected by such harsh sentences. This is not just a measure against people who already are willing to make sacrifices (by sending themselves to death) but also a warning to every other Singapore citizen, PR, and even people overseas to say that we do not tolerate drug trafficking. </p>
              <p>The demand for something will always be there. We cannot stop the demand for something without boycotting it. Drugs are right in an addict's face. Tell me how he or she can resist the temptation or anything of the sort to take it. </p>

              <p>Death penalty may be murder, but it is murder called for by him or herself. By trafficking drugs and play a part in distributing it, are you not committing homicide when people die of drug overdose or addiction? If you can kill others, then murder through the fore-mentioned death penalty is fully warranted because it is clear this should have come! You chose it. </p>

              <p><em>About 147 million people, 2.5% of the world population,
                      consume cannabis (annual prevalence) compared with 0.2% consuming
                      cocaine and 0.2% consuming opiates. In the present decade, cannabis
                      abuse has grown more rapidly than cocaine and opiate abuse. The
                      most rapid growth in cannabis abuse since the 1960s has been in
                      developed countries in North America, Western Europe and

              <p>My point is that drugs do not directly affect others, it affects
              the individual. I don't see what's so hard for you to grasp.</p>
              <p>I do understand what you're saying but you are completely
              factually incorrect, especially in the instance of cannabis.
              Marijuana is not worse than alcohol and cigarettes, this point has
              been made by researchers and it was just last year that British
              scientists actually ranked drugs on a scale according to factors
              including its affect on society, potential for addiction, effects
              on health, etc. and marijuana was below alcohol. How is it that
              alcohol is legal yet marijuana, which is far less harmful,
              isn't?</p>
              <p>I have, and any police officer in the world would much rather
              deal with someone who's stoned than somebody who's drunk. An
              alcoholic is violent, someone on marijuana isn't.</p>
              <p>Perhaps instead of presenting an argument comprised completely
              of rhetorical questions try actually addressing some of my points.
              It's not an argument if it says nothing.</p>

              <p>british scientist rank the marijuana thingie right? give me the source. If it is just last year, it should not be hard to find. And no, not everything scientist says is correct, that's why people want to look at how the research was carried out. Remember, not interested in how people destroy themselves.</p>
              <p>police officers rather deal with stoned people than drunks? let me give it to you straight, I am a police officer, and I don't want to deal with stoned crazy druggies who share needles and probably disease. drunk bastards may act tough, but sending them home or locking them up for the night is not that hard.</p>

              <p class="first">SINGAPORE, Jan 3, 2009 (AFP) - A 20-year-old Ghanaian has been sentenced to death in Singapore for trafficking 2.6 kilograms (5.73 pounds) of cannabis, the Straits Times reported Saturday.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">The High Court convicted and sentenced Chijioke Stephen Obioha on Tuesday after a 21-day trial held last year, it said.</div>
              <p>Under Singapore's tough anti-drug laws, the death penalty is mandatory for anyone caught trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin, 30 grams of cocaine or 500 grams of cannabis.</p>
              <p>The death penalty is carried out by hanging.</p>
              <p>Narcotics officers arrested Obioha in April 2007 following a surveillance operation. He had come to Singapore in 2005 to try out for a football club, the report said.</p>
              <p>He was not hired but remained in the city-state working as a middle man for electronics goods dealers. His immigration pass expired in January 2007.</p>
              <p>Human rights groups have strongly urged Singapore to abolish the death penalty, but the government maintains that it plays a key role in keeping crime down and is a strong deterrent to organised crime gangs.</p>
              <p>In December 2004 Singapore hanged a 25-year-old Australian drug runner Nguyen Tuong Van, despite appeals for clemency by then Prime Minister John Howard.</p>
              <p>Two convicted African drug traffickers were put to death in 2007 after their appeals for clemency were turned down and despite protests from the United Nations and rights activists.</p>

              <p>british scientist rank the marijuana thingie right? give me the
                  source. If it is just last year, it should not be hard to find. And
                  no, not everything scientist says is correct, that's why people
                  want to look at how the research was carried out. Remember, not
                  interested in how people destroy themselves.</p>
              <p>police officers rather deal with stoned people than drunks? let
                  me give it to you straight, I am a police officer, and I don't want
                  to deal with stoned crazy druggies who share needles and probably
                  disease. drunk bastards may act tough, but sending them home or
                  locking them up for the night is not that hard.</p>
              <p>Now, this is the 2nd time i have addressed your point on
                  this.</p>

              <p>Well that's because you're a Singaporean police officer who probably has never encountered someone's who's stoned. No offence to the country's police force but they don't exactly have to deal with a lot of the stuff those of other countries do. Oh and you don't use needles for marijuana. Goes to show how much you actually know about drugs.</p>
              <p>A person on marijuana does not become violent whereas a drunk person does. Alcohol impairs your judgement much more than marijuana. Talk to any police officer of another country and they will wholeheartedly agree with me.</p>
              <p>How many deaths each year are directly caused by alcohol (excluding misadventure while under the influence, etc.)? An average of about 300. Yearly deaths caused by marijuana? Zero. It is impossible to overdose on cannabis.</p>
              <p>Not only that, medical marijuana is legal in some states in the United States because it can be used as an effective painkiller and THC, its active chemical, has anti-carcinogenic properties.</p>

              <p>Despite what you may think it is possible to have a 'hardcore' drug habit and still function normally. Let's just say personal experience and those of friends have proved this true. Most of you have been propagated to perceive the image of the typical drug user destroying his life but just spend some time amongst those involved in drug culture and you will see how false this is. You don't even need to do that, just look up some statistics on drug addiction and it clearly shows how false that image is.</p>
