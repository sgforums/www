                  				Democrats <br>10 Feb 08 </span></span></p>
              <p>Former Singapore
                  				solicitor-general and Law Society president Mr Francis Seow filed
                  				an affidavit in support of the SDP in the lawsuit against Mr Lee
                  				Kuan Yew and son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>The Lees sued the
                  				Singapore Democrats and its executive members over an article
                  				which the party published drawing parallels between the NKF
                  				scandal and the way the PAP runs Singapore. <br><br>The High
                  				Court awarded the Lees the case without giving the SDP a fair
                  				trial despite the fact that the defendants had filed their
                  				defence and raised the fact that there were disputes in fact and
                  				law.<br><br>The judiciary will now decide how much the Lees have
                  				to be paid in damages in a hearing. Mr Seow filed an affidavit
                  				last week as a witness for the Singapore Democrats. In it, he
                  				refuted the claims made by the Lees that they are worth the
                  				amounts they claim (see below). <br><br>Earlier, the SDP and two
                  				other defendants Ms Chee Siok Chin and Dr Chee Soon Juan, filed
                  				their <a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlenkflawsuit26.html"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: #0047ff;">Affidavit
                  				Evidence in Chief</span></span></a>, stating that the reputations
                  				of the Lees have inflated by the system they control. <br><br>Mr
                  				Seow has stated that he stands ready to be cross-examined at the
                  				hearing.</p>
              <p>Affidavit of
                  				Mr Francis Seow<br><br>I, Francis T Seow, do hereby make oath
                  				and say as follows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. I am a witness for the defendants in this suit.</p>
              <p> 2.
                  				I was the former Solicitor-General of Singapore and the former
                  				President of the Law Society of Singapore.</p>
              <p>3.
                  				As the former Solicitor-General, I have some knowledge of how the
                  				Government works under the Lee Kuan Yew (LKY). From my
                  				interactions with him, there is no doubt that LKY is bent on the
                  				total control of the Singaporean society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4.
                  				The use of the Internal Security Act (ISA) to quarantine and
                  				rehabilitate his political opponents, the wholesale subjugation
                  				of the print and broadcast media, the prohibition of public
                  				protests, and ironically the use of defamation laws have all had
                  				one effect: To silence opposing views in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5.
                  				I was one of his victims. I was arrested and detained without
                  				trial under the ISA for opposing LKY's ways and his autocratic
                  				policies. My experience under detention is recounted in my book
                  				<em>To Catch A Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's Prison</em> published by the prestigious Yale University Southeast Asia
                  				Studies. Pertinently, no one, not even the ever-litigious Lee
                  				Kuan Yew, has challenged the accuracy of what I had related in my
                  				book.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6.
                  				During my imprisonment I was told during my interrogators that
                  				they were going to neutralize me and that I should give up my
                  				idea of going into politics:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"So,
                  				you think, you can take on and bully the second-generation
                  				leaders? Well, our job is to make sure that you do not succeed.
                  				We are here to neutralize you. You know, to neutralize you! For
                  				your infomatioon, Lee Kuan Yew is running for another term. And
                  				you will be locked up here for at least two years, if not more.
                  				So, where will you be? You can give up all your ideas of going
                  				into politics." (Francis T Seow, To Catch A Tartar: A
                  				Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's Prison published, Yale University
                  				Southeast Asia Studies, 1994).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7.
                  				If the State can treat the country's former solicitor-general in
                  				such a contemptible manner, how much more can it intimidate the
                  				ordinary citizen – such is the persecution of dissenters
                  				and opponents of the PAP Government?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8.
                  				When his political opponents and dissidents are persecuted few
                  				would dare join the ranks of the opposition, much less stand for
                  				elections. Given such an arrangement it is no wonder that the PAP
                  				is repeatedly returned to power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>9.
                  				When such an undemocratic practice is in place, how does the
                  				plaintiff claim that he is the duly elected leader of Singapore?
                  				And yet, Lee Hsien Loong (LHL) pretends that he operates in a
                  				democracy and claims that his position in the Government is a
                  				mandate given by Singaporeans. He has inherited the system put in
                  				place by his father.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>10.
                  				The effulgence with which the media speaks of the plaintiff is
                  				not without contrivance. Journalists and editors who have been
                  				critical of LKY and the system he devised have been detained
                  				without trial, and newspapers that have demonstrated an
                  				independent streak have been closed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>11.
                  				Legislation has been passed to prohibit news organizations
                  				without Government control from being established. The Singapore
                  				Press Holdings which publishers all of Singapore's newspapers is
                  				chaired by Tony Tan, LKY's protégé and former
                  				deputy prime minister. Dr Tan's predecessor is Lim Kim San, a
                  				former cabinet minister and loyal friend of LKY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>12.
                  				With the media in the hands of LKY and those close to him, it is
                  				not possible for a balanced view of LHL to emerge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>13.
                  				There is no getting away from the fact that the political system
                  				that the PAP has devised in Singapore is not a democratic one. In
                  				fact the PAP Government thrives on fear. LKY himself boasted
                  				that: "<em>If nobody is afraid of me, I'm meaningless."</em> (Lee Kuan Yew, <em>The Singapore Story: The Man and His Ideas,</em>1998).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>14.
                  				Only those operating within the PAP system will agree that the
                  				system is not designed to inflate the plaintiff's reputation and
                  				to curtail opposing views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>15.
                  				Given such a climate of fear and intimidation, there can be only
                  				be praise of the plaintiff. His critics, especially the prominent
                  				ones, have all been silenced. Given such a scenario, LHL's
                  				reputation is based on his own opinion and those of his minions.
                  				This is no way to assess a plaintiff's reputation especially in a
                  				court of law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>16.
                  				To obtain a reliable and valid assessment, a broader spectrum of
                  				views and opinions must be sought especially from persons/groups
                  				who are not within the control of the Singapore Government.</p>

              <p>Hmmmmm.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought Internal Security Act (ISA) was used in the 1960s to detain communist elements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>"The <strong>Internal Security Act</strong> (<strong>ISA</strong>) of </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Singapore</em></span><em> confers on the government the right to arrest and detain individuals without trial in certain defined circumstances. The legislation originated in the wake of </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>World War II</em></span><em>, when a number of countries around the world introduced </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>legislation</em></span><em> that severely curtailed the rights of known or suspected </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>communists</em></span><em>.</em></p>
              <p><em>The most notable ISA case was the </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Operation Coldstore</em></span><em> in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the opposition party </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Barisan Sosialis</em></span><em> who were opposing Singapore's merger with Malaysia. While the ISA has not been invoked in recent years against political opponents, the continued existence of ISA is perceived as restricting political opposition and criticism of the government."</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Either Francis Seow and the USA are communist; or the ISA has evolved into a mechanism to restrict democratic processes and opposing views.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought Internal Security Act (ISA) was used in the 1960s to detain communist elements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"The <strong>Internal Security Act</strong> (<strong>ISA</strong>) of</em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Singapore</em></span> <em>confers on the government the right to arrest and detain individuals without trial in certain defined circumstances. The legislation originated in the wake of</em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>World War II</em></span><em>, when a number of countries around the world introduced</em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>legislation</em></span> <em>that severely curtailed the rights of known or suspected</em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>communists</em></span><em>.</em></p>
              <p><em>The most notable ISA case was the</em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Operation Coldstore</em></span> <em>in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the opposition party</em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Barisan Sosialis</em></span> <em>who were opposing Singapore's merger with Malaysia. While the ISA has not been invoked in recent years against political opponents, the continued existence of ISA is perceived as restricting political opposition and criticism of the government."</em></p>

              <p><strong>Either Francis Seow and the USA are communist; or the ISA has evolved into a mechanism to restrict democratic processes and opposing views</strong>.</p>

              <p>Francis seow is a pawn in a game between KGB, CIA, singapore ISD and malaysian intelligience service. a naive fool who played right into the hands of america.<br><br>The prize of the game is the control over the straits of melaka and singapore. with it... the control of the oil and trade flow towards the entire far east.<br><br>he who controls singapore and malaysia... controls the far east, the north east and the south east asia.<br><br>if america wins... america would literally control the entire pacific! and all the nations that rims the pacific...including japan...<br><br>if russia wins.... american influence in the far east would be slashed by as much as 50%, furthermore, all CINCPAC ships, subs and planes movement through singapore would be monitored with ease plus the CINCPAC forces would be sliced into half. the economic impact on america would be immeasurable.<br><br>the CIA detected russian KGB activities in the two countries 25 years ago.... this alarmed the american leaders.... a plan was put in place... it consist of 2 parts.<br><br>part one was to thwart any KGB attempt to gain influence in malaysia and singapore govt by providing intelligience information on KGB activities to the ISD of both country on a need to know basis... 2 malaysian malays, both personal secretary of malaysian PM was arrested after being found to be working for KGB.<br><br>part two is to establish local pro america political forces that could be put into power to american advantage in the event the current power fails to appease to american desire or if the current regime is showing signs of pro KGB tendency. seow belongs to this part of the programe.<br>with the collapse of soviet union... singapore opening CNB (lion note:Changi Navy Base where CVN can berth there)to america... the game came to an end with singapore malaysia and america emerge the winner... russia defaulted.. the 2 malaysian traitor and seow lost... the malaysian traitor still locked under malaysian ISD and seow lost his job as AG in singapore and becomes a useless old man in USA licking his wounds and pride. came out with a stupid book that claims absence of mandarin chicken from a 5 star hotel while he is in detention as a cruel form of torture... my god</p>
