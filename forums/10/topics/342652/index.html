              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have this teething question on my current job status and I would like to seek any geninue advices. I am working with this IT company for 10+ years and would consider as one of the seniors. At the moment, my boss has owed us 3 months of salary, to date. He cited that the economy is not doing well ( which I agree ) and the sales is not picking up at all. In a single month, our sales would sometimes be as low as 1k. However, I checked my CPF regularly and he did make a contribution to my CPF every month.Currently, I am single and supporting my parent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My question to all is, should I leave the firm and look for a new job now or should I hang on til the economy picks up?</p>

              <p>It does not sound like this company can lasts.</p>
              <p>Have you and your collegues sat down with the HR department and the Bozzes regarding this?</p>
              <p>If you still wishes to stay with the company, then at least talk to them to release you for other kind of work to keep you going.  If not, then at least a retrenchment benefit.</p>
              <p>Economy is not good all world wide.  Even if you leave this current job, you might not be able to find one out there.</p>
              <p>Also, there is a term of termination if the company has not been paying salary for a month.  So you best be on the lookout for some other job on standby just in case.</p>
              <p>Talk to your bozzes, have the HR department involved and make it a mass project instead of HR dept talk to you one by one on the sly.</p>

              <p>1. If this is not a problem your UNION should help you solve, what then is the purpose of your union's existence? did you pay annual fees to UNION? demand service.</p>
              <p>2. You should not accept this. If everyone accept this and becomes a common practice, in this crisis, all companies can also do this - withhold salary.</p>
              <p>Check your employment contract, if you still keep it. Salary withholding is morally wrong.</p>
              <p>3. If i were you, I would discuss with all employees whose pay get withheld and use Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
              <p>4. last resort is to SUE your company. You have not done wrong and the company owes you salary. to me, you cannot lose. Charge them interest as well.</p>
              <p>5. find a new company asap. loyalty depends on how good is your employer. does he deserve your loyalty?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>first of all talk to your companies employees are you the only person not get paid? or everyone?</p>
              <p>Second. Start a negociation process with your boss. establish partial payment terms on bimonthly.</p>
              <p>personally i don;t think u r going to get a new jobs in these market. So work out a part time term and start working part time to compensate your income.  </p>

              <p>nobody knows when the economy will recover.</p>
              <p>it will get worst before it gets better.  a few months later he would be owing you many months of salary.  what if the company cannot last until the economy recovers?</p>
              <p>go look for another job.  go to the MOM immediately after you leave the company.  if i remember correctly according to labour law your company has to pay you all your salary 7 days after your last day.</p>
