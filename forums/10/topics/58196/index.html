It announced in August that it will add another 500 ha to its petrochemical hub, Jurong Island, by 2005 in an effort to attract more investment. -- AP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most interesting judgment to read is the JOINT STATEMENT from the ad hoc judges, with one each being separately selected and appointed by Malaysia and Singapore to sit on the Tribunal.<br><br>These two learned persons have made some very poignant points that put the issue in perspective by DISINTERESTED parties to this dispute; and is diplomatically quite telling on the Malaysian.<br><br><a href="http://www.itlos.org/case_documents/2003/document_en_233.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.itlos.org/case_documents/2003/document_en_233.doc</a><br><br><strong>JOINT DECLARATION OF JUDGES AD HOC HOSSAIN AND OXMAN</strong><br><br>Our decisions to join in supporting the unanimous Order of the Tribunal are informed by a fundamental principle on which the Convention is built. <span style="color: red;">The right of a State to use marine areas and natural resources subject to its sovereignty or jurisdiction is broad but not unlimited. </span><span style="color: blue;">It is qualified by the duty to have due regard to the rights of other States and to the protection and preservation of the marine environment</span>.<br><br>Nowhere is the importance of this principle more evident than in and around a narrow strait bordered by each party throughout its length. We discern in the final statements of both parties, <strong><span style="color: red;">in particular that Malaysia accepts the importance of land reclamation and does not claim a veto over SingaporeÂ’s activities</span> </strong>and that Singapore is prepared to make the specific commitments noted in the Order to accommodate MalaysiaÂ’s concerns, a sincere effort by each party to apply this principle in the circumstances of this case.<br><br>What is most urgently required to protect the respective rights of the parties pending a decision by the Annex VII arbitral tribunal is the establishment of a joint process for addressing their most immediate concerns in this regard that builds on their respective statements and implements their duty to cooperate. Two elements are particularly important. The first is the establishment of a common base of information and evaluation regarding the effects of the land reclamation projects that can command the confidence of both parties. The second is that they are expected to consult with a view to reaching a prompt agreement on such temporary measures with respect to Area D at Pulau Tekong, including suspension or adjustment, as may be found necessary to ensure that the infilling operations pending completion of the joint study with respect to that area do not prejudice SingaporeÂ’s ability to implement its commitments.<br><br>In view of our appointments to the Annex VII arbitral tribunal, we note that our respective decisions to vote in favor of the Order in no way prejudge our respective conclusions on any question that may come before that tribunal, including the question of the jurisdiction of the Annex VII arbitral tribunal to deal with the merits of the case, or any question relating to the admissibility of the claim or relating to the merits themselves.<br><br>(signed)<br>Kamal Hossain<br><br>(signed)<br>Bernard H.

SINGAPORE)<br><br>Judge Dolliver Nelson, President of the Tribunal, today read the Order of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in the Case concerning Land Reclamation by Singapore in and around the Straits of Johor (Malaysia v. Singapore), Provisional Measures.<br><br>THE DISPUTE<br><br>On 5 September 2003, Malaysia submitted a request for the prescription of provisional measures under article 290, paragraph 5, of the Convention.<br><br>The dispute concerns land reclamation activities carried out by Singapore which allegedly impinge upon MalaysiaÂ’s rights in and around the Straits of Johor, which separate the island of Singapore from Malaysia.<br><br>Pursuant to article 290 of the Convention, the Tribunal, pending the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, may prescribe provisional measures if it considers provisional measures appropriate to "preserve the respective rights of the parties to the dispute or to prevent serious harm to the marine environment" and if it considers that prima facie the arbitral tribunal which is to be constituted would have jurisdiction and that the urgency of the situation so requires.<br><br>THE ORDER OF 8 OCTOBER 2003<br><br>In its Order, the Tribunal first addresses the issue of whether the Annex VII arbitral tribunal would prima facie have jurisdiction over the dispute.  With respect to the obligation to exchange views set out in article 283 of the Convention, the Tribunal considers that Malaysia was not obliged to continue with an exchange of views when it concluded that this exchange could not yield a positive result.  Turning to SingaporeÂ’s contention that the parties by agreeing to meet on 13 and 14 August had embarked on a negotiation process, the Tribunal noted that the meeting took place after the institution of arbitral proceedings and that Malaysia had expressly stated that such meetings would be without prejudice to its right to proceed with the arbitration pursuant to Annex VII to the Convention or to request this Tribunal to prescribe provisional measures.  Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the Annex VII arbitral tribunal would prima facie have jurisdiction over the dispute.  The Tribunal also finds that the case is admissible.<br><br>The Tribunal then proceeds to analyse the contention of Singapore that, as the Annex VII arbitral tribunal is to be constituted not later than 9 October 2003, there is no need to prescribe provisional measures given the short period of time remaining before that date.<br><br>The Tribunal notes that, under article 290, paragraph 5, of the Convention, the Tribunal is competent to prescribe provisional measures prior to the constitution of the Annex VII arbitral tribunal, and that there is nothing in article 290 of the Convention to suggest that the measures prescribed by the Tribunal must be confined to that period.<br><br>With respect to the land reclamation works in the sector of Tuas, the Tribunal finds that Malaysia has not shown that there is a situation of urgency or that there is a risk that its rights with respect to an area of its territorial sea would suffer irreversible damage pending consideration of the merits of the case by the arbitral tribunal.  Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to prescribe provisional measures with respect to the land reclamation by Singapore in the sector of Tuas.<br><br>The Tribunal notes that during the oral proceedings Singapore, in response to the measures requested by Malaysia, reiterated its offer to share the information requested by Malaysia with respect to the reclamation works, stated that it would provide Malaysia with a full opportunity to comment on the reclamation works and their potential impacts, and declared that it was ready and willing to enter into negotiations. The Tribunal places on record these assurances given by Singapore.<br><br>With respect to the infilling work in Area D at Pulau Tekong, which is of primary concern to Malaysia, the Tribunal notes the commitment made by Singapore at the hearing not to undertake any irreversible action to construct the stone revetment around Area D pending the completion of a study, jointly sponsored and funded by both States, to be undertaken by independent experts.<br><br>The Tribunal considers that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the land reclamation works may have adverse effects on the marine environment in and around the Straits of Johor.  For that reason, the Tribunal considers that prudence and caution require Malaysia and Singapore to establish mechanisms for exchanging information on and assessing the effects of the land reclamation work.<br><br>For these reasons, the Tribunal, unanimously, prescribes the following provisional measures, pending a decision by the Annex VII arbitral tribunal:<br><br>"Malaysia and Singapore shall cooperate and shall, for this purpose, enter into consultations forthwith in order to:<br><br>(a) establish promptly a group of independent experts with the mandate<br><br>(i) to conduct a study, on terms of reference to be agreed by Malaysia and Singapore, to determine, within a period not exceeding one year from the date of this Order, the effects of SingaporeÂ’s land reclamation and to propose, as appropriate, measures to deal with any adverse effects of such land reclamation;<br><br>(ii) to prepare, as soon as possible, an interim report on the subject of infilling works in Area D at Pulau Tekong;<br><br>(b) exchange, on a regular basis, information on, and assess risks or effects of, SingaporeÂ’s land reclamation works;<br><br>(c) implement the commitments noted in this Order and avoid any action incompatible with their effective implementation, and, without prejudice to their positions on any issue before the Annex VII arbitral tribunal, consult with a view to reaching a prompt agreement on such temporary measures with respect to Area D at Pulau Tekong, including suspension or adjustment, as may be found necessary to ensure that the infilling operations pending completion of the study referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) with respect to that area do not prejudice SingaporeÂ’s ability to implement the commitments referred to in paragraphs 85 to 87.<br><br>2.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: green;">The separate judgment opinion from Judge Chandrasekhara Rao was very detailed in his explanation of his decision, which seemed to have been the basis of consensus amongst all the other judges in arriving at an unanimous decision.<br><br>The telling part of this opinion can be found towards the end of his written opinion:</span> </strong><br><br>(See the list of separate judgment opinions in the earlier post on 9 October 2003 - 4:28 A.M. )<br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://www.itlos.org/case_documents/2003/document_en_234.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.itlos.org/case_documents/2003/document_en_234.doc</a><br><br>36.	As regards the prescription of provisional measures, the limited question that calls for determination by the Tribunal is whether, on the evidence before the Tribunal, it can be said that there is a reasonable possibility of either irreparable damage to the rights of Malaysia or serious harm to the marine environment in the short period before a decision of the Annex VII arbitral tribunal.<br><br>37. 	<strong>Malaysia contends that the Tribunal should not give credence to the argument of Singapore that Malaysia has delayed its own case for too long to make its claim of urgency credible</strong>, since the case involves the protection of the ecological interests, and the suspension of certain reclamation works can still make a difference. <strong>Assuming for the sake of argument that this is a valid justification for the delay involved, <span style="color: blue;">it would not absolve Malaysia from supplying proof of the damage alleged</span></strong>. Malaysia further contends that in matters involving protection of the environment the burden of proof lies on the State against whose conduct the case is brought. Here too, even if one were to accept this argument, it has been seen that Singapore has placed materials before the Tribunal to indicate that there is no likelihood of its actions causing irreparable prejudice to the rights of Malaysia or serious harm to the marine environment before the arbitral tribunal has had occasion to deal with MalaysiaÂ’s claim. <strong>SingaporeÂ’s assertions have not been seriously challenged. <span style="color: red;">Proof of the damage alleged by Malaysia has not been supplied</span></strong>. In its Request for provisional measures, <strong>the only argument advanced in support of the urgency of the situation is that there is little prospect that the Annex VII arbitral tribunal will be established and able to render a decision on provisional measures for some time. <span style="color: blue;">This argument too is untenable</span>. In the normal course of events, the arbitral tribunal will be constituted not later than 9 October 2003. <span style="color: blue;">There is also no reason to believe that this body will not meet shortly thereafter</span>. </strong><br><br>38.	It appears that <strong><span style="color: red;">urgency is indeed absent </span></strong>in respect of the substantial relief sought by Malaysia concerning suspension of SingaporeÂ’s land reclamation activities. The Tribunal observes in paragraphs 72 and 73 of its Order that Malaysia has not proven the existence of a situation of urgency in respect of its claims in relation to SingaporeÂ’s land reclamation in the sector of Tuas and it accordingly declares that it does not consider it appropriate under the circumstances to prescribe provisional measures with respect to that area. It may be recalled that, at the public sitting held on 27 September 2003, Malaysia stated that its concerns would be Â“significantly reducedÂ” if Singapore were to give undertakings to the Tribunal that no effort would be made to infill Area D pending the decision of the merits tribunal. Singapore gave no such undertaking. The TribunalÂ’s Order does not prescribe any measures requiring Singapore to stop infilling Area D, for there is no evidence before the Tribunal that such infilling would lead to irreparable prejudice to the rights of Malaysia or serious harm to the marine environment pending a decision of the arbitral tribunal. Accordingly, <strong><span style="color: red;">Malaysia has failed to prove a situation of urgency in respect of the substantial relief it sought concerning reclamation works even around Pulau Tekong</span></strong>. The operative part of the Order prescribes certain provisional measures which are consistent with that premise; these measures underline a sense of urgency arising out of the duty to cooperate as enshrined in Part XII of the Convention and general international law. <strong><span style="color: blue;">The Tribunal is not an innovator of these measures</span>.</strong> They emanate from the assurances given by Singapore during the course of the oral proceedings, the agreement of the parties to have a joint study undertaken of the effects of SingaporeÂ’s land reclamation and the statement of Singapore that if there is compelling evidence that its reclamation works have adverse effects it would re-examine its works and consider taking such steps as are necessary and proper, including a suspension, to deal with them. <strong>The Tribunal considered it necessary to underline that, in view of the special concerns expressed by Malaysia, the group of independent experts entrusted with the mandate of determining the effects of SingaporeÂ’s land reclamation should prepare an interim report on the subject of infilling works in Area D at Pulau Tekong with a view to examining as soon as possible whether MalaysiaÂ’s concerns in respect of Area D are properly based</strong>. The Order further calls upon the parties to enter into consultations with a view to ensuring that the infilling operations do not prejudice SingaporeÂ’s ability to implement the commitments referred to in paragraphs 85 to 87 of the Order. <strong><span style="color: blue;">It recognizes the basic stand of Singapore that any suspension or adjustment of land reclamation works should follow an objective study by a group of independent experts and that corrective measures would be taken only if such a study provides proof of adverse effects of the type mentioned by Malaysia</span></strong>.<br><br>(signed)<br>P. Chandrasekhara Rao<br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">In the other statement of Opinion from Judge Anthony A. Lucky, his opinion was the only one that is more specific to Singapore to STOP all works at Pulau Tekong Area D, and also addressed the future consideration of compensation to any Responding Parties (Singapore) for any restrictive measures awarded to Applicants (Malaysia) for reasons that are later found to be irrelevant.</span> </strong><br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://www.itlos.org/case_documents/2003/document_en_238.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.itlos.org/case_documents/2003/document_en_238.doc</a><br><br>19.	After considering the issues and evidence I agree with the Tribunal. Might I humbly suggest that I would have added that specific measures be prescribed with respect to Area D off Pulau Tekong, i.e., <strong><span style="color: red;">that in-filling works in Area D off Pulau Tekong be suspended until a joint assessment authority is established to report within three months</span></strong> whether there will be serious harm to the environment and whether the rights of Malaysia with respect to navigation will be infringed.<br><br>20.	<strong>Although there is no international precedent that I can find, I think the time has come to consider whether applicants for provisional measures, as in some municipal systems, <span style="color: blue;">should provide a guarantee in their applications that if the measures sought are granted, but discontinued if the substantive matter is determined in the respondentÂ’s favour, they will pay damages incurred and costs to the respondents.</span></strong><br><br>21.	I have voted in favour of the Order of the Tribunal.<br><br>(signed)<br>Anthony A. Lucky<br><br></div>
