            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Paperchicken,<br><br>First of all, there is no basis of comparison whether YPAP forum is better or SGforum better.<br><br>But in YPAP forum, I get more kick, due to some "hotting up" effect and changing to confrontational mode. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I wasn't serious when I apply to join YPAP forum but to test on PAP's "Open, Inclusive" concpet. I made known to them I am from Workers' Party. Well, it takes a while for my account to be activated but at least, it got activated. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>There are some good forumites in YPAP forum, people like StrayCat (insightful and creative), Lai (knowledgable in infrastructure development due to his profession and also he is pretty good in Singapore political history), Vincent (sharp and very logical thinking) and even Modeus has his pluses. Of course, there PAP "bouncers" around, like Elfred. It is a good training ground for people like me. I need sparring partners as well as dancing partners to shape me up.<br><br>AS for SgForum, I think there are more "silent readers" around, some are critics of both PAP and opposition. But the fact is, it is a citizen's right to make his political stand and I believe, one has to make his stand. I do not believe in the "perfect" system, but I do believe we are far behind time in political reforms. There are really much to be done to improve our society as a whole. I believe there are also PAP bouncers around and they are more "dangerous" than Elfred in YPAP. They are just waiting to bite hard, I guess. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> It may seem to many that YPAP is a "hotter" place, but to me, SgForum is a more dangerous place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for why WP doesn't have a public forum like Sgforum or YPAP, you must read carefully the political act which restrict internet public forums which requires them to "register" and forum hosts are liable for all sorts of charges and responsibilities. Sintercom closed down basically of that. To me, since only YPAP forum ultimately become the only political entity that could host internet political public forum, just make use of it lor! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But WP does have created a "closed", invite only, internet political forum under Yahoo. It is not open to public for the most obvious reasons.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by paperchicken:</div><div class="quote_body"><a href="http://www.youngpap.org.sg/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=3&amp;sid=b31d5ac2669b22066d7fcfb186cb7a86" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngpap.org.sg/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=3&amp;sid=b31d5ac2669b22066d7fcfb186cb7a86</a><br><br>How come your WP no forum ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Paperchicken,<br><br>Hahahha.... if ISD is not monitoring forums like this one, then I would be very worried. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As a person willingly putting myself right infront of public forum, I am open to public scrutiny. ISD used to have a big file on me already (I think they still keep it). There are only two things on my mind.<br><br>First, there is a pyschologist unit which is monitoring people like me. In fact, they study the content/materials and make psychological profiles of opposition politicians and people that could put up potential "threats" to PAP's monopoly of power. The data collection process is a long drawn one. They check on people right from where they are from; if you graduate from NUS econs department, they will check on your essays, thesis...everything. To make up a psychological profiles on how your mind work, what tickle you most, how would you react to situations...etc etc.<br><br>But individuals are not stagnant, they evolve over time. So, coming to forum like this one or YPAP, will provide a good field data collection for them. Thus, sometimes, I don't reveal my personality too much, choose to reveal things that would confuse them.....etc. But over time, it is inevitable that we would reveal our psychological state of mind to these people. This pyschological profile is important at "critical time"; especially during election period when there is heavy stress and people tend to lost guard of themselves and make grave mistakes. This profile will provide a guide on how to tackle your opponent, make him angry and make him make mistakes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Politics is all about perception. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Secondly, there are silent serpents around in this forum, which will jump up and bite suddenly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Barking dogs don't really kill, those kill, normally don't bark. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I could sense their presence. Their only attempt is to choose the weakest point to bite the hardest, to use one issue to discredit the whole individual or even the whole political party or "Opposition" as a whole. As an active forumite, you should train yourself to look out for these people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>AS for ISD checking on me? Hahaha...

            <div class='col-md body'>Opinion moulding is part and parcel of the political process. Normally, in a country runs by a dictatorship, opinion moulding or brain washing is more intense.<br><br>As for people in this forum is more of "middle ground" people, it is difficult to make them "love" PAP. But it is important that this group of people don't cross over to the opposition side. Thus, I guess it is natural for them to use an alternative tactic to mould the opinion of forumites here; to install the image that even though PAP is not lovable, but "opposition" is useless, incapable of anything....etc etc. Thus, voting PAP would be a better choice. This is the "stand" that I feel, is subtlely installed in this forum when I first came in.<br><br>Normally such image or opinion moulding is done by using single incident or single individual's mistakes to project such perception. Dr. Chee has been mentioned again and again to brain wash such perception into viewers here. Nobody really bothers to differentiate between the different political parties or even check out on the development of these parties anymore. That's where the serpents bite and come into picture. It is a subtle but distinguish social engineering of mindsets.<br><br>Normally these people are not interested in "debating" on issues but rather, starting wild fire with a match stick. They will wait quietly for such opportunity. Sometimes, they will even set traps for you to step in and if you unwittingly step into it, they will go for the kill.<br><br>These agents exist with vicious intent. To "demolish" any potential threat in one swoop. But sometimes, they failed, they will just retreat into the background, waiting for another opportunity again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, for normal forumites, you do not need to be worried because you are only their subjects of "social engineering", not their targets of demolition. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> You will only need to beware of their attempts of social engineering and trying to poison your mind with certain perceptions.

Who do you think send instructions to arrest him for "criminal defamation"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Throughout the whole process, no one debates with him or argue with him with regards to his postings in various forums, especially those in soc.culture.singapore.
