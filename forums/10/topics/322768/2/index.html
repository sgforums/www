              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Only the brilliance of the 'dearHunter' will have us believe that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tax imposed</strong></span> on the petrol - causing the domestic petrol sales price to rise by 25% - is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a subsidy</strong></span> from the government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your explanation of "<em>tax and subsidy</em>" for the Singapore situation is true - what were the Malaysian, Indonesian and Indian Governments doing - forcing their petrol or fuel selling price to be as low as possible, by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>giving money</strong></span> to the oil companies <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to fix the price lower</span></strong> ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now that the money subsidy is removed from the oil companies in Malaysia, Indonesia and India - petrol prices has risen without the subsidy.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hypocrisy seems to flow from the dearHunter in the same volumous ways as the garbage that flow from his 1% inspired thoughts, and stink from the 99% perspiration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you conveniently forgotten your vulgarities and juvenile hooliganism in your ranting reply to robbertteh ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your 1% inspired stupidity, can we hope for any sensible discussion with your 99% perspiration in juvenile expertise in your insults, scathing dishonesty, and patronising statements ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Clearly when you are lost for your words, all you can resort to is your vile retort mixed with frustrated vulgarities.</span></p>

              <p>The point is, the length of history is not the only thing to consider, nor is it a very good excuse given a certain someone predicted "swiss" standards of living some time back.</p>
              <p>Is this due to "lack of history" or simply being outclassed?</p>
              <p>More importantly, is our current dismal 25th ranking an indication of an "everything that has been done has been done", optimal situtation or could much more be done to improve the ranking?</p>
              <p>More telling is our dismal rating for quality of life, now I seriously doubt that is the result of lack of history.</p>

              <p>I would differ in views with you. Is it not true now that most singaporeans are working hard? I would say that they are working hard. But the government are taking our money through increased GST, and less subsidy and also increasing the fees of public transport, which is supposed to cater to the less rich citizens? We are very concerned that the price of many daily things will increase again. We are not waiting for people to feed and babysit us. We just ask that the government will not increase the prices so much to breaking point. Do you disagree that we are trying to make our country a better place already? The only thing people worry about nowadays, is increase in prices. And the raise of the government's salary increased soon after the GST increase to 7%. Do you really blame them for being suspicious and more disatisfied with the government?</p>
              <p>We in singapore are not waiting for anyone to babysit us. Unlike other countries, where the government gives money to people who are not working, it is not like that in singapore. So, I don't believe that babysitting can be used to describe.</p>
