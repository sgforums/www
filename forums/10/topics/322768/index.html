              <p>Singapore, with no natural resources, small 'red dot', with only a population of est 3.5million,and only 43 years old, has rank 25th place, ahead of 152 other some bigger and older, resource rich countries in the world, in a UN 2007/2008 survey.</p>
              <p>Citizens, you can pop the champagne. Your hard work and tax contributions had made a difference, and while we may not be satisfied with our own lives for we are a go getter nation ever seeking to be better than we can ever be, we can take comfort that we had done well, as viewed and observed by others impartially around the world, no less than UN.</p>

              <p>Quality of life is subjective life satisfaction surveys, and at most use objective determinants in attempts to quantify the results.</p>
              <p>You can practically ask even the richest man on earth and he will tell you he is not satisfied. Who is, more so we chinese dominant society here? Can subjective opinions be used as facts? Doubt so.</p>
              <p>Thus, for peer reviewed and more proffesional determinants, it would be better to seek results and real data to determine the actual quality of life, based on Human Development Index, conducted by qualified and experienced <strong>academicians</strong> within the highest body of our world - the UN.</p>

              <p>The journalists at one time called this sort of propaganda selective comparisons or justification syndrome choosing statistics to glorify certain presumptuous feats while hiding the real problems unsolved.</p>
              <p>Through this sort of culled statistics all the problems will be explained away or denied as if by professonal information when on closer analysis the problems remain unsolved.</p>
              <p>For example,  MOM has conveniently concealed the extent of true unemployment problems counting the employments of Permanent Residents as employments of residents to dilute the original unemployment figure for citizens.</p>
              <p>Furthermore how does the MOM define unemployment. If a person is unemployed for some time say more than 20 months due to recessions and could not get any jobs and become permanently jobless is he included as unemployed.</p>
              <p>If these long-term unemployed are excluded of course again the actual number of unemployed will also be diluted or lowered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the same manner, statistics on skill or educational development are lumped up government can easily look more generous when actually the government has levied a separate SDF tax for certain purpose where millions were collected from companies but the spending to promote skills were quite doubtful in nature.</p>
              <p>If these millions spent were to be analysed it will be found they were not spent to help developing skills needed in new start-up technologies but on mundane for the bigger companies which had to be withdrawn in many cases because of certain abuses in the past by companies.</p>
              <p>Education fees paid are shooting up because of incorrect policies aimed at paying up for the infrastructures which should have been financed out of taxes like COEs, ERPs, Housing Tax, Land sale profits, stamp duties etc.</p>
              <p>So through taxing and hoarding of taxes paid as mentioned education fees will have to be charged on par with other countries to pay for costs of infrastructures all over.</p>

              <p>The journalists at one time called this sort of propaganda selective comparisons or justification syndrome choosing statistics to glorify certain presumptuous feats while hiding the real problems unsolved.</p>
              <p>Through this sort of culled statistics all the problems will be explained away or denied as if by professonal information when on closer analysis the problems remain unsolved.</p>
              <p>For example,  MOM has conveniently concealed the extent of true unemployment problems counting the employments of Permanent Residents as employments of residents to dilute the original unemployment figure for citizens.</p>
              <p>Furthermore how does the MOM define unemployment. If a person is unemployed for some time say more than 20 months due to recessions and could not get any jobs and become permanently jobless is he included as unemployed.</p>
              <p>If these long-term unemployed are excluded of course again the actual number of unemployed will also be diluted or lowered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the same manner, statistics on skill or educational development are lumped up government can easily look more generous when actually the government has levied a separate SDF tax for certain purpose where millions were collected from companies but the spending to promote skills were quite doubtful in nature.</p>
              <p>If these millions spent were to be analysed it will be found they were not spent to help developing skills needed in new start-up technologies but on mundane for the bigger companies which had to be withdrawn in many cases because of certain abuses in the past by companies.</p>
              <p>Education fees paid are shooting up because of incorrect policies aimed at paying up for the infrastructures which should have been financed out of taxes like COEs, ERPs, Housing Tax, Land sale profits, stamp duties etc.</p>
              <p>So through taxing and hoarding of taxes paid as mentioned education fees will have to be charged on par with other countries to pay for costs of infrastructures all over.</p>

              <p><br>True, but then again, a ranking of 25 for a government that claims so many "world's no. 1" is hardly anything to cheer about.</p>
              <p>It's kinda amazing how DeerHunter is trying to say this is good news, if he had some common sense as to what was good for his agenda in here, he's better off not starting this thread at all.</p>
              <p>What can we say?</p>
              <p>Apparently our SAF is buying more ROFLCOPTERs in light of his latest great mishap of judgement.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this the best production from a dearHunter's 1% inspiration - with 99% perspiration in plagiarising and bastardising the well arranged propaganda from some surveys ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore has been around since 1819, had limited self-rule since 1953, full self-rule by 1959 and independence since 1965 - why should you start your historical count on an ignominous date when Singapore was kicked out of a wilfull merger with Malaysia through a sham Referendum that was shamelessly conducted ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has Singapore performed in such sterling manner compared to those countries behind its ranking at 25 ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why did you not compare Singapore with similar size countries - in usuable land area even with larger population size - such as Hong Kong which also has no natural resources and dependent on the industry of its people ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hong Kong was colonised by Britain in 1842, and given self-rule only in 1971 - yet according to your UNDP score, Hong Kong had achieved a ranking of 21 despite the shorter history compared to Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Incidentally, Singapore's population is 4.5 million - {unless you clearly state that the 3.5 million are citizens only}; compared to Hong Kong's larger population of 6.98 million {July 2007 est}.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Considering the quality of environment influenced by human ingenuity to control the carbon dioxide emission {CO2} - the index for Hong Kong in 2004 was 37.4; and the index for Singapore in 2004 was 52.2. {according to your UNDP reference}</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How could this have happened considering the long history in Singapore Garden City campaign, and the tight regulation in vehicle and industrial emission ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Both Hong Kong and Singapore have a majority of the population being ethnic Chinese - how could the score be so different given Singapore's longer political history in self-governance ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have lies been told here, or facts been twisted, or has the 99% perspiration by the 'dearHunter' achieved nothing from his characteristic low inspiration score of 1% ?</span></p>
