Everyone is the same.</div></blockquote>You believed in afterlife? OMG!<br><br>I despise this: 'All men are created equal' and I truly detest it. Some are borned into riches. Some borned with a handicap. It's only in death that all men are equal. You can be given equal rights but men are not created equal. They are all the different. Whether we live a life after death is not a known fact, and I personnally thinks it's too ideal that in death we pay for our sins. Then why do we live in the first place? To let the chance go to some rich, bad brats, so in death they pay with suffering? No, we fight for those chances while living. You can retain your moral values or not, but retain your sanity to believe in life all are nothing but different and unfair. LEARN to accept differences, not avoid these questions. DENYING differences is stupid. It's like saying your boss and you are the same.</div>

Now they know we are different. In China, singaporean chinese is a force being reckoned with, along with Taiwanese and Hong Kongers. If you are malaysian chinese, macau chinese or american chinese, you are not chinese. They have this to say about this three groups of non-china chinese, : Taiwanese have no shame (wu chi), HongKonger have no sentiment (wu qing) and Singaporean are naive (wu zhi).

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oldbreadstinks:</div><div class="quote_body">huh? why's that?</div></blockquote>I once introduced a malaysian to a mainland chinese in Xian, his response:"how come malaysian got chinese name?"<br>The impacts of these malaysian chinese, macau chinese and american chinese are  practically not there. Many mainland chinese thought there are mainly portugese in macau and the chinese there are mainland chinese. They thought american chinese are mainland chinese, hongkonger or taiwanese chinese who had gone there to get american passport. To them, the ABC, especially those who can't speak chinese, are the same as korean and japanese, look like chinese but are not chinese. Besides, those ABC always address themselves as american.<br><br>Taiwanese, hong kongers and Singaporean made significant impact, especially economically, in China. The presence are felt and are recognised.  The last time I was in Shanghai the Raffles City owned by capitalland standing prominantly just outside the People's Square MRT was a landmark of Singaporean's presence in shanghai. Deng XP's learning from Singapore....all have great impact on their ppl about singapore. If you see a group of tai tai in a chinese restaurant, the captain will recognise them as those from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore or local.They acknowledge that singaporean don't speak very good mandarin, but all speak english.  Those from other places, ethnically chinese or not, are wai tuo ren, foreigners.</div>
