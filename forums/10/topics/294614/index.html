            <div class='col-md body'>Government has been trying to tell the international media that Singapore is unique being vulnerable due to its size so it cannot afford to grant citizens' freedoms of speech or expressions and must practise harsh laws called rule of law (govt can have its own set of law on salaries and life pensions etc) to create a more stable environment.<br><br>So criticizing of government is not yet accepted as a culture in little red dot.<br><br>If there is some relaxation it is only for show to the outside world to get foreigners to invest in Singapore. It is found that many intellectuals or cartoon strips or films are being allowed as if there are now greater freedoms.<br><br>Let us examine the fact whether there is now greater freedoms granted by the government. Is the Straits Times publishing critical letters asking for example Temasek to disclose the wrong doings behind the losses in Shin Corp or other critical letters asking for accountability in the recent fire incidents in Hougang. Why was there no commission of inquiry?<br><br>I am sure many of us have sent letters to the Straits Times which were rejected because they were too sensitive to the government with the pro-government editors knowing what to do to avoid getting in hot soup with the government.<br><br>A number of citizens' critical letters as tested here in this forum concerning rising costs of living and profiteering or wrong policies of government were rejected from publication in its forum page.<br><br>Lately the government even tries to take over theonelinecitizen website to serve as its propaganda machine as some of our forumers have found out.<br><br>Is this kind of controlled or selective publishing of only mild criticisms as seen being conducted by Straits Times or theonlinecitizens contributing to nation building or is it merely an excuse to hide potential problems and wrong doings through misuse of political power which at the end will be creating bigger instability to hide wrongful acts or wrong policies which serve only the private interests of a few leaders. Will not such control of the media lead to violent reactions of the people another day when problems being locked up become even bigger malpractices as already seen in outrage and widespread anger over the wrongs in NKF or last-year outcry over another increase in ministers' pays</div>
