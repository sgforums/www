              <p>In 2004, about 4 years ago, PM Lee and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan
                  announced that pap would change its past policies of scouting only for
                  those with their own mindset and welcome non-conformist critics who
                  could offer alternative policies and solutions to join the party.<br> <br> Not that I have had any intention of joining the party, I actually
                  posed myself as a potential interested non-conformist critic with lots
                  of queries to ask and wrote to young pap's secretary asking to take
                  part in its internal policy debates (not the same as joining young pap)<br> <br> You know what, I was told I needed to join the pap as a member before I
                  could take part in such debates. I was given some contact in pap hq and
                  referred to the MP in my constituency to sort be put under some
                  observation or understudy in order to be admitted as a member. Of
                  course one could guess my response. I did not bother with such an
                  invitation to join the party.<br> <br> If Raymond Lim this time is serious about inviting people to join some
                  pap forum to give them ideas on alternative policies or solutions to
                  put them out of mischief he could try again. Rest assure there will be
                  a wall of obstacles to make people think twice about offering any
                  solutions.<br> <br> PAP is not interested in genuine feedbacks; all the talks about
                  welcoming people to offer feedbacks and alternative solutions are only
                  for shows.<br> <br> That is the way pap solves problems. It is too proud to admit its
                  policies are less than right or perfect. It is only putting up a facade
                  or charade to appease the critics because the critics will and are
                  becoming an intellectually better lot than many of the ministers put
                  together even in the way of solving education and transport problems.<br> <br> Look at some solutions already suggested as posted in this forum and
                  many others. There are no lack of good ideas and solutions. It is just
                  that the leaders are too proud and too arrogant to listen especially
                  with regard to giving up revenues to hoard monies from citizens and
                  profiteering from the people.<br> <br> So the way I look at it there will be only lip service. Show us Raymond
                  Lim you are prepared to give up the ERP revenues from the estates
                  residents like Toa Payoh by removing the Toa Payoh gantry and put such
                  gantry elsewhere along only fast moving expressways like PIE or CTE
                  leading to major CBD or concentration of business or industrial
                  districts by creating the three tiers of road networks of expressways,
                  major roads and local roads allowing a combination of local roads and
                  major alternative roads to be alternative ERP-free roads to provide
                  alternatives to ERP instead of indiscriminately putting up ERPs
                  everywhere.<br> <br> Set up an indepth study panel to discover our innate and practical
                  local talents who can be found in large numbers instead of rushing to
                  the conclusion that we need to open the floodgates to all foreign
                  workers to create jobs.<br> <br> A bit of hand holding is essential before any local talents can match
                  different needs in different vocations. Many older people are learning
                  computers so there is no reason why there should be a lack of talents
                  if employers are given incentives to employ potentially good people and
                  retrain them with a certain flexible definitions to jobs. Create longer
                  probation period to entice certain changes to the job markets.<br> <br> It is immoral to charge the HDB low cost housing at full market prices
                  when lands are already paid for partly or fully by citizens through
                  their own monies and taxes. A high level panel needs to be set up to
                  consider more creative ways to lessen the impact of citizens'
                  livelihood due to high housing costs especially when government is
                  encouraging people to get married and produce more children.<br> <br> As for education policies, just go back to the old posts given to
                  feedback unit and many like the forumsoneasia or youngpap or sgforums
                  to read the many good ideas and solutions already posted. We need all
                  the ministers and senior civil servants to come down from their high
                  horse and begin to encourage all to apply practical talents in every
                  field and not just narrowly concentrating on the regular curriculum in
                  schools. Be more open to practical applications in ideas outside the
                  classrooms. Read www.sgforums.com to get some good and practical ideas how to set up tasks and duties in
                  simple doable daily work routines to encourage every one to grow in
                  their jobs or professions.<br> <br> Just let the civil service be manned by people with really good
                  experiences from the middle-career administrative and technical
                  employees from the private sector who are becoming security guards or
                  taxi-drivers.<br> <br> Many local talents are being excluded because of lack of holding hands
                  or probationary incentives to attracts our own talents to take up
                  available jobs and increase diversification of the whole government and
                  civil service.<br> <br> It is all a man-made illusion that the leaders or party knows best. If
                  they know best Mas Selamat will not escape that easily through the
                  toilet bowl and Temasek will not lose billions in Shin Corp.<br> <br> With such wild cards ideas will the executive committees of pap or
                  youngpap still welcome people to debate their internal policies? Let's
                  get real for once Mr. Raymond Lim.</p>
