You born already or not ?</blockquote>Don't get fooled by newspaper sensationalism. There was no removal of any structural columns. A group of RC piles were badly out of alignment with the pile cap as testified by the expert who was nevertheless overruled on one of the commissioners of inquiry. As a result of this structurally defective pile cap the columns were obviously unable to carry the extra load posed by the additional water tanks, OTTV claddings, safes and all.<br><br>The above-stated fact was not revealed to the public. I invite anyone to study again the photographs of non-aligned piles and pile caps as printed in the report of the COI and he would know better why the structural checking was ever so important and not to be delegated to LTA, HDB or any contractors, safety officers or subcontractors who will definitely push away all such responsibilities to god knows who.<br><br>If our million-dollar ministers cannot oversee his relevant departments like the BCD there would be a lot of shirking and excuses as seen in the Nicol Highway collapse inquiry where BCD definitely failed to implement the structural checking introduced after the Hotel New World collapse and sadly the prior-collapse suicide of site engineer was not even looked into.<br></div>
