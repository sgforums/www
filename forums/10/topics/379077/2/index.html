              <p>According to them now, lift upgrading is now a "national
              project" which means they were wrong to deliberately not upgrade
              opposition wards, leaving them last behind some younger PAP held
              estates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it is a national project, then party MPs should not be using
              it as a reason to canvass for votes during elections.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Wrong.  Lift upgrading is a political incentive for voting for the right party.  You know like how you offer a parrot some sunflower seeds when it says "hello!" ?</p>

              <p>That's my point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They use it as a political incentive to get people to vote for them in previous elections saying it was a "party" initiative.</p>

              <p>However, in this saga, they have decided it is now a "national project" much like say building public roads - which it should have been non partisan in the first place.</p>

              <p>National project... roads are public goods, commons for all to consume.  These things are paid for when every we pay our taxes be it income tax, gst etc.  </p>
              <p>But fair enough, legislators are voted in by the people to represent their interest. And hence all that "oh you didn't vote for me, so you don't get new public goods."  Dirty, but fair... so lets let that slip for now. </p>
              <p>However, that also means that if constituency votes for them, they then become obligated to finish that promised project by the promised timeline.  If not, the people of the constituency would have been scammed of their votes.  In the long run, as long as the PAP has the resources to fulfil their promises, this incentive based campaign strategy will work.  It will bite them back in the rear end if they should be unable fulfil what they have obligated.</p>
              <p>In any case, opposition strategies are limited for now. They should focus on engaging the PAP on timelines rather on what they promised to do.  Upgrade lifts? By When?  The strategy will have low short term yields but may be promising in the long term.</p>
