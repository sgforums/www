              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Govt concedes argument with WP and Singaporeans<br> </span></strong><br> Since the ill-advised announcement by the so-called PAP “grassroots
              advisers” of Hougang and Potong Pasir about the Lift Upgrading
              Programme (LUP) in the two opposition-held wards, the Minister for
              National Development has had to answer three letters to the Straits
              Times to justify their stand on the issue. Two of those letters were in
              response to Workers’ Party leaders Low Thia Khiang and Sylvia Lim, and
              one was to a public-spirited Singaporean, Muhammad Yusuf Osman.<br> <br> In his latest letter (copied below), the spokesman of National
              Development Minister Mah Bow Tan wrote: “We do not expect the Workers’
              Party to accept these basic facts, and we will agree to disagree.”<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>In saying this, the Minister is
              basically conceding that his argument holds no water, and he has no
              more points to add that could better justify the PAP’s
              politically-motivated stand.</strong></span><br> <br> The “basic facts” were that the PAP grassroots adviser is the
              government’s official representative, and that he is “answerable to the
              government”.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I can’t see how the PAP advisers,
              being volunteers (I hope!) and not under the government payroll are
              “answerable” to the government. </strong></span>If they mess up, how
              are they held accountable? At most they get removed from their post and
              lose a bit of face, but suffer no other loss.<br> <br> The opposition MP, on the other hand, may not be answerable to the
              government, but is answerable to the electorate in his ward. If he
              makes a mess of the LUP, voters may throw him out at the next election
              and he’ll lose his job and a $16,600 a month allowance.<br> <br> Now tell me, who do you think will work harder to make LUP a success to benefit residents?<br> <br> The Ministry spokesman ended by saying: “(T)he interests of Hougang residents are best served by concrete actions, not words.”<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>It is clear to voters that the
              opposition MPs in Hougang and Potong Pasir, who have been serving their
              residents for 18 years and 25 years respectively, have a far more
              distinguished track record of “concrete actions” serving their
              residents than the Johnny-come-lately PAP challengers, who are very
              good at plastering their faces all over the ward and claiming credit
              for things they never did.</strong></span><br> <br> *    *    *    *    *<br> <br> <em><span style="color: blue;">Straits Times, 17 October 2009<br> <br> Lift upgrading: We will agree to disagree<br> <br> I REFER to Ms Sylvia Lim’s letter on Thursday, ‘WP rebuts ministry’s
              reply on lift upgrading’, in response to the Ministry of National
              Development’s (MND) earlier explanations on the Lift Upgrading
              Programme (LUP) in Hougang.<br> <br> As we have pointed out, the LUP is carried out and funded by the
              Government, not the local Member of Parliament. The Government tasks
              the local adviser to grassroots organisations to work with all
              interested parties, including the MP, to implement the LUP. This is not
              a matter of protocol, but because of the need to implement government
              programmes through persons and agencies answerable to the Government.
              Opposition MPs do not answer to the Government, and implementing the
              LUP is not one of their constitutional or legal duties.<br> <br> We do not expect the Workers’ Party to accept these basic facts, and we
              will agree to disagree. In the final analysis, the people of Singapore
              will decide. In the meantime, the interests of Hougang residents are
              best served by concrete actions, not words.<br> <br> The MND and HDB will continue to work with the grassroots adviser and
              other stakeholders in Hougang to implement the LUP in the constituency.<br> <br> Lim Yuin Chien<br> Press Secretary to the Minister for National Development</span><br> </em> <br> ====================<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>For news about Singapore from non-mainstream media, visit <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a></strong></span><br> <br> .</p>

              <p>The arrogance of the reply from the PAP Minister is typical of their stance as seen in the statement made in their reply that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">because of the need to implement government programmes through persons and agencies answerable to the Government</span></em>" - hence, the Government is not answerable to the constituents who do not have their Party Nominee as the MP.</p>
              <p>If the MP from the Alternative Party is an Elected Official to represent the people in its Constituency, both the MP and the Government should be answerable for all matters in the Constituency.</p>
              <p>While the MP may not be working as part of the Government, it should still have the responsibility as the co-ordinating office between the government agencies tasked to implement the LUP works in  the MP's Constituency.</p>
              <p>The entire matter is another one of the typical PAP Third World Petty Politicking mentality to score points with the electorates - at the expense of the tax-paying electorates.</p>
              <p>The fact that the PAP Minister is prepared to concede "to agree to disagree" clearly show its position has no merit in the eyes of the public.</p>
              <p>Is there any honor to play politiks with tax payers' money for the benefit of the party that is controlling the dispensing of the development funds ?</p>

              <p>Somehow those who are taken in by the dramas created by the MIW are the ones most enthused in this artform as their own supreme roles being the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a></p>
              <p>How many in Singapore will swallow the venom of the MIW towards their political nemesis ?</p>
              <p>It is quite obvious that the unthinking drama addicts will fall for the scripted dramas that have been creatively crafted by the MIW to "fix" those who pose the biggest threat to the political fortunes of the MIW.</p>
              <p>Can a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Narcissist">“narcissist” </a>know how to take the heat under the spotlight, when it has yet to step on center stage while it gripe and make childish criticism of the efforts made by others ?</p>
              <p>We can trust the narcissistic <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>being familiar with its own supporting cast of charlatans and clowns for its unique "circus of dramas".</p>
              <p>It is pathetic that while most Singaporeans have shown sympathy and empathy towards JBJ - who have been undeservingly derided by LKY as a 'charlatan' - clowns like the resident <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>will wish to pass on this label to CSJ.</p>
              <p>If the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>is to be credible, it should admit to its volumous fraudulent claim to be a fence sitter with its quack knowledge of the political circumstances and events that has give comfort to the MIW inflicting pain and suffering on the main actors from the alternative political parties.</p>
              <p>A credible <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>should be honest enough to admit to its true role - and will at least be able escape its own shroud of being a 'charlatan' in its own BS drama.</p>

              <p>According to them now, lift upgrading is now a "national project" which means they were wrong to deliberately not upgrade opposition wards, leaving them last behind some younger PAP held estates.</p>

              <p>If it is a national project, then party MPs should not be using it as a reason to canvass for votes during elections.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <h1>MND continues to throw smoke bombs over role of PAP “grassroots advisers”</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              The National Development Ministry has continued to throw smoke-bombs over the role of PAP “grassroots advisers” in a letter written by its <strong>press secretary Lim Yuin Chien</strong>, which was published in the Straits Times Forum today.
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The letter was a direct rebuttal of a biting commentary published last week by Straits Times senior correspondent Sue-Ann Chia who earlier questioned the seemingly conflicting roles of a MP and grassroots adviser.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim wrote that “the roles of MP and adviser are distinct and separate, even though government MPs, wearing their other hat of advisers, are expected to perform both roles.”</p>
              <p>“Opposition MPs cannot be appointed advisers, because they do not answer to the ruling party. They have no constitutional or legal obligation to carry out national programmes on the Government’s behalf. Nor can the Government hold them to account if they perform this role unsatisfactorily.” he added.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">That’s where Mr Lim is wrong. There is no such thing as a “government MP.” The correct term to use should be “PAP MPs”.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The PAP is NOT the government of Singapore which can be formed by a coalition of parties.</span></p>
              <p>Mr Lim re-emphasized that “the LUP is not a town council programme. It is a national programme which receives most of its funding from the Government.”</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">And where does the government receive its funding from? From every citizen of Singapore including the residents of Hougang and Potong Pasir</span>.</span></strong></p>
              <p>There is absolutely no reason why opposition MPs cannot be appointed as grassroots advisers unless they decline to work with the government.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The root cause of the problem lies in the lack of a clearly defined demarcation between the state and the party which resulted in many supposedly apolitical institutions like the People’s Association being made use of by the PAP to serve its partisan interests.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">As the People’s Association is a statutory board, its members and grassroots advisers should have no political affiliations.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is disingenuous of the PAP to appoint their losing candidates to continue “serving” in the opposition wards under the veneer of being the “grassroots advisers” appointed by the PA.</strong></span></p>
