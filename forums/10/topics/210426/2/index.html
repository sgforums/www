            <div class='col-md body'>Well, its one cross after another. But really, I don't understand this issue of letting the NGOs protest in the open. You fence up the area with razor-tipped fences, you just let them protest in the sun lahz. You provide aircon, they complain you welfare, then tekan them lor, let them bake in the sun lahz. If you wanna be nice, show you got compassion, mebbe put two water tanks there lahz. Now outside got no shelter mahz...so its defined as in the open right? Then in the open they protest, at most you get the SOC chaps to surround them in riot kit lahz, they guai lan, just whack. The IMF and WB chief cannot say anything what right? If not, you let them protest in the open, but make sure the go inside an area surrounded by the razor-fence lor, if anything, they wana run also cannot run, then you can ask SOC or Grukha to chiong in and have a field day hammering them or live target practice mahz. Stupid siahz...scholar go top University never teach them this meh? Rules are meant not to be broken, but bent.<br><br>If paranoid that the 27 chaps might pull off some stunt, ok...create a tent city for them also IN THE OPEN but tell them they must scan their passport when they go out or something lahz, then IMF and WB chief also LAN LAN, cannot say anything what,cuz you can say in view of the current security situation we are putting the interest of our guests as top priority what right. They want protest, you let them protest already right? They want NGO ppl to come in, you let them to come in already right? They want to protest outside, since people don't understand your welfare, then you let them lor, protest outside lah. The agreement never say must protet under what conditions right? So there you have it. Sometimes, I feel that we the poor and common people actually possess more cow sense and look into the finer details of things as compared to scholars. Damn, I'm beginning to feel that we are all more clever then the scholars in our creativity problem solving abilities man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I pity those people, not the government.</div></blockquote> the silly decision on the 27 persons are made by those involved in security. Each should be proud of what he does. Those who cook should be proud if the delegates enjoy the food. If they insisted that everybody should enjoy singapore food and serve mee siam, laksa and curry fish head  everyday, then they have reasons to be disappointed.<br><br>So far I believe all other parties can be proud and they can make singapore proud. Its those in charge of security, going around killing ends with hammers, should be disappointed.</div>
