            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore inflicts enormous damage to reputation: Wolfowitz<br>AFP<br>15 Sept 06<br><br>Singapore inflicted enormous damage to reputation: Wolfowitz<br><br>Singapore has inflicted enormous damage to its reputation because of its reluctance to admit 27 activists accredited for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, bank president Paul Wolfowitz has said.<br><br>"Enormous damage has been done...A lot of that damage has been to Singapore and it's self-inflicted," Wolfowitz said at a meeting with non-governmental organizations.<br><br>Singapore said it had security concerns about 27 of the hundreds of activists whom the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had already accredited to attend the institutions' meetings in Singapore as part of a formal dialogue.<br><br>"I would certainly argue that at the stage of success they've reached they'd be much better for themselves if they (took) a more visionary approach to the process," Wolfowitz said, adding that he raised the issue in a Thursday night meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>"Last night the prime minister said that based on Bank and Fund vouching for these people that they would look at each case individually and open the door to let them in. I hope that will happen expeditiously and completely and we're waiting for further developments," Wolfowitz told an earlier news conference.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tonight it was announced over the TV that PM Lee has agreed to retract 22 of the 27 bans on entries of Civil Organization protagonists originally deemed to be threats to Singapore security.<br><br>In other words what were originally deemed to be threats were found to be untruth or overreactions !!! What quality of our police force who could not make even proper assessments of threats.<br><br>It is hoped after this IMF/WB about-turn of one of the gahman's toughest and sternest no-demonstration and no-protest policies, the leaders have eaten enough of a humble pie and will in future learn from this lesson - you can hide your excesses and try to explain it away and call all shots some of the time but you cannot pull the wool on all eyes all the time.<br><br>What is not right morally or culturally even if they can be mulled over legalistically simply cannot be covered up or stand the test of time as demonstrated in the the NKF. At a more appropriate time like the SPH or IMF all the wrongs will stick up like sore thumb.<br><br>So why not adopt a fast-forward time table and ease all the unwarranted over-restrictions on freedoms of the press, freedom to exercise one-man-one-vote right, all the unnecessary over-controls and over-regulated laws and penalties on citizens under whatever names and for whatever the clouded rationale. Many of these curbs on citizens' rights were like the banning of these 27 civil activists were founded on figments of imaginations and justifications without facts and basis and should not have been put up in the first instance.<br><br>Why want to be embarrassed by international outrage and buckle the pressure of bigger forces to change it by condescension. Change will be double the pleasure if change is more graceful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think these 27 chaps, can die proud siahz. They managed to bring a govt. to their knees without inciting violence, buring a single car nor gettin anyone injured. Honestly, I'm against the idea of them barring ppl. entry based on an over-imaginative and creative sense of security threat assesment provided by them. I mean where did they get this Intel? Poring over the internet to look for those who have been arrested previously for troublemaking or what?<br><br>To do damage control, they should have continued their stand. Saying that NO WAY will we allow them in as they are assessed based on what criteria and thus we feel that they are a threat. By setting this so called criteria, can the IMF, Worldbank chiefs say that you are wrong? Hell No, because you can simply say this is how we assess and it has been proven that they are a threat, thus we have taken the pre-emptive action to bar them entry. The thing here is, the CRITERIA can be set and explained, you don't go out infront of the world telling them that as a soverign country you have the right to bar entry to undesirable visitors. If you ask me...the govt. should bar entry to those farking PRC who think that we are Taiwan of the South-East and come here to spread friggin VD and break families. Aren't they undesirable too? The damage they do compared to 27 chaps will be lasting.<br><br>Thus, hopefully from now, think from the citizen's point of view,not some scholary accelerated career advancement and overly creative aspect. It shames me to tell my aussie friend that we've spent so much creating all these campaigns only to have the IMF and WB chiefs ramming a big one up our asses and the 27 chaps squeezing us by our balls. Anyway to sum up, these 27 chaps are smart man, by not doing stupid things to discredit themselves, they auto-ignore the SG Govt. end up the world hail them as heros...really depressing, but I've gotta admit grudgingly...they're good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No one wants the World Trade Organization.<br><br>More than a month after December's WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong, which was supposed to decide on a venue for global commerce's next biennial jamboree in 2007, no city has yet volunteered to hold it.<br><br>The baggage associated with hosting such a meeting Â— organizing and providing accommodation and security for thousands of delegates, journalists and campaigners Â— is daunting enough.<br><br>That's before considering the possibility of the talks collapsing or violent protests Â— as happened in both Seattle and CancÃºn, Mexico Â— costing the host city financially as well as potentially tarnishing its image, as pictures of rioters fighting police beam around the globe.<br><br>"To do the last WTO meeting, it took us 18 months of preparation and cost us an incredible amount of resources," said Hong Kong Commerce Minister John Tsang. "This is not something you want to do every year."<br><br>Traditionally, a few names are considered before the WTO General Council announces a host city for the meeting. The last two hosts, Hong Kong and CancÃºn, volunteered more than two years before the event. Hong Kong said it needed at least a year's advance notice of exact dates because it was so complicated to organize the 10,000 attendees.<br><br>So with the next full-blown ministerial likely to be in late 2007, the clock is already ticking.<br><br>"Who would want to host something where there's such a high chance of failure?" said Philippe de Pontet, an analyst at the Eurasia Group in Washington, D.C. "There's a lot of negatives."<br><br>In Hong Kong, more than 1,000 people were rounded up at the end of the meeting after an anti-globalization march turned into a riot, when hundreds of protesters broke through police lines and tried to storm the convention center where ministers were still negotiating.<br><br>A survey by a Hong Kong research organization found that before the meeting, 57 percent of 500 residents asked thought the conference would benefit the territory. But afterward, that figure dropped to just 12 percent.<br><br>"Hong Kong people are not satisfied with the multimillions of dollars being spent and the inconvenience caused, without there being a real return," said Chris Farquhar of Market Insights Group, which is based in Hong Kong.<br><br>Tsang estimated that it cost the territory more than $38 million to host the event.<br><br>But WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell played down the significance of the trouble in Hong Kong, pointing out that it was less severe than at previous conferences.<br><br>"While this was nothing to sneeze at, it was certainly less than on previous occasions," Rockwell said.<br><br>The Seattle meeting in 1999 saw the worst trouble, when WTO talks collapsed after five days of anti-globalization riots that hurt the city's image and caused $3 million in damage. In CancÃºn, demonstrators battled with police and threw objects and even raw sewage in an attempt to crack a security perimeter around the meeting.<br><br>Officials say Singapore Â— a WTO standby, where the commerce body had its first ministerial conference in 1996 Â— could host the 2007 meeting, while Qatar may also volunteer.<br><br>Geneva remains the default location, but nothing is confirmed.<br><br>"It's true that we've had some concerns about certain meetings, mainly because of the importance of the delegations," said Geneva police spokesman Christophe Zawadzki, adding that the city has not yet put all arrangements in place for hosting a major WTO interim conference at the end of April.<br><br>But some analysts say these major events have less chance of making progress in liberalizing world trade because of the complications of conducting negotiations under close scrutiny.<br><br>Major players are preferring to meet in small groups in Geneva or other locations, such as this week's gathering on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, where they avoid some of the media spotlight that is focused on full ministerials.<br><br>"It is becoming increasingly difficult to make political decisions at the ministerial conference, and so the most powerful WTO members and the WTO secretariat are using other avenues to reach agreement," said Carin Smaller, a trade expert at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a Minneapolis-based research organization.<br><br>http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002762380_whowantswto26.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">Tonight it was announced over the TV that PM Lee has agreed to retract 22 of the 27 bans on entries of Civil Organization protagonists originally deemed to be threats to Singapore security.<br><br>In other words what were originally deemed to be threats were found to be untruth or overreactions !!! What quality of our police force who could not make even proper assessments of threats.<br><br>It is hoped after this IMF/WB about-turn of one of the gahman's toughest and sternest no-demonstration and no-protest policies, the leaders have eaten enough of a humble pie and will in future learn from this lesson - you can hide your excesses and try to explain it away and call all shots some of the time but you cannot pull the wool on all eyes all the time.<br><br>What is not right morally or culturally even if they can be mulled over legalistically simply cannot be covered up or stand the test of time as demonstrated in the the NKF. At a more appropriate time like the SPH or IMF all the wrongs will stick up like sore thumb.<br><br>So why not adopt a fast-forward time table and ease all the unwarranted over-restrictions on freedoms of the press, freedom to exercise one-man-one-vote right, all the unnecessary over-controls and over-regulated laws and penalties on citizens under whatever names and for whatever the clouded rationale. Many of these curbs on citizens' rights were like the banning of these 27 civil activists were founded on figments of imaginations and justifications without facts and basis and should not have been put up in the first instance.<br><br>Why want to be embarrassed by international outrage and buckle the pressure of bigger forces to change it by condescension. Change will be double the pleasure if change is more graceful.</div></blockquote>You know, Rob, they are always telling us all to "move forward" but they seem to have a lot of difficulty doing that themselves!<br><br>.. it's so hilarious this entire episode with IMF!
