If we were the party wooing IMF/WB to hold their conference here then of course we will be more likely be the party who has to accept their conditions beside knowing full well its traditional liberal entourages of CSO activists. That was perhaps the reason for Wolfolwitz's calling of our control freaks' bans on the 27 CSO activists as breach of agreement.<br><br>IMF/WB needs not learn how to suck egg from our own narrow-minded control freaks who over time might have become paranoid about street protests and CSO activitism because of their own overstepping on civil freedoms of its own citizens. Hence, it is clearly a case of our control freaks' own paranoid and over-sensitivity towards protest activities of these CSO activists which are purely normal and peaceful unless otherwise provoked. In any event who are the best judge of normal civilised behaviour and what is considered the objective normal standard.<br><br>There is a great deal our control freaks need to be fearing. To call IMF/WB system of allowing their CSO activists to attend annual conferences as flawed comes across as rather high-handed and presumptuous and one-sided.<br><br>Who is the party which finally has capitulated and has to back down by retracting the bans of 22 out of the 27 CSO activists who are finally found not be of such threats after all. Isn't there something lacking in the way we are conducting our security if finally we have to retract 22 bans out of the over-hasty and presumptuous original bans of 27.</div>

They have persistently accredited activists who have created a trial of chaos and damage at past meetings, from Seattle  through to Washington, Genoa, Quebec, Cancun, Hong Kong...They have negligently accredited all and sundry, leaving the host cities to pick up the pieces and suffer the damages.

They have accredited activists inside the convention hall trying to persuade ministers to their cause whilst the rest of their members are breaking windows outside.<br><br>"Protests have been linked to WTO ever since the 1999 meeting in Seattle morphed from marches by environmentalists in turtle suits to riots sparked by black-clad anarchists. The WTO, the body that sets the rules of global trade, has come to represent everything that worries people about globalization and free markets, from low-priced foreign competitors to environmental damage and cultural change.<br><br>But these days, <strong>protesting is only half of an "inside-outside" resistance strategy</strong>. Many of the activist groups protesting the WTO's push for uniform global trade rules are also accredited to walk the halls where the talks are held, allowing them to mingle with trade ministers and closely follow the nuances of their proposals."  (Seattle Times, Dec 16, 2005)<br><br>That is why the government allows most accredited delegates but banned all public protests. As for the the blacklisted activists, if intelligence revealed that an accredited activist has been known to be also involved in violent riots in the past, it would be negligent of the police to simply allow such anarchists to walk through immigration.<br><br></div>
