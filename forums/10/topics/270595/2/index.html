            <div class='col-md body'>Ignore the troll, before this thread degrades into a useless flaming exercise.<br><br>Yes, the response to Mr Brown's satirical article was completely uncalled for. It is unfortunate that TODAY took it upon themselves to withdraw the article and forced Brown to 'retire'. Miyagi also left TODAY in protest to the unethical and spineless actions of the editorial board of TODAY.<br><br>In this age of inclusive media, let it be known that not all writers are sycophants; there are many who write with indifference to the political climate, who disregard those who follow the conservative rules laid down by those who would dictate the lives of Singaporeans.<br><br>Respect them for it, and the risk they run for incurring the wraith of one particular party.<br><br>A real pity the 'brown t-shirt protest' didn't take on a life of its own. And more embarrassing that the police spent manhours taking down names of those at the gathering...just like the 40 riot police assembled to handle 4 SDP protesters at the CPF building, making SG an international laughing stock.</div>
