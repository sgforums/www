Majority of singaporeans are fearful of them, the law in Singapore has instilled the fear in the people.  Just read what I posted on the way they treat the SDP, we will know sometimes their doings and laws can be so bloody absurd.   Law in singapore works/serves only one way.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is known as toxic leadership style. It exists in business, in the military and in politics.<br><br><strong>What is toxic leadership? </strong><br><br>It is a leadership approach that harms peopleÂ—and, eventually, the organization as wellÂ—through the poisoning of enthusiasm, creativity, autonomy, and innovative expression.<br>Toxic leaders disseminate their poison through over-control. They define leadership as being in control.<br><br><strong>What are the symptoms of toxic leadership?</strong><br><br>In a toxic leadership environment, people are rewarded for agreeing with the leader and punished for thinking differently. In a toxic leadership environment, Â“yesÂ” people are rewarded and are promoted to leadership roles, while people who more fully engage their mental resources, critical thinking, and questioning skills are shut out from decision-making and positions of influence.<br><br><strong>Toxic Leaders</strong><br><br>Toxic leaders receive a certain level of ego gratification from over-controlling.<br>They  may have unresolved psychological issues (such as fear of the unknown, fear of failure, mistrust of people, feelings of inadequacy, lack of confidence, or extreme overconfidence) that they avoid by exercising toxic leadership.<br>The net result of all these factors is that toxic leaders fail to appreciate the uniqueness of being human, and this distorted view of human nature drives the way they relate to people who work for them. Human beings are complex, social beings, and they have intrinsic value that goes far beyond whatever salary they receive or the position they hold. They are more effective and productive, and their satisfaction level is higher, when they are treated as peopleÂ—that is, when they communicate, form relationships, and exercise their creativity.<br><br>In politics, these are the people for whom no malevolent act is out of bounds in the name of gaining and holding power; who pursue policies that abjectly favor the investment class while maintaining a populist rhetoric.<br>The toxic leader treats people as robots, defined by whatever function the leader expects them to perform. Thus the toxic leader is dealing with only a small portion of that person.<br>People pick up on this, and respond by being only Â“partly thereÂ”Â—in other words, their commitment to their work and their connection with the organization are tentative at best.<br>Over time, theyÂ’re likely to see their work as Â“only a job.Â” So the irony is that by attempting to control every aspect of a person, the toxic leader actually controls less of the person, and thus has less control.<br><br><strong>What effects can toxic leadership have on the organization?</strong><br><br>In addition to diminished commitment on the part of people, toxic leadership can produce systemic damage throughout an organization. Under toxic leaders, peoplehave basically two options: conform or leave. Those who remain will experience a diminishing of expectations. Some will be aware that the situation is less than ideal; these people may keep hoping that the situation will change, or be on the lookout for the right time to leave.  Others, however, may come to see toxic leadership as normal, and conform willingly. These will be groomed to be the next generation of toxic leaders!<br><br></div>
