I'll go and look for it if and when I have the time.<br><br>Actually, Hitler did remember that Germany lost WWI partly because it was forced to fight a two-front war. He should know - he fought as a corporal in WWI. That's precisely why historians are still divided as to why he would want to invade Russia and fight the two-front war he feared so much.<br><br>The way I see it, the only really logical move he made was the invasion of France. Even then, it was the military genius Manstein who came up with it. Hitler can only be credited for accepting the Manstein plan where most of his generals rejected it in favour for the highly-unimaginative (and expected) Schlieffen Plan.<br><br>That said, I'm glad that Hitler was an idiot, for I certainly do not want to see him as the Fuhrer of a Greater Germany spanning the whole of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and India. Ultimately, inhuman beasts like him can only succeed in sparking their own downfalls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Adolf Hitler should have been more diligent in school, and not miss out in the interesting history of Europe.<br><br>He will probably have picked up the disaster that fell on <a href="http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?type=theme&amp;theme=Napoleon" rel="nofollow"><strong>Napolean Bonaparte's expedition into Russia</strong></a> occurred during late summer of 1812 and unexpectedly stretched into the bitter cold Russian winter.<br><br>Adolf Hitler's invasion of Russia had also began in the summer of 1940, and can only lead to the same scenario that befell on Napolean a hundred years earlier.<br><br>Extracted from the BBC referenced material <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/wwtwo/hitler_russia_invasion_01.shtml" rel="nofollow"><strong>"History - Hitler's Invasion of Russia in World War Two"</strong></a><br><br>In the summer of 1940 Adolf Hitler, despite his swift and dramatic victory over France, faced a major military and political problem. The British would not do what seemed logical and what the FÃ¼hrer expected - they would not make peace. Yet Hitler was frustrated by geography - in the shape of the English Channel - from following his immediate instincts and swiftly crushing the British just as he had the French.<br><br>Hitler did in fact order preparations to be made for an invasion of England, but he was always half-hearted in his desire to mount a large seaborne landing. Germany, unlike Britain, was not a sea power and the Channel was a formidable obstacle. Even if air superiority could be gained, there remained the powerful British Navy. And there was another, ideological, reason why Hitler was not fully committed to invading Britain. For him, it would have been a distraction. Britain contained neither the space, nor the raw materials, that he believed the new German Empire needed. And he admired the British - Hitler often remarked how much he envied their achievement in subjugating India.<br><br>Worse, if the Germans let themselves be drawn into a risky amphibious operation against a country Hitler had never wanted as an enemy, every day the potential threat from his greatest ideological opponent would be growing stronger. (It was just ironic that he was not yet at war with this perceived enemy, since in August 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union had signed a Non-Aggression Pact.)<br><br>All this meant that, from Hitler's point of view, there was an alternative to invading Britain: he could invade the Soviet Union. Both Hitler and his military planners knew that Germany's best chance of victory was for the war in Europe to be finished swiftly.<br><br>Hubert Menzel was a major in the General Operations Department of the OKH (the Oberkommando des Heers, the German Army headquarters), and for him the idea of invading the Soviet Union in 1941 had the smack of cold, clear logic to it: 'We knew that in two years' time, that is by the end of 1942, beginning of 1943, the English would be ready, the Americans would be ready, the Russians would be ready too, and then we would have to deal with all three of them at the same time.... We had to try to remove the greatest threat from the East.... At the time it seemed possible.'<br><br>(The above paragraphs are taken from chapter one of 'War of the Century' by Laurence Rees, published by BBC Publications, 1999.)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many believe Hitler attacked Russia out of spite, guided along by delusions of grandeur to achieve 'what napoleon bonaparte could not'.<br><br>The truth is that personal vendettas aside, Hitler was also pressured by unconvincing reports from the OKH that the Russians were massing their borders along German-held lines for a pre-emptive strike.<br><br>Since their alliance of convenience to carve Poland in two during the phoney war, the two 'partners' have endured an uneasy trust to achieve an empire of their own.<br><br>Stalin despised and yet admired Hitler for his accomplishments in early 1930s when his Nazi party swept all before them during national elections. Babarrossa was unleased only after reaching a stalemate with Britain, allowing the bulk of the panzer divisions to turn eastwards for a 2nd 'blitzkrieg'.<br><br>In truth, the inaccurate information fed to the Fuhrer somehow convinced Hitler that he had to act to ensure the security of the Aryan race. The real fact was that the Russians did mass their forces at the borders, but in defensive positions and not offensive, this despite Red Army intel insisting the Wehrmacht were preparing to mount a sustained campaign of agression against them.<br><br>Stalin's complacency in the Red Army's capabilities and the transitional period of defensive preparation in which the Wehrmacht caught the Russians literally with their 'pants down', contributed significantly to Babarrossa's early success.<br><br>Subsequent mass encircling tactics by the highly mechanised German Army Groups A and B enabled them to sustain their lightning thrusts into Russian territory with minimal effort, resulting in huge losses for Russia in both troops and weapons.<br><br>References:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Hitler and Stalin, Parallel Lives</span><br>~Alan Bullock<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's totally easy to be writing about how to be Hitler to win the WWII. But personally, I think if anyone happen to be in Hitler's shoes, then the name "Hitler" wouldn't even be the leader of Germany, "Hitler" will still remain as one of the soldiers that will never be heard in history. So how could it be fair to critize Hitler's actions and claim to have a better stand to winning the WWII, because how would anyone knows that he have all these facts to him? If I have the fact that the war isn't going to be won, then of course it's easy for me to say, he shouldn't have started this war, because look he's not going to win because of bla bla bla... Have you even study how he tortured the jews? Have anyone study how his inhuman actions have slaughtered and tortured millions of innocents? I can't believe anyone actually idolize or like him. It's just not right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Germany commenced operation Babarosa. This was to eradicate the russians who had been stockpiling troops on the Russian front. Hitler never trusted the communist. The sign of a troops build up on the eastern front made Hitler feel that an attack on Germany by Russia was imminent.<br><br>Babarosa commenced and Russia was taken by suprised. They lost all their troop buildup and infrastructure to the Germans who were already very adapt at Blizkrig. In a matter of 2 months 90% of Russia was in German hands and the whole world already felt that Russia had fallen.<br><br>Hitler delayed his attack on Moscow by 2 weeks due to a divestment of attack on Leningrad. If he had attacked Moscow 2 weeks earlier...the kremlin would have fallen and Germany would have won the war. Kremlin was their central command for the Russians.<br><br>The germans were not issued winter clothing due to the boasting by Hitler that the war would be won before Winter. The winter then killed more men than the Russians did. The surviving 200,000 men retreated into stalingrad where they held off 1.5million russian soldiers for almost a year. They applied a technic called Hedgehog defence. It proved very effective even in todays warefare.<br><br>The russians won out and hitler regreted starting a war on 2 fronts. He shot himself in his own bunker just before the russians conquered Berlin. He was quoted as telling his aides that he never would want to fall into Stalins hands and be paraded around in a russian circus.</div>
