As I've said, Hitler was an idiot, and we are all the better for it. We're here not to glorify him, but rather to discuss about alternate scenarios in which he might actually have won.

In order to invade Russia, most likely the easier route was to attack China first, which Japan did in the first place.<br><br>The main reason why Japan choose to attack SEA simultaneously was because SEA is rich in natural resources and also Japan lacking the power of buying resources for their imperial army.</div>

After the Soviet spymaster Richard Sorge assured Stalin that the Japs would not invade Russia, Stalin diverted those Siberian divisions to fight the Germans. It was those Siberian divisions which proved to be the turning point - no way could the Germans handle all that firepower being thrown at them.<br><br>Besides, in 1939, border skirmishes actually did occur between the Soviets and the Japanese Army in Manchuria. The brilliant general Georgy Zhukov managed to drive back the 6th Japanese Army with brilliant mobile armour tactics. The battle experience gained by the Siberian divisions in this battle proved to be useful in their counterstrike against the Nazis.<br><br>Besides, these skirmishes convinced the Japs to not attack the Soviets and to risk going to war with the Americans instead.</div>
