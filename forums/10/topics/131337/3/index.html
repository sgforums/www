That it is for business, commercial and competitive sake of a nation. Like SilverPal had said, hes/she is able to communicate in other arrays of dialects within Singapore and claims since PRC folks are learning English, Singaporean's mastery of English is sufficient.<br><br>That, IMO, is a dangerous assumption.<br><br>if 1 billion pple are eager to learn English, then what edge that Singaporean Chinese hv in future's market ? Having a good english is must, but that is no longer unique to Singaporean's so-called bilingual system.<br><br>One may poke fun at current English proficiency amounst PRC Chinese, but the same joke can fall on some ethnic Chinese Singaporean on their terrible attitude they hv towards they "2nd language" which those 1 billion has already mastered.</span></div>

Besides, in singapore you won't even know if they can speak chinese because we will speak to them in english.<br><br>Chinese in china don need english if they stay in China because china market is big enough. When it comes to facing the globalized world, 1% of chinese speak english means 13 million chinese speaking english and chinese! what kind of competition are singaporeans facing ??

For those who wants to step outside and meet the world, "understanding" of any ethnic cultures will certainly help you understand why people behave the way they do and this will bring one closer to another. You have to find out what understanding your very own ethnic culture can do for you. If you don't, then you don't need to know. Singaporean, our nationality, does not replace our ethnicity.
