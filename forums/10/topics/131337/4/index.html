How do you eliminate skin color? Racial difference exists simply because man are not made the same.

Obviously you do not know the diff between ethnicity and nationality. I encourage singaporean to learn chinese if you are ethnically chinese. If you choose to learn malay or indian language, culture or history, good for you. But do you know anything about culture and history?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br><br>oic you meant he show off to other countries, sorry i thought you were refering to internally, my bad.  but in this case my point is still correct for showing common ground or concerns so that you can manipulate them better, manipulate is just an different and uglier word but if you want to say advantage so be it, it still doesn't pinpoint towards learning chinese culture etc specifically. </strong></blockquote>The point is that LKY learned chinese language and culture because he knew he had to meet chinese outside of singapore, obviously he did not want to appear as a banana.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>hmm i see no humour since i was actually "going down to your level" so that you can see the point. anyway so i assume you draw the line at your gradparents?so my grandparents came from malaysia so i shoudln't be that bothered about chinese culture? or for that matter those 2nd(or was it 2rd) generation chinese signaporeans will then be able to ignore their "chinese" back ground? have to question what you mean by brought up as a chinese, if you say you were brought up as per all that chinese culture and history stuff then fine, but you should then realise that the chinese singaporean were brought up as singaporeans and not chinese. oh and the blood was actually becuase if you do happen to draw the line further up you family tree what happens if one of the ancestors was an indain for an example so so forth<br></strong></blockquote>At least you can identify those as 2nd generation <strong>chinese singaporeans </strong>(it doesn't concern you or me whether they ignore their background or not). I know I were brought in as a chinese and i identify myself as a chinese, not for you to question!!<br><br>don need to go on yr knee, if you don't know how you were brought up and if your parents can't tell you who you are, no body can help you.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>common language is just that, the language you speak in common, doesn't have direct relations to what ethnicity you are. if you are proficient in french and meet a french who doesn't do that well in english you would switch to french no? a french greeting a french in french is just because thats the language they are familiar with nothing more i guess we could say the same in singaporeans conversing in singlish, btw what does this have to do with your chinese push? </strong></blockquote>Carry on with yr singlish...<br><br></div>
