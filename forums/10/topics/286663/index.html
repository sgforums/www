            <div class='col-md body'>Major survey ranks Singapore's education among the world's best: MM Lee<br>By S Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 19 October 2007 2221 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE : Why do some countries succeed in the field of education and others do not?<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said on Friday an article in the latest issue of the Economist has rated Singapore as one of the top five countries that have succeeded in the field of education.<br><br>And it is based on a report prepared by McKinsey, a worldwide management consulting firm advising leading companies on issues of strategy, organisation, technology, and operations.<br><br>And he stressed that Singapore has crafted an education system that suits the country after studying several models worldwide, including those of the British, Americans and the Japanese.<br><br>Mr Lee shared this point with participants of a dialogue on Leadership in Asia organised by French post-graduate school, INSEAD.<br><br>It is a leadership forum attended not only by past and present students of INSEAD itself but also by captains of industry and CEOs from top international firms.<br><br>So if Singapore were a stereotypical city, would such talent or even INSEAD bother setting up in the city state?<br><br>John Burton, Singapore Bureau Chief, Financial Times, said: "Singapore does want to become a knowledge society and to do that you do need people who can think out of the box and to challenge the system. Do you think this is a serious issue for Singapore? And does it pose a threat or limit to Singapore's future growth? And what is the solution?"<br><br>MM Lee said: "This is a standard Western correspondent viewpoint. If we cannot think out of the box, you think we would be here sent by the Financial Times to throw darts at us from time to time - and we could change year by year the way we have?"<br><br>Mr Lee said the McKinsey report had studied the education system of many countries.<br><br>He said: "And the conclusion they came to is not whether your classes are big or small, whether you have tests or you don't have tests, but what is the quality of the teachers and how quickly you put things right when it goes wrong and how you get good quality teachers. "<br><br>To be able to do that you must be able to think for yourself because the British didn't leave us with the system and it's not me or the Minister for Education. We have people who have gone round the world studying the education systems. I think if the Financial Times does worry about us and sincerely takes an interest in our future, I suggest read that report, visit our universities and find out how it is."<br><br>For participants at INSEAD's leadership summit, it was an opportunity for them to get Mr Lee's views on the factors that have resulted in good governance in countries.<br><br>And one of them wanted to know what was his role now as Minister Mentor in the government.<br><br>MM Lee said: "When my son became the Prime Minister, I either had to leave the cabinet or he made quite sure that I am not deciding policy. I was moved from Senior Minister which I was for 14 years when Goh Chok Tong was Prime Minister and he kept me as supernumerary minister as Mentor. In other words, I cannot give any direction to any ministry or any minister, I can only mentor them. They are using me as a data bank."<br><br>But Mr Lee made it clear he would shudder to be a mentor to any other government elsewhere. - CNA/ch<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has a great education system . You can't deny it. Look at the education system and society . Most Singaporeans are robotic. The equation of success = degree = money<br><br>Not many people have deviated from that aspect , let alone from textbooks- and when we talk about deviating - in Singapore, even social deviation is a rare occurance as well.<br><br>The education system has succeeded to the point where people want a degree , not because they are interested in pursuing the subject , but because they need it for the great paper chase in order to fit into that equation of success.<br><br>So great at education Singapore is , and most Singaporean students are absolutely the best at regurgitation of the standard education curriculum. Getting A-s are so common nowadays - it is not funny. Students are programmed to get A-s or risk failure at the grand Singaporean equation of success.<br><br>However Singapore has not produced any internationally ground breaking research or theories despite its great education ranking. The only real  industry that came out of Singapore into the international pedestal was  a brain child of  Sim Wong Hoo who was a poly graduate - which now a few elitist JC students will look down on if he was a poly graduate in our current day and age.<br><br>If you look at internationally successful people who did not depend on their family's connection to get them through to their current day status, they all failed at some point of their lives. They picked themselves up and try again until they succeed.  It is , alas , not the way of Singapore. We are not taught to fail. We are taught to play it safe with textbooks and rote learning with the goal of passing our exams with high marks to ensure a productive future ahead of us. Failure is unacceptable and failure means that it is the end of the road for many in Singapore. No second chances.<br><br>Singapore produces alot of great students which will become great followers but not many great thinkers or leaders of our time. Ask yourself why they send the brightest out with scholarships into top American Universities or English Universities and not offer them a scholarship at the local universities.<br></div>
