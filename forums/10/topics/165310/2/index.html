            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by skyline63:</div><div class="quote_body">Bus fare so high ! </div></blockquote>in my opinion, the public transport scene has evolved signficantly over the last decade or so because of the MRT.  the bus is no longer the primary mode of transport for many people and its role will only diminish with time as MRT routes expand.  thus, the economy of scale that the bus company once enjoyed will diminish and with it escalating costs.<br><br>at the same time, bus companies have become mercenary, self-serving entities no longer devoted to public service.  the double pressures of a shrinking pie and a greater need to squeeze the bottomline can only mean that they charge more for less ...<br><br>to fundamentally overcome this situation, i think there is a need to relook the role of buses in the future of singapore's transport system.  it may be better that some other transport medium be used to complement the MRT as a means of bridging the short distance between home and MRT.  we can have better amenities for bicycles or roller blades or that segweg thing provided it can be made inexpensive ... or even tut tuts that are so prevalent in Thailand.<br><br>in addition, rather than buy expensive buses from Europe and paying double for the exchange rate, why not collaborate with Thailand to have our own buses produced in Thailand?  Thailand is now an automotive hub with a strong engineering base.  it would be win win for both of us ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my main contention is this.  our bus services are monopolies.  monopolies have a tendency to take consumers for granted and to request for fare hikes as they deem fit.  there is no alternative for the consumer but to except these increases.  if they truly believe they're doing a hell of a fantastic job better than anybody else then open up the competition and level the playing field.  if we have a choice, we wouldn't have to debate here would we?  we would simply walk away.<br><br>monopoly breeds complacency and the ignorance of various means for improvement like sourcing for cheaper buses.<br><br>ultimately, i feel that public transportation cannot compare with individual transportation.  if one can help, would one stop at every bus stop?  wait 15 minutes for a stupid bus that often bunch together so that missing one bus means missing two?  would one be contented with the long bus journeys?  how much precious time have we wasted?  would a minister who doesn't take buses and who gets to have traffic stopped for him understand those inconveniences?<br><br>in my opinion, short distance travel between home and MRT ought to be better performed by ourselves, provided there are adequate amenities like bicycle ways and lockers ...</div>
