            <div class='col-md body'>We can afford to live in $200k - $400k flats, own $60k - $100k cars, have airconditioning in most homes. We go shopping so often, it's so crowded. We eat such good food that our top 10 diseases are all "rich men disease".<br><br>I believe government is helping, but not spoon-feeding. If the government is not helping, then good luck to all of us. Live in another country before you comment. Here's what I mean:<br><br>In many countries I've been to, they are encouraged to work 2 jobs, and each job's shift is relatively short. They have strong union groups who rally against the government, thus having shorter working hours, more benefits, and more time to spend with family. The result is less pay (of course), higher taxes (50% income tax), social problems (because people have too much time on their hands, sometimes can't be bothered to look for 2nd job) and the hardworking ones become discriminated.<br><br>Not to mention that Singapore is a small island. East to West only 40km. It's normal when working in another country that you probably travel to another state to work (just like having 1 job in Woodlands, another job in JB). So, really, with the high standard of living that we have now, we shouldn't complain at all.<br><br>No system is perfect. I'd rather think of a solution than complain that our government is not efficient. Do you have a solution?</div>

He also hinted that we should delay our personal gratification until we achieve better financial freedom. But he too warned that we shouldn't be living like a cheap.<br><br>I do agree with u that the ruling party, with the help of the public media which it controls, has encouraged the pursuit of materialism. We have been so indoctrinated that we tend to measure success with material well being - the type of house we live in, the type of car we drive, the kind of holiday we take, etc.<br><br>However, recently the ruling party has belatedly but half-heartedly tried to educate us on the importance of financial planning.
