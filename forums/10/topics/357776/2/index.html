              arithmetic rate and population growth increases at a geometric
              rate, the world will starve itself to death (n.b this was in the

              <p>your problem of climate change -&gt;&gt; climate change remains
              a very dismal science and there's a lot of conflicting evidences.
              as such it wouldn't validate your statement as it being a very very
              serious problem at least until it can be proven without a doubt
              that climate change is really really a bad thing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the underlying point is that technology is, and can be improved,
              to solve, if not elevate, these major problems that worries you. at
              the end of the day, a benefit here is a cost there so think about
              what you'd be willing to give up if you really want to save the
              world.</p>

              <p>and neither does it say that self-correction isn't happening q:</p>
              <p>unless of course you're talking about public goods (like fishing) then we have market failure all together.</p>
              <p>actually, when i said starvation is in itself self-correcting, i was referring to hunger, not population explosion; if the hungry starve to death then wouldn't there be less, if not none, world hunger?</p>
              <p>with reference of exporting pollution causing industries, i think it's evident that the benefits more than make up for the costs. but once you start going into the long run with "life will bite our children back where it hurts", everything starts to go sideways; assuming things don't change then yes perhaps that could happen. but it would be erroneous to assume that any one variable can remain constant in the long run.</p>
              <p>in terms of population explosion, we can turn to technology again for answers; sure it doesn't solve all the problems but it'll elevate some of it.</p>
              <p>as always a benefit here is a cost there and it all boils down to how much people are willing to pay to have less benefit (for less cost).</p>

              <p>your problem of depletion of resources -&gt;&gt; the same way thomas malthus predicted that since food increases at an arithmetic rate and population growth increases at a geometric rate, the world will starve itself to death (n.b this was in the 18th century) </p>
              <p>your problem of world hungry -&gt;&gt; maybe you haven't heard of the green revolution, but it's introduction to developing countries have help elevated part of the problem</p>
              <p>your problem of climate change -&gt;&gt; climate change remains a very dismal science and there's a lot of conflicting evidences. as such it wouldn't validate your statement as it being a very very serious problem at least until it can be proven without a doubt that climate change is really really a bad thing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the underlying point is that technology is, and can be improved, to solve, if not elevate, these major problems that worries you. at the end of the day, a benefit here is a cost there so think about what you'd be willing to give up if you really want to save the world.</p>

              <p><br>The problem is not whether 9 billion is the real threshold for population growth, the question is when are we going to realise the moment we hit the threshold ? Should we even wait for that threshold to be reached before we do anything about it?</p>
              <p>The Green Revolution can be viewed in two ways, yes it saved us and allowed us to expand our population twice fold (by 3billion+) or it could actually set us up for a much harder fall (7-8 billion starving compared to 3.5 billion starving)</p>
              <p>Population growth can only be sustained through infrastructure building supported by increasing resource production. That means when we finally hit that peak resource production the progressing years are going to be filled with more and more suffering as the system struggles to support the population on even less resources.</p>
              <p>We are NOT running out of resource per say but we are hitting a production plateau, where each new discoveries is going to cost more manpower and energy to extract.</p>
              <p>Instead of digging 100 feet in the barren desert and oil will gush out on its own we need to build gigantic rigs to tow over to established oil reserves in the deep sea to extract. Instead of digging on exposed coal seams we have to dig gigantic holes in the ground to get it.   </p>
              <p>THAT is the problem. Energy is only a small factor in the whole equation of the human population problem. We still need mineral resources/wood to build our infrastructures, petroleum is still needed for chemical processes even if we don't use it for energy.</p>
              <p>There's a very good reason why countries like China have to resort to draconian population control, even India and Pakistan is already trying to curb their population growth and Bagladash is already having a lot of social problems with their population growth.</p>
              <p>Any new technology we developed now to delay the core problem would be harder and harder to implement because of the huge population involved and the increasingly shrinking pool of technicans capable of implement the complex infrastructure capable of supporting that technology.</p>
              <p>The point is when we DO hit the limit, immense suffering would follow almost immediately. Are we going to wait till then before we start regretting it or start doing something now?</p>

              <p>Resources are limited while world population are bulging. Technology can help recycle resources for human usage for instances but technology still has limitation. The over-population can be solved through implementing policies and using technology such as allocation of human population to other planet's settlement and implementing world-wide population control.</p>

People can be bombarded by suggestive advertisment on TV/radio/magazine to buy a certain product on the TVs that promise youth, happiness, beauty and statue. The more one consume, the more one has to earn an up keep or look for another sources of income to uphold their living.</p>

              <p>I really find the things we worry about in Singapore laughable compared to the problems that would face the world if there are no mindset changes.</p>

              <p>Resources are limited while world population are bulging. Technology can help recycle resources for human usage for instances but technology still has limitation. The over-population can be solved through implementing policies and using technology such as allocation of human population to other planet's settlement and implementing world-wide population control.</p>
              <p>The majority of the population issues are largely concentrated in certain parts of world. I do think one can adminstrate population control in certain parts of the world properly.</p>
              <p>In other developing and war-torn countries, i'm not too sure if they are currently facing a major over-population issues.</p>

              <p>Problem is recycling is hardly a 100% exchange. I won't get the 100% of metal/paper/rubber back from recycling. So it just delays the problem, but not really a world changing one.</p>
              <p>The problem i think is increased consumption. We blame the media/PAP/Satan for always being unsatisfied with what we have but it is a biological need rather than a spiritual one. Happiness is how the brain rewards us when we fulfill the evolutionary imperative to breed and multiply (By getting better physical assets, better clothes, cash, plastic surgery to attract mates).</p>
              <p>The solution to the resource constraint problem is a multi faceted one. There is no single magical solution. Population control alone is too slow and negliable if the 1st World does not learn to reduce our consumption rate. America alone consumes 4 times the energy, 3 times the water, twice the rubbish than the worldwide average.    </p>
              <p>The problem is how much the 1st World is consuming, not how much the growing population in the 3rd World is consuming. But as the 3rd world population increases, their governments would have no choice but to either</p>
              <p>1)starve their population</p>
              <p>2) keep the products to feed their own</p>
              <p>Now we know why the Americans favour corrupted regimes and overthrow nationalist/socialist ones. But we, even in Singapore support this indirectly through our love for cheap products.</p>
              <p>Even space colonization to obtain resources is going to be impossible considering the amount you need to put into keep a huge population happy enough not to attempt any uprising.</p>
              <p>Building an infrastructure on Earth to support one million is easy but supporting one in orbit or on the moon is going to harder due to water and air constraints (And in direct relation - food)    </p>

              <p>Ice Dive, the issues that i pointed out in the first page require either all of men to work together to solve...or can never be solved. The first option is out obviously.</p>

              <p>I'm looking at the most prevailing system of our era -- the economy system which is also inherently flaw. Most people are driven and stressed up by the economy system. People can be bombarded by suggestive advertisment on TV/radio/magazine to buy a certain product on the TVs that promise youth, happiness, beauty and statue. The more one consume, the more one has to earn an up keep or look for another sources of income to uphold their living.</p>

              <p>Well, that is how the economy get churned, you want stagnatisation, migrate to North Korea. Spend and earn is the way the world had evolved since early men times, for them is hungry and hunt, the more they are able to hunt, the more the women like him and the more he will be the chief. Same here, the more your earning power, the more women will come to you, including me, and the more powerful you are, and most importantly, when you talks, thousands if not millions listen. People like you talks, only I listen.</p>

              <p>Actually yes, switching off your electrical appliances and running water sources as much as you can is always good. Even if you dont believe in conservation the reduced utilities bill would be a plus.</p>
              <p>Other things I do are stick to a vegetarian diet as much as I can (got sold on this in army when the vegetarian food at the cookhouse beats the normal chinese : p) and cut down on my driving about 90% from the period that I just got the license. probably only once a month now.</p>
              <p>But I pretty much cut the line there. Not gonna form some green awareness group or whatever. But sometimes fantasize about joining greenpeace and doing dumb things like sneaking onboard whalers and shark hunters ships and sabotaging them in my wild dreams.</p>
