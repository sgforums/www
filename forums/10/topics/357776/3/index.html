              <p>Actually yes, switching off your electrical appliances and running water sources as much as you can is always good. Even if you dont believe in conservation the reduced utilities bill would be a plus.</p>
              <p>Other things I do are stick to a vegetarian diet as much as I can (got sold on this in army when the vegetarian food at the cookhouse beats the normal chinese : p) and cut down on my driving about 90% from the period that I just got the license. probably only once a month now.</p>
              <p>But I pretty much cut the line there. Not gonna form some green awareness group or whatever. But sometimes fantasize about joining greenpeace and doing dumb things like sneaking onboard whalers and shark hunters ships and sabotaging them in my wild dreams.</p>

              <p>I tried 2 foolish things before </p>
              <p>1) I thought of coming up with a house hold recycle bin to separate waste and make it easy to carry to recycling centre. Even shopped around with friends for the materials , then I heard someone in australia did that also but it does not seem to be a big thing. </p>
              <p>2) I thought of having a central circuit breaker so that it become a one stop place to shutdown power of useless things that we do not use when we go to sleep . Studied the thing but do not know how to implement .. haha .. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I heard a friend's friend got a solar powered battery pack at home which is used to power computer . But I do not know how it works and my friend does not want to intro me to the person. Cool ah ... </p>

              <p>The problem with these alternatives is that they can only replace what our energy usage <strong>at best</strong>. And the energy invested for extracting energy would not be as easy as fossil fuels</p>
              <p>We are not going to see the sort of explosion in growth like the past century, that's the result of the Golden Age of Oil.</p>
              <p>We are not, i believe going to be able to retire by 50-60 the same way our parents and grandparents could do. And we're going to see alot more recessions and market crashes because the economic system is built on the belief that we could continue the same sort of growth we did the century before and it would take time and fine adjustments to fix it.</p>

              Bah if men couldn't control their primal instinct to dominate others, there would certainly be wars.
                                                  
                                                  Wars are not due to differences but are due because an elite group inability to control their primal instinct to dominate others.

              <p>Hi forummers,</p>
              <p>I feel that religion will be forever a sensitive topic.</p>
              <p>Let me illustrate with a simple example:</p>
              <p>Ah Hong G is a very serious believer of Religion C.</p>
              <p>Ah Kang is a very serious believer of Religion I.</p>
              <p>So, here we see 2 believers of 2 different religions.</p>
              <p>Each am convinced his religion is the only real thing in this universe.</p>
              <p>They could not understand why other religion believers could not accept his religion which to him, it is so clear that is the only truth. so good so wonderful.</p>
              <p>Now, who is correct?</p>
              <p>Now, is there no potential for Friction ? disagreement?</p>
              <p>So, while both may have good intentions, their thinking is the same but in exactly the opposite way.</p>
