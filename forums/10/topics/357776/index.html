              <p>
              </p><p>In the history of humankind, man has always been divided along 3 major lines.</p>
              <p>1) Wealth and Status</p>
              <p>2) Political systems and States</p>
              <p>3) Race and Religion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Wealth and Status.</p>
              <p>Clear examples would be caste systems ( aristocrats &gt; clergy &gt; commoners etc), exclusive institutions (private health care, expensive schools, clubs), social groups (millionaires, socialites, car-owners, elites in SG etc).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Political Systems and States</p>
              <p>This is easy to see. We have communists, socialists, republicans, democrats, libertarians, etc. We have Russians, Chinese, Iraqis, Armenians, New Zealands, etc. Results in things like Cold War, Vietnam War, Korean War; where opposing parties are socially, culturally and historically similar but separated by "countries" or "political systems"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) race and religion</p>
              <p>Not much to elaborate on. Results in things like the Christian crusades of the Middle ages, Nazi purging on Jews, even Muslims killing Muslims ( sunni vs shia in middle east), racial riots in Singapore in the 50s etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My hypothesis: Men cannot survive as long as there exist any differences within them. I don't know how man can eliminate all these social constructions that divide us, but we have to do it (Heck it's not enough to be blind to skin colour, trust me men will still find faults with each other; we must all have the same skin colour but it seems impossible?). I believe only a utopian socialistic world build on common interests, universal brotherhood and scientific advancement will survive into the 22nd century.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The major challenges facing Man, which requires us to band together to solve:</p>
              <p>1) population explosion. The earth cannot support the 9 billion projected population that will be reached by 2050.</p>
              <p>2) extensive ecological damage. Endangered species, formation of growing dead zones in the oceans where nothing can survive because overfishing has destroyed the food chain, etc.</p>
              <p>3) climate change</p>
              <p>4) world hunger. 750 million go hungry everyday. Doesn't include the millions whose families get by with just a few dollars a day.</p>
              <p>5) depletion of natural resources</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will we do it? I think man will never learn; will never give up his god, his car, his human rights, his country, his family, his money. I predict at least a major war by the end of my life.</p>

              technology will remain what it is for the next 40 years, which will
              hardly be the case unless something severe enough to move mankind
              backwards a couple centuries happens.</p>
              <p>frankly speaking, people should be focusing on the problems now
              instead of clamouring over projected problems; if you can't solve
              your problems now, don't count on solving anything in the
              future.</p>

              Children produced from incest are rumored to be less intelligent as

              <p>im just saying that the majority of social constructs should be given up. not your hobbies or passions or sex. feel free to go wild heh. cant a man define himself by his achievements or interests other than race or age? :p</p>
              <p>see wikipedia for a definition on social constructs. i think in a laymen definition, they refer to things that only exist because of mens' definitions and beliefs. religion is an obvious example. other more subtle and useful human constructs are things like the definitions of magnetic susceptibility and electric permittivity of a vacuum etc</p>

              <p>The next is the religious. It became fashionable in Western
              Civilization, particularly in the last hundred years, to be scornful of
              religion. But it is a fact that human beings have religious needs. They
              have a need for a feeling of certitude in their minds about things they
              cannot control and they do not fully understand, and with humility,
              they will admit they do not understand them. When you destroy people's
              religious expression, they will establish secularised religions like
              Marxism.</p>
              <p>The very idea that there is some kind of conflict between science and
              religion is completely mistaken. Science is a method for investigating
              experience, and religion is something quite different. Religion is the
              fundamental, necessary  internalisation of our system of more permanent
              values.</p>

              <p>your problem of depletion of resources -&gt;&gt; the same way thomas malthus predicted that since food increases at an arithmetic rate and population growth increases at a geometric rate, the world will starve itself to death (n.b this was in the 18th century) </p>
              <p>your problem of world hungry -&gt;&gt; maybe you haven't heard of the green revolution, but it's introduction to developing countries have help elevated part of the problem</p>
              <p>your problem of climate change -&gt;&gt; climate change remains a very dismal science and there's a lot of conflicting evidences. as such it wouldn't validate your statement as it being a very very serious problem at least until it can be proven without a doubt that climate change is really really a bad thing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the underlying point is that technology is, and can be improved, to solve, if not elevate, these major problems that worries you. at the end of the day, a benefit here is a cost there so think about what you'd be willing to give up if you really want to save the world.</p>
