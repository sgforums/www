Consequently, the frequency and duration of sessions are often reduced.<br><strong>It is timely to review the therapist-children ratio and decrease the number of cases per therapist, to help boost the duration and frequency of the sessions.<br>Therapy services are in high demand in institutions serving children with special needs as well as in the private market. This adversely influences the cost of such services.</strong><br>Children with special needs receive education and support not only in special education schools from the age of seven, but a good number of those below age seven are also supported in the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children. Also, there are a fair number of children with special needs in mainstream schools.<br>When the available care options are scarce and limited in these institutions, including the VWOs, parents are compelled to look for alternative sources of professional care in the private market.<br><strong>With the limited pool of therapists in Singapore and with caps on the inflow of foreign talent, lateral thinking with innovative strategies is very much needed.</strong><br>Another evolving trend is the growing demand for special student care centres for children with special needs. These centres provide care and enrichment services to the children, enabling their parents to go to work with peace of mind.<br>These centres may also address the additional therapy needs of children with special needs through holistic care with therapeutic inputs.<br>Tim Oei<br>Chief Executive Officer<br>Asian Women's Welfare Association<br>Copyright © 2014 Singapore Press Holdings.
