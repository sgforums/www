Which makes it more annoying. For example, a friend, who is conversant in mandarin, applied for a mechanical technician job with his friend, a chinese guy. They both just graduated from the mechatronics course in TP and my friend even had the better grades. However, the Chinese friend was the one who got the job while my friend had to wait another 6 months before getting a job.<br><br></div></blockquote>better grade so wat ? maybe you fren's fren did better in the interview or have other qualities that employer want ? dun start making racist accusations.</div>

To counter such measures. That is why we still complain, because it makes no difference if you can speak mandarin fluently because they simply want their own race in that company.<br><br><strong>2.

What about other countries such as the USA? Or to a lesser extent, say, the Phillipines? Do they not trade with China? Do they seek Chinese people who understands Chinese culture to deal with China just so they could "appreciate" the "cultural nuances" of Chinese business dealings? Anyway, many Chinese Singaporeans these days have been accused of "forgetting their roots". Some even blatantly distance themselves from being associated with mainland Chinese. So do all Chinese Singaporeans "appreciate" the "cultural nuances" of mainland Chinese?

They are highly productive, fast paced and take work very seriously.<br></strong><br><br>So are you saying other races are not "hardworking, resourceful and resilient people"? The Americans are not hardworking? The Europeans are not resourceful? Heck, the Indians are not resilient??

            <div class='col-md body'>Hence, as mentioned before, it's blatant racism. The only other way to go around this would be to make the companies more transparent. However, that will add up advertising costs and I'm sure nobody will back that. So, with that, it seems we minorities are destined to be trapped in the cycle of poverty with the unlikely chance of breaking out of it. Why? Because it is widely accepted and tolerated.
