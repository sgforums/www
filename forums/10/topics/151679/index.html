            <div class='col-md body'>actually they are looking for chinese only...<br><br>NOt that they wanted to be racist (especially when u r gg thru job agencies) but it's the criteria that the HR set.  And they can't put out in the ad that they want chinese only, as it is not allowed by law.  It is also not allowed to list out you want males or females, so they can only put 'females working environment' n hope that u get the hint.  And also not allowed to state the age range oso...<br><br>So you hv to b understanding..... not that they r making you waste ur time.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Speak Chinese Only<br>2) Chinese Only<br><br>Equals to a crock of bullshit.<br><br>There are guidelines, DOs and DON'Ts, for employers, but time and again, we come across employment requirements with way too much racism. Does this tells us that employers are listening to our Government? Doubt so.<br><br>I know that there are companies out there, who will ONLY hire chinese people who only speaks, and or communicates in Mandarin. As such, I propose that stringent reguations and penalties be put in place, to curb the multiplication of these individualistic companies.<br><br>Singapore is NOT like China. Most of us "chinese" or rather, asians, are Straits borne. We may have roots way back in or from China and Hong Kong, but we're typically Singaporean. I don't imply or boast that I possess a good command of the English language. But I am Chinese, Teochew as a dialect, and am partially Peranakan. So what they HECK!<br><br>Here's an example of an organisation that employs people who largely speaks Mandarin, Stamford Tyres. When I called to enquire about a certain product, the receptionist simply says there's no one here who can speak English, therefore instructed me to get someone who can to make the enquiry!

Which is a problem when what you think is right is not so right in the wisdom of Chinese, which means you probably won't go far in the job.<br><br>But if it's part time, it all depends on the nature of the job. Are you going to handle Chinese market? If so, you must think Chinese as well.<br><br>It's not the same as English, because Chinese as a language requires a certain cultural wisdom behind it. Which is why Chinese who speaks good English generally survives well outside China but foreigners who speaks Chinese often don't go relatively as well, especially Singaporean non-chinese.<br><br>Put yourself in the shoe of a boss, you have a very good chinese candidate with good potential, but without that basis behind, would you even recognise that potential? Most probably both are wasting the others' time.</div>
