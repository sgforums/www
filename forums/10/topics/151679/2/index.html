And there are a huge group of mainland chinese who do not process such heritage themselves being victims of the cultural revolutions and the subsequent money-only mentality. But in comparison, our Chinese generally lose out to the mainland Chinese in the wisdom compartment.<br><br>It's as if getting a guy to sell bras where the targetted market is woman... often requiring services/enquiries over the bras and their... breasts.

            <div class='col-md body'>my friend running a computer shop told me that now he has to deal with his customers in mandarin more often than before, especially in retail service. More chinese softwares are used  now than before, educational software, translation software, chinese words softwares and even games software. You can't explain to these customers in english, using english computer terms!!<br><br>In small business sectors, many medical halls are using computers with chinese software and it is a niche market for my friend who can handle computers in mandarin.<br><br>If this were my business, I would employ a chinese! This is not racism or discrimination.<br><br>If your chinese is really so good as to be able to handle computer trouble shooting and handle customers in chinese, then it is the company that has missed the opportunity to employ a good and capable guy.</div>

If Jeq is going to be sent to China with everything that Ang Moh could as you claimed, that's one thing.<br><br>But when he called for a part time, or a full time job with most of the local employers who are really not in the appetitide for huge gamble or for people for specific work scope, that's another thing altogether.<br><br>There is no promoting of racism here.

That's what most of the minorities are doing. And their reward for that? "Sorry, position's already been taken up." See, for your ignorant mind's information, we minorities have been consistently discriminated no matter how hard we try to break out of the cycle. We study hard, get good degrees, heck, as YOU suggest, learnt mandarin. Some of us have tried so goddamn hard to conform to YOUR rules and procedures. But in the end, does it all matter? Not when the root of this is blatant racism. Ever wondered why minorities are rarely found to be successful? This is why. Opportunities limited. So not only are we subjected to stereotypes, preventive barriers are put up so that we stay in the poverty cycle that most of us are in and be stereoyped for eternity. So before you rebuke anyone for whining and not trying, please think again. Carefully.</div>
