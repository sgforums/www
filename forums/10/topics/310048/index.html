              <p><strong></strong><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: maroon;">INTERVIEW</span></strong><br> <strong>Anwar Ibrahim</strong><br> <span style="color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>Anwar to Abdullah: It's nothing personal</strong></span><br> By Ioannis Gatsiounis
                  																	<br> <br> KUALA LUMPUR - It has been a decade since Anwar Ibrahim has held political 
                  																	office, and yet the opposition politician remains the ruling government's 
                  																	biggest concern as Malaysia readies itself for parliamentary elections. Prime 
                  																	Minister Abdullah Badawi called the snap polls for March 8, a month before a 
                  																	politically motivated corruption conviction which bars Anwar from politics 
                  																	officially ends.
                  																	<br> <br> The former Islamic youth leader and deputy premier has since his release from 
                  																	prison in 2004 refashioned his political image as a pious crusader for social 
                  																	justice and racial equality. Although he cannot run in the upcoming polls, he 
                  																	nonetheless is seen as the unifying figure for a disparate group of opposition 
                  																	parties, which
                  					 include the Islamist party known as PAS, the Chinese-based and secular 
                  																	Democratic Action Party (DAP) and his own multi-religious and multiracial 
                  																	People's Justice Party (PKR).
                  																	<br> <br> Anwar's critics contend that he changes his tune depending on the audience he 
                  																	is addressing - a charge the veteran politician denies. Yet a poor showing by 
                  																	the opposition on Saturday may well force Anwar to rethink his strategies - if 
                  																	not his political future.
                  																	<br> <br> In a wide-ranging interview, Anwar addresses the many challenges Malaysia faces 
                  																	and calls on the electorate to vote for change.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Asia Times Online:</strong></em> What do you see as wrong with Malaysia?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>Anwar Ibrahim:</strong></em> Now we're seeing more anger. The Indians are 
                  																	enraged because of perceived discrimination and demolition of temples. It's 
                  																	widespread throughout the country. And among the Chinese there's a perception 
                  																	that the discriminatory policies have gone a bit too far to enrich the few at 
                  																	their expense.
                  																	<br> <br> So this is the basic problem. The government's failure, due to incompetence and 
                  																	poor leadership, has affected them aversely. And the state of our economy: we 
                  																	rely to a large extent on [foreign direct investments] ... and we have lost 
                  																	that. We have lost our competitiveness; we have lost out to our neighbors.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> The Chinese and Indian communities have voiced their 
                  																	frustration about a number of government policies, but over the years most have 
                  																	continued to support the Barisan Nasional-led ruling coalition. Do you foresee 
                  																	a change at the upcoming polls?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Well, I see change because I think [the government has] 
                  																	crossed the line. For example, we have seen the destruction of [Hindu] temples, 
                  																	the issue of permits, or building bylaws. This is the first time we have seen a 
                  																	100-year-old temple demolished. Nothing has been done to address the legitimate 
                  																	grievances of the Indian community: poverty, unemployment, housing, crime.
                  																	<br> <br> And among the Chinese, when the economy becomes more sluggish, then they of 
                  																	course will attach blame to poor governance and the [affirmative action] New 
                  																	Economic Policy. And then how does the government respond? Of course, 
                  																	brandishing the <em>keris</em> [traditional Malay dagger] towards minority groups 
                  																	becomes very symbolic. It's virtually a threat. They change the language ... of 
                  																	instruction [to Malay] for math and science in Chinese schools.
                  																	<br> <br> So I think unlike previous elections, the Chinese and the Indians have 
                  																	virtually made a clear shift. Normally Malaysians maintain their decorum and 
                  																	are quite polite. But now you see ministers going and being booed, which is 
                  																	unheard of.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Why vote for your PKR party? What can you and your party 
                  																	bring to the people that the BN [Barisan Nasional] has not?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> First is the issue of governance. We have made it very clear 
                  																	that constitutional guarantees must be protected, which means we respect the 
                  																	Malay majority [and] Islam as the religion of the federation. But the 
                  																	constitution also guarantees freedom of conscience, religion and expression. 
                  																	The rights of non-Malays in terms of language and culture must be respected.
                  																	<br> <br> Second and very critical is our Malaysia Economic Agenda. We've crafted our 
                  																	agenda in a way that will make us more competitive and attract investment - but 
                  																	not at the expense of the Malay community. Even in areas where you need to have 
                  																	affirmative action, it will not be based on race: affirmative action for the 
                  																	marginalized, for the poor irrespective of race.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> There is a great deal of indignation among the Chinese, 
                  																	having been victim to discriminatory policies for so long. Isn't there a 
                  																	legitimate fear among Malays that if you scrap the New Economic Policy, the 
                  																	Chinese would pursue their personal and community interests at the expense of 
                  																	the Malays?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> There is, I agree. I have crafted the Malaysian Economic 
                  																	Agenda for more than a year now. There is no free media. So therefore we have 
                  																	to publish half a million pamphlets so people can understand. It will not be at 
                  																	the expense of the Malays, because it is affirmative action to protect the 
                  																	interest of the majority of the poor and marginalized, which means you do away 
                  																	with the 30% [ethnic Malay ownership] control [requirement for local] 
                  																	companies. We would take RM10 billion [US$3.1 billion] for quality education, 
                  																	so the majority of the funds would still go to the Malays.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> But what is it about the policy that guarantees protection 
                  																	for the Malays?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> If I have 10 billion ringgit to spend for education or 
                  																	whatever, do I then give contracts or construction away to 20 Malay families? 
                  																	Or do I allocate these resources to all poor Malaysians, irrespective of race? 
                  																	Now, 80% of [state] funds go to [only] a million Malays.
                  																	<br> <br> But then the funds will also be able to be absorbed by the Chinese and Indians 
                  																	- the deserving ones. And the Malays would actually benefit more than they do 
                  																	now. But there has been incessant propaganda for the last three decades that 
                  																	our [Malay] survival would depend only on the New Economic Policy.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> What is the party, and more broadly the opposition, doing 
                  																	differently this time around from the 2004 elections? What lessons have been 
                  																	learned and how have you re-tooled and re-strategized?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> One is to work together; one opposition candidate versus the 
                  																	BN. Second is to address issues clearly to the public. We can talk about 
                  																	independent judiciary, free media, freedom of conscience, constitutional 
                  																	guarantees. But you have to articulate these issues in clear terms.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> But in the past the opposition has raised these issues 
                  																	without sufficiently articulating the consequences. Are the consequences being 
                  																	articulated? In other words I could say the BN is corrupt but unless you're 
                  																	conveying to the people the consequences of that corruption, the message runs 
                  																	the risk of getting lost.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> That's right. When our speakers talk they must not just talk 
                  																	about an independent judiciary. You talk about how corruption has led to cases 
                  																	being determined at the expense of the people ... which means the poor suffer. 
                  																	Or, on the issue of price increases, why is it that Malaysia is the [world's] 
                  																	largest producer of oil palm and still [there isn't] enough in their 
                  																	supermarkets? Is it because you protect the cartels? You don't even allocate 2% 
                  																	to benefit the poor. So you have to articulate it in a way people can 
                  																	understand.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Some people have charged that you're not a genuine 
                  																	reformer. How has your time in the political wilderness changed you?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Well, of course, it's a time to meditate and reflect and 
                  																	read. But for me it should be done from our programs and actions ... Because I 
                  																	think that even in my time in government, you talk about public housing 
                  																	programs, you talk about toll increases - I could defend my record ... Why is 
                  																	it when I go to the low-cost housing areas like Kampong Kerinchi I have huge 
                  																	support? They know that I was the last bastion for effective programs by the 
                  																	government for the poor when I was minister.
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> How have you changed your ideas about governing and the 
                  																	direction of the country since you were last in office?
                  																	<br> <br> <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Well, I think you mature. And I think globalization and the 
                  																	changing environment would dictate - demand - that you also
                  																	adapt accordingly. Your 
                                                understanding of the policies or the economy, your 
                                                assumptions that you can decouple easily, knowing 
                                                that it's not realistic. <br><br>Okay, I'm very 
                                                passionate about working with and helping the 
                                                poor. [But] you realize that without growth and 
                                                competitiveness, you will not have the resources, 
                                                which means you have to have a market-friendly 
                                                economy and other things - reforms - before you 
                                                can assist and elevate the living conditions of 
                                                the poor ... I think [the government] has failed 
                                                on both counts, attempting to propel the economy 
                                                but ignoring the plight of the poor.</p>
              <p><em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> You are now 
                                                articulating a much more democratic agenda than 
                                                what you did when you were in the United Malays 
                                                Nasional Organization (UMNO)-led government. Did 
                                                you have some epiphany that democratic principles 
                                                are important for development? 
                                                <br><br><em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Of course you can 
                                                articulate your position more freely now. But if 
                                                you look at my position - freedom of democracy and 
                                                empowerment and support for an independent 
                                                judiciary are there. So I don't think it's quite 
                                                correct to suggest that these are only thoughts 
                                                [I'm having] now. But then you articulate, you 
                                                craft in a different manner, because of the 
                                                constraints of the media. 
                                                <br><br><em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> A letter writer to a 
                                                politics and culture website recently commented 
                                                that your "faction within UMNO was remembered 
                                                [even] by UMNO members as one of the most 
                                                aggressive ... and deeply feared". How do you 
                                                respond? <br><br><em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Aggressive, 
                                                yes. We were looking to achieve reform. For 
                                                instance, I introduced this anti-corruption bill. 
                                                It was immensely unpopular among the UMNO leaders. 
                                                Not [just] UMNO supporters, but ministers for that 
                                                matter ... I looked at the Hong Kong Independent 
                                                Commission Against Corruption. There's a provision

                                                years in office - that you benefited while you 
                                                were in power - they can go after you. That 
                                                provision was strongly opposed to. 
                                                <br><br><em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> I think, though, what 
                                                the letter writer meant by "aggressive" was 
                                                intimidating. <br><br><em><strong>AI:</strong></em> That's the 
                                                first time I'm hearing this. I was [part of] the 
                                                more liberal wing of the government. It's quite 
                                                known. For example, I engaged the Bar Council at 
                                                the time [former premier] Mahathir [Mohamad] was 
                                                fighting [them]. When there was a huge protest 
                                                over the Baku dam, I allowed them to come in and 
                                                discussed it with them. When the draft bill was 
                                                tabled in cabinet, I faxed the draft to the 
                                                opposition leader the moment I got it, which had 
                                                never happened in the past. 
                                                <br><br><em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Some people say Islam 
                                                has begun to play too central a role in Malaysian 
                                                life. Do you agree and what would you do to revise 
                                                matters? <br><br><em><strong>AI:</strong></em> It depends on 
                                                how you perceive this. The super-liberal wing of 
                                                the public would want to have nothing to do with 
                                                Islam. And you have an extremely conservative wing 
                                                that wants to dictate. So I don't share either 
                                                view. But then we have to sort it out. <br><br>You 
                                                have to engage them, allow them to articulate 
                                                their views. So I think for a person to suggest in 
                                                Malaysia - to deny the role of religion and Islam 
                                                - I don't share that view. Where I think we draw 
                                                the line is when it comes to compelling people, or 
                                                not allowing non-Muslims to use the civil courts. 
                                                That's unheard of in our 50 years. 
                                                <br><br><em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Obviously there is 
                                                increased tension between the races with religion 
                                                playing a part. What as a leader would you do to 
                                                defuse the situation? <br><br><em><strong>AI:</strong></em> I 
                                                am opposed if a group for example wants to compel 
                                                others to Islam, [or] if you apostatize you should 
                                                be shot. And the other view says religion should 
                                                have no role whatsoever; we should do away with 
                                                the religious court. I also disagree with that. I 
                                                think the consensus among Muslims is that the 
                                                sharia court should be confined to Muslim personal 
                                                law and Muslim affairs. <br><br>The problem is 
                                                when you use this legislation to compel ... to 
                                                deny non-Muslims to bring their cases to the civil 
                                                courts, because finally the issue of faith is a 
                                                personal issue. I am a Muslim. I believe in Islam. 
                                                I don't rejoice in hearing that people are leaving 
                                                Islam, but I think finally it is his or her 
                                                personal decision. It is beyond me and I don't 
                                                think we should politicize that further.

                                                incompetence ... He gives a multi-billion ringgit

                                                without tender. He gives a 25 billion ringgit 
                                                development approval for Patrick Lim, his crony in

                                                for them to say I haven't been critical. You say

                                                Abdullah we have been less competitive 
                                                economically, that corruption has become more 
                                                endemic, crime rates have increased - all under 
                                                Abdullah. I have done that, made major criticisms 
                                                of him. But to go [down the road of personal 
                                                attacks], well [Abdullah] sleeps all the time, why 
                                                is he married to this [new foreign wife] Jeanne? I

              Abdullah: It's nothing personal</strong></span><br>

              <br>
              KUALA LUMPUR - It has been a decade since Anwar Ibrahim has held
              political office, and yet the opposition politician remains the
              ruling government's biggest concern as Malaysia readies itself for
              parliamentary elections. Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi called the
              snap polls for March 8, a month before a politically motivated
              corruption conviction which bars Anwar from politics officially
              ends.<br>
              <br>
              The former Islamic youth leader and deputy premier has since his
              release from prison in 2004 refashioned his political image as a
              pious crusader for social justice and racial equality. Although he
              cannot run in the upcoming polls, he nonetheless is seen as the
              unifying figure for a disparate group of opposition parties, which
              include the Islamist party known as PAS, the Chinese-based and
              secular Democratic Action Party (DAP) and his own multi-religious
              and multiracial People's Justice Party (PKR).<br>
              <br>
              Anwar's critics contend that he changes his tune depending on the
              audience he is addressing - a charge the veteran politician denies.
              Yet a poor showing by the opposition on Saturday may well force
              Anwar to rethink his strategies - if not his political
              future.<br>
              <br>
              In a wide-ranging interview, Anwar addresses the many challenges
              Malaysia faces and calls on the electorate to vote for change.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Asia Times Online:</strong></em> What do you see as
              wrong with Malaysia?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>Anwar Ibrahim:</strong></em> Now we're seeing more
              anger. The Indians are enraged because of perceived discrimination
              and demolition of temples. It's widespread throughout the country.
              And among the Chinese there's a perception that the discriminatory
              policies have gone a bit too far to enrich the few at their
              expense.<br>
              <br>
              So this is the basic problem. The government's failure, due to
              incompetence and poor leadership, has affected them aversely. And
              the state of our economy: we rely to a large extent on [foreign
              direct investments] ... and we have lost that. We have lost our
              competitiveness; we have lost out to our neighbors.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> The Chinese and Indian communities
              have voiced their frustration about a number of government
              policies, but over the years most have continued to support the
              Barisan Nasional-led ruling coalition. Do you foresee a change at
              the upcoming polls?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Well, I see change because I think
              [the government has] crossed the line. For example, we have seen
              the destruction of [Hindu] temples, the issue of permits, or
              building bylaws. This is the first time we have seen a 100-year-old
              temple demolished. Nothing has been done to address the legitimate
              grievances of the Indian community: poverty, unemployment, housing,
              crime.<br>
              <br>
              And among the Chinese, when the economy becomes more sluggish, then
              they of course will attach blame to poor governance and the
              [affirmative action] New Economic Policy. And then how does the
              government respond? Of course, brandishing the <em>keris</em>
              [traditional Malay dagger] towards minority groups becomes very
              symbolic. It's virtually a threat. They change the language ... of
              instruction [to Malay] for math and science in Chinese
              schools.<br>
              <br>
              So I think unlike previous elections, the Chinese and the Indians
              have virtually made a clear shift. Normally Malaysians maintain
              their decorum and are quite polite. But now you see ministers going
              and being booed, which is unheard of.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Why vote for your PKR party? What
              can you and your party bring to the people that the BN [Barisan
              Nasional] has not?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> First is the issue of governance. We
              have made it very clear that constitutional guarantees must be
              protected, which means we respect the Malay majority [and] Islam as
              the religion of the federation. But the constitution also
              guarantees freedom of conscience, religion and expression. The
              rights of non-Malays in terms of language and culture must be
              respected.<br>
              <br>
              Second and very critical is our Malaysia Economic Agenda. We've
              crafted our agenda in a way that will make us more competitive and
              attract investment - but not at the expense of the Malay community.
              Even in areas where you need to have affirmative action, it will
              not be based on race: affirmative action for the marginalized, for
              the poor irrespective of race.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> There is a great deal of
              indignation among the Chinese, having been victim to discriminatory
              policies for so long. Isn't there a legitimate fear among Malays
              that if you scrap the New Economic Policy, the Chinese would pursue
              their personal and community interests at the expense of the
              Malays?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> There is, I agree. I have crafted the
              Malaysian Economic Agenda for more than a year now. There is no
              free media. So therefore we have to publish half a million
              pamphlets so people can understand. It will not be at the expense
              of the Malays, because it is affirmative action to protect the
              interest of the majority of the poor and marginalized, which means
              you do away with the 30% [ethnic Malay ownership] control
              [requirement for local] companies. We would take RM10 billion
              [US$3.1 billion] for quality education, so the majority of the
              funds would still go to the Malays.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> But what is it about the policy
              that guarantees protection for the Malays?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> If I have 10 billion ringgit to spend
              for education or whatever, do I then give contracts or construction
              away to 20 Malay families? Or do I allocate these resources to all
              poor Malaysians, irrespective of race? Now, 80% of [state] funds go
              to [only] a million Malays.<br>
              <br>
              But then the funds will also be able to be absorbed by the Chinese
              and Indians - the deserving ones. And the Malays would actually
              benefit more than they do now. But there has been incessant
              propaganda for the last three decades that our [Malay] survival
              would depend only on the New Economic Policy.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> What is the party, and more broadly
              the opposition, doing differently this time around from the 2004
              elections? What lessons have been learned and how have you
              re-tooled and re-strategized?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> One is to work together; one
              opposition candidate versus the BN. Second is to address issues
              clearly to the public. We can talk about independent judiciary,
              free media, freedom of conscience, constitutional guarantees. But
              you have to articulate these issues in clear terms.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> But in the past the opposition has
              raised these issues without sufficiently articulating the
              consequences. Are the consequences being articulated? In other
              words I could say the BN is corrupt but unless you're conveying to
              the people the consequences of that corruption, the message runs
              the risk of getting lost.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> That's right. When our speakers talk
              they must not just talk about an independent judiciary. You talk
              about how corruption has led to cases being determined at the
              expense of the people ... which means the poor suffer. Or, on the
              issue of price increases, why is it that Malaysia is the [world's]
              largest producer of oil palm and still [there isn't] enough in
              their supermarkets? Is it because you protect the cartels? You
              don't even allocate 2% to benefit the poor. So you have to
              articulate it in a way people can understand.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Some people have charged that
              you're not a genuine reformer. How has your time in the political
              wilderness changed you?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Well, of course, it's a time to
              meditate and reflect and read. But for me it should be done from
              our programs and actions ... Because I think that even in my time
              in government, you talk about public housing programs, you talk
              about toll increases - I could defend my record ... Why is it when
              I go to the low-cost housing areas like Kampong Kerinchi I have
              huge support? They know that I was the last bastion for effective
              programs by the government for the poor when I was minister.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> How have you changed your ideas
              about governing and the direction of the country since you were
              last in office?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Well, I think you mature. And I think
              globalization and the changing environment would dictate - demand -
              that you also adapt accordingly. Your understanding of the policies
              or the economy, your assumptions that you can decouple easily,
              knowing that it's not realistic.<br>
              <br>
              Okay, I'm very passionate about working with and helping the poor.
              [But] you realize that without growth and competitiveness, you will
              not have the resources, which means you have to have a
              market-friendly economy and other things - reforms - before you can
              assist and elevate the living conditions of the poor ... I think
              [the government] has failed on both counts, attempting to propel
              the economy but ignoring the plight of the poor.</p>
              <p><em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> You are now articulating a much
              more democratic agenda than what you did when you were in the
              United Malays Nasional Organization (UMNO)-led government. Did you
              have some epiphany that democratic principles are important for
              development?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Of course you can articulate your
              position more freely now. But if you look at my position - freedom
              of democracy and empowerment and support for an independent
              judiciary are there. So I don't think it's quite correct to suggest
              that these are only thoughts [I'm having] now. But then you
              articulate, you craft in a different manner, because of the
              constraints of the media.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> A letter writer to a politics and
              culture website recently commented that your "faction within UMNO
              was remembered [even] by UMNO members as one of the most aggressive
              ... and deeply feared". How do you respond?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> Aggressive, yes. We were looking to
              achieve reform. For instance, I introduced this anti-corruption
              bill. It was immensely unpopular among the UMNO leaders. Not [just]
              UMNO supporters, but ministers for that matter ... I looked at the
              Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption. There's a
              provision that if you are deemed to be corrupt even after 10 years
              in office - that you benefited while you were in power - they can
              go after you. That provision was strongly opposed to.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> I think, though, what the letter
              writer meant by "aggressive" was intimidating.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> That's the first time I'm hearing
              this. I was [part of] the more liberal wing of the government. It's
              quite known. For example, I engaged the Bar Council at the time
              [former premier] Mahathir [Mohamad] was fighting [them]. When there
              was a huge protest over the Baku dam, I allowed them to come in and
              discussed it with them. When the draft bill was tabled in cabinet,
              I faxed the draft to the opposition leader the moment I got it,
              which had never happened in the past.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Some people say Islam has begun to
              play too central a role in Malaysian life. Do you agree and what
              would you do to revise matters?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> It depends on how you perceive this.
              The super-liberal wing of the public would want to have nothing to
              do with Islam. And you have an extremely conservative wing that
              wants to dictate. So I don't share either view. But then we have to
              sort it out.<br>
              <br>
              You have to engage them, allow them to articulate their views. So I
              think for a person to suggest in Malaysia - to deny the role of
              religion and Islam - I don't share that view. Where I think we draw
              the line is when it comes to compelling people, or not allowing
              non-Muslims to use the civil courts. That's unheard of in our 50
              years.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Obviously there is increased
              tension between the races with religion playing a part. What as a
              leader would you do to defuse the situation?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> I am opposed if a group for example
              wants to compel others to Islam, [or] if you apostatize you should
              be shot. And the other view says religion should have no role
              whatsoever; we should do away with the religious court. I also
              disagree with that. I think the consensus among Muslims is that the
              sharia court should be confined to Muslim personal law and Muslim
              affairs.<br>
              <br>
              The problem is when you use this legislation to compel ... to deny
              non-Muslims to bring their cases to the civil courts, because
              finally the issue of faith is a personal issue. I am a Muslim. I
              believe in Islam. I don't rejoice in hearing that people are
              leaving Islam, but I think finally it is his or her personal
              decision. It is beyond me and I don't think we should politicize
              that further.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> The prime minister's son-in-law and
              UMNO deputy youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin recently branded you as
              an agent of the Jews and the United States. There are reportedly
              pictures of you and [former US deputy defense secretary] Paul
              Wolfowitz being disseminated in the villages. Could this be
              damaging to you politically?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> It could. But look ... I say yes, I'm
              a friend of the Jews. I am a friend of the Chinese, a friend of the
              Muslims. Where is the problem? The Iraq war - I am against it.
              There are many Americans, including Jews, who are against the Iraq
              war.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> But anti-Semitism and
              anti-Americanism run deep in Malaysia. It's maybe not as vocal as
              in some other places, but there is a great deal of ignorance and
              fear. And UMNO has the machinery to fan the flames. What are you
              doing to combat it?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> It does [run deep], it's ignorance,
              and it's been [reinforced] by leaders. Mahathir did it ... and this
              is dangerous. I did address [the allegations], but in the last few
              months I have not because I asked some religious leaders and they
              said [only] a small number of people are being influenced by this
              and they said I don't need to respond. So I have moved on ... We
              are taking a civil suit against Khairy on that allegation.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> Some people say you haven't been
              very critical of the prime minister. This has led to speculation
              that you may one day attempt to rejoin UMNO. Why haven't you been
              more critical?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> I have nothing personal against
              him.<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>ATol:</strong></em> But this is the election season.
              Don't you need to use everything within the capacity of the law at
              this point to end the BN's two-thirds parliamentary majority?<br>
              <br>
              <em><strong>AI:</strong></em> If I have evidence, I present it. But
              with Abdullah there is incompetence ... He gives a multi-billion
              ringgit contract to his son to build a monorail in Penang without
              tender. He gives a 25 billion ringgit development approval for
              Patrick Lim, his crony in Penang. These things are being
              said.<br>
              <br>
              But to make personal attacks, I refuse. But it's wrong for them to
              say I haven't been critical. You say the leadership is incompetent,
              you say that under Abdullah we have been less competitive
              economically, that corruption has become more endemic, crime rates
              have increased - all under Abdullah. I have done that, made major
              criticisms of him. But to go [down the road of personal attacks],
              well [Abdullah] sleeps all the time, why is he married to this [new
              foreign wife] Jeanne? I don't go there.</p>

              <p>It's just a matter of time before Mr Anwar Ibrahim becomes the next Malaysian PM.</p>

              <p>If what he said about BN MPs defacting to the oppositon party, then it will be sooner than we think that a major change will happen in Malaysia.</p>

              <p>I'm betting on his persistance and charisma to change the political landscape in Malaysia for the good of all Malaysians, regardless of race and religion.</p>

              <p>The day will come for Malaysia when there is no longer any race-based politics. All we will see is multi-racial parties to govern the mult-racial country.</p>
