            <div class='col-md body'>Actually all these years the people are not asking the government to distribute free monies to the lazy or the irresponsible.<br><br>People are not that stupid to ask for free lunches but you get ministers talking like people are asking for free lunches.<br><br>What people have been asking is some forms of allocations to relieve temporary setbacks or bad lucks for the unfortunate who fall into prolonged unemployment, the abandoned old and the sick. A certain insurance is what people ask to provide a certain three meals and payment of bills for the unfortunate.<br><br>Unfortunately the government has gone overboard to paint the doom-day scenarios using scare tactics to frighten the people allowing the whole government to accumulate wealth for its own sake going into the reverse - greedy for monies, relentless taxing and recovering costs, accumulating surpluses and keeping all the monies locked up in 30-60 years' reserves as what its favorite NKF was encouraged to do.<br><br>I am sure that while welfarism is bad moneyism is worse. The government using this kind of scare tactics has become uncaring of people's unfortunate occurrences not of their own choice.<br><br>Limitations and conditions actually can be appropriately set to prevent any welfarism from taking root. Now by outwitting people on welfare scare the worse is heppening - government worship money for its own sake.<br><br>So the government is caring for people's wellbeing using scare tactics to allow it to go on taxing and privatising essential services to create more surpluses and more reserves.<br><br>So this is how the government is building all its world class surpluses and building 30-60 years' reserves - the best government in the world.<br>_______________</div>

Last thursday, I was at the CC, and along came a malay lady dressed quite decently, came in to the counter with a letter to collect the transport fund. While the officer is processing, a hip music sounded and she drew out a Sony Erricson K700 and started talking on the phone. I believe the officer wasn't happy about it too and asked her to show him her IC for verification. It turned out that he cannot do anything because it was approved by the CDC and all particulars are correct. The last thing we wanted to see is that this lady then hoped on to a motorcycle waiting for her at the lobby and off they go with the $50 transport voucher.<br><br>Knowing my displeasure, the officer gave me a helpless look.<br><br>From this incident, I am really doubtful about our welfare syatem.<br><br>In fact, the allocation of the ERS and NSS is already a big loophole. It is not necessary that the poor are living in the three room flats while the rich live in executives.<br><br>I have came across to a couple who lived in 3 rooms flats and were forced to move due to end blocks. They were offered a 4 room flat but they wanted only a 3 room. However, due to the fact that HDB did not build any more 3 room flat, they are forced to live in a over spacious 4 room flat. Not only that, they got lesser for NSS, ERS, PUB rebate, Consrvencies Rebate etc. while the cha kway teow bachelor who can afford a 3 room resale and driving a mercedes is enjoying more welfare than the poor old couple. Is this kind of welfare system fair?</div>
