            <div class='col-md body'>USA departing Ambassador Frank Lavin had this to say about  Singapore (amongst other things)at his farewell dinner -<br><br><blockquote>"...Singapore has its share of challenges as well.  Singapore has flourished over the past 40 years, but is a 20th century model adequate for the 21st century?  Singapore is grappling with the definitional questions of what kind of society it wants.<br><br>"Remaking its economy is, in a sense, the easy decision.  Shaping a political system to reflect the needs and aspirations of its citizens is more difficult and more sensitive.  What are the bounds of expression?  What say should citizens have in their government?<br><br>"In this era of weblogs and webcans, how much sense does it make to limit political expression?  Remember, we have the death of distance.  There are no more islands any more.  As part of Singapores success is its strong international links,  it is surprising to find constraints on discussion here."<br><br>"In my view, governments will pay an increasing price for not allowing full participation of their citizens..........." </blockquote><strong>My question is - are we, the ordinary citizens prepared and willing to make PAP government pay for denying us the freedom of speech and participation in our country's policies.?</strong><br><br>Singapore Government feedback units are just for show, you have to be fool not to know that!<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The average citizen, myself included, is so caught up with the bread-and-butter issues that freedom of speech and participation in country' policies are way in the back of my mind.<br><br>(1) Freedom of speech<br><br>Yeah but through what channel? Any letter to newspapers are filtered for content etc. You can talk all you want on the internet forums but it serves no real purpose cos the govt is not reading it. (I also wonder what I'm doing here. To satisfy my own vanity to get my opinion published on a website?)<br><br>(2) Participation in country's policies<br><br>As much as the average citizen is apathetic (is that the word?) to politics, when policies influence our lives, we send letters in, we nag, we grumble, we "exercise our freedom of speech" to give feedback that the govt says it will consider.<br><br>But I remember one govt minister saying in the casino debate case, the people can give all the feedback we want to give, in the end the govt will decide what "it" thinks is the best.<br><br>How are we going to participate in policy-making?<br><br>(A) Go join the ranks of PAP, rise through it and make yourself and your views heard.<br><br>(B) Since the existing opposition in S'pore is really unreliable (my personal opinion), one can form own opposition platform.  But then i can't guarantee the support u get at elections.<br><br>So, my major question is: How can we participate in policy-making in a real, meaningful way?<br><br>Voting? Currently, i don't believe in voting out PAP cos they are relatively good at governance (pls compare with other democratic countries and the state of their society, economy, crime rate etc) and provide political stability.<br><br>Another reason is, there is no strong, trustworthy opposition.<br><br>How do we participate?</div>

The press does publish apparently critical letters from readers but these were subjected to heavy editing and many really critical ones were simply withdrawn (after acceptance for publication) or thrown away in the waste paper basket.<br><br>The past controls over expressions of views and opinions under press control and widespread use of political defamation suits have been so pervasive that Singaporeans have totally lost any power of thought over bigger issues of survival and competitiveness.<br><br>Singaporeans are losing out in a bigger way in that there is now hardly anyone to disagree with policies or ministers' replies on bus fare or utility price increases. So no one is giving their views on national issues of survival or competetiveness. That is the real cost of curbing of people's expressions of views and opinions.<br><br>How many people are really willing and coming forward to give their critical and objective views or tell the truths on any issues?<br><br>That is the main issue behind the actions against racist bloggers not like what certain forumers are saying that racism was the real problem and that they would willingly accept the actions on the racists concerned when that case would be used as legal test for extending of control over expressions in blogs and the internet. This has been the state of citizens' apathy ..being easily brainwashed into accepting imagined fears about certain problems when bigger problems are bestowed upon them.<br><br>Now we can expect more actions to be taken not on racist bloggers after this case but for remarks alleged to be defamatory over the blogs or internet There are already hints of worse clamp downs on expressions to come even in our forums ..we all forumers will not be able to say anything as we objectively feel justified to say in the future. That is why Li Hao was right in criticising Singaporeans as gullible (not of the Lee Wei Ling type or category) as being unable to stand up to this type of governance - using fears about racism as justification to give them the legal means to regard remarks over the blogs or internet as publication or broadcast.<br><br></div>

I can see many Singaporeans are in this category. They know what is happening is wrong but they don't want to be the one to do the dirty work like standing up to the wrong doers and want others to do it for them. When the time comes should they see the wind of change, they would quickly follow to do what is right and probably claim credit too.</div></blockquote>Hey thanks man! If I have the opportunity &amp; have the appropriate number of supporters, I'll not hesitate to stage either a demonstration or a protest. Or if others start 1st, I'll also not hesitate to join them. Really, many Singaporeans have an extremely long way to go before we can see an overhaul of the system of government over here. I think that many would just turn a blind eye when they see their fellow Singaporeans are in trouble. The worst are those who run away, damn it!!! Those Singaporeans who do not have to courage to stand up &amp; fight for justice are really damn bloody pathetic, phui!!! Now I understand what is the real meaning of parasites, never do anything then still dare to claim credit, phui!!!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">From 'The Matrix'</span><br>Â“You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain -- but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life; that there's something wrong with the world; you don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?Â”<br><br>Â“The Matrix,Â” Neo asks?<br><br>Â“Do you want to know what it is? The Matrix is everywhere, it is all around us. Even in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes; it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.Â”<br><br>And Neo asks, Â“What truth?Â”<br><br>Â“That you are a slave Neo, like everyone else, you were born into bondage; born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch; a prison for your mind. Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to experience it for yourself.Â”<br><br>Those few humans who were either born into reality, or have successfully taken the red pill, become the focus of the movie's story -- their attempts to destroy the Matrix and liberate the mass of humanity that lives completely encapsulated in their pods and the illusions fed to them by the powers that be -- powers that will go to any length to maintain the illusion.<br><br></div>
