              <p><br>CAIRO – Egypt exploded with joy, tears, and relief 
              after President Hosni Mubarak resigned as president, forced out by 18 
              days of mass protests that culminated in huge marches Friday on his 
              presidential palaces and state television. The military took power after
               protesters called for it to intervene and oust their leader of three 
              decades.</p>
              <p>"The people ousted the regime," rang out chants from 
              crowds of hundreds of thousands massed in Cairo's central Tahrir Square 
              and outside Mubarak's main palace several miles away in a northern 
              district of the capital.</p>
              <p>The crowds in Cairo, the Mediterranean city of 
              Alexandria and other cities around the country danced, chanted "goodbye,
               goodbye," and raised their hands in prayer in an ecstatic pandemonium 
              as fireworks and car horns sounded after Vice President Omar Suleiman 
              made the announcement on national TV just after nightfall.</p>
              <p>"Finally we are free," said Safwan Abou Stat, a 
              60-year-old in the crowd of protesters at the palacer. "From now on 
              anyone who is going to rule will know that these people are great."</p>
              <p>Mubarak had sought to cling to power, handing some of
               his authorities to Suleiman while keeping his title. But an explosion 
              of protests Friday rejecting the move appeared to have pushed the 
              military into forcing him out completely. Hundreds of thousands marched 
              throughout the day in cities across the country as soliders stood by, 
              besieging his palace in Cairo and Alexandria and the state TV building. A
               governor of a southern province was forced to flee to safety in the 
              face of protests there.</p>
              <p>His fall came 32 years to the day after the collapse of the shah's government in Iran.</p>
              <p>The protests have already echoed around the Middle 
              East, with several of the region's autocratic rulers making pre-emptive 
              gestures of democratic reform to avert their own protest movements. The 
              lesson many took: If it could happen in three weeks in Egypt, where 
              Mubarak's lock on power had appeared unshakeable, it could happen 
              anywhere.</p>
              <p>The United States at times seemed overwhelmed trying 
              to keep up with the pace, fumbling to juggle its advocacy of democracy 
              and the right to protest, loyalty to longtime ally Mubarak and fears of 
              Muslim fundamentalists gaining a foothold. Neighoring Israel watched the
               development with growing unease, worried that their 1979 peace treaty 
              could be in danger. It quickly demanded on Friday that post-Mubarak 
              Egypt continue to adhere to it.</p>
              <p>Friday was the biggest day of protests yet in the 
              upheaval that began Jan. 25. The movement grew for the Internet 
              organizing of small groups of youth activists into a mass movement that 
              tapped into widespread discontent with Mubarak's authoritarian lock on 
              power, corruption, economic woes and widespread disparities between rich
               and poor.</p>
              <p>The question now turned to how the military, long 
              Egypt's most powerful institution and now its official ruler, will 
              handle the transition in power. Earlier in the day, the Armed Forces 
              Supreme Council — the military's top body — vowed to guide the country 
              to greater democracy. State TV said a new statement by the military 
              would be issued Friday evening.</p>
              <p>Vice President Suleiman — who appears to have lost 
              his post as well in the military takeover — appeared grim as he 
              delivered the short announcement.</p>
              <p>"In these grave circumstances that the country is 
              passing through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to leave his 
              position as president of the republic," he said. "He has mandated the 
              Armed Forces Supreme Council to run the state. God is our protector and 
              succor."</p>
              <p>Nobel Peace laureate Mohammed ElBaradei, whose young 
              suporters were among the organizers of the protest movement, told The 
              Associated Press, "This is the greatest day of my life."</p>
              <p>"The country has been liberated after decades of repression," he said adding that he expects a "beautiful" transition of power.</p>
              <p>Outside Mubarak's Oruba Palace in northern Cairo, 
              women on balconies ululated with the joyous tongue-trilling used to mark
               weddings and births.</p>
              <p>"Finally we are free," said Safwan Abo Stat, a 
              60-year-old in the crowd of protesters at the palace. "From now on 
              anyone who is going to rule will know that these people are great."</p>
              <p>Another, Mohammed el-Masry, weeping with joy, said he
               had spent the past two weeks in Tahrir before marching to the palace 
              Friday. He was now headed back to the square to join his ecstatic 
              colleagues. "We made it," he gasped.<br><br>Source:<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ml_egypt"><br>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ml_egypt</a></p>

              <p><br>According to the BBC news, the top Egyptian (older) generals backed Mubarak but the younger ranks and files backed the protesters.</p>
              <p>If that situation carried on further, the military would split into two - the head (generals) on one side and the body (the other ranks) on another side. </p>
              <p>By then, with a disunited military, any order from the command to act (open fire) on the protesters will be too late - anarchy within the military.  </p>
              <p>A prolong protest not only renders the generals as impotent/useless as Mubarak but also risks opening Egypt's wide border to foreign military adventurism.<br><br>When comes to the crunch, its all man for himself - the generals, the lower army ranks, Mubarak, Obama and the rest. </p>
