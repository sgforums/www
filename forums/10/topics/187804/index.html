If There is someone out there in private sector being paid more must it follow that ministers are worth more and they are automatically entitled to more. Where is the logic and how to support this kind of logic. As long as this kind of comparison is blurred and not apple-to-apple citizens will be unable to understand why ministers must get a multi-fold jump or increases in their salaries. To say that we need to offer highest salaries to potential ministers in order to make them part with their existing lucratively paid CEO jobs is not borne out in practice. So the original argument has fallen flat on its face and not supported by the previous salaries of new batches of MPs even those with Ministers' potential. Just tell me how much was Khaw or Lui paid before joining as MPs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello MIONG,<br><br>Government is not a business entity. It is a body of people's representatives elected as stated in party manifesto or the constitution to protect and look after the people's welfare and wellbeing. It is not a body to enrich the government's coffers to show off to the world about our leaders' presumptuous ability or leadeship. It is an advertising firm for our leaders to show that they are world-class leaders.<br><br>Who care about our world-class buildings and airport during the recessions anyway ? Who care about what kind of degrees our ministers possess when in the recent recessions they were so helpless in rescuing the citizens from retrenchments except in giving excuses.<br><br>A good government is elected to protect and provide services to and look after the people. However our government only seems interested in keeping itself in power with all kinds of laws to control dissents and even gives the all the benefits while people are suffering from wage and CPF cuts. So Dr. Catherine Lim was right, it is losing touch of people's basic needs and aspirations and is causing deep disaffective divide among the people.<br><br>The government keeps taxing and recovering all costs to the fullest possible and even raise rentals in bad times to the disgust of many thousands of shopkeepers.<br><br>It is the only government that double-charges for land costs already paid for by the citizens under taxation. Through corporatisation, many traditional government services from hospitals to utilities, it has been able to freely raise fees to market and above-market prices. Thus government is able to claim success that it has built up surpluses. Yet despite having such surpluses which came from corporatised fees and double-charging on lands and assets, it still keeps raising fees of basic services including utility and transportation and even education. Citizens are at a loss what is the government for.<br><br>This election is therefore about whether we are still having a caring government which will look after the welfare and aspirations of the citizens. The MPs and oppositions should debate on such big issues and not waste their time having election and missing solutions of all these problems.<br><br>Sometimes I keep wondering where are our talents. With so many talents and scholars none of them is doing their jobs properly with ability to solve our problems.</div>

Scientific and technological advances today have been mostly brought about in such democratic countries as in such countries citizens enjoyed freedoms of choice essential conditions for progress and prosperty of nations. Edisions, Einsteins, Bill gates and Jack Welches were tjhe products of democratic diversities at work where people are largely motivated by freedoms to exercise their choices.<br><br>Many non-democratic countries are learning from democracy and are trying to emulate democracy even if democracy is not perfect. Even great critics like Mahathir has admitted in a recent speech at the Singapore Management Unversity that there is no other system of government better than democracy.<br><br>History however has been the best judge. After all the travails and tributions over many forms of government from authoritarianism to communism and dictatorship etc, the effectiveness of democracy offering free election and choices to citizens has by far proven more successful than authoritarianism and dictatorship etc.<br><br>Yet democracy is not perfect requiring modifications to suit different people of different cultures and affinities. Even in modified democracy or pseudo-democracy their leaders still prefer to tell the outside world they are democratic even as they are criticising democracy.<br><br>Therefore it is beyond all doubts that democracy is still the best form of government as a system and political ideology and philosopy. Even as our leaders and leaders of certain countries are criticising democracy, they are still learning to use democracy to gain more support of their people. If they have tried to control freedoms previously, they will sooner or later in order to create competitiveness and vibrancy have to open up to free election and freedoms and choices to the people.<br><br>So quite clearly it all depends on one's perspective and perception in trying to discuss democracy whether democracy offers the best form of government.<br><br>Within democracy, it is possible to throw up the best leaders of people' choices but in an autocracy or thecracy or modified democracy, there will be problem in choosing quality leaders. If bad leaders are in charge, it will have to take revolution to changer and sustain the autocracy for whatever authocracy may be boasting of.<br><br>In the ultimate epic contest befween democracy, authoritarianism, communism, socialism, theocracy and dictatorship, democracy has triumphed time and again in recent history.<br><br>Countries which practised true democracy will be countries which empower the masses leading to advances and progresses in all fields. Western democracies are largely responsible for scientific progresses and technological advancement of the world today of which the authoritarian and autocratic regimes everywhere are merely trying to keep up. Autocracy is good by accident of history and may in fact produce some limited and isolate success but as a whole and as a system autocracy will lag behind in term of producing competitiveness of the masses and knowledge applications.<br><br>Singapore has stagnated from the 1970s and the people of talents find no scope in continuing their endeavours here unless they have freedom to exercise their creativity in diverse fields.<br><br>It is now up to the leaders to see why it is stagnating and costs of living keep going up while wages are dropping. So in terms of welfare and wellbeings and aspirations or happiness index, Singapore leaders must realise that they are scoring very badly. They must now open up and allow citizens to have more freedoms to choose whatever they are doing without all the conrols and regulations and defamations suits or constraints.<br><br>Democracy offers freedom and choice but autocracy reduces these basic motivation of people. The leaders could not understand the aspirations of the young as shown in the recent TV dialogue. It is time they take a closer look at motivation and knowledge application to bring back Singapore as a democratic country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>England then.<br><br>I agreed to everyone who say that though the government said that singapore is progressing but the life of the lower-middle income is still mostly stagnant. The reserve of Singapore is indeed increasing constantly but has the governemnt constantly spend at least 50% of it on the ppl who really need it. The progress package give everyone $ even those who do not need it, the professional.<br><br>In due of the rising oil prices the government has done nothing. Dont say that the rising oil prises only affects people who drive, it has farfetchhing consequences like the increase increase of oil prices or bus fare. The ppl who suffered the most might be private bus as the fuel prices hike and more competition from both comfort and NTUC their livelihood is being treaten. The government has done nothing to help such ppl. There are also other industry, eg NTUC going into casket, that is being harm by big cooperation snatching up the customers. The government shld have done something to help individuals in such industry.<br><br>Its true the government has done much to help singapore propel forward. With retraining people will be able to find a new job when retrench. How will they survive the time they take to find the job especially if the person is a single parent witha grand parent and son going through university? Prevention is always better then cure. The government shld do better in prevention. The jobsecurity in Singapore is really very low. Everyone in the private sector know that. The gov shld do something to improve it.<br><br>There are many thing in which the gov can improve on especially in the aspect of job securtities. We are paying a couple of million each year for a grp of COE. In a company just one is needed to help solve all the problems so with a grp things close to the heart of singaporeans like job securities shld have been solve long ago so maybe they just dont deserve their pay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">In countries that practise true democracy like the US, Switzerland and Finland governments have been stable for centuries and there are many successful people in all fields of human endeavours. Scientific and technological advances today have been mostly brought about in such democratic countries as in such countries citizens enjoyed freedoms of choice essential conditions for progress and prosperty of nations. Edisions, Einsteins, Bill gates and Jack Welches were tjhe products of democratic diversities at work where people are largely motivated by freedoms to exercise their choices.<br><br>Many non-democratic countries are learning from democracy and are trying to emulate democracy even if democracy is not perfect. Even great critics like Mahathir has admitted in a recent speech at the Singapore Management Unversity that there is no other system of government better than democracy.<br><br>History however has been the best judge. After all the travails and tributions over many forms of government from authoritarianism to communism and dictatorship etc, the effectiveness of democracy offering free election and choices to citizens has by far proven more successful than authoritarianism and dictatorship etc.<br><br>Yet democracy is not perfect requiring modifications to suit different people of different cultures and affinities. Even in modified democracy or pseudo-democracy their leaders still prefer to tell the outside world they are democratic even as they are criticising democracy.<br><br>Therefore it is beyond all doubts that democracy is still the best form of government as a system and political ideology and philosopy. Even as our leaders and leaders of certain countries are criticising democracy, they are still learning to use democracy to gain more support of their people. If they have tried to control freedoms previously, they will sooner or later in order to create competitiveness and vibrancy have to open up to free election and freedoms and choices to the people.<br><br>So quite clearly it all depends on one's perspective and perception in trying to discuss democracy whether democracy offers the best form of government.<br><br>Within democracy, it is possible to throw up the best leaders of people' choices but in an autocracy or thecracy or modified democracy, there will be problem in choosing quality leaders. If bad leaders are in charge, it will have to take revolution to changer and sustain the autocracy for whatever authocracy may be boasting of.<br><br>In the ultimate epic contest befween democracy, authoritarianism, communism, socialism, theocracy and dictatorship, democracy has triumphed time and again in recent history.<br><br>Countries which practised true democracy will be countries which empower the masses leading to advances and progresses in all fields. Western democracies are largely responsible for scientific progresses and technological advancement of the world today of which the authoritarian and autocratic regimes everywhere are merely trying to keep up. Autocracy is good by accident of history and may in fact produce some limited and isolate success but as a whole and as a system autocracy will lag behind in term of producing competitiveness of the masses and knowledge applications.<br><br>Singapore has stagnated from the 1970s and the people of talents find no scope in continuing their endeavours here unless they have freedom to exercise their creativity in diverse fields.<br><br>It is now up to the leaders to see why it is stagnating and costs of living keep going up while wages are dropping. So in terms of welfare and wellbeings and aspirations or happiness index, Singapore leaders must realise that they are scoring very badly. They must now open up and allow citizens to have more freedoms to choose whatever they are doing without all the conrols and regulations and defamations suits or constraints.<br><br>Democracy offers freedom and choice but autocracy reduces these basic motivation of people. The leaders could not understand the aspirations of the young as shown in the recent TV dialogue. It is time they take a closer look at motivation and knowledge application to bring back Singapore as a democratic country. </div></blockquote>stick to the question  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> so all in all it still doesn't prove that there is one state which practices "authentic" democracy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> asia has traditionally been ruled by political families, even now in today's world its pretty much the same so if you want to see a truly democratic state in asia then i'd say a jolly yo ho ho and in your dreams.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I have shown you democracy has worked well and it has even overwhelmed all other systems including autocracy.<br><br>If autocracies has been the prevailing system in the past in Asia it has now changed and is still changing towards democracy. Even if Asia has been traditionally run by autocratic or political families, like the Sukarnos and Suhartos, the trend is now towards democracy.
