            <div class='col-md body'><br>An interesting article contributed by a Singaporean, and extracted from the www.Thinkcentre.org<br><br>17 September 2003 by Kelvin Tan Wei Hann<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">'Mutual trust' </span>seems to be the buzzword for Singapore lately as the PAP government attempts to explicate the lack of overt discontent over the recent cuts to contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF).  </strong><br><br>Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong talks about the 'trust between the people and the Government' as a 'fundamental pillar of the PAP' in a bid to deride MP Low Thia Khiang's accusation of betrayal on the part of the PAP.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong asserts the existence of trust in the people's relationship with the Government because we don't see a million people demonstrating on Parliament Square.<br><br>Even journalists have jumped on the bandwagon, with Straits Times' Chua Mui Hoong discussing the notion of trusteeship and the faith of the people in the Government to "act in their best interests".<br><br>The bottom line, according to these individuals, is this: people don't protest because they trust that the PAP government will always act to protect the interests of Singaporeans, even if it means having to swallow a pill as bitter as the CPF cuts.<br><br>There's that word again: TRUST.<br><br>Forget about the debates regarding the efficacy of the latest policy in cutting costs significantly enough to attract and retain foreign investment.<br><br>Focus instead on the central issue of 'trust'. The question that we must ask ourselves is whether such a relationship between the Government and the people actually exists.<br><br>Sociologist Barbara Misztal sees trust as "a social resource that can be drawn upon to achieve certain organisational goals". It is a transaction of social capital between two parties in "a strategic decision to take a risk in the condition of uncertainty".<br><br>A fundamental principle that underlies this conceptualisation of trust is that neither party can be overtly coerced into participating in this exchange of social capital even though one party can certainly delude the other into participation.<br><br>Thus, genuine trust can only come about when both parties involved in the transaction are oblivious to any coercive mechanisms that instil fear and suspicion, thereby forcing either of them to partake in the exchange.<br><br>It is this yardstick that we must impose upon the relationship between the citizenry and the Government before we can draw a conclusion about its exact nature and see if it holds up to the claims of the abovementioned individuals.<br><br>Despite its commitment to a kindler, gentler government and to "practise a more constructive, participatory-style democracy" under the ambit of 'Consultative Government', it is certainly arguable that the PAP has not effectively dispelled the sense of fear amongst Singaporeans when it comes to criticising the political leadership.<br><br>This is primarily due to a structure of governance that acts to curtail political criticism from the citizenry.<br><br>The public actions of the people are severely constrained by numerous 'driftnet' legislation, such as the Sedition Act, the Internal Security Act, the Miscellaneous Offences Act and The Penal Code, to name but a few.<br><br>Each of these legislation prohibit any assembly or procession in a public place should the authorities be satisfied that it might result in public disorder. Of course, whatever 'public disorder' means is entirely at the discretion of the political elite.<br><br>The people are also subject to the might of subsidiary legislation that can be and has been invoked retroactively by ministers of the PAP to change the nature of the legal playing field to suit their purposes, however noble they might be.<br><br>Furthermore, there appears to be no guarantee of the citizen's rights to fundamental liberties given the ease with which our Constitution can be altered.<br><br>Top that off with <strong><span style="color: blue;">a government that has, in recent years, demonstrated its willingness to employ a vast array of arbitrary responses, ranging from mild rebukes to severe punitive measures, towards individuals who have either publicly criticized them on a political front or who are members of the political opposition, and a climate that is a mixture of fear and apathy is inevitably formed.</span> </strong><br><br>Given the intellectual capabilities of the political elite, it is highly probable one can put up a logical defence of every individual action on the part of the government.<br><br>Nevertheless, <strong><span style="color: blue;">no one can dispute that they have a cumulative effect in producing suspicion and fear amongst the citizenry, thereby eradicating the fundamental premise for the use of the word 'trust' as a description of the relationship between the people and the government</span>. </strong><br><br>Of course, it would simply be over-generalizing to say that all the people live in suspicion and fear of the government.<br><br>There is no doubt that there are probably individuals who truly trust that the government acts in their best interests.<br><br>However, the point here is that the use of the word 'trust' to describe the overall relationship is in itself over-generalizing and simplistic, for it is unrealistic to say that feelings of suspicion and fear, given the structure of governance, play no significant part in the eventual course of action undertaken by the citizenry.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">So when we don't see a million people demonstrating in Parliament Square, it may not be merely 'trust' that prevents them from being there. It may well be the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, The Penal Code, The Internal Security Act or a combination of all three or more that do so</span></strong>.<br><br><a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2175" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2175</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is an article that was published in the Straits Time during 1999, and probably was not so significant then.<br><br>However, judging by LHL's belief that since there is no public outcry or DEMONSTRATION against Government policies, then it is correct for the Government to view it as acceptance by the Singapore Citizens.<br><br>The Ruling Party has disguised many Government policy issues as part of Election Issues, but DO NOT make the voting of the policy issues separate from the choice of political parties to form the Government.<br><br>The "pork has to go with the barrel" is the kind of politics that the Ruling Party practise politics in Singapore; and the Singapore Electorate has to wise up and be mature in the election vote casted, and should not complain when any unpopular policies hurt.<br><br>Unlike the recent Hong Kong Citizens participation in the Political Life of Hong Kong, in demonstrating against or being vocal in their objections to the proposed Internal Security Act, Singapore Citizens tend to adopt an attitude of political apathy.<br><br>Such attitude can only result in the Government being bolder in their belief that since there is no demonstration of objections, then their policies are widely accepted - even if no polls have been taken.<br><br>The saddest part is that the silence of the Singapore Citizens will allow the Government to pass legislations that will ulitmately affect the Citizens - as in the use of the ISA to arrest Singaporean Politicians, Citizen Political Activists; laws that send Singapore Citizens to be caned for letting out their properties to illegal immigrants, and other harsh laws passed to boomerang onto innocent and loyal Citizens.<br><br><strong><span class="large">ISA 'accepted as part of political system': Lee Jr</span> </strong><br>-------------------------------------------------<br>Straits Times March 11, 1999<br><br>SINGAPOREANS have accepted the Internal Security Act as part of the political system here, said Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.<br><br>He argued that opposition MPs were aware that the Act had public support, and this was why they had not made its abolition an issue at election time.<br><br>Workers' Party candidate Francis Seow had made speeches on the subject in the 1988 general election campaign, soon after being released from detention under the Act.<br><br>But he had not said that he objected to the ISA, but merely that the government had misused it, noted Brigadier-General (NS) Lee.<br><br>"He did that because he knew that it was the best way to collect votes. So, I don't think anybody can say the ISA has no political support," he said.<br><br>The Act allows for the arrest and detention without trial of those suspected of being involved in activities that might threaten national security.<br><br>Yesterday, opposition MP Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir) had called for it to be abolished or suspended, arguing that it was a relic of a bygone era.<br><br>Disagreeing, BG Lee said the Act was an important safeguard to allow the government to act immediately and decisively with a security problem before it got out of hand. "The ISA is a precaution, a safeguard, which we have had for many years now and use very lightly. It has been accepted by Singaporeans as something which is necessary as part of our political landscape," he said.<br><br>He maintained that the Act was still relevant today, noting that two people were detained under the ISA in 1997, and another four last year, for espionage activities.<br><br>These cases, he said, were not publicised as the government did not want to inflame relations with the countries and agencies involved.<br><br>But any MP who was not convinced that these cases were genuine could ask for a briefing on them, he said, pledging that they would be given the details.<br><br>Said the DPM: "We are not in Toyland, where everybody can be taken at face value and all is well.<br><br>"But while you maintain the smiles and a certain facade of normalcy, a certain amount of cloak-and-dagger skulduggery continues all the time, and that is one of the reasons, not the only one, why we still continue to need the ISA."<br><br>Published in the Straits Times.

            <div class='col-md body'>Francis Seow is right, the ISA is misused. The ISA is a law to ensure Singapore's security and survival.<br><br>I believe in the ISA as a way to ensure Singapore's security and survival. However <strong>I do not believe in the ISA as a tool to ensure the ruling party's survival.</strong><br><br>Therein lies the difference.<br><br>I'm also uncomfortable with putting the power of the ISA in the hands of people who misuse the Act like they have done.</div>
