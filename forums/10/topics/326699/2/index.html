              <p>actually it really does not matter where one studies... whether one is suited for the global workforce or not all depends on the adaptability of the particular person, I know many people from Adelaide Uni who would make lousy employees.... even in australia, not talking about the global workforce yet.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who did not get to uni, but rose to become a very high level manager in Dairy Farm, and only after this did the person get two masters degrees, yet this person over saw many of the company's operations and was involved in many overseas projects too... education means nothing without application and even without education, there is still a way.</p>

              <p>In Aus, they teach children about the traffic lights and such but they dont ask them to raise their hand ect.Even for older international students, orientation about the country is provided. And one thing u will realise in Australia, the lecturers and teachers have a good general knowledge of stuff outside the curriculum they impart to their students</p>

              <p>Studying in Australia offers international students more than academic achievement and a globally recognised qualification. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience through which a student can develop independence, maturity, an understanding of other cultures, and the ability to see issues from different perspectives.  <br><br>Study in Australia better prepares a student to work in today’s global marketplace. This is why several foreign companies recruit directly from Australian universities and vocational institutes. Many international organisations and companies employ overseas students with Australian qualifications because their exposure to the outside world gives them greater independence and maturity. With international trade barriers disappearing, great opportunities exist for those with the skills, experience and knowledge to seize them.</p>
