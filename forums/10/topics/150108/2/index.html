I don't go around discriminating against anyone who isn't the same as I am. However, I resent the fact that my taxes are being used to create unnecessary and tremendous competition against myself and my local counterparts. And trust me, if you're not in this faculty, you don't know the meaning of TREMENDOUS.<br><br>Yes, I agree that some competition is good.... but this is pure overkill. Also, the powers-that-be can't claim that we will be 'enriched' by their culture and stuff... if anything, those foreign students tend to keep to themselves and to their own communities.<br><br>I keep asking myself this question (as in my previous post): why should my taxes pay for foreign students who may very well afford to pay full board when there are Singaporeans out there who can't afford to study in NUS? Heck, why should my taxes pay for them when I've got huge study loans to clear?<br><br>Like I said.... I'm not trying to be xenophobic.... but the current situation is making me resentful of the system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>anyways, the policy needs to be reviewed... obviously out of date and I think we should help our own fellow people first before we keep "helping" others (our govt has very badly misplaced "good" intentions) . Who in the political office dare to rock the boat. usually the politicians talk only and wait till its too late and only RE-Act to the issues that blew up in their faces.<br><br>I do not udnerstand why we cannot make these people pay their way through our school since the govt keep harping that we have "world" class schools. If its so "world" class, people would be willing to come here on their own $ and pay their way through - hence we really make Money from education services instead of handing money out to people who will never contribute and be a part of this society. Obviously, we are not "world" class as the govt like everyone to think and far from that, these FS come here realise it and go back to bad mouth sg again! I think once we really are "world" class and not just pretent ... people will flock here instead and beg to be in our system. Right now, out locals are marginalised in favour of FS and WE are doing the begging.<br><br>face it, none of us will be in the political office and even if there is, change is frown on... in this current office and I guess in any office. We are given "world class" education, exposed to the world and yet, when there is a concern that is raised, our leaders rather listen to white skin foreign "talent" they import than to their own people. Its quite useless to be educated in sg cause all the system want are obedient 2nd class citizen sheeps (sheep-tizens aka sh!t-tizens cause we do take a lot of crap).  My view is that work hard for your money and save it. If there is any opportunity to move out of this place, do so and don't turn back and there is no regret. Being a 2nd class citizen here and being 2nd class over in another country... really makes no difference.<br><br></div>

Who in the political office dare to rock the boat. usually the politicians talk only and wait till its too late and only RE-Act to the issues that blew up in their faces.<br><br>I do not udnerstand why we cannot make these people pay their way through our school since the govt keep harping that we have "world" class schools. If its so "world" class, people would be willing to come here on their own $ and pay their way through - hence we really make Money from education services instead of handing money out to people who will never contribute and be a part of this society. Obviously, we are not "world" class as the govt like everyone to think and far from that, these FS come here realise it and go back to bad mouth sg again! I think once we really are "world" class and not just pretent ... people will flock here instead and beg to be in our system. Right now, out locals are marginalised in favour of FS and WE are doing the begging.<br><br>face it, none of us will be in the political office and even if there is, change is frown on... in this current office and I guess in any office. We are given "world class" education, exposed to the world and yet, when there is a concern that is raised, our leaders rather listen to white skin foreign "talent" they import than to their own people. Its quite useless to be educated in sg cause all the system want are obedient 2nd class citizen sheeps (sheep-tizens aka sh!t-tizens cause we do take a lot of crap).  My view is that work hard for your money and save it. If there is any opportunity to move out of this place, do so and don't turn back and there is no regret. Being a 2nd class citizen here and being 2nd class over in another country... really makes no difference.<br><br></div></blockquote>true... true...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
