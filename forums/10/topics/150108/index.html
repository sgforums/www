            <div class='col-md body'>By Liew Hanqing<br><br>August 25, 2005<br><br>THERE could be more foreign students than Singaporeans taking some engineering and science courses at the National University of Singapore.<br><br>Students tell The New Paper that this is particularly true in electrical and computer engineering, with local students forming less than a quarter of the class sometimes.<br><br>For instance, out of the 48 students in one industrial and systems engineering class, only 10 are Singaporeans, they said.<br><br>As many as 31 are from China, and seven are from other countries.<br><br>When asked for the details, the university said 20 per cent of its entire student body is international.<br><br>'International students are not evenly distributed across all faculties,' its spokesman said.<br><br>'Faculties such as engineering and computing may have a higher proportion of foreign students depending on foreign student interest in such courses.'<br><br>In going international, NUS has gone into partnerships with seven universities worldwide - including big names like Peking University, Australian National University, UC Berkeley and Yale.<br><br>This means there will be more exchange programmes and more collaborative research.<br><br>More competition too, as foreign students flock to our shores.<br><br>And the locals seem to be feeling the heat. One 23-year-old computer engineering student said foreigners made up about two-thirds of his class.<br><br>Three other students who are doing computer engineering confirmed that the majority of students taking the course are foreigners, mostly from China.<br><br>NUS would not comment on this figure.<br><br>Fourth-year environmental engineering student Audrey Huang, 22, said: 'With more foreign students, local students aren't given enough space to develop.<br><br>'Maybe the competitive local students would like being spurred on by these foreign intellectuals, but personally, as a normal student, it gives me excessive pressure.'<br><br>Second-year computer engineering student Chen Kaiwei, 22, felt that admitting foreigners would be meaningful only if more interaction between them and the locals was encouraged.<br><br>'Local students don't mix with the foreigners, so they don't learn anything from them,' he said.<br><br>'The only effect, then, is the intensive competition.'<br><br>But that is the key to success, the NUS administration believes.<br><br>The NUS spokesman said: 'We impose a highly competitive selection criteria for international students, more so than we would for local students.<br><br>'This is to ensure that our international students are among the most talented, and that they are truly deserving of a place in NUS.'<br><br>Some local students are taking the competition in their stride.<br><br>'There's no running away from competition,' said second-year mechanical engineering student Zeng Xian Hong, 22.<br><br>'If we don't meet foreign competitors in school, we'll meet them in the working world.<br><br>'There's no difference.'<br><br>But will this make an NUS education less accessible for local applicants?<br><br>NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University now have separate admission systems, the spokesman said.<br><br>'There are, therefore, sufficient places and a variety of courses - no deserving local students will be turned away.'<br><br>For reference:<br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>One more thing,<br><br>A kind reminder to all those young rich singaporean kids who are still dreaming in their classes. You are now enjoying the hard labours of ur parents, but they cannot provide you forever. If u dun work hard and smart, China Kids &amp; Indian Kids are very happy to replace your seat in the NUS / NTU LTs. Even if your dad is rich enough to send u overseas, u will still face the challenges from them when u work outside  or even in your dad's own company. Just look at the dear prices that a lot of older generation singaporean paid when we looked down on the mainland chinese during the Suzhuo investment era in 1980s-1990s.</div>

I.e. the subsidized ones pay nearly the same amount of tution fees in poly and uni as your Singaporean citizen.<br><br>Where does the subidization money come from? From you and me!<br><br>You are right. These foreign students are bonded to work in singapore for 2 or 3 years after grad. They will compete directly with the locals for jobs! I don't see any real benefit in doing this. Will they pay enough taxes or spend enough in Singapore for the gov to earn back the subsidized money? Perhaps the gov is thinking that these foreign students will return as tourists. But who in the right mind, after spending 3 years in Singapore will want to come back here for touring?<br><br>In the end, who are the worse suckers?<br><br>We are!<br><br>Pay foreigners to come here to study and steal our own jobs!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue is not about competition. The issue is why is the govt importing every tom, dick or harry foreigner to Singapore at the expense of locals?<br><br>90% of  those places could have gone to Singaporeans, who cant afford to go overseas- and the fact that these foreigners actually pay less as compared to local is also insulting. Local taxpayers, in reality, are actually paying the govt to allow foreigners to take over their son's place in one of the three Unis locally.<br><br>So what gives? These foreigners, at least 85%, will not become citizens. They will go back because they know they will get very little once they become S'poreans. They also will not allow their kids to do NS if they settle over here.<br><br>These foreigners are actually smart- they can come here and spend less money in education as compared to locals(and also education in the US, Oz and Europe) and can use the blue IC to apply for a work permit in the West or use it as an asset if they go back home.<br><br>But who will be the losers? S'poreans. Why? We pay money, so we lose money. And then the money won't come back to us, because our children cannot get into Uni. And then these foreigners will leave once they get their degree. We are in an disadvantage from day one.<br><br>This flexible, open-door policy imposed by the PAP will kill off Singapore talent, not cultivate it. Even if we don't want Singapore to be North Korea, we also know such an liberal open policy will be bad for us all. We need to be like Australia or US..foreigners are welcomed yes, but only the good ones- and not at the expense of those who are born locally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok here's my S$0.02....<br><br>I feel that though we do need SOME foreign talent, I feel that the government is overdoing it. Yes, we really do need talented foreigners to come work in Singapore, but the way I see it, all that's happening here is that much of these foreign students are simply taking our hard-earned taxes to come here and enjoy highly-subsidised education.<br><br>I'm not trying to be xenophobic here. I'm not trying to say that we should close all of our doors to foreign students and provide free university education for all locals. But what really pains me is that my taxes are paying for them to compete against me academically on campus, and for limited jobs in the workforce. Some competition is healthy and fine, but this is too much.<br><br>What pains me even more is that there are Singaporeans who are worthy of a university education but can't have it due to their lack of finances. I would rather that my taxes help these less-privileged Singaporeans than foreign students who may very well be able to afford to pay full fare.<br><br>Yeah, my critics can say that there are plenty of financial assistance schemes, and I'm not disputing that. Well, try telling that to less-priviledged students who get saddled with huge study loan debts after they graduate.<br><br>I'm facing a total of about $15 000 in debts after I graduate.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
