(words like "indolence" , "lazy" , and "drunken" are usually prefixes to "portuguese-eurasian" if the writer was a brit... )<br><br>the brits really weren't very politically correct in the bad old days... its something our history books don't address  in enough details <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>and since identity here is patri-lineal, let's not split hair... there are no categories that would please u completely if u only knew what they REALLY meant...<br><br>even in the States, the have a rather narrow categorization system as well...<br><br>are you:<br>1) hispanic<br>2) african american<br>3) caucasian<br>4) native american<br>5) asian<br><br>and several sub-categories that doesn't do justice to the big, messy, genetic mix of modern life... so how?<br><br>well, not having it made explicit isn't always a bad thing...it makes for good conversation topics at parties  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
