            <div class='col-md body'>Orchidae as hit a nail on its head. This 'some are more equal than others' issue has been intrinsic within our society but like a bad penny, it has proven difficult to voice out.<br><br>Our multi-racial position is questionable at best. Perhaps we should change the phrase multi-racial harmony to multi-racial tolerance. Everywhere, we have indians, malays and chinese shaking hands but working separately in their offices, bringing out the 'you do yours, i do mine' mentality.<br><br>The fact that outsiders consider singapore a province of china is bad enuff. It shows our govt has not succeeded in promoting Singapore as a true-blue nation where radically different races have lived together and succeeded where others have failed.<br><br>We have developed into a nation of personal-achievers, a ship with a crew where everyone works for themselves. There is disjoint teamwork whenever a racial issue is involved. Why else would ppl reject the notion of the singaporean identity?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To answer a question asked,  I am half Malay, half white (in no order of preference).  I am proud to be Asian, something about being ethnic and cultural that makes me proud.<br><br>Since I've been travelling,  I am also a world citizen in a way - I am Buddhist in Tibet, Hindu in Calcutta,  Catholic in Ireland  and  Muslim in Tunisia.<br><br>Anyway,  I feel that the whole more equal than others thing has got to be sorted out in Singapore.  It cannot be ignored that silently,  non-chinese races are feeling resentful.  I do not know how long more people can smile and pretend that these issues do not exist because it will bound to come up soon enough.  I do not want to think of Singapore as living in multi-racial "tolerant".  I want Singapore to be in multi-racial harmony because that is what makes it special.  In times of world chaos,  I think that it is absolutely wonderful to be able to live with one another co-dependently.  Times are changing.  Alot more people are inter-marrying now.  I think alot of families are made up of people from different cultures.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe in my grandparents generation,  some time during the war,  many chinese kids especially girls were given up for adoption to none chinese families.  My maternal grandmother was one.  And I know another lady in that similar situation.  I just feel that there is no trust that exist like that anymore.  I believe that alot of those who gave their kids away in that situation gave them to people they trusted which I don't believe in an instant exist anymore between races.<br><br>I do not blame the Chinese race per say on this issue.  Yes, I do blame the PAP because who else can I blame?  And for that,  I don't vote for them.  Something more substantial has to be done - more than just talks and seminars that are all show.  We cannot afford racial disharmony in Singapore - we are too small a country for that.  We need to recognise that firstly, this problem of discontent exist.  That there are companies out that that only emplot chinese races.  That there are Singaporeans out there that have got absolutely no Malay or Indian or Eurasian friends.  That children in schools are not mixing well racially.<br><br>When asked recently about what it means to be Singaporean - I said, "To grow up with a Malay mum, a Caucasian dad and a Chinese grandmother.  To go to school and see Mrs. Siva, the Maths teacher wearing her Sari and a pendant with a picture of Sai Baba on it.  To go to English class and Miss Suriati is there wearing a hijab waiting for us to get to our seats.  To have Mr. Singh allow us play basketball during P.E.   To visit Indian friends as a family during Deepavali and Christian friends at Christmas.  To give Hari Raya goodies to non-Muslim neighbours on Hari Raya morning. To remember vegetarian and Halal food when inviting friends over. Those are some of the things that make me Singaporean."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed.What Singapore needs is a real social revamp.A country is like an organism in an environment.Diversity breeds strength and creates wealth within the Singapore system due to many different inputs,a multicultural nation being an asset as it encourages alternative viewpoints and provides taps to other nations.<br><br>All countries live by the adage - "Adapt or die".Simple as that.Singapore needs to adapt to face the challenge of 2 rising powers.And one way is favouring the minorites perhaps,in the manner of the Swiss,and encouraging trilingualism.Why not have all students learn basic Malay in primary school.It is the national language after all and provides a link to our heritage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why all the talk about "chinese being more equally treated" in Singapore? I don't see other races being discriminated upon. And about the lack of a speak Malay or Indian Campaign, has the thought ever occur to some of you that Mandrin standards in Singapore is very low and thats what promted the campaign?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is there a Singaporean Singapore to speak of?<br>IMO, its just another state led activity. Everything went too fast (not that it's bad) and this city state was facing a crisis, which explains emphasis on economic growth. However, we (as a country) haven't had much time to grow and develop our heritage. Most of our legacies are chosen and reconstructed by the state.<br>but, i must say that there has been some slight changes and i do hope that in the near future, there's something which i can identify with being Singaporean.</div>
