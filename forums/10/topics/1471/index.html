            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't it amazing how politics are played out? If everyone from the political cast were to be nominated for oscars in the upcoming academy awards, they'd be handing out statues by the buckets.<br><br>Yes i'm refering to the frequent and sometimes beligerent attacks on S'pore by our neighbours. "Stay out of our affairs" and "mind ur own business s'pore" are just some of the phrases tat come to mind when i recall past incidents that have been well documented in the papers.<br><br>The truth is, recent remarks made by SM Lee about the presence of terrorist ringleaders(We all know who's he's refering to) in indonesia have hampened efforts to tighten security measures locally, resulted in a withering attack from indonesian lawmakers, citing the backlash his comments would have on the country's economy and wat right has he to finger indonesia etc etc. Yet some of their own local policy makers have agreed that their govt have not done enuff to combat the terrorist plague, the lack of an internal security act notwithstanding.<br><br>Strangely enough, it wasn't so long ago that BJ habibie wrongly condemed s'pore's SAF for alienating muslims and capping their promotion limits in the SAF and their restrictons from certain vocations.<br><br>Recently, Malaysia has raised concerns that our land reclaimation projects are encroaching onto their territory when it's plainly clear that we are well within our lands.<br><br>When their claims were refuted, they then came up with unusual claims that the land reclamation is killing the fish and causing reprecussions for their fishermen.<br><br>How odd this may seem, seeing that malaysia saw it in their infinite wisdom not to inform us of the drastic changes they intend to make to their half of the causeway. "It's our portion of the causeway, we can do wat we want with it." was the cryptic response from their officials. In short, they felt no explanation for their actions was necessary.<br><br>Then they started to rattle off on the "fact" that they were bearing most of the construction costs of the bridge and how we were overcharging them for treated water (however did that come into the picture?). As before, our govt calmly and patiently refuted every point the malaysian officials threw at us without so much as a fuss.<br><br>Time and again, we have been singled out and taken to task for so many issues. The tudung case while admittedly concerning muslims, does not expand to include UMNO's interest in revamping our school regulation system. This ruiling has been ard for years, why the sudden interest only now? UMNO could have disputed this ruiling when it was first established. After all it's pretty clear UMNO takes a detailed interest in all matters concerning the muslim community worldwide.<br><br>The underlying truth abt our land reclamation projects probably lie in the new port setup Klang Maritime Authorities have established. Indeed, two major clients of PSA, Maersk Sealand and a Taiwan shipping giant have already been lured over, citing high production and shipping costs cut-backs.<br><br>For the moment at least, this tiny red dot can manage the arrows shot at it from  bigger players.</div>

Now I also lazy to get angry, I guess the best way to treat them is to ignore them. They are just like a dog in a cage - all bark, no bite. Sometimes, the dog got internal problems, yet got no way to solve them, so it starts to bark to distract itself from its problems. They keep intervening in OUR internal affairs, and conveniently ignore that they are doing so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is getting out of hand.<br><br>Just today, Rafidah Aziz asked all malaysians who have been summarily "affected" by our land reclamation to "sue" singapore. On what grounds has  this outburst been thrown?<br><br>This sharp-smiling straight-face bellies a straight-talking sharp-tongue; known for her outspoken nature, she has at times had her tactfulness called into questions over sensitive remarks allegally made in the past.<br><br>Has Malaysian ministers finally gone over the edge?

(He himself said that he saw no reason to "consult" us since the changes were to take place on the malaysian side of the border...sound familiar?)<br><br>And lastly, why is Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak stressing that recent acquisitions of new military weapons and equipment is in no way meant to intimidate or create friction for singapore?<br><br>All this time, we remained silent becoz of a few reasons:<br><br>1. We respect our neighbour's sovereign rights to do as they will within their national boundaries.<br><br>2. Not to appear petty and blicker over everything that may affect us. It's abt time everyone looked at the big picture and acted like adults.<br><br>Is it the malaysian govt's mentality to find fault with whatever we do or feel threatened by anything we purchase? When we buy a couple of submarines, they rattle our door. When we enforce the non-tudung dress-code in our schools, they cry foul and insist on changes to our sch's dress rules.<br><br>The irony is that they feel above the need to explain their controversial actions when the foot's in the other boot.<br><br>Isn't it abt time the Malaysian Govt wake up and smell the crisp morning air? They act like a bunch of bullies who've gotta win each time. I graciously implore the M'sian Govt:<br><br>Respect our sovereign rights for a change.<br><br>Be civilised and act like model political figures, not a bunch of screaming banshees.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is going on now? First Rafidah, now, Domestic trade and consumer affairs minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin making wild claims that SM Lee threatened war against Johor over water? What halabaloo!<br><br>Such claims lead to more than talking points between the two countries. It also speaks volumes abt a person's credibility.<br><br>By making these statements, yassin has now been placed in the hot seat. He has to support his allegations with steel, firstly by answering the following question:<br><br>Why wait until now b4 revealing such "unscrupulous" dealings at the negotiation table almost 12 years after they shook hands? If such a statement was uttered by SM Lee, surely calling off the negotiations or leaking this fact to the media would have provided immense leverage for the M'sia party? (This despite being a so-called TOP SECRET meeting)<br><br>Or is the truth abt Yassin's claims closer to lies and twisted words, bent to gain political sympathy? Surely this time, our govt will have to challange these claims? Such a statement is clearly a withering assault on our nation's credibility as a whole?<br><br>In fact, this whole episode stinks of a poor loser who refuses to address the actual problem but instead misleads the public by throwing sand in their eyes to muddle the key issue - land reclamation. The fact is that it causes none of the problems claimed by M'sia and is completely within our rights and boundaries.<br><br>They have failed to come up with any reason whatsoever to legally oppose the reclamation works, instead they prefer to scream like a bunch of spoilt brats who desperately need a pacifier.<br></div>

Their evidence? Claims that several villagers saw planes flying over Johor of a type not used by the RMAF.

Only after repeated requests from Singapore regardsing dates and times of the alleged intrusions did they give us the information, along with the usual vitriol. Result, aircraft concerned were USAF aircraft flying from Singapore on stopover on their way to their bases in NE Asia.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aww man.  This can't be happening!  The RSAF is gonna pit against highly trained covert operations villagers.<br><br>Come to think of it, the indonesian report is equally entertaining.  Some indonesian local authorities filed an official complaint against the US Navy of dumping toxic waste into coastal water from P3 orion, and snapped some photos of it.  The objects they identified as "barrels of toxic waste" was dumped off the aircraft.  If you thought that was bad, wait til you hear what the Indo General said, after a US Navy spokes person confirmed that the P3 had no cargo ability.  He said "The americans were not dumping barrels of toxic waste.  Those barrels are actually devices used to detect submarines, known as "solobouys"."<br><br>One and a half thumbs up for the Indo General who corrected what would have rather humiliating.</div>

A whole series of rubbish from the Malaysian press about Singapore firing mortar rounds into the Johor Straits near Johor, reported by villagers. Cue usual hysterics from handbook "101 ways to abuse Singapore, 1985 edition". An invesitgation into the matter found that their fishermen were using dynamite to catch fish.
