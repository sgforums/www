              <p>well, let's just say that there is NO totally independent newspaper on the face of this planet...</p>
              <p>as an adult, you learn to question, doubt and discern the truth...</p>
              <p>your views on all the political shit out there is idiotic and laughable.. it is like you refuse and reject your own personal responsibility and demand everything to be served to you on a silver platter while someone pops chilled peeled grapes into your mouth.. then you will complain about no one waving palm fronds to cool the air..</p>
              <p>get a grip...</p>
              <p>you want the MIW out, fricken show the people that the opposition has a better plan.. CSJ has no plan other than attention-whoring.. his so-called manifesto is laughable at best..</p>
              <p>then you idiots go and tear and rip into people doing the work, gaining credibility and trust of the people by quietly working and helping the people...</p>
              <p>i guess the biggest conspiracy theory is that the MIW actually put out CSJ to deflect and distract the people from real problems.. and real solutions... and if CSJ isn't a mole, he ought to be ashamed of himself for bringing the opposition to such disrepute...</p>
              <p>btw.. if you are unable to figure things out, i have no love for the MIW.. in fact, i have a lot of contempt for them... however, i have even more contempt for the people who took away a viable opposition and took them back 20 years.. people like Ling and Chee..</p>

              <p>My uncle is CSJ supporters, u can go and ask him, the psychological explanation here is that when peoples are fed up with the ruling party, they seek no way out to challenge them, then come a hero they protray as the man who can change all these, and these few peoples start idolise him, support him and praise him in hoping that he can shine like a knight infront of the ruling party. But then he falls during the battle, but his legend will go on</p>

              <p>It's a damn good movie if you ask me.</p>
              <p>During elections, the real issues are always deflected away by the Gov, thankfully to Chee &amp; Co's entics. The media spotlight will be on them, and not on the real issues, which the Gov gleefully endorse.<br>And before the people realise that the real issues are not addressed, the elections over.</p>
