The principals are getting extra assistants to look after administration and maintenance and upkeep of the schools who are also well paid.<br><br>The normal teachers who are longer in service are paid $8,000.00 pm to keep up with ministers' own pay increases. So the public sector is quite well remunerated and looked after while the ordinary employees in the private sector keep seeing their wages dropping year after year due to recessions etc from which the private sector has yet to recover.<br><br>So if government cannot lower its costs we can understand why. Taxpayers' monies are there for the spending so just spend them. Where is the problem? Talking about calling on people to sacrifice for the nation, this is what we will be getting eventually - spending taxpayers' monies and increasing GST and making more profits seems to be the governing philosophy rather than trying to get us value for monies or passing savings back to help the lower income earners to lower their costs of living.<br><br>So under such circumstance it is not very wrong for parents to demand the highly paid school Principals and teachers  to do a good job and answer for any lack of professionalism or effectiveness in education of children.</div>
