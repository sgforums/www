              <p>everyone have limit to how much freedom they want.. some are happier when they're freer others not so much. it really is subjective. one man's meat can be the other man's poison.</p>
              <p>i personally don't care much about politics as long as they don't interfere in my daily life but you on the other hand obviously want to be "freer".</p>

              <p>the same laws that you felt entitling sporeans Constitutional Rights WITHOUT any conditions also sent me to an army camp for 2 years. thats pretty much what i would call conditional and i've even been through the 2 yrs with guys who think ns infringes on their rights, they shouldn't have to be here. they should be free outside but then what about the rest who think ns is an acceptable price for what they have?</p>

              <p>Why should you "blame" <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the Constitutional Rights WITHOUT any conditions</span></em> being used to sent you to an army camp for 2 years ?</p>
              <p>How did you conclude that such an act makes it "conditional" to the Constitutional Rights ?</p>
              <p>The essence of the argument is about Constitutional Rights.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been deprived of the clearly stated Constitutional Rights when at the same time Singaporeans have been constantly exhorted to give every ounce of energy, commitment and loyalty towards the interests of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Those Singaporeans in your NS group have felt that NS had infringed on their rights is due largely to the fact that <em>NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS</em> had existed in the first place, and they are making a legitimate statement of fact.</p>
              <p>Why will the Swiss and Israeli citizens not have similar feelings towards their NS duties, and with most of them being issued rifles and ammunitions to be stored in their homes ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a fact that the Swiss and Israelis have a more wholesome two-way consultative process - in which the Citizens will naturally respond to protect the State, as much as the State will protect the interests of the Citizens ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a fact that Singaporeans have been repeatedly berated by the PAP Government to constantly devote our sense of duties to the State, but have been denying the clearly stated Constitutional Rights that have been printed in clear and concise words and language ?</p>
              <p>Whether NS is an acceptable price to pay has little bearing to the very Constitution that are suppose to define the Singapore way of life that is an inalienable Right of every Singaporean.</p>

              <p><br>Is it not more disgraceful that a Singaporean will call another Singaporean a "Whore" ?</p>
              <p>More so, to give the label - "whore" - on a Singaporean whose family life has been made insane by those in power, who will abuse the Constitutional Laws due to their inate fear from the challenges that a Singaporean dare to make towards their hold on political power ?</p>
              <p>What could possibly be the agenda for the creative author to make such a self-serving attention hugging accusation in calling another Singaporean an "ATTENTION WHORE" ?</p>
              <p>One can only conclude that the writer is no better than the one whom he has accused for being an "attention whore" - for all the scandalous drama that the term has been purposefully created to bring attention to the author himself.</p>

              <p>Then you and I differ on whether there is nobility of the human spirit without external control. Not everyone would have the same expectations of freedom as you have, you may feel it's a God's Given Right, i view it as a responsibility to the society.

              <p>I have never redefined it, i simply stated my view of it. Because i am aware of everything i chose to say affects everyone and every word said is one i cannot take back.</p>
              <p>I have never viewed LKY as some morally upright hero, i simply agree with the pragmatic way he choses to see things.</p>

              <p>Can the <em>"Human Spirit"</em> experience any sense of <em>"nobility"</em> when it is subjected to any controls in any form or ways ?</p>
              <p>The seemingly profound statements that you continue to make belies the experience that you intend to portray of yourself.</p>
              <p>Do not mistaken that the <em>"RIGHT"</em> is <em>"God's Given Right"</em> - but that which is clearly thought by Human Mind, and clearly written by Human hands to form the Constitution to define the Life that Singapore was meant to have - a Life that equivalent to the ideals and ambitions of the First World that Singapore aspire to achieve.</p>
              <p><em>RESPONSIBILITY</em> is itself a behaviourial act that the Constitution is supposed to have encouraged by the Life that it has intended for Singaporeans to have.</p>
              <p>Responsibility is a consequence that is supposed to be encouraged by the Constitutional Rights that Singaporeans are supposed to have.</p>
              <p>Why are there so much angst towards seemingly immature and irresponsible acts of Singaporeans that require the Government to enact more laws to ensure more responsible behaviour from 4.5 million people to live together ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a fact that the <em>missing RESPONSIBILITY</em> is due to the MISSING Constitutional Rights from the Life of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Can LKY be pragmatic when he is not morally upright ?</p>
              <p>Can there be pragmatism when there are no morals ?</p>
              <p>Should it not be morals guiding pragmatic acts ?</p>
              <p>Is this not part of the cause of the loss in the sense of responsibility in those Singaporeans whom you have held such disdain ?</p>
              <p>This has resulted in morals being foresaken as pragmatism becomes more convenient, and has resulted in Singaporean's Constitutional Rights being forfeited for the pragmatic ways that LKY has seen fit to govern in the ways he has.</p>
              <p>Your last comment is again the typical reaction of one that is accustomed to being defensive in making false assumptions when afraid to debate your position without hiding behind such thinking.</p>
              <p>Your kind of thinking - with your justification of LKY's pragmatism - will be welcomed by Bush and Cheney, and it will be a rough ride ahead for Obama and Biden to undo what their predecessors have done.</p>
              <p>Likewise, the arrogant ways that LKY had governed Singapore - with the excuse of pragmatism has resulted in untold damages that Singaporeans will continue to live with for the next few generations.</p>
              <p>When all the skeletons have emerged from the closet, you will perhaps learn that pragmatism cannot take precendence over moral correctness.</p>
              <p>The text that has been written in the Singapore Constitution are the ideals espoused by nations greater than ours, and are also identical to the declared ideals of the United Nations that LKY's government had committed to.</p>
              <p>If others have achieve First World status after more then 100 years of history, are we anywhere near half of their progress achieved in the 50 odd years since Self-Government in 1957, and full independence in 1965 ?</p>
              <p>Looking back over the last 20 years, Singapore is still hung-up to the apron springs of larger economies, while we exposed ourselves to the self-serving politics of LKY and his PAP at the expense of Singapore real progress in Human Talent, Human Achievements, and Human Creativity.</p>

              <p>the best thing that could happen to the opposition in Singapore now is if he fricken just shuts up and disappear...</p>
              <p>and that is a sad thing to say but it's true...</p>
              <p>i hope he does.. so Singapore can actually get some real opposition up there.. instead of someone always pulling of attention-seeking useless pointless stupid idiotic stunts like Steven Lim does.. because he's way more disgraceful and infinitely more damaging....</p>

              <p>Did CSJ set out to disgrace himself and Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Or was it not a fact that LKY and the PAP set out to disgrace him and in the process disgracing the standards of politics practised in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Why did the PAP bring out the issue of taxi fares against CSJ - when the taxi fares were approved by his faculty boss, who was a PAP stalwart - and when the dispute in the taxi fares was no more then $2.00 ?</p>
              <p>CSJ was accused of cheating NUS for a difference in taxi fare charges that amounted no more then $2.00 - when the total sum was approved a year before CSJ stood as a candidate for the SDP - and had declined the invitation by his faculty head to join the PAP.</p>
              <p>Why was the approved sum of postage charges - to mail CSJ's PhD dissertation to a US University - being made a political issue, when the sum was already approved and paid a year before CSJ stood as a SDP candidate ?</p>
              <p>Is this not injustices committed by the PAP Government, and revealed the desparate knee jerk reaction to cut down CSJ before he make any bigger impact and impression on Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The fact that CSJ had to fight for his political survival on his own terms - instead of the arbitrary and self-serving terms and conditions weighted in favor of the PAP - showed his tenacity and strength.</p>
              <p>If everyone fights according to the unfair terms, conditions and ground rules laid out by the opponents - will the ANC win independence for South Africa, will India have won their independence from British Rule, will the CCCP win their battles over Kuomintang ?</p>
              <p>With all the print and broadcasting media in the hands of the PAP, and all legitimate and constitutionally sanctioned rights removed by the PAP - can CSJ and the SDP find any space for themselves to reach out to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Are you not being dishonest with your views to the political reality in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It is great to espouse fancy terms such as mouthed by LKY towards JBJ - do you even know the meaning of the word - without the passionate political hatred that LKY harbors towards JBJ ?</p>
              <p>A charlatan is a fraud, who will not stand by one's words.</p>
              <p>CSJ has shown himself to stand by his own words and prefer to test the self-serving and unfair game rules imposed by the PAP, even to the extent of going to jail.</p>
              <p>JBJ was also similarly called a charlatan by LKY.</p>
              <p>Ironically, almost 15 years later, LHL recognised JBJ as a loyal Singaporean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should we not conclude that the only CHARLATAN is the resident Drama Queen in this Speaker's Corner that declared being independent from the Government, but will spend all his energy to sow half-truths about CSJ and the SDP, and will only occassionally take sides with the subservient members from the Opposition ?</p>
              <p>The only CHARLATAN is the resident Drama Queen that create loud attention grabbing terms by calling Singaporeans - "Whores".</p>
              <p>Such is the maturity and disgraceful political thinking of "Attention Seeking Whores" dressed up as intellectual political commentators, when they are no better then "CHARLATANS" dressed up as Drama Queen.</p>
              <p>This is the level and standard of politics that gives reasons for the PAP to continue with their self-serving claims that Singaporeans are immature.</p>

              <p>Can the <em>"Human Spirit"</em> experience any sense of
                  <em>"nobility"</em> when it is subjected to any controls in any
                  form or ways ?</p>
              <p>The seemingly profound statements that you continue to
                  make belies the experience that you intend to portray of
                  yourself.</p>
              <p>Do not mistaken that the <em>"RIGHT"</em> is <em>"God's Given
                  Right"</em> - but that which is clearly thought by Human Mind,
                  and clearly written by Human hands to form the
                  Constitution to define the Life that Singapore was meant to have -
                  a Life that equivalent to the ideals and ambitions of the First
                  World that Singapore aspire to achieve.</p>
              <p><em>RESPONSIBILITY</em> is itself a behaviourial act that the
                  Constitution is supposed to have encouraged by the Life that it has
                  intended for Singaporeans to have.</p>
              <p>Responsibility is a consequence that is supposed to be
                  encouraged by the Constitutional Rights that Singaporeans are
                  supposed to have.</p>
              <p>Why are there so much angst towards seemingly immature and
                  irresponsible acts of Singaporeans that require the Government to
                  enact more laws to ensure more responsible behaviour from 4.5
                  million people to live together ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a fact that
                  the <em>missing RESPONSIBILITY</em> is due to the
                  MISSING Constitutional Rights from the Life of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Can LKY be pragmatic when he is not morally upright ?</p>
              <p>Can there be pragmatism when there are no morals ?</p>
              <p>Should it not be morals guiding pragmatic acts ?</p>
              <p>Is this not part of the cause of the loss in the sense of
                  responsibility in those Singaporeans whom you have held such
                  disdain ?</p>
              <p>This has resulted in morals being foresaken as
                  pragmatism becomes more convenient, and has resulted in
                  Singaporean's Constitutional Rights being forfeited for the
                  pragmatic ways that LKY has seen fit to govern in the ways he
                  has.</p>
              <p>Your last comment is again the typical reaction of one that is
                  accustomed to being defensive in making false assumptions when
                  afraid to debate your position without hiding behind such
                  thinking.</p>
              <p>Your kind of thinking - with your justification of
                  LKY's pragmatism - will be welcomed by Bush and Cheney, and it will
                  be a rough ride ahead for Obama and Biden to undo what their
                  predecessors have done.</p>
              <p>Likewise, the arrogant ways that LKY had governed Singapore -
                  with the excuse of pragmatism has resulted in untold damages that
                  Singaporeans will continue to live with for the next few
                  generations.</p>
              <p>When all the skeletons have emerged from the closet, you will
                  perhaps learn that pragmatism cannot take precendence over moral
                  correctness.</p>
              <p>The text that has been written in the Singapore
                  Constitution are the ideals espoused by nations greater than ours,
                  and are also identical to the declared ideals of the United
                  Nations that LKY's government had committed to.</p>
              <p>If others have achieve First World status after more then 100
                  years of history, are we anywhere near half of their progress
                  achieved in the 50 odd years since Self-Government in 1957, and
                  full independence in 1965 ?</p>
              <p>Looking back over the last 20 years, Singapore is still hung-up
                  to the apron springs of larger economies, while we exposed
                  ourselves to the self-serving politics of LKY and his PAP at the
                  expense of Singapore real progress in Human Talent, Human
                  Achievements, and Human Creativity.</p>

              <p>Nobility is a result of experience and proper upbringing. Parents play a fair greater part in that than any governments.</p>
              <p>What in the world does pragmatism have to do with morals?  There's
                  no connection at all. Pragmatism recognises morals as a tool to provide
                  ground rules for a stable society, moral denies pragmatism as a valid
                  way of looking at things.</p>
              <p>Pragmatism recognises physical and biological constraints,
                  morals does not. They are both radically different perspectives in a
                  given scenario. As long as we exist in the physical world, pragmatism
                  will always make more sense.</p>
              <p>Because we live in a multi racial society surrounded by
                  countries whose politicians already like using us to score political
                  points. I enjoy talking with their citizens, but politicans are never a
                  reasonable bunch.</p>
              <p>Because we are descended from lowly educated labourers and
                  required laws to make sure we don't resort to irresponsible behaviour
                  against people we disagree with. Violent culture is a far harder thing
                  to rid ourselves of when the other guy has a different skin color and
                  language.</p>
              <p>Oh don't start playing the bloody victim here Atobe. I
                  have always been willing to parttake in meaningful debate with others
                  with different viewpoints. I recognise that i'm ignorant and welcome
                  new perspectives.You, however hide behind the ignorant Singaporeans logic and lash out at anyone who disagrees.</p>
              <p>What
                  i dislike, is dealing with hysteria when i put forward a viewpoint that
                  is different. What i dislike, is having my posts dissected to the
                  extent that the original meaning is lost. What i dislike most of all,
                  is having to debate with people who refuses to see any common ground
                  with people who disagrees with them.</p>
              <p>You are not even willing to respect a person with differing viewpoints, so don't claim the moral highground.</p>
              <p>About Bush and Cheney, incorrect. My pragmatism acknowledges
                  that wars cost more than they are worth and a policing action is far
                  more difficult to maintain than a military action.Yet they did it,
                  because they felt it was morally correct for America to remain the
                  dominant superpower in the world.</p>
              <p>Moral correctness does far more damage than pragmatism.
                  Religious wars are fought over moral correctness, racial discrimination
                  comes from moral correctness. The constant tendancies to demolish
                  regimes because they're not pro American gains its strength from moral
                  correctness over no Democracy.  Terrorism, comes from people who wants
                  moral correctness but has neither the economic or miltary strength to
                  do so.</p>
              <p>You are assuming that i believe the PAP and LKY to be a
                  morally upright government, that they have no skeletons in their
                  closets. Incorrect, i have always regarded governments as no better
                  than gangs i do not believe that there are no backhanded dealings
                  within the PAP.</p>
              <p>I work in the Creative industry, so don't pull out this Human
                  Creativity crap when you obviously have so little dealings with it.
                  Creativity comes from an actual formal education, not from this vague
                  "freedom" you talk about. Da Vinci is both a scientist and an artist.</p>
              <p>True
                  masterpieces are not made by splashing pails of paint at a canvas. They
                  are made through hard research and experimentation like all other fields.</p>

              <p>Your post is oxymoronic and contradictory which is typical of any attempt to defend the current regime's view of free speech. While it is true that free speech must have limits, but while you prefer politics not to interfere with your daily lives, the fact remains is that the politicians have already done so and dictated it in so many ways that you have gotten used to being controlled. Then you refuse to look outside the box created by the said regime. What kind of argument is that?</p>

              <p>Can this abstract "human spirit" experience in "NOBILITY" be taught in a controlled environment - as I have asked in the preceding post?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>What in the world does pragmatism have to do with morals?  There's no connection at all. Pragmatism recognises morals as a tool to provide ground rules for a stable society, moral denies pragmatism as a valid way of looking at things.</p>
              <p>Pragmatism recognises physical and biological constraints, morals does not. They are both radically different perspectives in a given scenario. As long as we exist in the physical world, pragmatism will always make more sense.</p>

              <p>Can life experience be of any values when morals are abandon in favor of pragmatism ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it not odd that you should emphatically state that - "<span style="color: #0000ff;">There's no connection at all</span>" - between "<span style="color: #0000ff;">pragmatism</span>" and "<span style="color: #0000ff;">morals</span>" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet you will follow on with your statement that <span style="color: #0000ff;">"pragmatism" recognises "morals" as a "tool" to provide ground rules for a stable society</span> ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You prefer to see "morals" as a "tool" to mould others in some pragmatic ways, and clearly showed the moral flaws in your character, as had been so clearly seen in the moral flaws in LKY's pragmatism - as you have stated in your earlier reply when stating that you do not see the pragmatic LKY as any "moral hero".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you have morals ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without morals can you teach anyone the sense of "NOBILITY" ?</p>

              <p>Yet you will 'boast' that <span style="color: #0000ff;">"Pragmatism recognises physical and biological constraints, morals does not";</span> and claimed that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>"They are both radically different perspectives in a given scenario."</strong></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In a given scenario, a pragmatic person will forsake morals and rule in favor of an expedient solution irregardless of the pain caused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While in the same scenario, a moral person guided by his higher sense of values in the humanities will find a solution that will be just, equitable, and acceptable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, "pragmatism" and "morals" will look at the same scenario from their different values - can "pragmatic" values be superior to "moral" values in guiding us in the physical world ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If Parents play a far greater role than the Government - without morals as a guide and only depending on pragmatism - can Parents living in a physical world impart any influence to instil a sense of "NOBILITY" to the next generation ?</p>

              <p>With the exception of Nelson Mandela, all named were failures despite their wilful efforts and continued persecution by those in power, and did not live to see the success of their efforts.</p>

              <p>If CSJ continue with his "antics" - do you seriously believe that the PAP Government will sit easy ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly you will not qualify to be in the invitation list to the Tea Party - as you do not show the qualities nor the talent required by the PAP, and can only lurk in the shadows of the miscreativity from others and promote their failed ideas.</p>

              <p>Should we be amazed that a self-acclaimed intellectual like you will degrade Singaporean politics and politicians to the level of whores despite your boasted Oxford lineage ?</p>
