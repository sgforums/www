              <p><strong>Strict regulation of public protest is necessary to keep Singapore stable</strong></p>
              <p>i don't know if i agreed with the notion that public protest ensure to keep SG stable  will "continue" to ensure a progressive improvement of higher standard of living. I grew up in SG and spend most of my adult life living and working oversea. Overtime I see the benefit of peacful protest.</p>
              <p>I rather have a sound minded balance society than a "orderly" society.</p>
              <p>What we needs are stability in peacful handover of power. And that Citizen respect the election result. I think So far Singapore citizen are respecful of the election result.  </p>

              <p><br>Singapore become a commie country - if Singapore had not merged ?</p>
              <p>Who will lead Singapore to become a commie country ?</p>
              <p>Lim Chin Siong ?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it was proven that Lim was not a Communist as much as he had espoused 'Socialism'.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the 'wolf in sheep's wool' was LKY.</p>
              <p>Have you not observed the Marxist methods employed to control Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>His pretentious exercise in 'democratic-socialism' in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s was seen through by his early supporters from the European Socialist-Democratic movement - who were deeply shocked and disappointed by LKY's ruthless methods employed towards Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In his usual ways, LKY pre-empted the European Socialist-Democrats move to kick the PAP out of the movement, by quitting the organisation ahead of the passing of a motion to eject the PAP's membership.</p>
              <p>The Singapore political and economic model that we see today is a mirror image of the State control and domination in all spheres of political, economic and cultural Life of the citizens.</p>
              <p>In his memoirs, the late Chin Peng - the head of the Malayan Communist Party - had written that Lim Chin Siong was never a Communist, and the MCP did not control nor manipulated Lim Chin Siong's activities in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Has the agenda not already been surreptiously achieved with Singapore's present status of a dominant ONE Party Rule ?</p>
              <p>Even China's Deng Xiao Peng had to visit Singapore in the 1970s to learn from LKY's experience in so successfully suppressing the rise of any other political parties to challenge the PAP, and allow PAP to dominate politics, and develop the economic, cultural and social philosophies without any political hindrances.</p>
              <p>If Lim Chin Siong was a sacrificial lamb, who was the ultimate beneficiary ?</p>
              <p>Was it not LKY - who had introduced to then Chief Minister David Marshall that Lim was the best candidate to be the future Prime Minister of Singapore with the tremendous support from Singaporeans then ?</p>
              <p>Looking at the organisational structure of the PAP, does it not resemble the levels of autocracy of a communist party controlling a socialist state ?</p>
              <p>The PAP was formed based on a political ideology of democratic-socialism for the progress of the mass of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the democratic part was dropped, and with socialism adopted for its strict form of controls without the socialist welfare to the proletariat.</p>

              <p>Did Hamas make any calculation when they recklessly and brainlessly taunted the Israelis with a mindless firing of long range rockets that bombarded deeper into Israel ?</p>
              <p>If the Israelis did not suddenly decide to halt their military campaign after surrounding Gaza City, there will be no opportunity for Hamas to gloat over their false claims to having resisted the Israeli IDF.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, Hamas has been written off as a terrorist organisation, and is not seen as a willing player to live with Israel.</p>
              <p>Can Obama work with Hamas when their political agenda continue to see to the total destruction of Israel ?</p>
              <p>Seizing opportunity of the moment depends on the willingness of individuals to take action at the right time, and also depend on the individual to have the ability to sense and identify the right moment.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, seizing the opportunity also depend on a set of circumstances available for such actions to be taken.</p>
              <p>If none exist, you will have to go out and create that environment - which is what CSJ is doing, and which what the South Africans had done to fight the White Apartheid System, and which Martin Luther King had done to challenge the existing status quo that stubbornly existed for over 100 years in the USA despite legislations passed after the great Civil War in the USA.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, civil disobedience cannot succeed unless there is support - as was seen in the Hongkongers being pro-active to protest Beijing's attempts at interfering in Hongkong affairs despite their self-proclaimed One Country Two System.</p>
              <p>In the present Communist environment in Singapore, will Singapore represent themselves - when so few even dare to speak their mind or even search for the truth ?</p>
