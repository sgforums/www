              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleI/barack_obama.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="200" align="right"><em>BBC News<br></em><br>The leader of a Singapore opposition party has posted a video message asking for US President Obama's support.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan, secretary general of the Singapore Democratic Party, posted his "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNhfIexncdc">message to President Obama</a>" on the video sharing website YouTube.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>Mr Chee said he hopes that the US "will pay more attention to the human rights abuses of the Singapore government".<br><br>Mr Chee has been jailed several times and faces multiple charges of defying local protest laws and other offences.<br><br>His Youtube message began with congratulations to Mr Obama, describing his inauguration as "an occasion of great moment".<br><br>He
              reminded the US president of his words on International Human Rights
              Day in December 2008, when he had aligned the US with "men and women
              around the world who struggle for the rights to speak their minds,
              choose their leaders and be treated with dignity and respect".<br><br><strong>"Clever repression"</strong><br><br>Mr
              Chee then spoke of the many men and women around Asia suffering in that
              struggle, notably Burmese opposition icon Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains
              under house arrest. <br><br>Mr Chee expressed the hope that with Mr
              Obama in charge, it could not be "repression as usual" in Burma, and
              that "urgent change must come" to the country ruled by a military junta.<br><br>In
              Singapore, Mr Chee claimed, repression was exercised through the
              "clever use" of terms such as rule of law and good governance "to cover
              up what is effectively a dictatorship".<br><br>"How else do we describe
              a government prohibits public speech and peaceful assembly controls
              media, detains citizens without trial and manipulates elections?" he
              said.<br><br>He expressed the hope that Mr Obama might "take positive steps to help Singapore join the community of democracies."<br><br>"Under your leadership I look forward to a world that is freer, more democratic and more just," said Mr Chee.<br><br><strong>Economic concerns<br></strong><br>Mr
              Chee's YouTube message includes pictures apparently of poor
              Singaporeans living in cardboard boxes - an allusion to growing
              economic distress in a state that has made impressive economic success
              a key plank of its appeal at the ballot box.<br><br>The Singapore
              government has announced a new low in the level of economic performance
              expected this year - a contraction of between 2% and 5%.<br><br>Singapore
              President SR Nathan sent his own congratulatory message to Mr Obama in
              which he expressed the hope that the US would provide new economic
              leadership.<br><br>Mr Nathan noted the close ties between Singapore and
              the US which he described as longstanding, close, multifaceted and
              versatile.<br><br><em>The Straits Times</em> newspaper in Singapore carried a brief report about Mr Chee's message without comment on Wednesday.<br><br>In the past the government has dismissed complaints about restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly as without substance.<br><br>A
              park is designated as a space for free speech in Singapore; outside
              that area, gatherings of more than five people need official permission.<br><br>Mr
              Chee is one of the few Singaporeans who have publicly spoken against
              Singapore's People's Action Party, which has ruled since 1959.<br><br>Singapore's
              leaders say tough laws against dissent and other political activity are
              necessary to ensure the stability which has helped the city-state
              achieve economic success.<br><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7841485.stm"><em>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7841485.stm<br></em></a><br><br><strong>Singapore opposition leader appeals to Obama on rights<br></strong><em>AFP<br></em><br>The
              leader of a Singapore opposition party, jailed numerous times for
              defying local protest laws and for other offences, has posted a video
              message asking for US President Barack Obama's support.<br><br>Chee
              Soon Juan, secretary general of the Singapore Democratic Party, posted
              his "message to President Obama" on the video sharing website YouTube,
              where he called Obama's Tuesday inauguration "an occasion of great
              moment."<br><br>Chee expressed hope that the United States "will pay
              more attention to the human rights abuses of the Singapore government
              and take positive steps to help Singapore join the community of
              democracies."<br><br>Chee, dressed in a dark suit and a tie, sat at a desk to deliver the message lasting more than five minutes.<br><br>He
              said his party was especially encouraged by what Obama, the first black
              president of the United States, has said about human rights.<br><br>"Under your leadership I look forward to a world that is freer, more democratic and more just," said Chee.<br><br>He
              is one of the few Singaporeans who have publicly spoken against
              Singapore's People's Action Party, which has ruled since 1959.<br><br>Since
              independence in 1965, Singapore has grown from a Third World country to
              an Asian economic powerhouse. But critics say this has come at a price,
              in the form of restrictions on freedom of speech and political activity.<br><br>The
              ruling party has all but two of the 84 elected seats in parliament, and
              the opposition's complaints include a lack of access to mainstream
              media in the country.<br><br>Except for a park that serves as a
              designated area for limited free speech, it is illegal to hold a public
              gathering of five or more people in Singapore without a police permit.<br><br>Singapore's
              leaders say tough laws against dissent and other political activity are
              necessary to ensure the stability which has helped the city-state
              achieve economic success.<br><br>The government has said allegations
              that Singapore fails to meet international standards for political and
              human rights are without substance.<br><br><em><a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?col=&amp;section=uselection&amp;xfile=data/uselection/2009/January/uselection_January144.xml">http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?col...</a></em></p>

              <p>While i can agree that Singapore does need to be more democractic and just, i find the idea of "freer" a very subjective term.</p>
              <p>What exactly does this "freer" entails? The right to protest in the streets and disable government ministries because the protesters feel as long as they're justified they can do anything?</p>
              <p>Granted , there are going to be positive effects in being more free which currently i cannot think of any examples for. But we need to look at the concept of freedom as an idea that is extremely subjected to interpretation by every single individual not as a natural magic bullet that will solve all problems.</p>
              <p>Are not the multinational corporations free to express their opinions louder than the average individual? What benefits the corporations' employees and board of directors would not neccesarily benefit the country as a whole.The Americans have already proven that to us.</p>
              <p>If we want freedom, we got to understand it's a responsibility not a bloody right.</p>

                                      presidency, we can achieve a new age where freedom will be the
                                      bedrock upon which everything else will depend.<br> <br> This letter is a plea to you to help the countless people in
                                      Singapore who are suffering under the crushing yoke of Lee Kuan
                                      Yew's dictatorship. One of his victims is myself.<br> <br> I wish to tell you my story.<br> <br> I am an American citizen, born in Singapore and formerly a
                                      Singapore citizen. I lived most of my life in Singapore, and was
                                      educated there. I then went to England to read law and was admitted
                                      to the English Bar. Thereafter I returned to Singapore, was
                                      admitted to the Singapore Bar, and practiced there law until 1991,
                                      when I came to the United States, obtained asylum for the
                                      persecution I suffered for my political beliefs. I was admitted to
                                      the California Bar and have been practicing law here ever
                                      since.<br> <br> On May 26, 2008, I went to Singapore to observe a defamation of
                                      character trial in which the Minister Mentor of Singapore Lee Kuan
                                      Yew and his son, the Prime Minister were suing Dr. Chee Soon Juan
                                      and his sister Miss Chee Siok Chin who are opposition politicians,
                                      for having written an article critical of them.<br> <br> Being a lawyer and someone personally involved in Singapore
                                      politics, this trial was of particular interest for me, especially
                                      since it was publicized that Dr. Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin
                                      will be cross examining Lee and his son. This particular hearing
                                      was to decide the quantum of damages the court will award to the
                                      Lees since they had already won this lawsuit earlier. This hearing
                                      was scheduled to be heard by Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean in the
                                      Singapore High Court from May 26, 2008 to May 28, 2008. I planned
                                      my trip to Singapore to last from May 26, 2008 to June 1, 2008, a
                                      period of 7 days to enable me to attend the trial as an observer
                                      and return after spending the remaining few days in
                                      Singapore.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I was in Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean's court for all 3 days
                                      listening to the trial. Throughout the 3 days, this Judge was
                                      completely biased in favor of the Lees. She did not give the
                                      Defendant Dr. Chee Soon Juan or his sister Miss Chee Siok Chin any
                                      meaningful opportunity to defend themselves. Anyone who had
                                      observed the trial would have walked away with the same opinion.</strong></span> Full details of Judge Ang's complete abdication of her judicial
                                      responsibility is well documented in Dr. Chee Soon Juan blog,

                                      which I criticized her conduct in her judicial capacity during the
                                      3 days of trial. I am attaching a copy of this blog post.<br> <br> On Saturday May 31, 2008 at about 8.30 pm, while I was descending
                                      from my 7th Floor hotel room at Broadway Hotel, Serangoon Road,
                                      Singapore, I was arrested by 5 plain clothes policemen when the
                                      elevator door opened at the ground floor lobby. I was handcuffed,
                                      pushed back into the elevator, rode to the floor where my room was
                                      ransacked and my American passport and personal documents
                                      confiscated. I was then driven in their police car to Central
                                      Police Station where I was kept in solitary confinement for 6 days
                                      during which time I was repeatedly interrogated day and night and
                                      accused of having sent Emails to this judge and others, which I
                                      never did. I was charged for this. The charge read that I had
                                      insulted the judge in the Emails.<br> <br> When I denied ever sending any Emails, I was charged under the
                                      Sedition Act of Singapore for having insulted this judge and told
                                      that I will be sentenced to a prison term of up to 3 years if
                                      convicted. Subsequently, they reverted back to the Email charge.
                                      Finally I was charged for having insulted this judge because I had
                                      written this blog post in my blog.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><strong><br> The Singapore Constitution has a provision like in most other
                                      constitutions of the world guaranteeing free speech, expression and
                                      assembly. The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights guarantees
                                      this right to every person in this world regardless of race creed
                                      or religion. In my writing this blog post in criticism of this
                                      judge, I was acting just as any other human being is entitled to
                                      act.</strong></span> <br> <br> After holding me in solitary confinement for 6 days, they
                                      officially charged me in court on June 5, 2008. I was then released
                                      on bail. My case was fixed for hearing before Judge Kan Ting Chiu
                                      on September 08, 2008. Although I had made several requests for my
                                      case to be heard sooner so that I can return to my law practice in
                                      California, the court simply refused. Two attempts for the court to
                                      release my passport to enable me to travel to the US in the interim
                                      to take care of business, even though supported by the American
                                      Embassy were also ignored.<br> <br> This meant that I had to remain in Singapore throughout this period
                                      which will result in my suffering severe financial harm due to
                                      neglecting my practice this entire time of 6 months. I was not able
                                      to earn any income from my US practice as well as having to
                                      maintain myself to live in Singapore during these months.<br> <br> Eventually the case came to trial. Judge Kan Ting Chiu was
                                      determined to send me to prison. No amount of argument by me in
                                      saying that writing a blog post was lawful criticism and a human
                                      right, made any difference to him. On the 17th of September 2008,
                                      he sentenced me to 3 months imprisonment, a sentence much harsher
                                      than even thieves and robbers receive.<br> <br> On the 20th of November 2008, I was released from prison, allowed
                                      to remain in Singapore for 5 days until the 26th of November 2008
                                      when I was permitted to leave Singapore. The Singapore Immigration
                                      Department has placed a condition that I am not allowed to enter
                                      Singapore again unless I have the written permission of the
                                      Singapore Immigration and Customs Authority. This effectively means
                                      that I am banned from ever returning to my country of birth.<br> <br> Since my return to Fremont, California on November 26, 2008, I have
                                      been trying to rebuild my law practice which has been shattered. I
                                      have also been financially ruined by my forced stay in Singapore
                                      for 6 months, from which I am trying to recover.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Despite Lee Kuan Yew's attempts to show Singapore as a democracy,
                                      it is far from it. Today, Singaporeans live in mortal fear of their
                                      government. The constitution is completely ignored. Singapore
                                      Parliament is merely a rubber stamp, the country being run entirely
                                      on the dictates of this one man, Lee Kuan Yew. Although the
                                      constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression, the law
                                      requires permits to engage in such activity and permits are never
                                      granted. With one party rule, the people have no legal means to
                                      voice their dissent. Dr. Chee Soon Juan and other activists have
                                      engaged in peaceful protests for which they have been repeatedly
                                      charged and sent to prison. At this very moment, Singapore human
                                      rights activists, Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Gandhi Ambalam, Chee Siok
                                      Chin and Yap Keng Ho are undergoing a trial for having engaged in a
                                      peaceful assembly, one of the many they have suffered.</strong></span><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> In Singapore today, there is no free press. Every single newspaper
                                      and news media is controlled by the government. The judiciary is
                                      entirely politicized and they invariably abuse the law to punish
                                      political opponents. The Internal Security Act, giving the
                                      government the right to detain people without trial is being used.
                                      There are a number of people presently detained in Singapore under
                                      this law. The police force is being used as Lee Kuan Yew's private
                                      army to arrest detain and charge his political opponents.</strong></span><br> <br> Dear President, you have said it is your intention to try to uplift
                                      people oppressed under the yoke of dictators. You have said you
                                      believe strongly in the right of people to achieve their self
                                      determination, to live as men and not slaves. This letter that I
                                      write carries the hopes of thousands of Singaporeans yearning to be
                                      free, to live as free men and women endowed with the human rights
                                      they rightly deserve.<br> <br> Singapore unlike other countries has no hinterland, no farmland, no
                                      place where people can survive without government recognition. It
                                      is a concrete island where one has no choice but to submit to Lee's
                                      dictates, because inviting the wrath of Lee Kuan Yew would mean
                                      being destitute. There are people who are able to emigrate leaving
                                      Singapore for a freer life elsewhere. But for the vast majority,
                                      leaving Singapore is impossible. They have nowhere else to go. And
                                      so they live in submission and fear of Lee Kuan Yew's rule.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> You have also said you intend to look into tax havens and money
                                      laundering centers where foreigners invest to avoid paying taxes in
                                      their own countries. It is very well documented that Singapore
                                      banks maintain large investments belonging to Burmese drug lords.
                                      The US has placed sanctions against the Burmese government. By
                                      Singapore permitting these assets from Burma to remain in
                                      Singapore, it is clearly hurting the purpose of the US sanctions.
                                      American and European businessmen, in order to avoiding taxes in
                                      their own countries also bank their moneys there. I hope your
                                      office will look into this and demand that Singapore comply with
                                      international standards of financial responsibility and stop
                                      profiting from illegal funds.</strong></span><br> <br> A free and democratic Singapore is a boon for the US, not a bane.
                                      Trade between the US and Singapore will increase, not decrease if
                                      Singapore becomes a democracy. Nothing is lost and everything is
                                      gained by this.<br> <br> Even though I am an American citizen, Singapore is dear to my
                                      heart. It was the place where I was born. I hope to see
                                      Singaporeans proud and free, standing up tall as men and women, not
                                      the sheepish lives they live now. Dear President, please do what
                                      you can for the people of Singapore. Our hopes ride with you.<br> <br> Thank you Mr. President.<br> <br> Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>i think send the posts to Obama's blackberry is better...<br><br><a href="http://news.sg.msn.com/TopStories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=2210711">http://news.sg.msn.com/TopStories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=2210711</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Barack Obama has pulled off the first political triumph of his presidency -- he will get to keep his beloved BlackBerry.</p>
              <p>At a time of deep economic crisis and turmoil abroad, one of the most burning questions facing the new White House has been the fate of the president's trusty window to the outside world.</p>
              <p>Being the world's most powerful man apparently has its advantages because Obama has faced down the objections of Secret Service protectors and government lawyers trying to take away his trusty device.</p>
              <p>"The president has a BlackBerry through a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Thursday. "It's a pretty small group of people."</p>
              <p>"The security is enhanced to ensure his ability to communicate, but to do so effectively and to do so in a way that is protected," Gibbs said.</p>
              <p>The spokesman would not say exactly how the president's device had been protected or whether some kind of encryption was being used to prevent the cellular device from being hacked or from giving away his whereabouts.</p>
              <p>According to The Atlantic magazine, the president will be using a standard BlackBerry but one equipped with a "super-encryption package" developed by an intelligence agency, probably the National Security Agency.</p>
              <p>Gibbs confirmed that any emails sent or received by the president would be subject to the post-Watergate Presidential Records Act of 1978, which requires that a record be kept of every White House communication.</p>
              <p>Obama's BlackBerry was a fixture on his belt or in his hand on the campaign trail and he has said the phone was a valuable part of a wider strategy to escape the White House fishbowl.</p>
              <p>"It's just one tool among a number of tools that I'm trying to use, to break out of the bubble, to make sure that people can still reach me," he told CNN.</p>
              <p>"If I'm doing something stupid, somebody in Chicago can send me an email and say, 'What are you doing?'</p>
              <p>"I want to be able to have voices, other than the people who are immediately working for me, be able to reach out and send me a message about what's happening in America."</p>
              <p>In an op-ed column this week in the Los Angeles Times, John Podesta, who headed Obama's transition team, said allowing him to keep his BlackBerry was important to allow the president to stay in touch with the outside world.</p>
              <p>"Without his virtual connection to old friends and trusted confidants beyond the bubble that seals off every president from the people who elected him, he'd be like a caged lion padding restlessly around the West Wing, wondering what's happening on the other side of the iron bars that surround the People's House.</p>
              <p>"The president's ability to reach outside his inner circle gives him access to fresh ideas and constructive critics," Podesta said. "As president, it is more important than ever that he remain connected."</p>

              <p>No need anything that dramatic. Just have the Treasury Dept declare that they will ban all transactions to Singapore. In one swift swoop, our economy goes kaput.</p>

              <p>What exactly does this "freer" entails? The right to protest in the streets and disable government ministries because the protesters feel as long as they're justified they can do anything?</p>
              <p>Granted , there are going to be positive effects in being more free which currently i cannot think of any examples for. But we need to look at the concept of freedom as an idea that is extremely subjected to interpretation by every single individual not as a natural magic bullet that will solve all problems.</p>
              <p>Are not the multinational corporations free to express their opinions louder than the average individual? What benefits the corporations' employees and board of directors would not neccesarily benefit the country as a whole.The Americans have already proven that to us.</p>
