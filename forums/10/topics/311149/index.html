              				Release: A peaceful protest abruptly stopped</strong></span></p>
              <p>Singapore Democrats<br>15 Mar 08<br><br>Today is the World Consumer Rights Day. The Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) is organising a special event tomorrow (16 March 2008, Sunday) to "promote the basic rights of all consumers", and to "raise the profile of the consumer rights movement in Singapore".<br><br>True to the cause championed by CASE, the SDP also organised a peaceful "Tak Boleh Tahan!" protest today, similarly fashioned to last year's CASE event during which crowd wearing specially designed T-shirts congregated in front the Parliament House, holding various placards in their hands, then walked around the Singapore River, etc.<br><br>There were about 20 odd people participating in today's event, wearing the red T-shirts with the words "Tak Boleh Tahan" in white. In addition, there was a contingent of children holding red balloons, walking side by side with the grown-ups or being pushed along in their baby strollers.<br><br>In front of the Parliament House, the group also highlighted the recent price hikes by displaying an array of consumer goods which included a loaf of "no-frilled" bread, a pack of rice, a tin of Milo, instant noodles, biscuits, condense milk and cooking oil, etc.<br><br>The atmosphere was pleasant and joyful until the police showed up to gave the protesters their warnings, and asked them to disperse or risked being arrested.<br><br>Apparently uneasy with those images and messages prominently featured on the placards, the police tried to seize them from the protesters. As the group proceeded towards the Funan Centre, plain-clothes police surrounded the protesters and started making their arrests.<br><br>While the protesters locked their arms together to safeguard their properties, the police picked the first protester, forcefully pulled him out from the tightly inter-locked group, and swiftly dragged him to one of the police vans parked nearby. Then they went back to work on their 2nd victim. Making their arrests one by one, it took the police several rounds of spectacles in front of a big crowd of onlookers gathered around to finish their most important job of the day.<br><br>Finally, about 15 protesters, including Ms Chee Siok Chin were bundled into the police vans and sent to the Cantonment Police headquarters. Later on, when some family members of protesters went to the police HQ and tried to find out more about the list of people getting arrested and their charges, the police refused to give any information.<br><br>Meanwhile, lawyer M Ravi is representing the group when the protesters continued to be held up for holding a peaceful protest until they were abruptly stopped by the police by force.<br>    <br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWCRDprotest13.html">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWCRDprotest13.html</a></p>

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>As you are aware, approximately 20 peaceful <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> had gathered in front of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Parliament</span> House Singapore on March 15, 2008 to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protest</span> against the government's consumer goods price hikes and lack of human
                      rights. Despite the fact that the Constitution specifically <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">allows</span> for peaceful assembly, the government had denied their request for a
                      permit to conduct it, and had used force to disperse and arrest these

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A personal account of Mr. Chia Ti Lik, Attorney at Law:</span></p>
              <p><em>My thoughts at this moment at 2341hrs on the events of the day.</em><br><em></em><br><em>I
                      had started out feeling enthusiastic about the protest which i was
                      about to take part today. Early awakening in the morning and thereafter
                      straight for a breakfast with a couple of friends.<br></em><br><em>We
                      found ourselves under cloudy weather when we arrived near the venue.
                      After a while of speaking around, we proceeded towards Parliament
                      House. There were probably about 25 to 30 of us. Excluding the children
                      that were brought by their parents.</em><br><em></em><br><em>Straightaway,
                      the seasoned eye of an activist spots a total of about 8 plain clothes
                      policemen lurking around to do surveillance. The police and the
                      administration were clearly rattled by the intention to protest in
                      front of parliament house.</em><br><em></em><br><em>To me this was a
                      symbolic gesture. As Parliament has failed Singapore in failing to keep
                      the Cabinet in check, a protest by people from all walks of life in
                      Singapore would bring them down a peg or two and for them to start
                      listening to the people. I prided myself for being able to pluck up the
                      courage to join in this protest.</em><br><em></em><br><em>After photos
                      and interviews were taken by the local and foreign press on the
                      paraphernalia and purpose of the protest, placards included. ASP
                      William <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Goh</span>, fearful of being identified as a police officer, failed to appear in his uniform. ASP William <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Goh</span> made a hasty introduction of himself and asked for us to disperse from the the Parliament House. Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan and Gandhi <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ambalam</span> agreed and started walking across the road towards <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-error">Funan</span> Centre.</em><br><em></em><br><em>There in front of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">Funan</span> Centre, we were accosted again by a sweaty and panicky ASP William <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-error">Goh</span> who now demanded that the placards to be surrendered and if the placards were not surrendered, arrests would be made.</em><br><em></em><br><em>Uncle Yap challenged the police to state which law the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> broke and why was it that they had to hand over the placards. Uncle Yap was covering the event with a camera of his. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kaixiong</span> and Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> tried to reason with the ASP and was getting nowhere. The ASP began
                      uttering gibberish - about something about the Parliament being
                      gazetted as a protected area and about the placards which must be
                      surrendered. The police officers blocked our way for a good 10 minutes
                      or so ironically preventing us from dispersing from the vicinity of the
                      Parliament.</em><br><em></em><br><em>I asked the ASP to see reason as
                      the protest was an entirely peaceful one and that there were many
                      Singaporeans affected by price hikes which the ruling party has
                      indirectly and directly caused and that it was totally <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-error">unremorseful</span> about. I told the ASP that given the number of reporters around, it
                      would be a public relations debacle for the Government Administration
                      if Mas <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-error">Selamat</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> remained on the loose and Police resources were freely used to stifle
                      dissenting voices for the benefit of the ruling PAP. This argument won
                      no ground.</em><br><em></em><br><em>After a couple of minutes more, when the police reinforcements arrived, they acted. ASP William <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_34" class="blsp-spelling-error">Goh</span> ignored our pleas that the protest was a peaceful one and that it was
                      concerned with the welfare of all Singaporeans. ASP William <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_35" class="blsp-spelling-error">Goh</span> ordered the arrest of Uncle Yap. Uncle Yap passed his camera to me. The
                      Police tried to grab it and i passed it to someone else. We locked
                      arms. One by one using police officers, they tried to pry as apart. The
                      regime has in fact resorted to softening its <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_36" class="blsp-spelling-error">hardline</span> approach by using non uniformed police officers and non uniformed women to do the dirty job of arresting <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_37" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span>. None of them were in uniform.</em><br><em></em><br><em>From
                      the corner of my eye, i saw that the police vans were ready to take us
                      away. Our grip became tighter. So were the number of hands and arms on
                      us pulling our grip apart.</em><br><em></em><br><em>I had probably 4 or 5 female officers pulling my arms apart from I think was <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_38" class="blsp-spelling-error">SDP</span>’s <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_39" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ghandi</span>. I ended up facing away from Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_40" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> but yet locked arms with him. I was on Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_41" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span>’s left. John Tan was on his right. Soon we were overpowered. I was led to one van only to find <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_42" class="blsp-spelling-error">Siok</span> Chin being manhandled into the van. For some reason or the other then
                      they then decided to put me in another van. I ended up being trussed by
                      two policewomen into a police van with Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_43" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span>, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_44" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kaixiong</span>, Sylvester, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_45" class="blsp-spelling-error">Seelan</span>. It was only inside the van that the officers were uniformed. There were 3 officers, all Staff Sergeants - seasoned men. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_46" class="blsp-spelling-error">Seelan</span> was dragged all the way in, dragged face down onto the van floor. The
                      debacle was seen by hundreds of onlookers. This was happening in
                      Singapore.</em><br><em></em><br><em>Inside the van, i sat opposite an
                      officer. He forbade me from using my phone be it to call or to receive
                      calls. The reporters were still outside the van, there were many people
                      watching. There was also a traffic police on a motorbike who had
                      stopped the traffic. It was a real spectacle. Amidst all these, i found
                      tears welling in my eyes.</em><br><em></em><br><em>I was surprised, was
                      it the humiliation? Was there any shame? For a lawyer to be trussed up
                      into a police van watched by hundreds and with cameras rolling? I
                      searched myself. Yes it was shame. But it was not mine.</em><br><em></em><br><strong><em>The
                      shame i felt was Singapore’s shame. Of a situation and plight where
                      people can no longer speak and assemble freely in their own country.
                      How has our island whom we are taught to live love and die for become a
                      place where the citizens who are expected to carry the burden are
                      treated lesser than the foreigners who come in and who are deemed to
                      have no reason to be speaking up against their own government?</em></strong><br><em></em><br><em><strong>We
                      have a place which can no longer be called a country. Singapore has
                      been twisted into a macabre contortion by the People’s Action Party. To
                      live life and pay up AND shut up.</strong> I held back the tears, there was no
                      reason for the tears to fall in a regime’s police van for the word
                      Police, its emblem and its uniforms no longer held any meaning. <strong>This
                      was a police force which allows the PAP’s subsidiaries e.g. CASE
                      conduct similar protests with impunity. This was a police force that
                      showed restraint against protesting foreigners. This was the same
                      police force that let Mas <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_47" class="blsp-spelling-error">Selamat</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_48" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span></strong> <strong>loose. This was the same police force that accosted and bundled up Singaporean activists into police vans.</strong></em><br><em></em><br><em>My tears were too sacred for them to have contact with the defiling instruments of the regime . I held back my emotions. Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_49" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> joked <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_50" class="blsp-spelling-error">abit</span> as we backed out into C<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_51" class="blsp-spelling-error">oleman</span> Street before heading towards Police Cantonment Complex. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_52" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kaixiong</span> broke into a song along the way.</em><br><strong><br><em>I thought about the state of which this country was in and the position a citizen was in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_53" class="blsp-spelling-error">vis</span>-a-<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_54" class="blsp-spelling-error">vis</span> a foreigner and the State. The verdict was depressing. We were mere
                      digits. To be enslaved. To be taxed. To be bled. AND to be silenced.</em></strong><br><em></em><br><em>The time is 0040hrs 16<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_55" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> March 2008. It has been a long day. I will recite the events at the Police Station in Part 2.</em></p>

                  Parliament house Singapore. My admiration and congratulations go out to
                  you.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Firstly my congratulations to the peaceful
                  protestors of March 15, 2008 on World Consumer Rights day in front of
                  Parliament House Singapore. An excellent job. Well done.</p>
              <p>By your
                  action, you have just caused Lee Kuan Yew and the government of his son
                  even more problems than they already have.</p>
              <p>In this war that goes on in
                  Singapore, the forces of democracy are advancing bit by bit, moving
                  ahead while the Lee family who run Singapore are losing day by day.<br><br>The
                  state owned and controlled media, Channellnewsasia, just as all the
                  other news media is owned and controlled by the Singapore government
                  carried a story, "Chee Soon Juan and 20 others stage protest outside
                  Parliament", 15th March 2008. This Singapore government newspaper whose
                  principle activity is to disseminate propaganda favorable to the
                  government reports that 20 persons including Dr. Chee Soon Juan of the
                  Singapore Democratic Party staged a protest outside Parliament House on
                  Saturday afternoon, March 15, 2008. At this point, we have to stop and
                  correct the misinformation. It was not 20 people. It was 50! So you
                  have got a lie right there for you!<br><br>The reporter for this state
                  controlled newspaper Hasnita A Majid, who works for this newspaper as a
                  purveyor of propaganda, perhaps because she can't find any other job,
                  writes that Dr. Chee and others ignored repeated warnings to stop the
                  "unlawful assembly".<br><br>Wait a minute. Another blatant lie. The
                  assembly was not unlawful at all. <strong>The Constitution of Singapore
                  specifically guarantees the right of assembly.</strong> It is the government
                  trying to disperse it that is illegal. Not Dr. Chee and his friends who
                  are in the legitimate exercise of their constitutional rights.<br><br>She
                  writes that "police officers faced resistance from some of the members
                  of the group who struggled and locked their arms together. Police
                  equipment including a police radio set was damaged". I am not surprised
                  at this at all. Surely these peaceful protestors are only exercising
                  their rights to defend themselves against police brutality and illegal
                  acts. The police should expect their equipment to be damaged since they
                  can expect peaceful citizens to resist the illegal actions of this
                  police force acting to protect Lee Kuan Yew and his illegal regime.<br><br>In
                  fact, it is the government that should compensate these peaceful
                  protestors for any damage they had suffered and Mr. M Ravi, Attorney at
                  Law, who is reported to be legal counsel for these protestors; should
                  take up the challenge and file a lawsuit for compensation for his
                  clients.<br><br>This reporter or rather propaganda disseminator, for
                  want of a better term, Hasnita A Majid reports that Miss Chee Siok
                  Chin, a committee member of the Singapore Democratic Party and the
                  sister of Dr. Chee "tried to bite a female officer when the latter
                  tried to arrest her". Now tell me who wouldn’t when one is falsely
                  being arrested and detained! A man would have hit the female officer. A
                  woman bites. But the reaction is not only expected, it is also
                  justified. I would have hit her, no doubt about it.<br><br>This
                  reporter Majid goes on to say that Dr. Chee has held "unlawful
                  demonstrations" in the past and that this is not the first time;
                  whereas in this instance Dr. Chee and the others had escalated their
                  defiance and had begun to use standard militant protest methods by
                  locking arms. I am pleased that Dr. Chee and his friends have become
                  more defiant and have deliberately resisted arrest. There is nothing
                  wrong in resisting an unlawful arrest as in this case. Such resistance
                  is not only justified; it is honorable.<br><br>This propaganda agent
                  says that the attack by Ms. Chee Siok Chin will be investigated. I
                  think we all expect that of this government. Ms. Chee, I and almost
                  everyone else who understands Singapore knows that the government will
                  investigate, and file charges. How much good it will do them is
                  uncertain.<br><br>And now comes a blatant unashamed lie by Hasnita A
                  Majid. I will reproduce the entire sentences here. <strong>She says "Police
                  said Chee had earlier applied for a police permit to hold a protest
                  rally. But this "was an empty gesture, as a subsequent posting on SDP's
                  website indicated that SDP intended to proceed with the rally on March
                  15, at 2 pm even though the permit was not obtained."</strong><br><br>Anyone
                  with any understanding of Singapore law as well as the English language
                  full well knows that Hasnita A Majid is unashamedly telling a shameless
                  lie here. The facts are clear. <strong>There was no "empty gesture" on the part
                  of Dr. Chee at all.</strong><br><br>Dr. Chee did apply for a permit to hold the
                  rally, even though Dr. Chee as well as I know that both the requirement
                  of a permit and the law itself is illegal. Dr. Chee could have, if he
                  wanted to, gone ahead with the rally without even applying at all.
                  Singapore is governed, or at least it is supposed to be, governed by
                  the Constitution.<strong> The Constitution is the supreme law.</strong> Any law that
                  violates the constitution is illegal unless a compelling reason can be
                  shown for the law. Dr. Chee had applied, even though he did not have
                  to, for a permit under the Public Order Act. His application was
                  illegally denied. There was no legal basis for denying it.<br><strong><br>In
                  2007, CASE, an organ of the Lee Administration had held a protest at
                  that very location. Furthermore Dr. Chee’s was a peaceful protest.
                  There was not a single possibility that anyone could have been harmed
                  by this peaceful protest.</strong><br><br>Since this government has abused the
                  law by denying this permit, as they routinely do, Dr. Chee subsequent
                  to this, announced that he will go ahead anyway, without the permit. In
                  these circumstances why was Dr. Chee's application for a permit an
                  empty gesture? Dr. Chee was trying to comply even with an unjust law.
                  Since he was disallowed his lawful right to protest, he went ahead
                  anyway. Not an "empty gesture" at all.<br><br>She then finishes with
                  this sentence" Police reiterated that no one is above the law."<strong> I
                  totally agree with her, by pointing out that this Lee Kuan
                  Administration is also not above the law, and I hope that the police
                  will understand that. </strong>The Constitution of Singapore applies to them as
                  well as Dr. Chee. <strong>It gives Dr. Chee the right to peaceful assembly.
                  Please respect that right keeping in mind that Lee Kuan Yew and the
                  Singapore government are not above the law.</strong><br><br>The good news is
                  this. In this clash between these civic minded protestors and this
                  government trying to impose unacceptable repressive laws, the loser
                  each time is Lee Kuan Yew and his son's government.<br><br>Singapore is
                  a small country with 3 million people or so. It is reliant on an
                  educated workforce, in the English language. It is not a rice growing
                  country of peasants. By now Singaporeans, especially the educated ones,
                  are becoming more and more aware of how people in other western
                  countries live, such as in Australia. They too want the same freedoms
                  that others have. <strong>They know there is nothing wrong with peaceful
                  protests. It happens all the time in Sydney, Melbourne or London. Why
                  then should they not be allowed the same freedoms, they ask?</strong><br><br>Singaporeans
                  are already fed up with Lee Kuan Yew and his son's arrogance. They have
                  decided to leave. Emigrate. As you are aware, massive emigration is
                  hurting Singapore, emigration of the most educated and capable. With
                  the news of the arrests of these peaceful protestors, another 1000
                  educated and capable people will join the line for Australia. This
                  hurts Singapore.<br><br>Singapore’s lawyer population has remained
                  stagnant for the last 10 years. 10 years ago, there were 3,200 lawyers.
                  Today we have the same number. No one wants to enter the law. The
                  reason is the lack of the rule of law. With the news of these arrests
                  of these innocent people, a further hundred will immediately leave the
                  profession. No matter what; whether it is more money, scholarships,
                  working from home, working part time and all manner of desperate
                  attempts to stem the decline in numbers, lawyers are leaving the
                  profession and no one is joining. This latest news of the arrests will
                  only increase the resignations even further.<br><br>The Civil Service
                  does not have manpower. The army barracks are empty because no children
                  are being born for national service. Good honest reporters are leaving
                  the news media in Singapore leaving behind dishonest ones such as this
                  Hasnita A Majid.<br><br>I hope Dr. Chee will continue to hold protests.
                  One for UN Day, one for Children’s Day, for Christmas Day, for May Day,
                  for Dr. Chee’s birth day, one for my birthday, whatever. And provoke
                  this government to make more and more mistakes until their government
                  becomes untenable when they will have no choice but to see reason.<br><br><br>From
                  the government position, I can only see 2 alternatives. Either they
                  arrest Dr. Chee and shoot him like Lee Kuan Yew's friends do in other
                  dictatorships or they should stop this stupidity and come to their
                  senses. They should realize that Dr. Chee and the movement for change
                  are unstoppable. These arrests and releasing them a week later will not
                  do any good. It will only embolden them, whereas at the same time the
                  government suffers from the converse effects of their actions.<br><br>With
                  the continuing decline of educated people from Singapore resultant on
                  this government’s stupidity, you will find that almost everyone with
                  any brains have left.</p>
              <p>Leaving behind the likes of this reporter Hasnita
                  A Majid and recent immigrants from Communist China who neither speak
                  nor write English. And of course we cannot forget the Peidu Mama with
                  their infant children from Communist China who are educated in
                  Singapore at government expense while these mothers, on condition they
                  are good looking, work in massage parlors or other places of disrepute!<br><br>I
                  hope I am not being too presumptuous, or too arrogant to say that I
                  believe the large turn out was partly due to my writing in this blog
                  urging both Singaporeans and foreigners alike to show their solidarity
                  and protest to exercise their constitutional right of free assembly.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p><br>In true, you just put your finger to what ails Opposition and why Goh Meng Seng and Chai Ti Lk split off from WP after doing so well a GE2006. On eof the reasons is the disagreement and conservatism in fighting PAP over Cyperspace, and wooing all those Millennials via Cyperspace.</p>
              <p>Malaysia GE2008 demonstrated that Cyperspace is a potent weapon against an incumbent in control of Mass Multi-media, and counre-attacking the Incumbents' policies.</p>
              <p>A new generation of opposition, in tune with the people, not those PAP-domesticate opposition, wasting apcae in aprliament, and "opposite for the sake of opposition".</p>
              <p>Not the likes of Chee Soon Juan, with his high-browed ideas of human rights and democracy when 95% of Singaporeans living in HDB Estates are worried about feeding their families, servicing the onerous HDB mortgage loans, insufficient retirement funds, medical bills, tuition fees and employability.</p>
              <p>Simply forgotten Napolean's saying:</p>
              <p>"An army marches on its stomaches."</p>
              <p>But I will predict that SDP will gatehr momentum and attract more and more disgruntled Singpaoreans.</p>
              <p>Simply that their confrontational polcitics are getting more and more appealing to angry Singpaoreans who felt so helpless to do anhting about it through "proper channels", found no outlets to express their frustrations and to vent their growing anger over the unfairness of PAP Polciies.</p>
              <p>Polciies which tend to favor the Rich &amp; Famous, and demonsntrated such shocking lack of empathy and benevolence, and deviod of sensitivity and callous indifference in awarding tehmselves millions of dollars in salary increment and bonsues, trumpetting the excellent Economy performance, and concurrent refusing "social welfarism" as it will finish off SIngapore.</p>
              <p>Singpaoreans may have reached a breaking point that rather to continue the status quo, they will rather "Singapore is finished" during GE2011.</p>
              <p>There lies the danger of GE2011 where demagogues will hold swerve SIngpaoreans who are so blinded by anger that come voting, it may very well be "ANYTHING BUT PAP".</p>
              <p>GE2011 may very well prove Marx correct: " Revolution is the midwife when Capitalism give birth to Socialism" modifies to "2008 PAP Policies is the midwife when Lee Hsein Loong Regime give birth to Opposition of Millennials".</p>

              <p>The last election in 2006, I was activated to do security coverage at a nomination centre which was a school premises. That was a weekend. When PAP nominees turn up and prepared to go into the area where the nomination took place, which happened to be the school assembly hall, all eyes were like on them. Press local and foreign, and supporters of PAP turned up.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, the SDP came. Excluding the nominee, there were less than 10 persons. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A few</span> journalists approached them. No one cheered. That constituency later had a PAP victory.</p>
              <p>Those who really think that SDP and Chee are heroes, where were you when they made their calls for the sunday rally? When you are in the voting room casting your votes, at places where SDP contested, who did your votes goes to? If so many ppl really supported them, then I must be confused that day. All those cheering must be cheering for the SDP. Support is not only by words. You can support through your acts. You can support through your votes. So, SDP supporters, where are you?</p>
              <p>How come Low cheng Kiang (not sure how to spell his name in English) and Chiam Si Tong are still holding onto their constituency, whereas the SDP never won before? They aint PAP. Guess that's because voters have eyes to see and mind to judge for themselves too.</p>

SDP is stronger so pap is worried that they will win the election, so pap went all out to destroy it, just like mm lee destroyed JBJ.pap is a crook party.They worried they lost ,so by all means, they have to fix the oppositions. They knew that in 1987, the oppositions were very strong, so they cooked up the marxist theory to catch the oppositions.Following that they created GRC to make sure they win. They will find fault to the oppositions by checking their account, income tax and charge them even there is a $2 discreapancy in the taxi fare (CSJ) case.

If for nothing else, as a deterrent to others who are slightly fearful of legal reprecussions when they toy with the idea of joining the protests. I dare say if SDP is not arrested for 3 protests in a row, numbers will grow dramatically. Hence, the govt cannot afford not arresting them, even if they have to do so on charges that dont stick well. I guess they have weighed the pros and cons, "arrest, look abit like a bully, but deterring all but only the most determined protestors."</p></div>
