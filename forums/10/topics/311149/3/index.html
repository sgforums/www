              <p>Opposite of Good is Evil, Law is Lawless, Public Interest is Private Agenda...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Government is elected to do good for the people not practise evil, lawless taking of sucking of monies from people or practise its own hidden agendas and profiteering?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This has been the universal law for ages. If a government has power, it will use the power given or obtained to further the interest of the people to do good and not evil to serve public and not its own private agenda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the opposite of Peaceful? If Police stops someone from holding Peaceful Protest is it not asking the protestors to use violence to overthrow the government for apart from such peaceful protests what else can the protesters do if not able to express their problems to the government causing the problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All over the world it is the same. The monks cannot have peaceful protest so they will turn violent like others in Myanmar. The Malaysian Indians cannot have peaceful protests so they will eventually throw bottles or stones at the police.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If CSJ cannot hold peaceful protests, eventually people around him may just forget about such protests and do something unwise. Who will be the cause of such lawlessness at the end?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do our million-dollar world's best ministers have such basic knowledge or talent to see such cause and effect consequences in running the government?</p>

              <p>u people talk of how screwed up the pap is, and i agree with you, but when it came down times where real action is needed,  what are ur leaders doing? getting thrown into jail?</p>
              <p>seriously, i mean, i loathe the prices going up, i loathe stupid laws, but u do stupid things like standing there with a few lame placards and u expect the PAP to go "hey yah they are right, we should lower the prices."?</p>
              <p>you know why the opposition is still not going strong? is not becoz the pap redraw their GRC and group here group there.. its because u guys are the exact same thing that u are protesting against.. u promise so much, yet u deliver so little.. u make so much noise, but when ppl actually looked at u, they find that u are an empty vessel..</p>
              <p>and what about the stupid views that u opposition supporters have towards ppl who disagree with u? retarded, brainwashed by propaganda, stupid.. i mean come on, have u degraded to george w. bush no.2? "either you're with us, or you're against us"? if ur points are so valid, if ur actions are so morally justified, i'm not even going to be political, just look at how conveniently u all avoided the all time question of "why are children being involved in YOUR lame protests?', there should be no arguments against you at all.. u are so blinded by ur own eagerness to kaobei the pap govt that u have failed to check back on how fucked up u urselves have become..</p>
              <p>and guess what, there are going to be opposition supporters who are going to quote me and start blabbering 'hail the opposition'.. if u guys say singapore is becoming under lee regime, i will say guess what, your leaders got owned by the lee regime. Big time.</p>

              <p>putting aside whether they are a bunch of lollies or smart chaps with a mission, it is clear that sdp wanted to attract as much soundbites as possible, hopefully with foreign media. i think protest is the best way to get those attention. in fact, the skirmishes they had with the police is probably designed by them to show the `outsiders' how they are treated. the fact that it got posted in you tube helped them attained that awareness of what they set out to do.</p>
              <p>realistically speaking, there is no other avenue where sdp or csj could be heard, in singapore.</p>
              <p>i mean, if you want to be the centre of attention in orchard road, a clown suit or birthday suit will certainly capture the imagination of the crowd there. so, i don't think csj is dumb in that respect.</p>

              <p>Hi Deathbait,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a country is run on two sets of law one for the power that be and another for the people like CSJ what future has it got?</p>
              <p>So when you insisted people must obey the law that is fine from one perspective that is government will also uphold the law.</p>
              <p>If the government gives the impression that it does not wish to be subjected to the same law people are being used against, then there is no point painting a picture of lawfulness or rule of law. I hope I do not have to go into details like withholding cyclethon permit from opposition party for anniversary celebration while granting same for its own party amounts to an abuse of power. I suppose I do not have to go into why squandering of our citizens' monies held on trust in the surplus by the government on Shin Corp or some international bank of which minister was an advisor and use of people trust monies to rescue such bank from sub-prime crisis is unlawful under the Company Act or the Corruption Act.</p>

              <p>this one you say one har .... there is a law in Singapore against "illegal assembly without a permit" ... so it's alright then to break the law in Singapore ? ... if you think it's alright to oppose an unjust law and a repressive regime in Singapore, how come not in Tibet ? not in China ? ... how come you seems to be so pro a known repressive regime there ? ...</p>
              <p>I'm quoting from the very source you've cut and pasted from right now ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">In January this year, AFP
              				reported that Chinese police arrested a monk in Tibet for having

              				sentences of 1 to 12 years' imprisonment for alleged separatist
              				activities, including painting a Tibetan national flag,
              				possessing pictures of the Dalai Lama, and distributing materials

              				requirements of "patriotic education," such as the

              				Tibetan Buddhists. Dozens of monks and nuns continued to serve
              				prison terms for their resistance to "patriotic education."

              				from a radio tower, private displays o Dalai Lama pictures were
              				confiscated in urban areas of two Sichuan counties. The

              <p>I think it's a serious over-reaction from the SPF's part to break up the assembly .... and I think there is something even worse going on in china too .... looks like they are getting it a lot worse than what are are gettiing here ... how come you choose to be blind to all this, how come you're practising double standards ? ....</p>
