              If u want to rob a bank,no one is stopping you.But remember,even if you want to rob,pls go n rob GLC banks like DBS and POSB,dont go n rob foreign banks.

              deathbait, is there something wrong with you? I mean, have you ever been to school where you were taught the difference between right and wrong? 
                  
              I am just puzzled. How on earth could you equate bank robbery with citizens exercising their constitutional rights to gather and voice their grievances?? Our constitution grants us the rights to freedom of speech and assembly! If anything, the police are the ones breaking the law by depriving free citizens of those rights.
                  
              In this case, the injustice is even more glaring because while CASE went on with their march, the SDP were denied the very same right.

              <p>because, as i have already pointed out in another thread, protesting without a permit is AGAINST the constitution, not a constitutional right.</p>
              <p>You can be certain CASE had a permit, am I not right?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Thus, to support any party who illegally holds protests is unconstitutional. And if, according to you, being against the constitution is the rule of being wrong instead of right, what does that make you?</p>
              <p>If robbery is wrong because it's against the law, how is protesting illegally right? I went to school...I'm just not quite sure you did.</p>

              <p>If you, however, tell me that the above statements are indeed true, but the police is still in the wrong, then I beg you to explain to me why the police should arrest me if I rob a bank, for apparently to you, breaking the law is not the pre-requisite for police intervention.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... I'd like to see how you'll react one day you find yourself on the short end of the stick.</p>
              <p>Law is law, but if the law is used justly or abused is another question entirely.</p>
              <p>If you want to see things by letter of the law fine with me, but you might find yourself on the short end of the stick one day when some person who knows the loopholes better then you decide it's totally legal to exploit you.</p>
              <p>I'd rather live by the spirit, and not the word of the law. The law is there as a framework to determine what is right and wrong, but right and wrong in itself is much larger then written law and it's up to the conscience of men to decide if they want to follow the law if they have, by conscience come to realize that the law might be wrong in the context of the absolute right and wrong.</p>

              <p>You are right. There is right, and there is wrong. This falls outside the boundaries of the law. The law is there to make sure we do not cross too far over the line. It is not theÂ  definate measure of what is wrong.</p>
              <p>But let's not be misled by these complicated concepts. If you know you're breaking the law, and you continue to do so, you lose all moral highground. Let's be clear on that. The way around bad laws is to change the law, not break it.</p>
              <p>You elect your representatives to parliament. They represent you. They are the check and balance to the system. Too often I hear people who say they are useless...they won't put their necks out for the people. I then question : why did you elect them then?</p>
              <p>The way to do this properly is via slow changes to the system introduced by the representatives who do their job. The system is not isolated from us, the people. We simply can't be bothered to use it. I see alot of disgrunted people here. When was the last time ANY one of you bothered to write to your MP? When was the last time ANY one of you did anything resembling in depth research before electing him to office? If the government fails to do it's job, it is OUR fault. WE don't put in the effort, then act surprised when the shit hits the fan. Then we try to elect opposition party members to office just because they happen not to be PAP. And then we're surprised they don't do a good job.</p>
              <p>The law against large groups of people in public areas is an archaic one, and is perhaps abused in the current situation. BUT IT IS STILL THE LAW. And a society that does not abide by it's laws does not deserve, and cannot for long remain a peaceful society. The correct approach is to elect competent people to office. People who will look into these small details, ever ready to tweak things as situations change.</p>
              <p>So if you don't agree with how the law is being carried out in this incident, WRITE TO YOUR REPRESENTATIVE. Go door to door to campaign for someone you feel WILL give a crap about these small matters. Vote for competent candidates, not just because they belong to a specific party. But for crying out loud, do not defend the actions of these protesters. For make no mistake, they DID knowingly break the law. And everytime someone breaks the law, laws hold less meaning. And I for one do not wish to one day find myself in a society where laws are reduced to nothing.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Remember, two wrongs don't make it right. Don't confuse one wrong with another. The protest was wrong. Simple as that. Just because you feel the law is wrong does not make the protest right.</p>

              Lee Kuan Yew is a person without feelings....Usually when something goes wrong,we will ask ourselves why,and try to solve it.
              
              
              But this LKY simply use force to clear all the problems if he encounter any.(like ppl try to voice out different opinions,he will simply ask them to shut up)
              
              
              I am sure not only most Singaporeans hated him now,even some ppl in the PAP party also hated him deep into bone.Most probably,his own sons also dont like him.            <blockquote>

              <p>The opposition has never won a mega-GRC (5-6 men) in history. The GRC was a useful concept in bringing in minorities into the parliament, but with only 4 major races, is there a need for GRCs to reach 6 men per team, yet only have a requirement of a minimum 1 minority race in each team? We don't need 5-6 men GRCs to bring in minority races.</p>

              Let me enlighten deathbait here about the constitution and our rights as citizens.
              
              HeÃ¢â¬â¢s been going on and on about how the whole protest was illegal because the SDP did not get a permit and examples about bank robberies using his Ã¢â¬ËAlice in WonderlandÃ¢â¬â¢ logic.
              
              Let me explain some fundamentals here. Our rights to freedom of speech and assembly are inalienable. All free citizens are born with these rights. They are not transferable and cannot be taken away. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s the nature of Ã¢â¬ËrightsÃ¢â¬â¢. Now, if the PAP say you can only exercise your rights under certain circumstances or with their permission, then they are not rights but privileges. If that is the case, the PAP should just re-draft the constitution and call them Ã¢â¬Ëprivileges to freedom of speech and assemblyÃ¢â¬â¢.
              
              Yes, parliament passed an act requiring us to get a permit before we can protest. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s a blatant case of tampering with our inalienable rights as citizens. The PAP are therefore guilty of breaking the law themselves. That particular amendment to the Constitution should be declared null and void!
              
              Mr Gopalan Nair has pointed out: Ã¢â¬ÅThere are rare instances, such as serious national issues, where a constitutional provision can be temporarily amended. But such instances, as I said, are very rare.Ã¢â¬ï¿½ Now can anyone tell me, (deathbait you out there?), were there any serious national issues that warranted the police taking action against the peaceful protesters on Saturday?
              
              Yes, we do have a dangerous terrorist on the loose. But that did not prevent CASE from holding their own protest. Why the double standard?

              The PAP think the constitution doesn't matter just because they are uncomfortable with a certain clause granting citizens the rights to free speech and assembly. The PAP are wrong to ignore our rights enshrined in the constitution. 
              
              Either they use the constitution AND respect our rights as citizens or they don't. They can't amend and use the constitution to defend themselves and pretend the part of the constitution granting citizens the rights to freedom of speech and assembly does not exist.
