              <p>the more they are paid, the more they take the nation for granted.   We all don't own gold mine to allow them to dig us dry.    these pap sickos are very contented with their bloody ways of treating us.    We don't owe them a living, it is them who owe us a living, we feed them.  </p>
              <p>WITHOUT THE PEOPLE OF SINGAP0RE, THERE IS NO EXISTENCE OF PAP (PAY AND PAY TILL YOUR DEATH).   So PAP be grateful to the people.    and to those who like me in my past thought that without LKY singapore cannot survive, this is absolutely not true.   Other successful countries have no LKY leading the countries and they survive.   LKY is not indispensable.  </p>

              Too many things are currently going wrong, raising doubts on
              leadership ability among some Singaporeans. One such view.<br>
              Dec 24, 2008<br>
              <br>
              Don't Shake Hands, Hold Fingers! Or Are We Not Paying Our Ministers

              Feed Me To The Fish<br>
              <br>
              "You know, the cure for all this talk is really a good dose of
              incompetent government. You get that alternative and you'll never
              put Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together
              again...and your asset values will be in peril, your security will
              be at risk and our women will become maids in other people's
              countries, foreign workers.' -- MM Lee, justifying pay hikes for
              Singapore ministers, The Straits Times, 5 April 2007.<br>
              <br>
              Assets in all classes are in peril. Some already valueless and
              dead. Where security is concerned, Mas Selamat still jalan. Are we
              having a good dose of the medicine now?<br>
              <br>
              I saw the above video and I realised we should not have reduced
              their bonus and should pay them more. It's a bloody mistake! If we
              do not want a good dose of incompetent government, we jolly well
              pay and pay!<br>
              <br>
              Incompetence does creep in when they are under paid.<br>
              <br>
              After Dr Teo Ho Pin telling me I should be grateful and the show
              &amp; tell by Khaw Boon Wan on Town Councils' investment debacle,
              we are now witnessing Minister Raymond Lim, Chairman of PAP
              Manifesto Committee at work.<br>
              <br>
              When he finger-pointingly tells me that I have to pay 8.5% GST to
              get a completely free bus and MRT service, it seems interesting and
              threatening at the same time.<br>
              <br>
              The way he tells me that I either have to pay more as a commuter or
              a tax payer to help the fat cats profiteer shows how stupid we can
              be. Yes! Either way, we pay! I wonder if transport companies are
              like town councils. Do they need to build a sinking fund to dabble
              in toxic investment too?<br>
              <br>
              Another observation:<br>
              Was he shaking the hands of residents of MacPherson constituency or
              residents of MacPherson Aids/HIV Halfway House? The way he shook
              the hands of the residents speaks volume of how busy he is or how
              clean residents' hands are? Or is "finger touching" a new form of
              greeting in uniquely Singapore?<br>
              <br>
              How can we "bersatu padu bergerak maju or stay together move ahead"
              from bottom up if we keep talking down and dumbing down the
              peasants? According to some culture, it's bloody rude to keep
              pointing your index finger down at people too.<br>
              <br>
              I guess the millions we are paying our ministers now is not even
              enough to teach them the rudiments of good manners.<br>
              <br>
              Maybe to them, we are morons, happy morons, after all!<br>

              I guess the old saying is still true. We pay peanuts, we get
              monkeys.<br>
              <br>
              Obscene peanuts = obscene monkeys!<br>
              <br>
              How can we stay together and move ahead when every time we "Quah
              tio zin, tio pai. Quah tio ter, tio tai"? Roughly translated: See
              god, pray. See pig, slaughter?<br>
              <br>
              Let's be kind to animals!<br>
