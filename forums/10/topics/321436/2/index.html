              <p>Time and time again I see you vehemently defending ALL of our government policies. Not to descredit our government for the good years we've had, but surely not every damn goverment policies are 100% beneficial for our country. I would even say that any discerning citizen would be pretty pissed with the rising inflation, GST increase, ERP and Mas Selamat incident. Are you telling me that all these are for the good of the people? Are you telling me the average Singaporean whose pay doesn't increase but see his liabilities increase together with other screw ups in our administration have no right to be pissed? BUT here you are slamming your average "dulan Singaporean" and opposition supporters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To clarify Im not an opposition supporter nor am I a PAP supporter. I personally feel that there is still not enough quality opposition that can really give PAP a run for their money or convince me that they can do a better job. Until that happens, my vote will still go to the PAP.</p>

              <p>To be a good citizen, he must have the interest of the country and countrymen at heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He will not have the interest of the country or countrymen at heart if he only praise or defend the governing party whatever it may be doing. That will be plain doggieing or ball-carrying or selfish especially if he happens to be a ruling party member or blue-eyed boy of the mightly authoritarian self-praising leader.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So isn't it quite obvious that this assessment of the duties of citizens will answer your question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is part of the past 40 plus years of propagandas of the ruling party that whoever queries the government or governing of the country and its wrongful selfish and protectionist policies as seen in NKF for years and lately Mas Selamat the ruling party will use its media to protray critics as liars or anti-government. It will also push back every problem by asking them to walk the talk or take them on in the next election. These are dirty tricks employed to protect their own selfish wrongdoings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People have now matured with education and hardship. They are not likely to fall wholesale for such propaganda. The fact that you are asking this sort of question like whether supporters of oppositions or critics are or are not smarter than the ruling party ministers only show you have been consciously or subconsciously brainwashed by such repetitive propagandas employed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See all the posts of protagonists of PAP in this forum and you will know what I mean. They are so condescending and always trying to make it look that their views or PAP's views or people are more superior and trying to cast doubt on others like critics or supporters of oppositions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice to these people is : Be humble and look at the posts of people and see the strengths and logics of their arguments e.g. ERP not solving problems or Minister should be penalised for escape of Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So stop saying things to justify PAP dominance and hope-for continuing dominance without answering to any real issues or problems at all now or for the future.</p>

              <p>The lack of quality in our opposition with the exception of a few whom I may not have a chance to vote for causes such a situation. Given the chance a few years back, sure as hell I would have voted for LTK and WP had I not moved from hougang.</p>

              <p>5 Favourite policies ( actually there are more)</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><strong>1. Increase in GST</strong>:- We have no natural resources, thus social spending will have to come from our pockets. No one is going to help us but ourselves. There are some who may not have good opportunities in life, or faced in setback and would need our help. GST monies would help to fund them, give their kids a good education and escape the poverty trap. Furthermore GST is based on free will. If you don't need to buy, you don't need to pay. The more you buy, which shows your spending power, the more you pay GST which will help our fellow countrymen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2. Increase in ERP:-</strong> No one wants to continually pay. But in Spore, we are limited in size. IF you don't need a car, then don't buy one. You will escape such charges easily. Public transport in aircon comfort is still avaliable, and is no loss of 'face'. Even Wall St exec walk, talk buses, the rail lines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3. CDCs:-</strong> the creation of one stop CDCs to help the less well off. Currently the complain is that the elderly gets $300 a month. You and I know it is not enough. But with 20% GST, they will be able to draw more. No point crying that they draw only $300 if you are not willing to contribute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><strong>4. Increase in ministerial salaries</strong>:-</strong> Hot potatoes. Already much debated,  But a necessary even though unprecedented measure to combat corruption and MORE IMPORTANTLY, bring in talents, the educated to help administer the country, run our economy and protect our reserves for your kids to live in a better and improved Singapore of our common future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5. Fighting inflation:-</strong> a.) they source for cheaper products around the world, buy in bulk and charges less than other international corporate shopkeepers.</p>
              <p>b.) they meet up with reformed or semi-reformed dictators, such as N korea, Libya and Russia, whom had been relatively quiet nowadays, to not only help bring about change through better administrative insights, but bring about more trade with our country.</p>
              <p>c. ) the increase in our dollar, so as to help the working population cope with increased in prices, ( but i fear for our exporters)</p>
              <p>d.) EDB's increased activities to woo foreign investments into our country, through the use of cheap foreign workers and experience foriegn talents, which in turn adds more job to our workers. And upgrading grants to help the young and old to upgrade their skills so that they too may be gainfully employed.</p>
              <p>Want more? But it wouldn't be fair. Why not you or others here tell me what are your hated policies and why, so that others may see if it is intellligent critically or critically ignorant. </p>

              favourite policies? You can scold me if i presume to go ahead.</p>
              <p>5 Favourite policies ( actually there are more)</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><strong>1. Increase in GST</strong>:- We have no natural
              resources, thus social spending will have to come from our pockets.
              No one is going to help us but ourselves. There are some who may
              not have good opportunities in life, or faced in setback and would
              need our help. GST monies would help to fund them, give their kids
              a good education and escape the poverty trap. Furthermore GST is
              based on free will. If you don't need to buy, you don't need to
              pay. The more you buy, which shows your spending power, the more
              you pay GST which will help our fellow countrymen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2. Increase in ERP:-</strong> No one wants to
              continually pay. But in Spore, we are limited in size. IF you don't
              need a car, then don't buy one. You will escape such charges
              easily. Public transport in aircon comfort is still avaliable, and
              is no loss of 'face'. Even Wall St exec walk, talk buses, the rail
              lines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3. CDCs:-</strong> the creation of one stop CDCs to help
              the less well off. Currently the complain is that the elderly gets
              $300 a month. You and I know it is not enough. But with 20% GST,
              they will be able to draw more. No point crying that they draw only
              $300 if you are not willing to contribute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><strong>4. Increase in ministerial
              salaries</strong>:-</strong> Hot potatoes. Already much debated,
               But a necessary even though unprecedented measure to combat
              corruption and MORE IMPORTANTLY, bring in talents, the educated to
              help administer the country, run our economy and protect our
              reserves for your kids to live in a better and improved Singapore
              of our common future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5. Fighting inflation:-</strong> a.) they source for
              cheaper products around the world, buy in bulk and charges less
              than other international corporate shopkeepers.</p>
              <p>b.) they meet up with reformed or semi-reformed dictators,
              such as N korea, Libya and Russia, whom had been relatively quiet
              nowadays, to not only help bring about change through better
              administrative insights, but bring about more trade with our
              country.</p>
              <p>c. ) the increase in our dollar, so as to help the working
              population cope with increased in prices, ( but i fear

              <p>1) Singapore government has imposed various taxes that are unheard of in most other countries, such as 110% additional tax on vehicles. Are the government that desperate to depend on the GST to help the poor in the society? If you ask me, I do not believe it.</p>
              <p>2) ERP has time and time proven to be an unwise measure to curb traffic jam and at the same time add onto the financial burden of ordinary Singaporeans. When the government decided to up the population growth to an unprecedent level, it is inevitable that congestion will occur. Have the government consider these problems and other societal problems before implementing the foreign immigration policy? Is economy issue their only consideration?</p>
              <p>3) For your information, the government only increased the CDC to $290, not $300. Our budget surplus is worthed billions of dollar (I do know that not every year is a budget surplus). I cannot comprehend why the government has no financial mean to help these poor and elderly except to tax from the other citizens?</p>
              <p>4) Ministerial pay increment has being debated countless of times as you have mentioned. But mark my word, their reasons for the increment are an insults to Singaporeans' intelligence.</p>
              <p>5) Inflation. Fair enough. The government has no mean to control oil and food prices, which contribute much to our inflation rate.</p>
              <p>The above are just my opinions.</p>

              <p>1. Increase in GST. Singaporeans already contribute to CPF coupled with the existing GST. It is also a known fact that we charge the one of the highest amount of taxes for alcohol and cigarettes. Our "losers"(according to our MM) do contribute to GST too. If the true motive is to prevent the expansion of the income gap? Shouldn't there be a more effective way which would exempt those whom the government aims to bring out of the poverty trap? How much is enough? With our reserves and state owned companies not enough for such funding?</p>
              <p>2. Increase in ERP. Yes, I agree, Singapore is small and owning a car is a luxury to some extent. But you do realise that with exhorbitant road taxes and the COE which is Unique Singapore, we're paying a heft price for such a luxury already. If the true motive of putting up more ERP gantries is to improve the flow of traffic, should something more effecient such as improving our road infrastructure be implemented? To increase ERP charges together with more gantries in itself is a regressive policy. Furthermore, ERP charges also bear down on taxi passengers. Coupled with increase in taxi fares, I wonder how badly cabbies are affected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. CDC. I concur that these one stop CDCs do assist our people in one way or another, however please refer to point 1 as stated. There should be better ways to assist our people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Ministerial Salaries. Here we go again. The main idea that the government tries to drive home to justify their wages is to prevent corruption and attract talent into our civil SERVICE. I agree that our ministers need to be well paid and well fed, but how much is enough? 6 times that of Mr. George Bush? Thats ridiculous! Some say that in itself is open corruption, but I will stop short of making such allegations or "slander" as a certain someone on these boards would put it. If we need to fork out such astronomical sums to attract talent into our civil SERVICE, I question where their allegiance lies. Their own interests and pockets or the interests of the public of whom they are duty bound to render their SERVICE. Please take note that they are serving their country and people and that in itself should take precedence over monetary gains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Fighting inflation. How does bringing in more foreign workers fight inflation? You claim that these foreign workers create employment opportunites for locals, but is that really the case? Even if that holds true, any employment they create in itself is cancelled off by the ones that they hold. Coupled with the host of social problems that we all associate with them especially the PRCs, is it really a wise move?</p>

              <p>Our society has never encourage more car ownership, simply because we don't have enough land for more road. But our society realizes the aspirations of some who may see it as a prestige symbol or a need, thus ERP came about - not to curb ownership, but to regulate the flow and quantity of cars here and compensate other owners of Singapore who do not own a car.</p>
              <p>Such collected monies goes into our coffers and is either saved for our next generation or spend for the social welfare or social programs to help this current generation. 3.5million citizens is alot of people and we need more than millions to help all.</p>
              <p>As for CDC help, i personally would want them to ensure the truly needy gets it, and not those who stay in mansions with children but are old attempts to collect it. It takes time to thoroughly check, afterall, its our money, not theirs.</p>
              <p>I would say that those 5 policies are my favourites, but it can be fine tuned to make it better. And to fine tune, we need intelligent and educated action men in service, not a bunch of slanderers or whiners sitting on their butt doing nothing but complain all day. </p>

              <p>1. Increase in GST. It is meant to pull the gap of the rich and poor closer together with government payouts. By the way, alcohol, cigarettes and cars are considered luxury items for individuals. If the poor cant pay for it, then dont buy it. Unless, you are talking about the new "poor".</p>
              <p>2) ERP goals: You pay for the amount of road you use. Sounds fair. In fact, I agreed on the ERP rules. Tax more on car users and subsidize on public transport. Helps the poor, promote the green.</p>
              <p>5) With a strong Singapore dollar, Singaporeans pay much less to buy things. But also, with a strong Singapore dollar, companies will be least willing to invest in Singapore. However, with foreign workers in Singapore, it attract investments in Singapore. Thus, indirectly helps to fight inflation.</p>

              <p><br>1. Basic necessities do not escape from GST either. There are more efficient ways then to increase or GST again to brigde the wealth gap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Is there really a need with the heft road taxes, coe inherent together with existing ERP? Taxis arent exempted from ERP either. Are taxis not public transport?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Yes agreed, hence I never did contend that a strong Singapore Dollar would not do us good in my post. But does the increase in investment create as many jobs that are taken up by these foreign workers?</p>

              <p>Subsidize public transport? You mean the little amount of coupons they give while the public transport prices continue to increase?</p>

              <p><br>To be frank, we are not here to kick the PAP away or to damage its reputation. We must reckon that PAP government had done a lot for the rapid progress of Singapore.</p>
              <p>However, there are still much room for improvement. And the current batch of PAP leaders are so disappointing. I wonder if they are more interested to serve their pockets or to serve the citizens.</p>

              <p>Spartans,</p>
              <p>I didn't mentioned names and yet those slanderers are ready to put words in my mouth. If you read that sentence,sequentially I only meant those in service, more so those civil servants and opposition MPs. These people are paid a fee irregardless if it is only a dollar or a million dollars. They accepted the job and will have to perform.</p>
              <p>As for forumers here, others are free to judge them on the quality they contribute. While it is true they are not paid millions, thing is, neither should they be free to slander against people who are only trying their best to make things work for us. Criticise by all means, and others will judge the category of criticism it falls upon and react accordingly.</p>
              <p>I had read your earlier criticism and found it written only as a perception according to your belief system, and nothing malicious as compared to the more slanderous types here. There are only certain issues that you may not be sure of, and i sincerly hope you will find the solutions acceptable to you one day. </p>
