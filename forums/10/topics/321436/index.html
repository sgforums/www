              <p>I have noticed that whenever someone support our government policy, he/she will be labeled as blinded by their propaganda, brain washed government controlled media, PAP dogs etc.</p>

              <p>Time and time again I see you vehemently defending ALL of our government policies. Not to descredit our government for the good years we've had, but surely not every damn goverment policies are 100% beneficial for our country. I would even say that any discerning citizen would be pretty pissed with the rising inflation, GST increase, ERP and Mas Selamat incident. Are you telling me that all these are for the good of the people? Are you telling me the average Singaporean whose pay doesn't increase but see his liabilities increase together with other screw ups in our administration have no right to be pissed? BUT here you are slamming your average "dulan Singaporean" and opposition supporters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To clarify Im not an opposition supporter nor am I a PAP supporter. I personally feel that there is still not enough quality opposition that can really give PAP a run for their money or convince me that they can do a better job. Until that happens, my vote will still go to the PAP.</p>

              <p>Maybe they should start following China's Communist tactics, I heard from my cousin in China, whenever there are some issues being discussed in the forums there. The government will put a temporary ban on those forums. My cousin said it happened sometime last year and this year, he could not access alot of the forums because alot of the netizens were talking about the increases in food prices in China. This was months before the global increase in the price of rice.</p>
              <p>China's inflation is a result of the inability of the communist government to control the money supply with stellar growth rates in the economy.</p>

              <p>i dunno.. most never looked beyond the superficial in the deceit of CSJ... i'd say they're stupid..</p>
              <p>however, i will say that some of the opposition supporters do figure out that substance is much more important than style and know the man who will work for them, for the people.. there are some really outstanding opposition fellas out there whom i would be proud to vote for.. people who are "smart" would vote for them.. because these opposition people serve a higher calling.. that of serving the people..</p>
              <p>that being said, there are those who are "smart" in their own ways who are supporters of the MIW.. let's just say they have a vested interest and are looking out for themselves... would that be considered dumb?</p>
              <p>the MIW panders to those people with vested interests... and therein, they are successful...</p>
