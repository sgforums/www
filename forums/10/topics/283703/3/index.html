And if memory serves me right, our late President Ong once sanctioned a strike in Singapore. Obviously then PM LKY wasn't too pleased, considering he was one of the chosen 4 to replace LKY as PM.<br><br>The thing is, you have to understand that the law was created for a reason. I believe the legislators had the racial riots and the communist rallies in mind when drafting such laws. Hence, it seems rather oppressive now but served a purpose then. Granted, I believe (or hope to) that Singaporeans as a whole has matured. This particular piece of legislation should come under review, and possibly be reformed. Speaking to MPs, sending letters to the govt and writing in to the press aren't the only ways to provide constructive feedback.<br><br>I believe that Singaporeans have matured to a stage where they can voice their opinions through peaceful protestation, and our police can handle the situation adequately.</div>

I think you will just be locked up for the rest of your life at the President's pleasure. They've got plenty of such laws to use, and they have the ability to hold people indefinitely without trial. Granted, due to the nature of the legislation, they use it sparingly. But the fact that they still do says something.<br><br>Also, put it this way. It takes smart, brave and passionate people to actually be able to effect change against the govt. I look up to our late President Ong for that. He got himself into the Presidency with PAP backing, then went on to do his job. He kept the PAP on their toes, and I believe if not for his wife and his illness, he would have stood for re-election. He commented that once, the govt approved the sale of POSB to DBS without his approval, and he openly voiced his displeasure. Under the Consitution, you have to inform the President. Needless to say, everyone ended up quite unhappy and if I'm not mistaken, the President now has lesser powers. Not that it matters.</div>
