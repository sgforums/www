His policies don't quite seem to hit the right notes with the public.<br><br>I'd prefer an opposition politician who will go into the Parliament and ask the right questions. The govt can throw up all sorts of numbers that they want about GDP, investment returns projections, policies for continued economic growth and fancy things like that, but simple questions can be overlooked. If you wateched Jack Neo's Just Follow Law, you'll see this scene where Gurmit Singh and his buddies go something like "govt always say economy is good, but where is the money? GST keep increasing, but my salary never increase leh."<br><br>It takes a brave and passionate person to actually ask simple questions like that. Rather than asking what your stand is when dealing with foreign policies, simple questions like "Mr Tan Ah Kow here has been a taxi driver for 20 years and his salary is still only barely $2000 a month after working 16 hour days almost daily. What are you doing to help people like him?" These questions make the govt sweat and are close to the hearts of Singaporeans.<br><br>Fact is, I believe you don't need eloquence nor complex forward planning leaders all the time. You need leaders who are in-tune with the ground. What's the point of charging forward if no-one follows? That's where I feel that CSJ  and our current govt are getting it wrong. Still, I commend him for his bravery to stand up and sacrifice his life for his beliefs.  </div></blockquote>What is Chee doing this for is something we got to ask ourselves. He says he wants to raise issues Singaporeans don't know. Every where I go, people talk as if they have already listened to Chee. They complain that the opposition cannot win because of the GRC. They say it's bad that one family in Singapore, including the daughters-in-law, have so much power. Some even say corruption is sure to happen. but Chee's party (SDP) gets the lowest votes.<br><br>So the people do know the issues. Chee can't have not realised that people know the issues, so he gives me the feeling that he is doing it for some other reason.<br><br>But the PAP always win in the end. I conclude that Singaporeans want something else. There are people struggling in Singapore. There are people struggling any country. So are the issues enough to get PAP being voted out? They want good management of the country that gives them the basics in life. Even the opposition MPs stay in power through good management of the estate although the other role they play in Parliament is a totally different ball game from estate management.</div>
