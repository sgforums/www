Try to publish an article in a local newspaper which criticises the government. God too does not have freedom of speech? No idea what you're talking about there. Want to deliver a speech to exercise your rights? No can do, gotta get a permit and good luck trying to get a permit to deliver a speech to the public about the shortcomings of the government. The Lee family has never lost a case in the supreme court, what does that tell you?<br><br>You Singaporeans are denied even basic human rights which are taken away by the use of corporal punishment. The condition of your prison cells violate UN regulations. Many people are locked away as 'political prisoners'. Their crime? Speaking out against the government for which they were imprisoned without trial. Still think you have your rights?</div></blockquote>Reading your post, I know you don't know exactly what you are ranting about. Your mind is simple. To you protest marches means you have rights. How simple can you get.<br>What you want to see is PROTEST, you want ACTION, ROITS, and your grouse is you are not getting any of that here.<br>"You Singaporeans are denied even basic human rights....." this shows you don't even know what human rights is.

You are so naive it's pathetic. If you have rights why don't you exercise them? Why don't you speak out against the government? Oh so what you're saying is you <strong>can't</strong> do that? That's not freedom of speech my friend.<br><br>You obviously don't know what basic human rights are. The justice system here negates basic human rights it's just that your head is obviously way too far up your own ass to know that. If your knowledge is so great like you make it out to be you'd know about the UN human rights regulations but you obviously don't. So stop acting like you're so omnipotent and put aside your blind patriotism for a moment to get a good hard look at the situation for what it really is.<br><br>You say you have all these rights yet you say you can't exercise them.

Suppose i go up to Lee Hsien Loong and berate him for compelling us to purchase an annuity that many do not believe in. Further if i go on to say that he does not respect what we think even though his salary comes from the taxes and he should step down because he does not deserve to be the PM etc will i get sued ?</blockquote>But I can assure you, that no sane Singaporean, including you, would dare to try that, because you know very well that while you may not get sued, your life in SG after you berated PM Lee won't be easy-going either.<br>There's a lot of work behind the scenes to make sure you pay for it.<br>And because of that, most SGreans don't dare to speak up.<br><br>recently, at this MM Lee forum where students were supposed to field questions, no SGreans dare to ask him question. only foreigners.<br>a couple of SGreans started to ask questions only after MM Lee says "Are there no Singaporean who have questions?"<br><br>if MM Lee didn't say that, do u seriously think locals would dare to speak up?<br><br>last year in the PAP / opposition election, got this show where reporters ask MM Lee questions also, and this guy ask MM Lee some questions, but in the end....something happened and he quietened down. dunno if you guys still remember that, but it was in the news.<br><br>what i wanna say is: u offend SG gahmen, u die.<br><br>your words, no matter how factual, will get twisted and turned back at YOU until in the end, you're the one who makes a wrong move and unwittingly slanders them, afterwhich they'll use their trademarked bloodless killing technique on you.<br><br>(Othello Red)<br><blockquote>I look up to our late President Ong for that. He got himself into the Presidency with PAP backing, then went on to do his job. He kept the PAP on their toes, and I believe if not for his wife and his illness, he would have stood for re-election. He commented that once, the govt approved the sale of POSB to DBS without his approval, and he openly voiced his displeasure. Under the Consitution, you have to inform the President. Needless to say, everyone ended up quite unhappy and if I'm not mistaken, the President now has lesser powers. Not that it matters.</blockquote>which is why i say, we're under a regime....or.....should i say....a dynasty?<br>Lee Dynasty (1965 - ?).<br><br>recently, some big shot at F&amp;N corporation quit his job and there's speculation it's cos' of Lee Hsien Yang (also known as The 3rd God, after PM Lee and MM Lee).<br><br>(Herzog Zwei)<br><blockquote>Nope, Because Dr Chee tends to challenge without solving the problems and SDP just supports him.

I believe there and then, they would have gotten a lot more credibility if they came out and admitted that they weren't doing some things right, and that it was time to change. Better still, they have decided to further test the limits of the people this year with this fabulous new scheme to cozen, i mean protect our money for our retirement.<br><br>Seriously, if they continue to believe that ignorance is bliss, I believe they will have to look for new jobs in the near future.</div>

The justice system here negates basic human rights it's just that your head is obviously way too far up your own ass to know that.
