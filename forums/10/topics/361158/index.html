              in every man than they are; neither do they receive any
              additional strength when declared by the municipal [or state]
              laws to be inviolable. On the contrary, no human legislation
              has power to abridge or destroy them, unless the owner [of the

              <h1 class="parseasinTitle"><span id="btAsinTitle">Dark Ages America: The Final Phase of Empire</span></h1>
              <p>A work of breathtaking erudition and synthesis, DARK AGES AMERICA
              offers no hope for arresting America's career as a self-destructive
              global hegemon. While that's a difficult conclusion to swallow, Berman
              amply defends his thesis, drawing his supporting evidence from a
              variety of disciplines: history, cultural studies, polling data,
              economic analysis, sociology and social psychology. The possibility of
              America's turning away from its dark destiny, which in Mr. Berman's
              analysis is now clearly manifest, is made to seem remote, and,
              regrettably, convincingly so. <br> <br>Particularly compelling is Mr. Berman's discussion of America's
              need for an enemy, an Other upon which to focus in order that we never
              turn our attention to the emptiness at the center of the American
              psyche: The Red Menace, the Cold War, the War on Drugs, The War on
              Terror. Each of these wars has served to diminish and even outlaw
              critical thinking about America's empiric career. In a constant state
              of emergency, history for Americans is a set of bullet points which are
              cynically served up as justification for the latest military adventure.
              Berman's anecdotes and survey findings paint an American populace that
              is self-absorbed, provincial, and willfully anti-intellectual, a people
              for whom bullet points more than suffice.
              <br> <br>We watch television shows about tightly knit families and groups of
              friends, staving off the loneliness generated by the individualistic,
              devil-take-the-hindmost ethos that is America's real civil religion,
              Berman says. We turn away from the terror that we inflict on innocent
              people in order that we may claim their oil wealth and so keep this
              dwindling life-blood flowing in the veins of the American project of
              global empire. We pay no attention to the vast sums of money spent to
              prop up the energy-military-industrial complex. Instead we are
              distracted by cynical stories of welfare queens, wicked tax and spend
              liberals, evil dictators and axes of evil, our resentments kept
              well-stoked and smoldering.
              <br> <br>On a personal note, landing at Kansas City International Airport
              the other day, my vision of America altered by my in-flight reading of
              Mr. Berman's remarkable work, I saw the landscape through new eyes, a
              landscape I now understood to have been systematically vandalized by
              the corporatocracy: big box stores, chain hotels and restaurants, strip
              malls and gas stations, a landscape everywhere repeated across the
              United States, a landscape we intend to impose upon the world in order
              to fulfill our destiny as bringer of freedom as expressed through
              consumption. <br> <br>While this cookie-cutter landscape had always before aroused in me
              a sense of unease, an unease that had become in me clich? and so easily
              subdued, with the assistance of Berman's perspicacious vision, I became
              alive to the fact that this American landscape represents in physical
              form the ingenuity and monomania of America's new empiric form. <br> <br>Empty of community, driven by the ethos of radical individualism, I
              saw an interlocking system of endless consumption in which we are all
              driven by the relentless stoking of our vanity and desire by clever
              marketers who have taught us to confuse social goods with economic
              goods, and by a political structure which mystifies cause and effect,
              which ruthlessly condemns anyone who has the temerity to question the
              course of this bleak, empty empire.</p>

              <p>Millions of years ago, even before men became human, they had a need
              for defence of the group, because it is perfectly obvious that men
              cannot live outside of groups. They can satisfy their needs only by
              cooperating within a group. But I'll go further than that, and return
              to it again in a moment: Men will not become men unless they grow up in
              communities. We will come back to that because it is the basis of my
              lecture tonight.</p>
              <p>If you have a group, it must be defended against outsiders; that's
              military. Before men came out of the trees they had that need. If your
              needs are to be satisfied within some kind of group, you must have ways
              of settling disputes and arguments, and reconciling individual problems
              within the group; that's political. You must have organizational
              patterns for satisfying material needs, food, clothing, shelter: that's
              economic.</p>
              <p>Then came two which have been largely been destroyed or frustrated
              in the last thousand years of Western Civilization. Men have social
              needs. They have a need for other people; they have a need to love and
              be loved. They have a need to be noticed.</p>
              <p>Sirhan Sirhan killed Robert
              Kennedy because no one had ever noticed him and he was determined that,
              from now on, someone would know he existed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In fact, most of these
              "motiveless" assassinations are of this type.</strong></span> Someone went up to the
              top of the University of Texas tower and shot something like seventeen
              people before they caught him. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That was because no one had ever noticed
              him.</strong></span> People need other people. That's the social need. The basis of
              social relationships is reciprocity: if you cooperate with others,
              others will cooperate with you.</p>
              <p>The next is emotional need. Men must have emotional experiences.
              This is obtained in two ways that I can see: moment to moment
              relationships with other people--moment to moment-- and moment to
              moment relationships with nature. Our society has so cluttered up our
              lives with artefacts-- TV sets or automobiles or whatever-- and
              organizational structures that moment to moment with nature are almost
              impossible.  Most people don't even know what the weather outside is
              like. Someone said recently that until September we had a great drought
              here in Washington, and four or five people standing there said,
              "That's ridiculous." We had a shortage of about eight inches of rain.
              Because they're in buildings, it doesn't matter to them whether it's
              raining or not.</p>
              <p> The next is the religious. It became fashionable in Western
              Civilization, particularly in the last hundred years, to be scornful of
              religion. But it is a fact that human beings have religious needs. They
              have a need for a feeling of certitude in their minds about things they
              cannot control and they do not fully understand, and with humility,
              they will admit they do not understand them. When you destroy people's
              religious expression, they will establish secularised religions like
              Marxism.</p>
              <p>Now, on the intellectual level: people have intellectual needs.  I
              used to tell students that Marilyn Monroe had profound intellectual
              needs. And when no one would treat her as an intellect or even as a
              potential intellect, for obvious reasons, she was starved for
              intellectual experience. That's why she married a man like Arthur
              Miller: she thought he was an intellectual.</p>
              <p>A community is made up of intimate relationships among diverse types of
              individuals--a kinship group, a local group, a neighbourhood, a
              village, a large family. Without communities, no infant will be
              sufficiently socialized. He may grow up to be forty years old, he may
              have made an extremely good living, he may have engendered half a dozen
              children, but he is still an infant unless he has been properly
              socialized and that occurs in the first four or five years of life.</p>

              <p>The basic entity we must understand is the civilization as a whole. Although I tell you I'm going to talk about the last thousand years, 976-1976, Western Civilization, of which we are a part, has been around for a considerably longer time than that. We might say Western Civilization began around 550, but there was no significant structure of public authority until almost 1050, with no state at all over the preceding two centuries, 850-1050.</p>
              <p>Yet 950 is significant as the point at which our Western Civilization began the first of its three great Ages of Expansion, 970-1270. (The other two were 1440-1590 and 1770-1890). This first age of expansion applies to the core of Western Civilization, the area between the Rhine River and the Loire, the area which formed the core of the Carolingian Empire (687-887). This Empire was the earliest political structure of the new Western Civilization, one of four new civilizations which sprouted from the ruins of Classical Civilization after A.D. 500.</p>
              <p>These four were Byzantine (330-1453), lslamic'(630-1922), Russian (800-?), and Western (550-?). Each of them modified the traditions it accepted from the ruins of Classical Civilization and created its own distinctive culture.</p>
              <p>Another paradigm I want to establish is a difference between two kinds of civilizations, which means a difference between two kinds of governments in them.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asiatic civilizations, which I call Class B Civilizations, generally do not attempt to deal with individuals or with the problems of individuals; they leave interpersonal relationships to the local or kinship community. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Class A Civilizations include Classical Civilization, our own Western Civilization, or the first Chinese or Sin¡c Civilization, whose dates are 1800 B. C. to 400 A. D. In Class A Civilizations, although the civilization begins as an area of common culture made up of communities, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>there is a long term trend to destroy and break down those communities.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The way I would like to express this would be —and I used to draw it on the blackboard —by saying that all civilizations start out as aggregations of communities. Those communities are generally of two types, either local, such as parishes, neighborhoods, villages or manors; or kinship communities, families, clans and so forth.</p>
              <p>When a civilization begins with such communities, as ours did in 550, there is no state, and there are no atomized individuals. I will not go into the details of this, but in such communities, there are no written laws; all law is customary. Most controls on behavior are what I call internalized, that is, they are built into your hormones and your neurological responses.</p>
              <p>You do what is necessary to remain a member of the community, because if you are not a member of the community, you would be nothing. You would not be a man. As you may know if you have ever studied linguistics, the names which many primitives and not-so-pr¡mitive peoples have for themselves is their word for man.</p>
              <p>The communities from which Classical Civilization came were local villages and manors. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucky civilizations, such as Chinese Civilization over the past 1500 years, generally have communities which are both kinship and local.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What happens in the course of Class A Civilization, over a thousand or more years, is that the fundamental communities are broken up and gradually disintegrate into smaller and smaller groups, and may end up simply as what we call nuclear families, a father and a mother, who eventually lose all discipline and control of their own children. </strong></span>The result of this process is a state which is not only sovereign but totalitarian, and it is filled with isolated individuals.</p>
              <p>Of the four civilizations which came out of Classical Antiquity's wreckage,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> two, Islamic and Byzantine, clearly are Class B Civilizations, that is, they continued to work for communities.</strong></span> Their governments were governments of limited powers, of which the most important were raising money and recruiting soldiers. The finest example of such an Asiatic Despotism was the Mongolian Empire of Jenghiz Khan about A. D. 1250, but its origins go back to the Persian Empires of the Achaemenids and the Sassan¡ds.</p>
              <p>Good examples of such a structure are the Chinese Civilization of 220-1949, the Byzantine Empire after 640, and the Islamic sultanates which eventually culminated in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
              <p>The efforts of the Carolingian Franks to establish a similar empire in Western Civilization collapsed and led to the Dark Age of 860-970.</p>
              <p>These eastern political traditions might be called Providential Empire or Providential Monarchy, and they are associated with the idea of a Providential Deity. To us today, who shove religion off into a corner and insist that it must have nothing to do with politics or business or many other things, it may be hard to grasp that one of the most potent things in establishing the structure of the state in any civilization has always been man's idea of the nature of deity. . . .</p>

              <p>It is interesting that people are mentioning the role of religion in the establishment of civilization. The sad fact is that the contemporary ignorance prevalent in western civilization (or shall I say anglo-american empire) forces people who want to engage in any kind of useful public debate to act on a first principles basis, to put the idea of God aside, like a joke. I think this is in part because within the anglo-american context, religious institutional authority  has failed to reconcile itself with the secular beliefs of Natural Law and vise versa, i.e. what the Church says that Jesus taught and what the scientists (the secular priests) says that Darwin taught don't mesh. To the point that all debate by people who fanatically accept the extreme views of either camp will invariably descend into chaos.</p>
              <p>What then has happened is that secular life has become irreligious and downright immoral while religious life has become disconnected with reality. The fact is that it is altogether natural and normal for enlightened religion to be reconciled with what Mankind has observed of the universe. The failure today is due to the contesting power centres of the religious and secular institutions within anglo-american society. It can be said that the neo-conservative movement was an attempt at a new reformation but the catastrophic failures of the ongoing neo-conservative project shows that the people who man the helms of religious, secular and economic power centres are all lacking in any broad and progressive ideas. The failures are all very evident and I propose will continue to be compounded as long as the blind faith in what our anglo-american instructors tell us about religous, secular and economic life perpetuates.</p>
              <p>The mistake of Islamic extremists is to diagnose that the cure to the problem is to destroy the entire anglo-american empire. This would mean plunging the world into chaos. I propose that what is actually needed is more meritocracy, in the truest sense of the word. Only in this way can good ideas take hold and do their good work.</p>
