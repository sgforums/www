              <p><em>Monday, 27 July 2009 - Singapore Democrats</em> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/lehman_hk_protest.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it a coincidence that victims of the Lehman Brothers scam in Hong Kong are 
              being compensated for their losses whereas those in Singapore are 
              not?<br><br>Hong Kong's financial authorities have taken action to pressure 
              banks to pay back at least 60 percent (more for older victims) to each investor 
              for their losses incurred as a result of buying the toxic financial products 
              from Lehman.<br><br>In contrast, Singaporeans are told that they have to jump 
              through hoops just to have their claims heard.</p>
              <p>Even then, they are made to wait for their cases to be heard and, in many 
              cases, are told that their money is irretrievably gone.<br><br>Either that or 
              they have to initiate litigation to claim compensation which is an expensive 
              process with no guarantee of success.<br><br>Perhaps, the most telling 
              difference is DBS's reaction to the two sets of investors.</p>
              <p>The Singapore bank 
              volunteered that it would <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=72716&amp;sid...">refund</a> Hong Kongers who purchased its troubled products whereas no similar move was 
              made for Singaporeans.<br><br>So why the difference between Hong Kong and 
              Singapore?<br><br>For one thing, the authorities of Hong Kong are still 
              accountable (and therefore responsive) to its people. This is because its 
              elections are much freer and fairer compared to what we have in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Elected representatives have to respond to the voice and mood of the 
              electorate.<br><br>In Singapore, MPs also have to remain attuned to the voice 
              and mood, but not of the voters. Instead they have to keep an eye and ear out 
              from what their party bosses say. In this matter the PAP, and hence all its MPs, 
              were more intent on protecting the establishment and its system than helping the 
              investor-victims.<br><br>And their party bosses have molded the election system 
              in such a way that they will never lose power. If they cannot lose power, what 
              incentive is there for them to pay attention to the voters?<br><br>Members of 
              the Legislative Council in Hong Kong have to be sensitive to what their 
              constituents say. Public opinion matters because it is broadcast and published 
              by the media which is reknowned for its freedom and independence from the ruling 
              class.<br><br>Singapore's media, on the other hand, can be turned on and off by 
              the PAP. This is not hard to do when the Singapore Press Holdings is controlled 
              by none other than former deputy prime minister Dr Tony Tan.<br><br>In addition, 
              Hong Kongers enjoy freedoms of speech and public assembly – and the Lehman 
              victims have exercised their freedom well. It was through their public protests 
              that the banks agreed to compensate them for their losses.<br><br>Alas, 
              Singaporean investors can only gather at Hong Lim Park – away from the eyes and 
              ears of the people for whom their angry message was intended. As a result, the 
              banks were free of the pressure to negotiate and compensate.<br><br>Free and 
              fair elections, a free media, the freedom to assemble are what made the 
              difference between Hong Kong's investors and Singapore's, even though both 
              groups were sold similar products and were caught out by similar 
              events.<br><br>So the next time anyone says that democracy and human rights 
              can't make you money, just remember these four items: Hong Kong - Singapore - 
              Lehman Brothers - compensation.</p>

              <p><br>It can be true, but not until realization. The banks should be able to fulfil their obligation to those fix depositers. Unless given a mature of deposit of the same day whereby all depositers withdrew their money, then the bank may have problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I believe the Banks had calculated the risk, get approval from MAS and is still able to pay any fix depositer upon their maturity.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think this is a part of greed, nothing to do much with democracy, a greed of capital. Under the free financial trade, whoever you are, when you invest, you take the risk and the gain. It is very much a personnal beholden situation. You are free to put your money anyhwere, but with your eyes open. That goes the same way as today communism or any other socialist or militant rules, and worst it that some of this system are so rigid that the distribution of wealth is totally out of the scope, everything is being control and kept by their rulers/dictators.</p></div>

              <p>Did banks <em>"fulfil their obligation to those fix depositers" </em>?</p>
              <p>Certainly, the fallen angel has no clue of the events that have transpired in Singapore in the repeat daily ritual of polluting the Speaker's Corner with thoughtless mischief.</p>
              <p>The issue in this thread concerns the toxic bonds which several Singapore financial institutions misled Singaporeans to subscribe to - is there any reference made to any other financial instruments available for investments for Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Hong Kong investors have received their compensation - what about the interests of those Singaporeans who fell easy prey to the high pressure misleading guidance employed by the investment advisers from local financial institutions ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think this is a part of greed, nothing to do much with democracy, a greed of capital. Under the free financial trade, whoever you are, when you invest, you take the risk and the gain. It is very much a personnal beholden situation. You are free to put your money anyhwere, but with your eyes open. That goes the same way as today communism or any other socialist or militant rules, and worst it that some of this system are so rigid that the distribution of wealth is totally out of the scope, everything is being control and kept by their rulers/dictators.</p>

              <p>Yes, one is responsible for one's actions when fall prey to a con-man.</p>
              <p>Should one be responsible for one's actions when one is misled by a financial institution that has license to provide sound financial services ?</p>
              <p>If there is no wrong done to Singaporean investors, it is surprising that a report surfaced on 7 July 2009 that  -  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/276475,singapore-punishes-financial-institutions-for-selling-lehman-notes.html">Singapore on Tuesday suspended 10 financial institutions for improperly selling credit notes linked to the collapsed US investment bank Lehmann Brothers. The bans would range from six months to two years starting on July 1 and would only be lifted when the central bank "is satisfied with the measures they have put in place," the Monetary Authority ofSingapore said </a></p>
              <p>Obviously, the fallen angel missed out on this fact that the financial institutions were penalised but the majority of Singaporeans who have lost their hard earned monies to the ingenious misinformation spread by these institutions.</p>
              <p>Has it nothing to do with democracy ?</p>
              <p>Besides missing out the facts of events that transpired, the fallen angel has also missed out the essence of the thread - that Hongkongers have largely got a positive response from their financial institutions that refunded their investments - as result of the very public and very vocal demonstrations towards their financial institutions.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have largely been left with their hands empty, while the Government worked out a cosy deal with the financial institutions - even when these institutions have to handle a claim of approximately 10,000 investors whom they had misled.</p>
              <p>Was it a general run on the financial institutions due to a general loss in confidence - as suggested by the fallen angel in the first response - or is this about the interests of the 10,000 odd investors who were misled ?</p>

              <p>Just reported few days ago, the 9 banks in america were issuing big bonuses to their senior executives, while taking bail out from the government. so the tax payers paid the bills.</p>
              <p>Who is the Bank?</p>

              <p>Whether the banks refund from their profits or from shareholders' fund, it is only right that they should make amends for their mistaken approach in selling "toxic bonds" to unsuspecting investors - who largely depended on their professional advise.</p>
              <p>It is the fiduciary responsibility of the management of the various financial institutions to exercise due diligence in vetting their products prior to their decision to market the same to boost their own profit performance.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, in a news report on 1 August 2009, GE Life had made a voluntary refund to about 18,000 of their customers who invested in the "toxic bonds", and in a follow-up ST news report on 4 August 2009 - GE Life is asking their agents to make a refund of the commission that was paid out since four years ago.</p>
              <p>When the total commission to be collected from the various GE Life agents will amount to approximately $12 Million - do we need to imagine how much more is gained by GE Life ?</p>
              <p>While normal humans slave for a monthly fixed wage, financial institutions make their money by "making the money work for them".</p>
              <p>Financial Institutions have their unique ways of making money work that will result in profit growing in geometrical proportions from the hoard of money that they collect through various programs - saving accounts, fixed deposits, investment programs, and dual-benefit or multiple benefits programs.</p>
              <p>Cash collected do not simply sit in the vaults and earn interests from tagging on or piggy back ride on programs offered by other financial institutions.</p>
              <p>Instead, the money do not even move across borders, while electronic transactions fly across the wire as trades are conducted electronically, and margins are earned by the minute in a 24 Hour day through all the time zones.</p>
              <p>The rise and fall in the fortunes of the various financial institutions depend very much on the rarefied atmosphere in which these Money Managers work, and in an exclusively unique environment that is open to a very select few around the globe.</p>
              <p>This is evident from the sudden report that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/business/2009/04/200941495430220198.html">Goldman Sachs makes surprise profit of US$1.66 Billion for first three months of 2009 </a>- when they were reported in late 2008 to need US Government bailout.</p>

              <p>In a surprise move yesterday, Great Eastern Life (GE) made a voluntarily offer to do an early redemption of their Greatlink Choice (GLC) products from 18,000 of its investors.</p>
              <p>The Greatlink Choice products were sold in five tranches between 2005 and 2007, collecting $594 million in premiums. It was marketed as a safe kind of investment with an annual payout of between 3.5% to 4.9% of the capital invested.</p>
              <p>It is a similar class of product to the Minibond, DBS High Notes and some of the Pinnacle notes which have been widely sold to other investors. While none of the Greatlink Choice has defaulted yet, their current market valuation ranged from 19% to 61% of the original capital.</p>
              <p>Owners of the Greatlink Choice products will now have an option to opt for a full redemption of their Greatlink Choice investment at their original capital less the total payouts they have received to date. This option will be available to them from now till 28th Aug 2009.</p>
              <p>GLC policyholders will receive a notice from Great Eastern on the procedure for acceptance of this offer. GLC policyholders who have questions on the offer may also call Great Eastern’s Customer Service Officers at 1800-248-2888 or contact their personal GE life planners.</p>
              <p>I applaud this move by GE as it gives investors of the Greatlink Choice products an early exit option. I am sure many of these investors who thought Greatlink Choice was a safe product would have been having sleepless nights seeing the value of their investments plummet. This is especially so for the Greatlink Choice products which are maturing in 2012/2013 and have a higher risk of default.</p>
              <p>From the perspective of GE, I am sure this helps to generate tremendous market goodwill. And while they will have to spend $250 million making this early redemption, if you think about it, this $250 million is not exactly a loss at all.</p>
              <p>Remember that none of the Greatlink Choice has defaulted yet and if it stays the same way, GE would have to refund 100% of the premiums at maturity back to investors anyway. And in giving this early payout, they would be redeeming at less than 100% of the capital as it is net of total payouts received.</p>
              <p>Of course, if there is a default subsequently, then GE would have to bear the loss themselves.</p>
              <p>Overall, I think this move is a win-win for both GE and their GLC customers.</p>
              <p>I am sure investors of <a href="http://www.lioninvestor.com/pru-3plus-price-update/"><span style="color: #585d8b;">Prudential’s Pru 3Plus</span></a> and <a href="http://www.lioninvestor.com/pru-yield-15-and-yield-20/"><span style="color: #585d8b;">Yield 15/20</span></a> will be casting an anxious look at Prudential and see whether they will offer something similar.</p>
