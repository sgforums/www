              <p>what so big deal about 12 millions?? do u know that this year downturn and upturn surge in stock have created a few millionaires within a year, look at those banks shares, wow! i thot i told someone to buy it. Me only become a thousandaire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Very simply put it, if the shares will to go further when i brought using my grandma name for tax evasion at $6 and now $16, i would have nothing to say about it. In Feb, all these banks blue chips are at discount offered prices, now you ask me to buy back, i would have to think twice, so there is risk in everything we do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore adopt an open economy and financial system, you go into an investment with your eyes open, and nobody asked you to sign, anyone above the legal age of 21 years old is liable to death sentence as all are consider as adult who knows how to think and care for themselves. No one put a bloody damn gun on your head. If you are greedy, you take the highest risk, that come with the highest gain, as said, no pain, no gain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The financial insitution such as GE, AIA or banks have all the right to not to pay any single cents base on your decision to invest, what makes them pay back and pay a little bit back is totally out of image, image for the banks and the insitutions, image for trust, image for long term business customer satisfaction and more importantly image for the public. Hope you understand Uncle.</p>

              <p><br>huh, you think Great Eastern is so great about giving money back and not even the exact amount, look at it carefully lah, dun just listen to state media and blur your vision and thinking.</p>

              <p>MAS cannot foreseen so many flaws in a financial market especially a busy one as ours, just like a traffic police, he knows the laws but he cannot catch every speedy motorist on the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GE has shareholders to answer and public to oblige to, it is a subsidary of OCBC, it rather own up/surrender it mistake to the authority and give back the amount than get booed off when someone start to complain and make MAS dig into the problem ending up with the Chairman of OCBC going to court which will be detrimental to OCBC and GE as a whole. YOU understand or not?? please be more clever lah.</p>
