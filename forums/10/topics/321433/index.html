Our fund managers are paid five times what I get. Why? Because they have had good track records in growing our fund and we know what they could command in the private sector. They are dealing with billions of dollars every day and must be compensated accordingly. <br><br>Unbridled capitalism, winner takes all like in America, does not work unless you can cope with an underclass. <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">So here we also stay with the losers</span></span>, make sure they have enough to live on, with healthcare, equal education opportunities for their children whose parents can no longer afford it. It's very important they not feel abandoned. So we have workfare and ingenuous ways to keep them working as we don't want layabouts doing nothing. We also subsidize homes which they would not be able to buy. A society can only survive if there is a sense of equity and fair play.</span></p></div>

              <p>I don't think anyone here considers him dumb.   The problem with this loser old man lky is that his growing arrogance knows no end and he thinks by who he is he has every right to say anything about anyone, any country, any politicians and so on.   He has very serious attitude problem and the bad attitude is like a terminal illness he is suffering.   </p>

              <p>LKY is NOT calling the lower class losers, but just stating that in a capitalist society, there MUST be people made worse off ('losers') if there are people benefiting from the system ('winners').</p>
              <p>in a true capitalist society such as the US, where everyone fights for themselves and takes home their own earnings, leaving those who did not fare as well as themselves to fend for themselves, which they cannot. thus in singapore, the government does step in to take care of this group of people and make sure they do not feel left out of society, as society will disintegrate and become unstable if this (large) group of people were to fall out of pace with the rest of the community.</p>
              <p>i do agree that lky is arrogant and he could have brought his point across in a more pleasant way. his attitude most probably comes from his thinking that singapore is his, as he led it through the difficult times and brought much progress.</p>
              <p>however, i also do agree that what he said is true and is for the betterment of society on the whole, although it may sound harsh to individuals, especially those being referred to as the 'underclass'. it is a fact of life that they are the ones at the tail end of singapore's great economic growth, not enjoying its benefits as much as the upper class.</p>
              <p>but you must also bear in mind that income equity is a government aim and there are policies which benefit the 'underclass' more than the upper class. take for example income tax in singapore. the lower class who earn less than 20k annually dont have to pay a single cent of income tax at all, while the upper class may have to pay up to 20% of their take home income.</p>
              <p>so dont feel insulted by lky. he is just looking out for society's welfare by promoting the welfare of the lower class, and not letting them feel abandoned. remember that the government has policies in your favour to promote equity. lky may have not said it in a nice way, but his aims are for the good of society.</p>
              <p>if you're not happy with him, just wait for him to die. although the government will likely remain the same and run the country in the same way, this sort of comments probably wont be made anymore. =]</p>

              <p>Well said, sexyfats, oxford mushroom and ayucrazy.</p>
              <p>The critics (like civilgoh and co.) in this forum simply look like a bunch of zealots, very quick to put their common enemy (LKY) down, but are not entirely sound in their judgement. And their antics, such as calling for LKY to die (eg. poh ah pak) are not in the least impressive. Without LKY, SG would be part of M'sia. In which case, the only place you can go to is China. Wait, isn't SG becoming a China nowadays<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> So, LKY is still achieving his goals</p>
              <p>What the critics have is aggression. But aggression in itself is not enough. <br>Are you harsh critics sitting somewhere in the middle-lower class? Pencil-pushers perhaps? Long hours, deteriorating mind and spirit? Cursing, swearing under your breaths all day, every day? My sympathies. </p>
              <p>And to answer that pressing question in the back of your mind:<br> <a title="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/313748" href="/forums/8/topics/313748">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/313748</a></p>
