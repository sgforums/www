            <div class='col-md body'>Worshipping technology is different thing from total involvement in understanding and applying techologies.<br><br>We are supposed to have many scholars some of them probably trained in latest technological developments from IT to micro-electronics and bio-tech etc etc.<br><br>A senior minister should long ago have undertaken total close-up review of all the value-adding industries under a high-level economic master plan to chart our practical new direction to upgrade the economy. Our leaders have only been talking about value-adding economic strategy since the 1980s.<br><br>All the talents should be assembled into a high-level team whose principal tasks are to formulate and implement our own self-reliant domestic economic sector now found to be so lacking. I am sure that such a high-level economic master plan when put up and reviewed monthly will enable Singapore to quicken the current pace of economic development and guide all businesses to reach greater competitiveness. It is not just IT plan but the total integration of all high-tech industries into the EDB implementation of investment promotion.<br><br>The University researches similary will have a clearer direction to work in tandem with the domestic industries. A new sense of urgency and total immersion should be inculcated among the whole government from PMO downwards to nurture and incentivise the value-adding economic development of Singapore. Now it is simply too slow and full of rhetoric and self-justifications. Foreign investments are deserting us because they are not able to tap on any particular practical plan to take advantage of our strategy.<br><br>Whateve rhas been said about our economic re-sructuring it is not taking place fast enough to prepare for our timely upgrading.<br><br>Ad hoc planning of a bit of this or that is not the correct method. We are seriously lagging behind South Korea and Taiwan who have entrenched themselves in technological developments at the highest national level. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
