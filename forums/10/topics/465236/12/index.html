              <p><br> people are not blind. what TJS said i some of his soeeches are
              logical true and make sense. people who need a change can ride on
              his words. but i am still wary about this party SDP. JBC not liked
              by people and seems to be takin a back seat. time will tell with
              future speeches at hong lim if these SDP members suddenly deviate
              from opposing the white paper stand and steer to
              political.</p>
              <p>TJS has been going for constituencies, presidential election and
              now white paper. what doe she really want in fact going all ove
              rthe palce just to have a shot at getting elected and parlimentary?
              its clear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but if he continue to bring out issues that are logical and can
              help us balance against the white pants, he will still be of use to
              the people. we just bneed t watch and not give him too much to
              topple the balance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we want people wo will serve the people whole hearted, not use
              this as a menas to get votes and later also cannot do anything
              better than the white pants people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now i see teh root of our problem is over reliance on the white
              or one party as government. we need a coalition gahmen. when no
              party dominance will rule the whole country but party dominance can
              make changes or stop changes to policies and white papers.</p>

              <p>no disagreement with what you said.</p>
              <p>It is important to let those in white pants know the people are not blind, we also need to let the opportunitistic politicians know that we will not vote for them for opposition sake. Opposition must prove to us they mean business, they are organized, they are united, then they can be of use to the people, and they will get the support. The WP has done well so far, and they are careful to distance themselves from politicians like CSJ.</p>

              The mass import of FT policy start somewhere during 2000, so if he had voted the elites since that time, it simply mean he agree with the FT policy in the past.  If that is the case, please don't complain now.

              <p>this Mr Loke ought to be worried about his job, at 38, still a machine operator earning $1,300 !! Crane operators are offered $7000, heavy truck drivers are offered $5000, these I know for sure. The $1300 jobs are meant for foreigners, Singaporean should make use of all the upgrading program to upgrade himself to get higher pay job. What does he expect? because nobody do his job so he can demand higher pay?</p>
