                   week after Iceland faced bankruptcy, Singapore guaranteed $700 billions
                   deposits of various currencies.  This blanket guarantee included 
                  foreign banks which had financial troubles in hundreds of billions of

                   reserves were used to back this guarantee.  Our reserves represent the 
                  cumulative sacrifices, sweat, toil, tears, heartaches and headaches of 
                  numerous Singaporeans both present and past.  Our savings are meant for 
                  our children, our aged, our beloved, our homes, our medical needs and to
                   protect us from ruthless enemies.  Yet, they were all placed in

                  reserves will be worth pennies on the dollar if the global economy had 
                  collapsed. However, depositors are still entitled to their $700 billion 
                  in cash at the click of the mouse. How is Singapore going to raise so 
                  much cash so fast? Such pressures will cause Singapore’s currency to 
                  fall and devalue our Central Provident Funds.  Moreover, our liabilities
                   for foreign currencies’ deposits will rise.</span><br><br><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>During

                  dramatically in value. Massive banks' failures will make Singaporeans 
                  liable for most of the $700 billions deposits. Singapore can become 
                  indebted to many wealthy foreign depositors.  Britain used 
                  anti-terrorism laws to freeze Iceland’s assets.  Governments worldwide 
                  can also freeze Singapore’s assets.</span></strong> <br> <br> <strong><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>Let

                   depositors’ money.  Our reserves had fallen in value to $100 billion. 
                  Singapore becomes indebted by $400 billions. Ironically, our $100 
                  billion savings will be paid to the foreign banks that fail first. </span></strong><br> <br> <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>Blanket
                   guarantee gives the weakest banks' depositors top priority claims to 
                  Singaporeans' reserves. This is true even if the weakest banks fall 
                  because of frauds, negligences, mismanagements, stupidities or 
                  speculations. Several foreign banks were in trouble when our local banks
                   remain strong. This means Singaporeans' savings were placed on the 
                  front line for foreign banks' depositors to lay claims on.  Lehman 
                  Brothers fell even though it had US$691 billion assets in Nov. 2007.</span><br> <br> <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>Since
                   foreign banks had the greatest likelihood of failing, foreigners had 
                  the greatest likelihood of claiming the greatest amount of money from 
                  Singaporeans' sweat stained savings. Thus, the poorest Singaporeans will
                   have to help pay off the richest foreign depositors.</span><br> <br> <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>Why
                   did Singapore give a limitless guarantee?  Isn’t this a terrible 
                  precedent for Singapore to set?  Even the United States only raised the 
                  guarantee from US$100,000 to US$250,000.  Why did the guarantee last 
                  till end of 2010?  If there was major capital flight into Singapore, 
                  this could increase our absolute exposure drastically.  </span><br> <br> <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>Parliamentary
                   approval should be required to raise the guaranteed deposit above a 
                  preset limit.  Parliamentary approval should be required before any 
                  foreign bank deposits can be guaranteed.  Blanket guarantees are NOT 
                  sustainable and have led Ireland and Iceland into troubles.  Laws must 
                  be enacted to ensure that only a limited percentage of our total 
                  reserves can ever be used for bank guarantees.  PERCENTAGE is the most 
                  important word here because value of reserves plunge when markets 
                  plummet like waterfalls.</span><br> <br> <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>Yours Sincerely,</span><br> <br> <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;'>Joseph Tan</span></div>

              <p>Whoever wrote this is trying to be smart by stating the obvious. But for those who have done modelling of economic crises, this is like saying: You know, I just discovered that since money cannot leave earth, therefore there must be a money cycle. Eureka!</p>
              <p>There's no such thing as "guaranteed". You know that. I know that. But there are times it is necessary to make such "guarantees".</p>
              <p>Here's why:</p>
              <p>If nobody panicks, and everyone goes down the exit in single file, nobody will get burnt to death.</p>
              <p>If someone starts a stampede, everyone dies. That's the simplified analogy.</p>
              <p>In other words, if I don't assure you that your savings are safe indefinitely (there are not), YOU are going to start the stampede in the worst case scenario and when everyone demands withdrawal, bank loans that have yet to mature will have to be withdrawn.</p>
              <p>There could have been enough money to go around if everyone was patient and the bank recovers the principal sums + the interests, but if everyone panicks and the bank has to liquidate, there obviously won't be enough to go around.</p>
              <p>So here's why a strong govt that can "hoodwink" and assure people is VERY important in the banking sector....as well as other portions of the economy for the matter.</p>
              <p>The government is not lying about the guarantee....but its on the implicit reasoning that a bank run would not occur.</p>

              <p>Singapore only back up to S$150 billion using its reserve and the guarantee have ended in 2010.. so money is safe... So why that guy now then talk about it?</p>
              <p>Cut and paste message from the minister Mr Lim Hng Kiang</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why the Guarantee is Sufficient and Prudent</span></strong></p>
              <p>7. The deposits of individuals and non-bank customers with banks,
              finance companies and merchant banks in Singapore amount to about S$700
              billion.  In view of MAS’ stringent regulations and close supervision
              of financial institutions in Singapore, their strong capital and asset
              positions, and the potential support that foreign institutions in
              Singapore can avail themselves of where necessary under the government
              guarantees provided by their home jurisdictions, MAS and the Ministry
              of Finance have assessed that the backing of S$150 billion of the
              Government’s reserves provided to the guarantee would be more than
              sufficient. </p>
              <p>8. Let me explain.  First, the likelihood of a bank failure as a
              result of problems in Singapore is small as our banking system is sound
              and closely supervised, even though it is possible that problems
              elsewhere will affect a bank’s operations in Singapore.  </p>
              <p>9. Second, even if a bank were to fail here, it should still have
              substantial assets to meet its liabilities to depositors.  Under the
              law non-bank depositors enjoy priority in being paid, ahead of other
              unsecured creditors.  This makes it more likely that the failed
              institution will have sufficient assets to pay out to depositors. 
              <strong>Hence, for the guarantee to be called, two things have to happen: a
              bank has to fail, and at the same time its assets must be worth so
              little that there is not even enough to repay its depositors.   Even
              then the draw on the guarantee should only be for the shortfall, which
              should be a fraction of the deposits outstanding. </strong></p>
              <p>10. Hence we have calculated that the S$150 billion backing is an
              amount that will be ample to meet any eventuality except the most
              remote.  S$150 billion does not in any way reflect an estimate of the
              likely draw over the two years of the guarantee.  On the contrary, we
              expect the actual draw to be small or if we are fortunate even zero. 
              Instead, the S$150 billion reflects the Government’s confidence in the
              banking system, and its intention to give all depositors that same
              confidence.</p>

              <p>The water issue is not a "doomsday scenario", it's an impending threat with high probability of occuring. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you can distinguish between the two. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do know what a doomsdays scenario is right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Also in a doomsday scenario like global depression, every country in the world would be affected, it's not just limited to Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Depositors withdraw all their funds from Singapore and shift to which other country (since all countries are affected). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I worry for the majority of Singaporeans, they are not brought up to think independently and objectively, a product of our rote learning system. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Also have to ask the Minister what happened to all our funds (whose pocket is it in now), our total money supply is not enough to offset the foreign "monetary deposits". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore still has a shortfall of at least 50% of $700 billions to satisfy the foreign depositors' so called "cash claims". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
