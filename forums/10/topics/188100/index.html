            <div class='col-md body'>i guess police in USA aren't much better either. Never forget that case in hollywood, where 2 men armed with AK-47s with HV armour piercing rounds, body armour, and a high munitions capacity held up a bank, and then nonchantly had a shoot out with police. Police standard issue handguns couldn't penetrate the robbers' body armour and the robbers didn't even need to take cover. Their AKs with HV AP rounds totally rendered whatever little cover the cops had useless. I remember the newsreel, the terrified faces of those cops who suddenly realised the brick building they were hiding around the corner from the robbers, was useless, as HV AP rounds tore thru the brick like butter. In the end they needed to go to this civilian gun store and borrow 5 semi auto civilian version M16s to have a chance of penetrating the robbers' body armour. Luckily nobody was killed, but it took a few hours before the robbers surrendered(because they ran out of ammo)</div>
