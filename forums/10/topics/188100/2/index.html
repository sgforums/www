The LAPD made efforts to change their procedures and now officers have access to the weapons that they need.<br><br>Its always like this, action.. den consequence.. den policies or procedures are made to stop that effort.<br>It seldom happens the other way round.<br>Even the SWAT team was initially set up after a crime was committed when the police realised they needed something to combat the threat they face.<br><br>BTW, both robbers did not surrender.<br>One committed suicide, although his death is being questioned. Some argue that an officer shot his head.<br><br>The other ran out off ammo while he was in a shootout in point blank range with officers armed with the M16s. He was shot in the leg several times.. and arrested. Before the ambulance could get to him in time. He bled to death.<br><br>Take another example. Who would have expected 911 to happen? Because of that, many major changes have been made.

The Malaysian police had been tracking their movements over the last six months. Then they moved in to smash the militant group before it could carry out its plans. ItÂ’s certainly one of the biggest anti-terrorist successes,Â” a source revealed.<br><br>The source said police seized several firearms and documents, including bomb-making instructions downloaded from the Internet.<br><br>However, it is not immediately known what the groupÂ’s targets were or when its plans would be executed.<br><br>Of the Malaysian militants arrested, one is a religious school teacher who graduated with a degree in Arabic literature from a Syrian university, while the other is a graduate from Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang.<br><br>Their job was to organise lodging, transport and other logistical requirements for the group.<br><br>Police are investigating if Darul Islam had links with the Abu Sayyaf terror group based in the southern Philippines and the al-Qaeda movement led by Osama bin Laden who orchestrated the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.<br><br>The Star learnt that at least 11 members of Darul Islam are being held at the Kamunting detention centre in Perak. They have been issued two-year detention orders under the Internal Security Act.<br><br>Regional analysts said it was no surprise that police were keeping a keen eye on Sabah in view of its strategic location.<br><br>Â“It is close to the southern Philippines, where terror camps have been set up, and Indonesia,Â” said one political risk consultant in Singapore.<br><br>Â“Sabah is also important economically. It is a popular international tourist destination, so there is no compromise when it comes to the safety of tourists.<br><br>Â“The police had successfully nailed the group before its members could even plan anything in the area.Â”<br><br></blockquote></div>
