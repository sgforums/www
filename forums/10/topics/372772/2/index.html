              <p>the idealogy is simple, without the poor, how can there be rich. And who make them rich, mostly is the poors who make them rich. The equation is simple, if you said you are rich, there is someone richer than you, if you said you are poor, there is also someone poorer than you. Let say you earn 100,000 p.a, consider rich in many countries already, but you gather round those earning 1 million p.a, then you start to say you are poor. Doesn't make sense ya</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rich also dun want the poor to go poorer, our govt understand that, if they go poorer, social unrest will occur, next, they will not spend and this will drag the rich down into poor condition. Our govt had always wanted the lower income people to move up, giving them ample opportunities and it is all up for them to grab and excel in it. Our society provide an equal opportunites for both the lower and higher income, you live in condo, i live in next door HDB, you drive merc, i drove honda, you go shopping at orchard, i also can go shopping, you buy at cold storage, i buy at NTUC, you got clubs, i also got social clubs, you buy insurance, i also can buy income insurance or my cpf also got insurance. You childrens or you can go study, i also can go study and educate myself. You can go changi airport, i also can go there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, if you look at our govt social policy, we do not take poor as an outcast, in many countries, some poor are not allow into shopping centre or airport or even schools. Nobody is poor in singapore unless you deem yourself to be ya.</p>

              <p>the idealogy is simple, without the poor, how can there be rich. And who make them rich, mostly is the poors who make them rich. The equation is simple, if you said you are rich, there is someone richer than you, if you said you are poor, there is also someone poorer than you. Let say you earn 100,000 p.a, consider rich in many countries already, but you gather round those earning 1 million p.a, then you start to say you are poor. Doesn't make sense ya</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rich also dun want the poor to go poorer, our govt understand that, if they go poorer, social unrest will occur, next, they will not spend and this will drag the rich down into poor condition. Our govt had always wanted the lower income people to move up, giving them ample opportunities and it is all up for them to grab and excel in it. Our society provide an equal opportunites for both the lower and higher income, you live in condo, i live in next door HDB, you drive merc, i drove honda, you go shopping at orchard, i also can go shopping, you buy at cold storage, i buy at NTUC, you got clubs, i also got social clubs, you buy insurance, i also can buy income insurance or my cpf also got insurance. You childrens or you can go study, i also can go study and educate myself. You can go changi airport, i also can go there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, if you look at our govt social policy, we do not take poor as an outcast, in many countries, some poor are not allow into shopping centre or airport or even schools. Nobody is poor in singapore unless you deem yourself to be ya.</p>
