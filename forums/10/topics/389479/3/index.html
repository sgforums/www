              <p>Maybe they say no World Cup for Singaporeans to watch if people vote opposition in next election.</p>

              <p>resale market he may have some problem controlling. can advise only. but for new falts first time buyer really those paid millions must really consider the outcome for those lower income or so newly weds. cannot just tell the chef to put sugars on everyone's cup if some one people only complains the coffee not sweet.</p>
              <p>the ones paid millions are to ensure only selective cups with people complaining not sweet add sugar only. some others may like it black.</p>
              <p>they are paid millions and wwe are not telling them they cannot have this salary. but they must achieve the possible from the impossible so that at least most of the population are better off or at least not taken down further.</p>

              <p>potong pasir peoples had been conned for many years, the true is, potong pasir get an opposition at the time when PAP and Singapore was criticised by the international world as a one party shows. That put pressure on LKY wherever he went  to visit countries which most leaders of these countries will question him. So, Chiam was born, LKY see a picked a person like Chiam who has a cool head and able to convince the ground to be the opposition, follow by Low TK, a recommendation from Chiam to PAP. Both can be consider as mole and opposite of PAP at the same time. This released the pressure and critics from the international world.</p>
