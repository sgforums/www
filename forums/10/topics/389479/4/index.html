              <p>Mr Mah – your time is over and your tenure as Mininster was long overdue when Singaporeans were relegated to the bottom and foreigners were given preferences arbitrarily and also when HDB policies and pricing became preposterously astronomical and bordering on untruths. Worst, it appears no longer to be for the citizens but a monopoly hell bent on squeezin as much money from buyers.</p>
              <p><br>Has any independent organisation or agency verified the so-called pricing, subsidy or what is so often bandied as reasonable ‘pricing’? It is the lack of transparency and refusal to listen and the condescending attitude of PAP that irks Singaporeans. Too bad, you are from the party and it is difficult for anyone to understand when one arrogates power /knowledge and assumes that only one party or the present govt has all the know-how.</p>
              <p> Sad but true is this – there are many Singapoeans 'better' than the current ruling party and I am sure they can deliver 'better' and most of all put Singaporeans first.</p>
              <p><br>The damage has been done. No amount of rationalizing and putting up statistics (which seems suspect and dubious) to justify your stance or would the cosmetic changes that may be put in place appease the displeasure of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>When an incumbent govt (party, in this instance PAP) purports to serve the people but ends up serving party interests - know that the inexorable slide to oblivion has began.</p>
              <p><br>Hope Singaporeans would see thru this charade and end it by voting wisely and intelligently.</p>
