              <p>Besides affecting the price of the land sold, the URA will increase costs onto the project by inflicting 'Development Charges' based on the type of project that is built, and the 'Stamp Duties' on the total cost of the project.

Then there are the charges for non-compliance to the minimum energy standards imposed on the design of the building.</p>
              <p>Even as much as the PAP government talk about leaving prices to be determined by the Market Forces, it will intervene to influence the market to prevent a virtual collapse or to prevent run away spiral.</p>

              <p>Now that they have boosted the prices of public housing to such high levels that result in even high values when bank interests are added, what price will these properties be when offered for sale later ?</p>
              <p>Can these artificial situation continue to be sustained, or will the bubble burst at some point in time ?</p>
              <p>The PAP leadership think themselves as being so smart riding on the back of the Political Tiger once before in the 1950s and 60s, and manage to get off without being eaten.</p>

              <p>BTO was artificially managed to reduce supply so that it was 50 times over subscribed. Any profession would start to ask what is Built to Order program? where it should have been an efficient way of managing supply and demand.  </p>
              <p>HDB and CPF is just becoming a government Feeder fund...sort of reminded me of Burnie Mattoff.  The only way a ponzi scheme could work is that the market input continue to expand but because SG has its limited pool so it increase base price and imposing CPF withdrawer limit.</p>

              <p><br>The Dark Angel never fail to try to impress with its simplistic approach in defending the PAP - even when it pretend to raise its hand to slap at the PAP, it will end up clapping in praise of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Stop fooling others with your simple minded Taiwanese village logic.</p>
              <p>If what you claim is true that one "can hear aunties and uncles boosting about how many hundreds of thousands or even millions they make from enbloc and selling off their properties" - do you seriously believe that these "aunties and uncles" will complain about housing prices being too high, when they can afford to live in a better type or quality environment ?</p>
              <p>With the "many hundreds of thousands or even millions" in their possession - why should the aunties and uncles "start to complaint housing prices too high" ?</p>
              <p>Do they need to rush into a property market that is hot ?</p>
              <p>In your usual attempt to simplify the situation to protect the PAP, you simply white wash the real issue by not paying attention to the real problem.</p>
              <p>It is the new generation of young married Singaporeans buying their first home that is complaining about housing price being too high.</p>
              <p>With housing prices being so high, they will have to struggle with the mortgage for the rest of their working lives, ending with all their cash being sunk into a dead asset, and with little cash for their retirement.</p>
              <p>Has the PAP solved the problem of high priced housing that resulted with the situation faced by present generation of Singaporeans - who find themselves asset rich and cash poor at the age of retirement ?</p>

              <p><br>The Dark Angel never fail to try to impress with its simplistic approach in defending the PAP - even when it pretend to raise its hand to slap at the PAP, it will end up clapping in praise of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Stop fooling others with your simple minded Taiwanese village logic.</p>
              <p>If what you claim is true that one "can hear aunties and uncles boosting about how many hundreds of thousands or even millions they make from enbloc and selling off their properties" - do you seriously believe that these "aunties and uncles" will complain about housing prices being too high, when they can afford to live in a better type or quality environment ?</p>
              <p>With the "many hundreds of thousands or even millions" in their possession - why should the aunties and uncles "start to complaint housing prices too high" ?</p>
              <p>Do they need to rush into a property market that is hot ?</p>
              <p>In your usual attempt to simplify the situation to protect the PAP, you simply white wash the real issue by not paying attention to the real problem.</p>
              <p>It is the new generation of young married Singaporeans buying their first home that is complaining about housing price being too high.</p>
              <p>With housing prices being so high, they will have to struggle with the mortgage for the rest of their working lives, ending with all their cash being sunk into a dead asset, and with little cash for their retirement.</p>
              <p>Has the PAP solved the problem of high priced housing that resulted with the situation faced by present generation of Singaporeans - who find themselves asset rich and cash poor at the age of retirement ?</p>

              <p><br>If your life in Taiwanese village has got nothing to do with anyone here, stop quoting about your experience and life in Taiwan.</p>
              <p>If you remain attracted to Life in Taiwan, your existence in Singapore and SgForum remains unwelcome as it was clearly shown during 2009.</p>
              <p>You could have been more honest to pass your comments about Life in your village in Taiwan - instead of passing judgment about Singaporean Life in Singapore.</p>
              <p>What does a Taiwanese faking as a Singaporean know about life in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Your remarks about prices of HDB flats sold in Singapore clearly reveal your hopeless ignorance about the political debate about the costings and subsidies that the PAP Government refused to be forthright and open to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans - young and old - need your 2 cents worth of Taiwanese experience to teach anyone how to live here ?</p>
              <p>Keep your homilies for your own consumption.</p>

And as free your market is, there is a higher risk, and higher risk also bring in higher gain.</p>

              <p>And are you sure it is the new couple who are complaining, aren't they earning more now than their ancestors of the 70s and 80s, with a nicer flats, better facilities all round, dun tell me HDB will still be selling 70s and 80s kind of prices?? The youngs must learn to survive, tho I am also young, i find that too many of them are being pamper, unlike my taiwan village culture, parents leave you to decide on your own, where got go and worry about your career or marriage and housing.</p>

              <p>10 years ago nasi lemak cost abt $1, 30 years ago 1 cup og kopi wsa about 50 to 60cents, cab fare was $1.20</p>
              <p>now?? cabe fare peak period is abt $4-4.50 ,food min cost $2 to 2.50 in most areas of singapore, to you , your simple minded thinking may mean that bigger number is bigger value, however, sadly it is not, the value is more like smaller, fast foward a few years time, even $5 or $10 might not last a person for more than 3 days.</p>
