              <p><span class="time">
              </span></p><p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>After months of denial, National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has finally acknowledged that “the rising HDB resale flat prices have raised fresh concerns.”</p>
              <p>The prices of resale flats has increased by 8.2 per cent in 2009 when Singapore was still mired by depression, contributed largely by a limited supply of new flats and rising demand fueled by the relentless influx of foreigners.</p>
              <p>Latest figures released by the HDB showed that cash upfront paid by buyers for resale flats, known as cash-over-valuation or COV, doubled to $24,000 in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>Despite rising frustration, resentment and anger on the ground over the increase prices of public housing in Singapore, Mr Mah and other HDB officials continue to insist that they are “affordable” to ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah even chided first time home buyers for being “choosy” and said that “the onus is on Singaporeans to play their part by buying a home within their means.”</p>
              <p>Quoting the affordability benchmark of 30 per cent used frequently by HDB to show that HDB flats remain affordable to ordinary Singaporeans, Mr Mah said a family with a monthly income of $3,000 can buy a flat worth up to $250,000 and spend only 30 per cent of their income every month on the mortgage.</p>
              <p><em>“Similarly, a family with a monthly income of $4,000 can afford to buy a new flat worth up to $333,000 without spending more than 30 per cent a month on the mortgage. This means they can comfortably buy any of the flats offered in the latest BTO projects this month,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>However, Mr Mah fails to take into account the bank interest rates and inflation over the years which will lead eventually to the family spending more than 30 per cent of their monthly income on the mortgage.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, after depleting their entire CPF for these over-priced 99-year leasehold HDB flats, they will have little or no savings left for their retirement.</p>
              <p>Though he admitted eventually he was “caught off guard” by the continued increase in prices, he failed to acknowledge the severity of the problem.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans who are still harboring hope that Mr Mah will bring down the prices of HDB flats are going to be disappointed.</p>
              <p>Echoing the stance of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Mr Mah said the Government should not ‘interfere in the resale market’ and should let it ’set its own price’.</p>
              <p>Instead, HDB will review its rules and policies to ’see if there’re any rules that are encouraging or allowing people to speculate on HDB flats’.</p>
              <p>The outcome of the review will be released in a few months’ time and by then the prices will have increased even more at the present rate it is going.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah reiterated that the HDB is monitoring demand carefully and is planning to roll out 7,000 new flats in the first half of this year, and about 12,000 for 2010.</p>
              <p>“If there is even stronger demand than that, of course HDB will built even more,” he said.</p>
              <p>As the flats will take about 3 to 4 years to be completely, they are unlikely to meet the immediate demand now.</p>
              <p>In fact, they should be built well before between the years 2006 – 2008 to prepare for the expected increase in demand due to the rising number of foreigners coming to work and live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>For some inexplicable reasons, only slightly more than 11,000 new flats were built during these three years or about 4,000 a year:</p>

              <p>If you go jurong, yishun, woodlands,  and other parts of sg empty land empty land .</p>
              <p>best is they get rid of the old shophouses and make the land empty for many years.  Good eg is those empty land at Beach Road formerly shophouses.</p>

              <p>not sure if you notice about the bugis area.  the govt long time ago got rid of the shophouses there and till now the land is till empty.    So what is the mbt doing?  Counting time to lay eggs there?   He is evil to get rid of the people staying there and make that place empty land.</p>
