            <div class='col-md body'>So the stupid dickless gueuse is back eh?! From what you brainless pig said about meddling with other people's affair goes to show what a busybody your govt is. The reason maybe you can't settle your problems back home and have to resort to bogeyman tactics.<br><br>Wah, yeah hor...we depend on you for food and water so much. Balls to you...a**hole!! Of the food we consume, only 1/3 of it come from Mud land!! Most of our food are from other places. If the price is not right, we will not even give you a single dime for that H2O. That is why we are moving towards desalination plant...dickless head.<br><br>British Colony...better to be one than to be a colony of Mud land!! Wah..since when did our industry start up with money from you?? It was the MNC that came and invest here...get your F**king facts right...a**hole!!<br><br>Sorry to disappoint you...but I do have a brain and it is quite well developed. Comparing your puny...tiny..pea sized brain is a joke. Yeah hor...lux soap uses palm oil...why did I not think of it. Of course I did, dickless gueuse!! But there are soaps and lotion that do not used palm oil as well. Nowadays most soap products come from the by product of petroleum...idiot!! Why, because it is cheaper than extracting it from palm oil...stupid a**hole!! And also since it is a by product, there is no need to cultivate palm tree..up yours a**hole!!<br><br>Hush, hush affair?! I don't think so, it was stated in the newspaper why we pull out of Suzhou!! But then again, with gueuse like you, who can't even read and interpret news, it is not surprising that you don't know about it. R&amp;D in your country...hahaha!! If R&amp;D is so good in MUD land, wonder why there are not much patented products coming out of there?<br><br>If you think I am bad and rude, same goes to you...dickless gueuse!! You were the one that started it!!!<br><br>Worthless piece of paper..hmm...interesting. Maybe it was this worthless piece of paper that allows us to get job easily...unlike some kampung mud who have difficulty securing uni. place if not for their so called "equal" opportunities for MUD!!<br><br>Wah...few years make a big difference!! True...but your MUD land is not the only country that will move forward..numbskull!!<br><br>Hi to all other readers!! Thanks for your advice!! I am not really pissed off by this gueuse here. I am just having fun with him.<br><br>So that's all folks...till the next time!!<br><br>gueuse = french for pig...a**hole<br>suidae = latin for pig....dickless head!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would agree with the majority of you volunteering yourselves, in fact, your mindset should be applauded!!<br><br>But the problem is that what have the SAF done over the years to highlight it's profile? Nothing!! To the general public, we are more of a liability, this is mainly because the society that we are living in is enforce by the police whom an average citizens thinks has a 'better' and a more 'worthy' jobs that what the NS guys are doing.(Charging hills, staying alert, getting away from home for training, feeding mozzies in LCK, etc ,etc...) Who really appreciates US?<br><br>To some, they are already thinking of leaving NS the moment they are in Tekong. Coming from a protective family doesn't help matters, especially if the Dad is some BIG shot(or knows someone who IS!), the training standard of that batch would certainly 'drop' to accomodate this 'horse'. It certainly is sad to see SAF stooping so low sometimes, for reasons that only who've been thru' all these can understand, the higher the chain of command, the more personal the reasons are.(Ever seen an MP's son charging with you up the hill?)Reasons?? Obvious right?)<br><br>I guess if we could root up this problem, other implementation would be much easier. Overseas deployment, volunteering for humantarian missions, whatever... It'll come if the countrymen is behind you, not cursing or booing you when you are trying the raise the profile of our creditable force to the international community. All these, should come from the heart...which sadly, is not in everyone of us.<br><br></div>

But brainless sika becoming a clown is something new.<br><br>Like your brainless companion up north, you have the tendency to put words into my mouth. Read my posting...stupid a**hole!! There was not a single time which I said my country was a pile of shit. As for pride, I have a lot. You dickless vark up there sure like to generalise other people.<br><br>I am not saying there is anything wrong with plucking coconut. Just that I am saying you have no where to go but to stay put in your kampung!! Again, this goes to show your inability to read between the lines.<br><br>Commando chopping down coconut for survival. That is survival...pea sized bird brain. You can use the leaves for shelter and other parts of the tree for other survival items. Unlike stupid encik MUD here, only eat coconut and have no idea what to do with the rest of the tress.<br><br>The joke on you MUD!! I am just highlighting what an idiot you are and you are so glad about it. I am glad that I am the other hand clapping, as obviously, you are the one who ended up looking like the clown here.<br><br>Seems that you have nothing new up your sleeve eh?!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey No Frill, I have actually been wanting to start a thread like this for a while, but was too lazy to do so. I can only strongly agree with your proposition to requiring women to serve NS as well. I think for too long men have paid the price for the freedom that women enjoy, only to have them get all ungrateful and whiny about it, not to mention call us sexist.<br><br>I'll post after this something I wrote about this in another topic. The topic was about the falling birthrate, and I proposed the compulsary NS thing. I'll also post an article on women and conscription that I read a while ago from a website; its written by this American guy. Its a different country entirely, but the situation in Singapore today is comparable to the situation in the US half a century ago.<br><br>And as a sidenote, I would like to ask you what are your thoughts on AWARE, and their agenda? I personally think that they're just a bunch of self-righteous bigots, which is very typical of your usual feminists. Always complaining about what they don't have and never knowing how to appreciate what they already have over us men. Obviously the word "reciprocate" doesn't exist in their vocabulary. They just want more and more without giving back anything. They want the same higher starting pay that NSmen enjoy, but they don't want to serve NS. They claim childbirth is their form of NS, but they don't see that their "NS" is not compulsary like for men.<br><br>Ok, anyway enough of the ranting....I'll post first what I wrote in the other topic, and then the article I was talking about. Also, go check out the AWARE forums <a href="http://www.aware.org.sg" rel="nofollow">www.aware.org.sg</a>  and read up on the topic about NS and see what I mean for yourself. Btw, what did you vote for concerning the women in NS thing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"they cant solve..unless they make a law...state that if a person dun get married at a certain age or dun be parent at a certain age, they will go jail.. " - Inzaghi<br><br>To a certain extent, I can't agree more to that, except that law should only apply to women. I'm not trying to be a chauvinist here...just hear out my explanation.<br><br>Childbirth has always been regarded as a woman's form of National Service, and is also the reason as to why they're exempted from serving NS like all the other physically fit males in Singapore.<br><br>However, what has been happening, is that the birth rate has been falling, and as a result, we are quickly losing our only valuable resource (people). Also, because of the falling number of people, and thus males in Singapore, the pool of active NS-men at any given time is getting smaller and smaller. What the government has been doing is increasing the time males have to serve in NS and requiring reservist to be active until the age of 50(? i'm not too sure about the exact age, sorry), to make up for it.<br><br>Think about it this way. When NS was made compulsary in Singapore, failure to enlist for NS should you meet the requirements, was and still is a crime punishable by law. How is it that women's NS (childbirth) in Singapore is a moral obligation, but men's NS in Singapore, is a legally compulsary obligation?<br><br>As a result of women's failure to do their "NS" (childbirth), men in Singapore have to serve longer NS. Can't it be said that men are in fact doing NS for those women that don't do theirs?<br><br>Screw all the bullshit about women not being as physically fit as men to do NS.<br><br>Firstly, doing NS doesn't mean having to serve in the military, where physical fitness is for the most part, a must. Women can do other less physically intensive tasks, that men who are not physically fit do in NS.<br><br>Secondly, aren't the female track &amp; field runners, softballers, netballers, etc, physically fit? Sure, they -may- not be as fit as the male track &amp; field runners, softballers, etc, but they're definitely fitter than the average Joe Singaporeon who has to serve NS, just because he is supposed to be fitter. If indeed women were so physically unfit, then they should be banned from participating in all sports events. Since that isn't and shouldn't be the case, then I don't see why they aren't required to serve NS, like the other half of Singapore's populace. In the NCC, there are girls who can run faster, shoot more accurately, and march straighter than some of the boys. If said boys have to serve NS when they reach 18, why shouldn't those girls have to as well? Wouldn't not requiring those girls to serve NS, be a waste of our human resources, which the government is always talking about maximizing?<br><br>Thirdly, having to serve NS is actually a violation of human rights. Go look up Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Now although that is the case, I also see the need for NS because without it, we would be rendered defenceless. However, this lack of a human right is only reserved as a "privilege" for male citizens in Singapore. Such a practice is more commonly know as sexual discrimination or profiling, which is on par and no better than racial or religious discrimination. If the government wants to revoke that human right, at least extent the lack of it to everyone, instead of just the men. SM Lee is always wondering how the Israelis manage to defend themselves so effectively when they are surrounded by so many hostile nations. Well, I don't know how much it would actually help but for starters, they require all citizens to serve NS, and that includes both men and women. If Singapore did the same, we would effectivly double the number of people serving NS. I seriously wonder why our government hasn't thought of this or at least if they have, why they haven't implemented it.<br><br>All I've said so far probably begs the question, of how this would help with the falling birth rate.<br><br>Well, I propose compulsary NS for all men and women in Singapore. Childbirth for women, like the lack of physical fitness for men, would be a reason for exemption from NS. There would be a standard physical fitness requirement that would apply to both males and females, which would decide what jobs they would have to do in NS. That way, all physically fit males and females would have to do stuff like combat roles, etc, and those less fit would do less intensive stuff like admin jobs, etc.<br><br>Anyway, I think I could go on forever about the unfairness about NS and other sexual discrimination against men issues but I think what I've said should be enough for now...I'll post this article I read on some website a while back. Its written by an American, about how he was forced to fight in Vietnam a long time ago when the U.S. also had conscription. Its rather relevant to the situation in Singapore I think...Any thoughts on my post and the article?<br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 14 May 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 14 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How Come Men Have to Register<br>for The Military Draft and Women Don't?<br>A look at gender roles, citizenship, and the distorted<br>equality paradigm propagated by ideological feminism.<br><br>As reported by<br>RICH ZUBATY<br>from a small island in the<br>SOUTH PACIFIC<br><br>I'm sorry I can't be with you at the 1998 American Men's Studies Association conference to lead a discussion about what I consider to be the most egregious omission of modern feminism -- registering women for the military draft. Debates about "glass ceilings" and "sexual harassment" are trivial in comparison with getting shot at in foreign lands defending the interests of U.S. corporations. If feminists were truly interested in Equality, rather than gaining ever more special privileges for women, they would be proactively lobbying the Congress and the courts to register women for Selective Service.<br><br>Is it not the very meaning of citizenship that the citizen of a state is obligated to protect and defend that form of government which affords her the privileges and protections of citizenship? How come, when women got the right to vote, they were not instantly saddled with the responsibility to fight in war to defend their right to vote? What mysterious, archaic gender paradigms populate our psyches, blinding us to the actual spectrum of issues which constitute "equality" and "citizenship"? Who has managed to control the gender equality debate to the extent that Selective Service registration has remained absent from it for 70 years? Why do they do it? What deeper paradigms are they skirting, glossing over, concealing? And...given that men are expected to fight in war and women are not, is it not possible to conclude that men are NOT the oppressors of women, but that men are, in fact, the PROTECTORS of women?<br><br>Right now I am somewhat willingly stranded on a small island in the South Pacific. There are no roads, no cars, no electricity, no phones. My hosts are in great part a hunter/gatherer culture. I spend my days with the men, fishing and collecting fruits: papaya, breadfruit, coconuts, bananas. The women stick close to home, sweeping the packed earth around their coconut leaf huts, shooing pigs out of the garden, collecting shellfish off the reef at low tide. Both men and women cook and tend the infants, depending upon who is not engaged in some other activity at the time. As other researchers have pointed out, there is less division of labor in both hunter/gatherer and "information age" societies than in the agricultural and industrial societies of recent epochs.<br><br>But the dangerous work is still done by the men. Women don't climb coconut trees (fat as I am, neither do I). Women don't ride small boats out into huge waves to catch fish. Women are not drafted in time of war. As in Europe and America, most families here are de facto matriarchies, governed by the iron will of the eldest surviving family member -- almost always a female. Men appear to have a great deal of autonomy while they're alive, but they simply do not last as long as women. While young women complain about social restrictions and lack of freedom, old women govern the wealth of the family -- in Europe, America, and the South Pacific. Thus, the very things that feminists complain about, are the things that ensure women's eventual dominion over the accumulated resources of the family. The men lead tough, dangerous lives, die sooner, and the family wealth devolves into the hands of the elder women.<br><br>"Equality" is not age specific. It's meaningless to ask whether men and women are treated equally at the age of 18, 35, 72. Equality embraces a lifetime of events. And it's clear -- in Europe, America, and the South Pacific -- that over a lifetime women possess more security and authority than men. Why? Because men willingly sacrifice their well being for women. Because men are the protectors and defenders of women. Because men die for women.<br><br>Why do they do it?<br><br>Because women are widely regarded to be more valuable than men. Women make babies. A deep biological imperative within men supports the notion that women and babies must be protected and defended. That's why there are male feminists. Male feminists are men expressing their innate urge to protect and defend women. Challenging and critiquing women runs against our character. We hate fighting with women.<br><br>So what about military service? Is draft registration a moot point since we're not at war? A young man I know of was recently booted out of an Ivy League school -- lost his admission and scholarship -- when it was discovered he had neglected to register for the draft. The school received federal funds, one requirement of which is that all males over the age of 18 must be registered for the Selective Service. The school could lose it's federal money if it doesn't comply, so the young man gets the "heave ho" -- instantly -- no appeal. Female co-eds need not worry about this sort of career disruption.<br><br>Bills have been sponsored in the U.S. Congress to register women for Selective Service. They did not pass. They got no feminist support. Moreover, since it is the policy of the Pentagon that women cannot be forced to perform combat duties, the issue of drafting them was deemed irrelevant. Tell that to the guys getting shot at.<br><br>I talked to some marines from Somalia. Their beef about women soldiers is that, while the guys are sent into the desert or on combat missions, the female marines guard the embassies and toady about with the diplomats and generals -- ensuring their own promotions.<br><br>It is a well-known fact that, during the build-up to the Iraq War, droves of female soldiers became suddenly ill or, more remarkably, temporarily pregnant -- many with pregnancies which seemed, miraculously, to vanish when the hostilities ended. Is military service just another career track for women? Another way to get a paycheck and a pension without having to risk too much?<br><br>And...while the engines of feminist propaganda inflamed the nation over the issue of admitting young women to military academies, the real issue -- registering ALL women for Selective Service in combat roles -- was cleanly swept under the rug.<br><br>Why do feminists, male and female, dodge this issue?<br><br>Because it is the death knell to their movement.<br><br>On every radio show I've ever done with ideological feminists -- where I was able to raise the Selective Service issue -- I was met with a prolonged pause, then a gush of unanimous and unequivocal agreement that women should be compelled to register, then the topic was swiftly changed to something else -- a peculiarly feminine technique for avoiding unpleasantness. They'll talk about it. But they won't do anything about it. Why won't feminists proactively advocate this issue?<br><br>Because they know their constituents. They know that the feminist movement would endure an 80% desertion rate led by those gender opportunists who go by the name of Equity Feminists if the ideologues began openly advocating draft registration. Far and away most women do NOT want to register for the draft. They do not want equality -- not if it means they REALLY have to fight for it.<br><br>And how about the people who don't believe in war?<br><br>Welcome to a bigger problem.<br><br>I didn't believe in the Vietnam War. I was drafted anyway. The women with whom I had pursued undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago sailed blithely off to graduate school, while I went underground dodging the F.B.I. It was no fun. And it certainly wasn't Equality.<br><br>200 years ago a flurry of democratic revolutions established that a person willing to fight and risk his life could be liberated from monarchy and gain the right to vote for his governors. 140 years later women obtained the right to vote, without being obligated to fight for, or risk anything. Is this not simply another instance of men affording special protections for women? It was men, after all -- the guys who fight and die -- who granted women the right to vote.<br><br>Have we not lost sight of what citizenship in a democracy is all about? How can our media focus on the "glass ceiling" and ignore this obvious inequity? I have no problem with women becoming senators, CEOs, or Supreme Court Justices. I DO have a problem with the idea that these women never, ever, have to fight to defend the form of government which permits them to attain these high positions.<br><br>Aristocrats are a privileged species of human being. Aristocrats are not expected to perform hard, dangerous, physical labor -- no bricklaying or asphalt pouring or oil well drilling for these folks. Aristocrats are not expected to serve as common soldiers in time of war -- for them are reserved positions of command and supply, far removed from the front lines. Are we not creating an aristocracy of women? Are we not breeding a race of privileged creatures, with guaranteed rights for advancement into positions of authority, who are not expected to perform nasty physical labor nor fight in time of war? It seems to me democracy is circling back on itself, like a snake swallowing its own tail, recreating a type of aristocrat, a privileged individual, one who wears a slightly more attractive gown, yet one who is, as in the olden days, endowed with favored status from her time of birth. Is it possible we are recreating an aristocracy of women?<br><br>All the feminist issues of the last 30 years rolled up into one pale in comparison to the image of the male draftee, getting shot at, by people he doesn't know, in a war he doesn't believe in. This is TRUE powerlessness, not TV hype.<br><br>Equality is not just about money and political power. It is also about human relationships. Whether it's a father who isn't allowed to see his children, a coal miner or bricklayer working a job he hates to feed his wife and kids, or a draftee getting shot at, the stark oppression of men in the entire arena of human relationships is perhaps the major untold academic saga of this century. We need much more serious academic inquiry into why men get stuck with the hard dangerous jobs, and why men get stuck fighting wars. Draft women. Let them get shot at -- or run from the F.B.I. That's real equality. That's civic responsibility. If women cannot accede to registering for Selective Service their very right to vote, much less their right to become senators, judges and CEOs, is called into question. Equality means equality of responsibility. Women can NEVER be equal without it.<br><br>But we -- bio-imprinted males that we are -- will continue protecting them and defending them while they rail at us for being their oppressors. Like cocks in a barnyard, no matter what injustices and outrages we female sympathizers foist on the rest of the male species, we will carry on blithely protecting and defending women and advocating their favorite issues. That's how we were made. Men compete with each other for the privilege of protecting women. And the guy who does the best job of that wins the emotional reward that women offer -- and I'm not just talking about getting laid.<br><br>But the joke's on us. Women live longer. Women control 65% of America's wealth (Forbes magazine). Women don't need our protection. Women don't have to fight in war.<br><br>Oops...please excuse me. I have to go. It's windy and raining, dark clouds lashing across the lagoon, but the guys want to go fishing and I should go too. Don't ask me why. I'll never understand. It's just something guys do -- enduring pain and discomfort to gain sustenance for the women and kids. That's not likely to change. Not in Europe, America or the South Pacific. Men take natural pleasure in protecting and providing for women. It's part of our bio-make-up.<br><br>And it doesn't run in the opposite direction. Few women are dedicated to protecting and providing for men. Few women will lay bricks or mine coal for a husband who stays home cooking pancakes. Equality between the sexes? It's about as germane an issue as financial security for sea urchins. If women want equality tell them to register for the draft. If not, tell them to stop yapping about it.<br><br>It's cold and wet out here. There are wild, wind-whipped waves and razor-backed reefs and mean-toothed fish to haul into the boat. It's not ideology. It's not something you discuss in climate controlled rooms. It's something you do.<br><br>Rich Zubaty is the author of Surviving the Feminization of America.</div>

I'm actually quite glad I finally got a response from someone, which is you. Thanks for replying to it btw.<br><br>About the combat fitness thing, sometimes I wonder how much of it is true, and how much of it is due to the mindset and upbringing of girls though. As I see it, if a man and a similarly sized woman happen to have the same fitness, lifting strength, etc, I don't see why a woman can't shoot as well or run as fast as a man. In fact, women are actually more suited to long distance running than men. Its about something due to their body mass to surface area ratio or something. This doesn't apply to all women though. Is there anyone who knows more about it who would like to comment? I'm not too sure about it myself.<br><br>I actually didn't mean that all women should serve combat roles alongside men, just that their physical fitness or lack of, shouldn't be a valid reason for their exemption from NS, since NS isn't just about charging up hills, running through fields with a full pack, etc. I would like to see them do NS...any NS, so long as they contribute to the country like all the men have to. Its come to the point where I feel that they no longer have to play a part in securing our freedom, but they still get to enjoy it anyway. Not to mention they complain about the perks we get like higher starting pay, etc, etc, as sexual discrimination.<br><br>As for having a female commander, I don't see anything wrong with it so long as she's proven herself as capable as another man. Meaning if she had to go through OCS, she would have had to do exactly the same things as the men and live up to the same standards. Of course having standard requirements would most probably result in less females and more males in combat vocations, and vice versa for non-combat roles, but that would be pretty natural.<br><br>Anyway, nice to hear your opinion on this. I'll post here again when I have the time tomorrow.</div>

The long distance aspect was assumed to be of free load when running. However in the army, regardless whether you are male or female, you have to carry the same minimum combat load and this will prove to be a significant distadvantage to women. As for same strength, I read in a bio report once that it is quite unlikely....I will post the report here if I can find it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eyezer:<br><br>Thanks for the info.<br><br>About the statistics though, I think that is of no consequence as to whether women can serve in combat roles or not. What would happen is that there would just be a less women in combat roles, and more women in non-combat roles. Women capable of combat roles should serve in combat roles, and vice versa for men, etc<br><br>Anyway thanks again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
