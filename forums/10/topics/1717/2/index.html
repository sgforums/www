The suggestion would be to send volunteer like shotgun, you etc for example over there.<br><br>And no offence but quoting from you : "Seriously, while it would give the troops good exposure, if something goes wrong, doesn't even have to be a hostile act, say, touchwood, 10 of you get killed in a road accident while on peacekeeping duty" -- Cut --<br><br>Continued by me:<br>"those dead would be honored by the government for the sacrifice they did and hence be awarded a singapore flag over their coffin. As for their parents, i have no comment of course since they most likely won't be like heartlander screaming blue murder. The government will just cover the issue off just like any other incidents that happened in camp that cost life to be lost."<br><br>And as for pple like heartlander ,me etc will start complaining in this forum what the fuck the government is doing sending men there to be lost and demanding an explaination for those innocent life lost just to glorify the stupid SAF in singapore. Do you want us to do that for you? if not we will just keep quiet and let the matter rest since you volunteer yourself anyway.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 22 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My logic is simple.  Create an active deployment force.  No need a very big number, maybe just an over-strength battalion, including combat-engineer support, artillery, light and heavy armor, medic.  This force consists of REGULARs ONLY, where they know that they have volunteered for hazardous duty, and make sure they are well paid as well as highly trained.  Their UN duties will of course be much more risky, and they WILL have to take a neutral stance, which might piss some people off enough to try to hurt them.<br><br>The main draw for this small force would of course be the $$.  Its like a mercenary force in effect, just that they are ALL Singaporeans.  Active duty for the first 5 years, then they have a choice to quit, or sign on for another 2 years.<br><br>Of course, when people die, the question will always come.  Why are we involved in other people's problem.  Knowing Singaporeans boh chup attitude, they will blame the govt and bla bla bla.  Explanation, obligations to the UN as well as the rest of the world, playing a part to make the world a safer place.  Similar obligation as NS.<br><br>Mr FuckSpore4ever, we won't have squabbles like these if ur politicians would just stay out of our civil affairs.  It doesnt help when ur politicians attack little problems in our society tryin to create a mountain out of an ant-hill.  Karpal Singh can come battle this tudung case all he likes, but even he will not affect the laws of OUR land.</div>

Moreover, the people's fear that the combat engineers and signal units would face danger would be much lesser if we remind them that their's is just a supporting role. Word play can pacify much fear. The combat units can come in later after people are readily to accept Singapore's active role in Peace keeping missions.<br><br>For these, we can build up the small core that shotgun is talking about...but it will take at least 20 years before the imdset of the people can be changed.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Moreover, the people's fear that the combat engineers and signal units would face danger would be much lesser if we remind them that their's is just a supporting role"<br><br>I think that there is a slight though forgivable misconception about the role of combat enginners as a 'support role'. Strictly speaking, yes, we are not 'assault' forces in the true sense of the word..but in the SAF, our role is purely of MCM (mobility, countermobility) we do not emphasis on the 'building' aspect that the combat engieners from other countries have. Ie we do not train to build barracks / running water. etc, unlike the Seebees of the US or the royal engineers in the UK.<br><br>Thus in fact SAF engineers perhaps occupy the most precarious positions in the army, since evertime an armoured column hits a minefield or a AT ditch, we have to be called in to breach the obstacle, and all times under fire. Even for infantry units, when battalion level attacks and above are launched, the field enginners are sent to breach all the defences first...ie meaning we run out into the open to plant charges and hope that our infantry / guards brothers provide sufficient accurate and timely covering fire from their hidden positions to keep the enemy down so that we don't get killed. Well, not all of us anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>All our training is offensive in nature and we go in with all you front line guys to support your offensive, so i think i have a right to say that we are in the same risk group as the other assault forces.<br><br>As for 'behind the lines' work, again engineers die the most, sadly, cos our work involves clearing up all the spent / misfired /blinds that litter our routes of advance. Statistically, the most number of deaths that have come out from peachkeeping duties have all come from the engineers, cos we spend time clearing minefields and booby-trapped buildings and unexploded ordinance. etc.<br><br>So i guess in relation to sending in engineers to help out, i think it is a fantastic idea cos it will incerase our operational experience, but we must be, as a nation, prepared to accept horrendous wounds and fatalities.<br>A misfired blind / AP mine lying in cambodia or timor that has to cleared, will just be avoided by the infantry and marked with white tape. Then the engineers go in to clear it. Sigh.<br><br>Ironically, the 'glory' of death has even evaded the engineers. When special forces die, or when infantry die taking a position it always seem so much more 'press friendly' as opposed to 'a mine clearance officer had his torso blown open while clearing mines today'<br>which people who have no knowledge as to what the risks are, will just mouth off 'stupid arse, probably careless'<br><br>just hope to correct some misconceptions. Thanks.<br>Advance and Overcome.<br><br>As for the troll, just ignore the ignorant. Stupidity will feed off itself and die off.</div>
