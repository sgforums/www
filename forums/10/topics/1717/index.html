            <div class='col-md body'>I think the idea is to make them contribute to Singapore as well. As it is these women folk of ours just breeze into uni, and then go on to the working world and leave their peers 3 years behind.<br>I was thinking, that their NS requirement should be:<br><br>1)also 2-2.5 years, with reservist up till 13 cycles like us (or age 55 like officers LOL)<br>2) They should be sent incamp to do signaller, medic, HQ job, armourer, vehicle repair jobs if in the army, air force or navy. If in the SCDF, then everything also can. Like Israel, they should also all be trained to shoot and have basic marksmanship training and if in the army, be trained to operate at platoon level. Those with promise can go on to OCS or other combat fields, but no standards should be lowered for them.<br><br>3) They can serve their 'time' if in a combat vocation 'one-shot' like us. If in service vocation, then they should be held for longer, come for 2-3 week training cycle and come down once every 6-8 months for exercise and refresher course<br><br>cos in our people scare land, every non-combat role filled by a woman frees up more manpower to go to the field...this makes for a more combat effective force.<br><br>Same thing happened in Germany, Russia, and the the European coutries during WW2...the men went to fight and the women filled all the support roles.<br><br>Whatever it is, i'm just opposed to the fact that all the women get off scot free now in S'pore and just enjoy the peace and prosperity brought on by us guys. They shop and drink cofffe at Starbucks while we sit with FBO during 4 NTM.<br>We crawl in mud and burn our weekends and they sit in aircon NUS, NTU and study.<br>And when we are working we have to go back for reservist and they just continue working.<br><br>The worst thing is that they don't even seem to appreciate the emormous sacrifice that we men are making for the country.<br><br>It's about time they gave something back.<br>And sorry girls, if you're reading this, motherhood isn't NS!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for Tripwire's suggestion, i think girls will be called in early to serve NS b4 they have a chance to give birth to 2 or more children to get exempted given the late child bearing age of singapore woman. i would think it's quite a fair system suggested by No Frill. But i seriously won't think the suggestion will work and the government will definitely not implement it. Firstly, majority of the votes that the government are getting come from the womanfolk who are enjoying the good life here in singapore. Will they make a risk at this? Maybe that's the reason why a internal "secret" survey was done instead of a public one. In the end it will be NATO.</div>

With respect to tripwire's suggestion, one should note that monetary benifits are no longer a carrot to our womenfolk. With the 3 years headstart, they can earn well enough to cover it. Furthermore, if they opt not to have children, the income they gain will far exceed what they get from those bonuses that the government offers.<br><br>We should view this problem in a different light. The carrot approach has shown to produce dismaying results and there is no reason why one should continue in this manner. Bonus can still be used as an incentive but with a twist. Our womenfolk should be made to sign a clause at the age of 18 having the following conditions:<br><br>1)   If she wants to be exempted from NS, she has to bear a minimium of 2 children {to satisfy the minimum statistics to ensure a stable popultation growth} by the age of 35. {To lower the chance of Down Syndrom }<br><br>2)   In the event that she does not fufill this clause by the maximum age, she has to pay out an amount equalvalent to 35% of her total assets as a donation to various charities. Failure to do so will result in pausible legal action against her and her immediate family.<br><br>3)  In the event that she could not get a husband or any other means to gain children, there will be 2 options left<br><br>i) age : 25 &lt; age &lt; 34<br><br>She has to sign up for compulsory   National service, or opt for artificial means to produce children<br><br>ii) age : age &gt;= 35<br>Apply condition (1) to her.<br><br>3)  If she chooses to immigrate or take PR somewhere else, she has to deposit an amount up to S$500,000 with the government. Failure to satisfy conditions (1) and (2) will result in the S$500,000 being donated to charities.<br><br>Of course for those women who bears children, the baby bonus still applies.<br>Let's face it. We will be in dire straits if we do not take drastic measures. As Machiavelli said, the end justifies the means. We need to, above all else, ensure our survival for the future.<br><br></div>

Trade embargo? Withdrawal of WTO status?<br><br>Now this world is a pretty double standard place. As long as the world wide community needs you, you can rest assured that hounding would just remain hounding and no more {for example : Israel}.<br><br>Secondly, if this is interpreted as a human right violation, then the baby bonus could be twisted by human right / women right advocates as a form of human right violations as well {don't ask me how...they can find any cock and bull reasons to do so}.<br><br>Thirdly, as I have pointed out in the previous post, our birthrate is declining and unless we do something about it, there isn't much people we can choose from to defend Singapore. Already the male to female population in Singapore is approximately 1 : 2. If we are not allowed to conscript females into National Service, the only alternative means is to ensure that the femalefolk help out by maintaining our birthrate. I know I may sound sexist to some, but what I am stating is cold hard facts. I do not like it personally and I would not want my girlfriend to be a child bearing machine. But in the interest of ensuring our survival in the future...perhaps a small sacrifice on our part might suffice much.<br><br>Female right advocates could suggest relaxing the immigration policies to bring in younger blood to defend our nation. My question is, how do we measure the degree of their loyalty to our nation and cause? Paying lip service won't do in matters of ensuring survival.  Mercenaries isn't a solution either. But this belongs to another thread, and I am not incline to discuss it here.<br><br>Hence, unless cloning technology could reach such a stage where it could replace the birth cycle ...I do not see any other viable alternatives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree in principle with CenturianMBT's idea that women need to play a constructive role in our national survival. However, I think that his policies (though i do personally agree with them in many aspects - cos i think that many of our females here are self serving materialistic little insulated shits; but that alas is another story) need to be tampered with inevitable international opinion.<br><br>A better way to make women in S'pore pay their due is to make them serve the non-combat vocations in the SCDF, army, navy etc...<br><br>Forcing women to have children is somewhat draconian, and would get S'pore in a load of trouble internationally. Those femi-nazis will start frothing at their lips and start burning our flags across the world!<br>I also think it would be a touchy issue infringing on the point of Human rights to compel women to have children, regardless of the justified ends to be achieved.<br><br>I guess a good start is to start compulsary enlistment or women for all these services. I mean just think, if we had 20,000+ women entering NS every year, and if even 1/5 of them are trained as medics or paramedics, mechanics, armourers, clerks, etc, that will free up thousands of able bodied men to form more combat ready divisions.<br><br>I suppose that having a child is still \, at the heart of it all, a very personal choice and I wouldn't violate that right with a ten foot pole.<br>If S'pore did that, we'd be no better than Hitler's Nazi youth regeneration programme which he started running in 1933...where pure aryan women were plucked from their homes and housed in bavaria where the air was clean to 'mate' with selected pure aryan SS officers to produce pure Aryan offspring who were then conscripted into the Nazi youth.<br>A frightening thought.<br><br>I'd settle for a women OETI mechanic or signaller anyday  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Would be hilarious to see sexual puns like after range, we walk up to a woman armourer back at the base and and say :" excuse me corporal, can you please clean my gun for me...it's jammed and can't shoot off properly' LOL<br><br>just kidding folks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Due to our small population size and our lack of international exposure, it is hard to get really inspirational leaders who can instill a sense of pride and belonging in the army..."Farmers" unfortunately are far and few and some NS conscripts view officers who get promoted on their merit of having a higher education status as bogus.<br><br>Such mindsets could not be changed overnight...perhaps by sending out medics, we are taking the first step into gaining public recognition for our arm forces.
