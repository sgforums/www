              <p>i would like to agree with you on this but you must take into account the employment factor and salary factor here.</p>
              <p>it is true to the above mentioned but like what the TS also mentioned, what happens when theres an economic downturn and suddenly you are cut off from your job? worst still with the PR competition getting more intense, can one gurantee that he/she will be earning the same amount like their last pay if they are reemployed?? truth is, it is yes to a very small number of people, some might earn maybe 2k or 3k to keep their house alive suddenly find that they are forced to take a job with half the amount, you cannot blame this on the lack of forsight since no one can really fully accurately predict what will happen to them in 3-10 years time since the time aand situation is constantly changing,same applies to the stockmarket, since it is also changing everyday,either going up or down.</p>
              <p>theres a old quote that said" knowing the truth is not difficult but reacting to it is."</p>
              <p>as for baby hunter, he's view is a sceneario where it is  1 sided based on the assumption that it all goes well, what happens if something happens inbetween that changes all of that after that event? this was not factored in and this is also what i am trying to point out as this would lead us back to the same sceneario where the TS has his worries about.</p>

              <p>What's the point of making an extra effort on saving an extra $200+ per month when you can use the same amount of effort to earn an extra $2000 per month?</p>

              <h1>Another old 5-room resale HDB flat in Telok Blangah asking for nearly S$1 million dollars</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 8, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Three days ago, we put up an advertisement of a 5-room HDB flat in Marine Parade selling for an eye-popping S$990,000.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Now we have another 5-room flat in Telok Blangah asking for S$999,000, $9,000 more than the earlier flat:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/telokblangah585.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="350"></p>
              <p>From the photos above, the flat appears to be situated in an older part of Telok Blangah and is at least 30 years old which means that it has at most 60 – 70 years left on its lease since all HDB flats are 99-year old properties.</p>
              <p>The exorbitant prices asked by some property agents is a sign that the red-hot public housing market has got completely out of control.</p>
              <p>The prices of resale flats increased by 8.2 per cent in 2009 when Singapore was mired in recession with Cash-Over-Valuation (COVs) doubling from $12,000 to $24,000 in the last three months:</p>
              <p><img title="hdbresale2009" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/hdbresale2009.jpg" alt="hdbresale2009" width="563" height="162"></p>
              <p>The sky-rocketing prices are fueled largely by limited number of flats built between the years 2006 – 2008 coupled with the large influx of foreigners into Singapore during the same period of time.</p>
              <p>Only 3,183 new flats were built in 2008 when there were over 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens in the same year:</p>
              <p><img title="hdbfy01" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/hdbfy01.jpg" alt="hdbfy01" width="550" height="287"></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: HDB Financial Report 2008/2009]</strong></p>
              <p>The resale market is popped up artificially by PRs and new citizens. According to Mr Mohamad Ismail, CEO of real estate agency Propnex, about 20 per cent of the buyers of resale flats are PRs. ERA and C&amp;H quote their figures at 40 and 50 per cent respectively.</p>
              <p>Despite widespread concerns, worries and frustration among Singaporeans at the rising prices of HDB flats, the ruling party continues to insist that they are “affordable”.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said lately that there is nothing his administration can do to control the prices of resale flats as they are set between the buyer and the seller themselves.</p>
              <p>HDB has promised to increase the supply of new flats, but they will not be ready until a few years later.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, home buyers will have to put up with the astronomical prices asked for by sellers and agents.</p>

              <p>If I were to compare, I would compare with people in similar circumstances, not with people who have much much more committments than me (I don't even need to start elaborating about my committments). That would be too much of a loser mentality. Can't believe you can even come up with that. But what's the point? I don't need to compare; I just need to see people with similar attitudes like you can liao. Without your kind of "excuses" attitude proliferating, there wouldn't be society strata.</p>
