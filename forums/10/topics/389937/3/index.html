              <p>There's nothing wrong will letting the lease owner resell the leftover lease to other willing buyers.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the Singapore resale market has defied economic logic.</p>
              <p>HDB was never supposed to be an "asset".</p>
              <p>But since everyone was making a huge fortune back then, the authorities simply let the circus go unchecked.</p>
              <p>But can they do something about it now to rein in the problem ? Most certainly.</p>

              <p>Singaporean worried he has no money for retirement after paying
                                      for over-priced HDB flats</p>
              <p>A Singaporean by the name of Kang Choon Tian has written a
                                      letter to the Straits Times Forum today expressing the concerns,
                                      worries and fears of many Singaporeans on the sky-rocketing prices
                                      of HDB flats – that they may not have any money left in their CPF
                                      when the grow old.</p>
              <p>Mr Kang revealed that he took a loan of $80,000 some 20 years
                                      back and the interest came up to $70,000 after he had
                                      finished paying for his flat.</p>
              <p><strong>He is concerned that many Singaporeans may end up with little in
                                      their CPF accounts at current prices of HDB flats:</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>First, the title doesn't even fit this article. Mr. Kang is concerned about other Singaporeans; he himself paid much less than the current market price.</p>
              <p>Second, unless you are born with a silver spoon (or gold), financial planning should be started as soon as possible. Why only worry after buying the property? Or who in the right mind would buy something they can't afford? Serves those right who over exert their financial muscle.</p>
              <p>Third, as baby hunter said, Singaporeans can always downgrade to a smaller flat and pocket the difference for their retirement. The maths doesn't really work out in favour at all for Mr Kang's argument. Suppose property prices continue rising, the downgrade would put more money into their pockets actually.</p>
              <p>Four, work hard, work smart, save more and invest well when young. There are so many ways to get additional income sources. Cry and complain that no one helps you when you do not even attempt to start building a retirement nest early enough? What for? You want anything, you work for it, not stretch your hand and demand it.</p>

              <p><br>It is the lower income that is short of houses and making hell lots of noises. In HDB, there are 2 lines for Q, the lower income and the middle income only. All other higher income should go to the show room, that is the way we diversify our class and also allow each individual to have buy house. If all can buy house at the lowest level, that lower income line will be a long Q, not fair the the poorer one. Why u need a small house?? can come my house in joo chiat, i can rent my upstair room to you, penthouse.</p>

Cry and complain that no one helps you when you do not even attempt to start building a retirement nest early enough? What for? You want anything, you work for it, not stretch your hand and demand it.</p>

              <p><br> It is the lower income that is short of houses and making hell lots
                  of noises. In HDB, there are 2 lines for Q, the lower income
                  and the middle income only. All other higher income should go to
                  the show room, that is the way we diversify our class and also
                  allow each individual to have buy house. If all can buy house at
                  the lowest level, that lower income line will be a long Q, not fair
                  the the poorer one. Why u need a small house?? can come my house in

              <p>I'm not sayin the poor not be given "priority".. to smaller/cheaper flats. However, we're talking about the AVERAGE people.. those that falls at the mids of the bell curve.</p>
              <p>Why a higher income want a smaller house ? It's called resource allocation.. yes?</p>
              <p>Looking at the HDB website.. a 2 bedroom has a income ceiling of $2000.</p>
              <p>3 bedroom non-mature estates $3000.</p>
              <p>3 brm in mature or 4rm or bigger $8000</p>
              <p>So if the household earns more than $3000 (combined income).. these family will be forced to purchase a unit tat costs more.</p>
              <p>LIke that how to live within their means ?</p>
              <p>Kinda contradicting ain't it ? Do we really have to jump through hoops just to "live within our means ?"</p>

              <p>Hi, your point is extremely valid, which is what led me to write point number 4 ;)</p>
              <p>The key to protecting oneself nowadays is the fabled multiple sources of income. As for me, I have 2 main sources of active income, 1 small small source of income which I'm attempting to grow slowly, and 1 more which I'm trying to find time to create. All these exclude dividend income. My main aim is to protect myself from what you said.</p>
              <p>The future cannot be predicted, but it can be worked towards. And it's important to make hay while the sun shines, and conserve the hay for usage when the sun stops shining :)</p>

              <p>Hi, your point is extremely valid, which is what led me to write
              point number 4 ;)</p>
              <p>The key to protecting oneself nowadays is the fabled multiple
              sources of income. As for me, I have 2 main sources of active
              income, 1 small small source of income which I'm attempting to grow
              slowly, and 1 more which I'm trying to find time to create. All
              these exclude dividend income. My main aim is to protect myself
              from what you said.</p>
              <p>The future cannot be predicted, but it can be worked towards.
              And it's important to make hay while the sun shines, and conserve
              the hay for usage when the sun stops shining :)</p>

              <p>While what you are doing now is ideal for a single guy.</p>
              <p>It is unsustainable for a married person with children.</p>
              <p>Our society is paying a huge price for the artificially induced high cost of living.</p>
              <p>Donch tell me. ye gonna just keep your 2 timing job for the double income till you reach retirement age ? How much time ye gonna spend with your family ? There's really only 24 hours a day , no ?</p>

              <p>You really think 2 hours a day for the extra work is a lot when it can match full time income? I still think many people work longer hours than me on a typical work day.</p>
