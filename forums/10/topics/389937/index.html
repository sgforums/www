              <p>Singaporean worried he has no money for retirement after paying for over-priced HDB flats</p>
              <p>A Singaporean by the name of Kang Choon Tian has written a letter to the Straits Times Forum today expressing the concerns, worries and fears of many Singaporeans on the sky-rocketing prices of HDB flats – that they may not have any money left in their CPF when the grow old.</p>
              <p>Mr Kang revealed that he took a loan of $80,000 some 20 years back and the interest came up to $70,000 after he had finished paying for his flat.</p>
              <p>He is concerned that many Singaporeans may end up with little in their CPF accounts at current prices of HDB flats:</p>
              <p><em>“The Government should look into this or Singapore may end up with many retirees with little in their CPF account, assuming an average household income of $3,000 to $4,000. Since HDB flat buyers may use 30 per cent of household income, they may be able to service their loans, but little is left for retirement. Besides, along the way, husband or wife may lose their jobs.”</em></p>
              <p>He added that though Singaporeans may well afford to pay for their flats now, their ability to do so may decrease as they grow older:</p>
              <p><em>“Buyers are allowed to take up to a 30-year loan. By then, their earning power may also diminish when they reach 60, assuming they bought their flat in the early 30s.”</em></p>
              <p>More than 85 per cent of Singapore’s population living in public housing built by government agency Housing Development Board or HDB.</p>
              <p>While HDB flats used to be easily affordable by Singaporeans in the 1980s, prices have ballooned in recent years caused partly by a limited supply of new flats and rising demand fueled by the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore.</p>
              <p>The prices of HDB resale flats hit a record high last year and increase by 8.2 per cent with median Cash-over-Valuation (COVs) doubling from $12,000 to $24,000.</p>
              <p>In contrast, the median monthly salary of Singaporeans remain stagnant at around $2,600.</p>
              <p>Despite rising frustration, resentment and anger on the ground over the increase prices of public housing in Singapore, National Development Minister Mr Mah Bow Tan and other HDB officials continue to insist that they are “affordable” to ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah even chided first time home buyers for being “choosy” and said that “the onus is on Singaporeans to play their part by buying a home within their means.”</p>
              <p>Quoting the affordability benchmark of 30 per cent used frequently by HDB to show that HDB flats remain affordable to ordinary Singaporeans, Mr Mah said a family with a monthly income of $3,000 can buy a flat worth up to $250,000 and spend only 30 per cent of their income every month on the mortgage.</p>
              <p><em>“Similarly, a family with a monthly income of $4,000 can afford to buy a new flat worth up to $333,000 without spending more than 30 per cent a month on the mortgage. This means they can comfortably buy any of the flats offered in the latest BTO projects this month,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>However, Mr Mah fails to take into account the bank interest rates and inflation over the years which will lead eventually to the family spending more than 30 per cent of their monthly income on the mortgage as pointed out correctly by Mr Kang above.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, after depleting their entire CPF for these over-priced 99-year leasehold HDB flats, they will have little or no savings left for their retirement.</p>
              <p>Mr Kang ended his letter by urging financial experts to give their take on the issue:</p>
              <p><em>“Since there are many in this income bracket, I hope some financial experts will be able give their take on this important issue or Singapore may end up with many retirees with little to live on. Many buyers are not aware of the final price of their flat, including the interest over 30 years.”</em></p>
              <p>Singaporeans who need a roof over their heads now are stuck in a quandrary. On one hand, they are unwilling to make a purchase at the height of the property market, but they are also worried that prices may continue to go up.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew expressed optimism that HDB is an “asset” which will continue to appreciate in value so long the Singapore’s economy is doing well, but what if Singapore were to enter another protracted recession as a result of a global financial crisis?</p>
              <p>One does not need to be an economist to realize that there are always ups and downs in any market and it is impossible to expect prices of HDB flats to continue to be increasing forever.</p>
              <p>With wages lagging far behind the phenomenal increase in prices,  they will have to come down one day when there are too few buyers in the market who can afford to buy them or worse, come crashing down if foreigners were to leave Singapore in the event of a recession.</p>
              <p>At the rate the prices are going up, some Singaporeans may have to wait till their parents pass on to inherit a roof over their heads.</p>

              <p>Here's a copy and paste from HDB website on eligibility.</p>
              <p>"Each eligible Singaporean household can buy the following housing unit <strong>only twice</strong>:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>a flat from the HDB; </li>
              <li>a resale flat with the CPF Housing Grant; </li>
              <li>a DBSS flat from developer; </li>
              <li>an EC unit from developer.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br> If you have already bought two housing units, you will not be eligible
                          to apply or be listed as an essential occupier in an application."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First time home buyers are newly weds/new start up family with.. low savings, high expenses. They probably go for the low end flats. 2 bedrooms/3room flat.</p>
              <p>Then sell it to get a bigger flat as the family grows. So they have to purchase a  flat SECOND time.</p>
              <p>After children grows up.. the couple become empty nesters. Children no longer living with them.</p>
              <p>Should they sell their bigger home to downgrade to a smaller one ? Will they be eligible to apply another flat directly from HDB ? </p>
              <p>OR,  are they forced to purchase a smaller RESALE flat from market ?</p>
              <p>With the current exhorbitant  RESALE prices.. is that even feasible ? Will empty nesters be forced to live in a bigger flat or risk paying through their nose for a smaller unit during <strong>retirement</strong> ?</p>
              <p>Isn't it time HDB review it's two strikes policy ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">After children grows up.. the
                              couple become empty nesters. Children no longer living with
                              them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Should they sell their bigger home
                              to downgrade to a smaller one ? Will they be eligible to apply
                              another flat directly from HDB ? </span><br> By then, they should already pay off their 2nd flat. there's no
                              reason for them to buy another flat either from HDB or resale
                              market.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">OR,  are they forced to
                              purchase a smaller RESALE flat from market ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">With the current exhorbitant 
                              RESALE prices.. is that even feasible ? Will empty nesters be
                              forced to live in a bigger flat or risk paying through their nose
                              for a smaller unit during <strong>retirement</strong> ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Again, by then they should already
                              paid off their current flat, if is 4rm flat, it worth ard 350k to
                              400k (on arrange base on today market). 5rm flat worth ard 400k to
                              500k.</span></p>
              <p>even they will to down grade &amp; buy a 3rm from open market
                               which is worth ard 250k, it is enough to 100% paid off &amp;
                              with some extra cash on hand for retirement.</p>

              <p>Ofcors no problem ASSUMING we live in a perfect world..</p>
              <p>where... all senior citizens are cash rich.</p>
              <p>Nobody in the family requires emergency/long term medical care.</p>
              <p>People remains youthful forever. No old age problems.</p>
              <p>Everyone remains gainfully employed their whole life.</p>
              <p>All the profits from the sale of flat are in cash.. no need put back into CPF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, reality ain't this perfect way.</p>
              <p>By the time you are retired, it's just illogical to be sitting on fixed assets that's worth 300K-400K. What you need is more cash/liquidity, less fixed assets ( 250,000 worth for a smaller flat? that's a lot for old people).</p>
              <p>Then there's the minimum sum, mandatory life plan... etc etc...</p>
              <p>HDB claims there's few hundreds empty units no Singaporean wants to buy. Then release them for rentals to old folks. Remove the 2 strike restrictions for HDB rentals. Don't force old folks to havta buy from the OVERPRICED RESALE market.</p>
              <p>There's a lot government policy can help to ease retirement stress. Yet old people need to work till their death, and we claim to be Swiss standard... ??? The irony...</p>

              <p>If you are the middle class, you cant retire in Singapore. Either you die on your job (which is the most fortunate), or sell you assets and retire in a cheaper country.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I can't imagine how our next generation is going to cope with their housing commitment, why are we so suffering staying in our own country whereby the HDB property prices can be kept in control initially. We have to stop this before our flats start to reach a million dollars. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">MBT always say HDB is affordable does he really look into it or he is judging based on his salary. I’m really sad and disappointed by our government. Why took us as money machine and yet you lose billions on investment. If only this billions can use to subsidies our housing benefits. </span></p>
