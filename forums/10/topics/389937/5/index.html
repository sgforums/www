              <p>With the resident Taiwanese 'hum' acting as a hustler at night working in PAPa's sleazy bar, pimping the China and Filippino girls, and then walking the street herself - obviously the stooooopid attitude towards money is that it is like liquid.</p>
              <p>Why pretend to be an economist when you are a half-baked lawyer receiving only partial training ?</p>
              <p>Now the Taiwanese 'hum' want to impress with its 2 cents worth of homilies - to teach others the intricacies of Capital and Economics.</p>
              <p>How pathetic that the desparation of a Taiwanese 'hum' looking for attention is insatiable and will not stop her stoooopidity as an Attention Seeking Whore 24 / 7.</p>

              <p>Yeah, Genie, medical cost expensive. My mum going for checkup in the polyclinic...+ medicine, the cost is about $130.</p>
              <p>No matter how we save, we fear govt or govt own...might up the fees here and there...making saving almost impossible.</p>
              <p>Pple so hard to save a few hundred dollars and now, (school fees increase), the save will just wipe out again. Parents are of course not happy and they keeps on doing this throughout this year, the GE, pap percentage will drop from 66.6%.</p>

              <p>Yeah, Genie, medical cost expensive. My mum going for checkup in the polyclinic...+ medicine, the cost is about $130.</p>
              <p>No matter how we save, we fear govt or govt own...might up the fees here and there...making saving almost impossible.</p>
              <p>Pple so hard to save a few hundred dollars and now, (school fees increase), the save will just wipe out again. Parents are of course not happy and they keeps on doing this throughout this year, the GE, pap percentage will drop from 66.6%.</p>
