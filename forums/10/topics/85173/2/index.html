            <div class='col-md body'>I think we agree a slap on the wrist is not the punishment we expect for drink driving.<br><br>But the person in question did not knock down anyone. If his statement is anything to go by, he has already expressed remorse over his offence. Blaming the 'whole world ' as some have put it for his predicament isn't exactly peachy, but it's natural for a person in his position to feel frustration.<br><br>Debts are piling, his wife (apparently from his statement) has gone back to work to help clear his bills and loans. It's a dead-end street anyway you see if he cannot secure a decent job. And at his &gt;50 age, it can only get more difficult.<br><br>Put it simply, he wants to regain a small measure of dignity he lost when he was charged in court. His path can only be doubly hard from now onwards. Still, we, being on-lookers, should not be the first to deny him a chance at some form of redemption.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed that most here easily pin point that drink driving is an offence. I also agree that LTA or the taxi company should be clear in their regulations and conditions for a taxi lic and return him the fee.<br><br>But the point is: He knew the law and the consequences that came with it but do it anyway. Honest mistake? I don't think so.<br><br>And most post here did not say aren't giving him the 2nd chance.  We can understand his current position but can he understand LTA or the taxi's company position on not allowing having the lic? Cannot view in 1 area, most look at the whole picture also mah.<br><br>If he can, I believe, he would not even bother to go and apply for that lic in the first place.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I fully agree, that alcohol and driving a vehicle, DO NOT mix, I must and would also like to point out that there are far more serious accidents involving Taxis and Buses, due largely to NEGLIGENCE, and of course, the ever popular Singapore's selfish driving habits.<br><br>Personally, I see and read about more sober motorists who drive inconsiderately and consequentially killing others if not just themselves.<br>Having said this, I do not mean to say that drinkers don't contrbute to accidents on our roads. Th crux of all this so far, is basic COMPASSION and mental perception of someone, who has run afoul our Local Law.<br><br>In this regard, I shall confidently state that the majority of road accidents here, are caused by inconsiderate motorists and speed-addicts, showing off their new snazzy japanese car or continental marquee. I wouldn't expect anything less than this, in my country, where COURTESY, KINDNESS, &amp; GRACIOUSNESS, needs campagnes to instill in people in general.<br><br>I hope, I have sumarrily addressed my opinion on this topic of Drink Driving, and the giving of one, the benefit of possible redemption after persecution for any wrongs done in Singapore.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The response in this forum and the other forum seemed to show that many people are rather unforgiving and live in a world of black and white. They think that when one commits an offence, one deserves to be punished. No redemption. No sympathy.<br><br>We're human beings and not saints. We are subject to temptation, greed, fear and moments of folly. To err is human.<br><br>Some forummers have also missed the point that alchfree wasn't blaming LTA for not allowing him to be a cabbie. He was actually venting his anger over LTA inefficiency; for not informing him in the first instance that his conviction disqualifies him for the job. If only LTA had told him that then he won't be wasting his money and effort in applying a second time. He was also not too happy with LTA for not refunding him the $30.50. I won't blame him for when one is poor every cent counts. Moreover, he was in debt and jobless. The $30.50 was indeed a huge amount to him.<br><br>As he had realised his mistake and had suffered a lot, I don't think we should castigate him any further. The least gracious Singaporeans could do is to lend him a sympathetic ear. Everybody makes mistakes.</div>
