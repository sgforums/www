            <div class='col-md body'>So it was possible to it drove its engineer to suicide. A post from youngPAP shows how hard hearted LTS is:<br><br>I was caught for drink driving more than 3 years ago and was charged in court, was fined a few thousands dollars and disqualified from driving for 2 years.<br>It was a stupid and a very expensive mistake.<br>I was retrenched after my boss found out and lost a $6000 pm job.<br>Naturally, I was depressed and feeling very down and worst, my dad was hospitalized. I wouldnÂ’t let him know about my predicament. Not long after my dad passed away and I still couldnÂ’t find a job.<br>My bills were piling up; especially the property which I committed at the peak was already down by 40 percent after the 9 September WTC disaster. I couldnÂ’t sell my house as the return itself was not sufficient to repay the whole principal sum.<br>Outstanding loans were rescheduled over and over again, incurring more costs and headache.<br>Luckily, I have a very good wife who supported by going to work at an age, most women would have retired.<br>The main problem in getting a job was my age, most employers considered old when you are over 50.<br>After my 2-year suspension was up and I have to go through the entire driving test a newbie would and managed to pass it first time. All those basic and final theory and the practical test took more than a year including waiting time.<br>In March 2003 I was issued a qualified driving license and I decided to apply for a taxi license.<br>I went to LTA but was told I have to wait for a year before I can be considered for approval because the minimum driving experience is one year on the road.<br>I told them I had been driving for more than 28 years but was told the past history was irrelevant as the date of my passing was in March 2003 and am classified as a new driver.<br>In April this year, 2004 I went to a job road show and apply for a post of a taxi driver again.<br>What puzzled me most was I have to pay $30.50 to LTA for processing my application and it took one month.<br>I think LTA deserved a place in the Guinness world of records for charging an administration fee for a job application.<br>My heart was jolted when I received a letter stating I was not qualified due to my past records.<br>This is a clear double standard, one year ago I was told my past driving history was irrelevant and now my past history becomes an issue.<br>If only they had make known to me that applicant with drink drive record will not be accepted, I would not have applied and save that $30.<br>The period between my suspension and the re-test took about three and a half years and I have lost two parents. My mum just passed away after witnessing the agony I was going through.<br>I am still without a job and am very desperate.<br>I am merely trying to get a job most suitable for my age and am prepared to earn less than 30% of my last drawn pay.<br>I have never even touch a drop of alcohol ever since I was convicted and is there really no 2nd chance in Singapore even for an honest mistake.<br><br>Why is LTA so unforgiving and punishing?<br>HavenÂ’t I been punished enough?<br>What should I do to be reinstated as a normal Singapore citizen again?</div>

Wait till your love ones gets knock down by a drink driver and only to realize later that the same driver has commited the same offense before and the LTA lets him become a taxi driver despite that. What will be your thoughts then.<br><br>Yes, he deserve to have a second chance, but not as a taxi driver. There are many other jobs out there. No one is cornering him. There is nothing wrong with the rule that irresponsible driver should never be given a taxi-driver license. There are too many irresponsible taxi-drivers out there already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LTA 's staff is definately practising double standard. One day I parked my old car at one dead end of Thomson Ridge when I was  there for a jog in Mactriche jungle track. I got a summon ticket of $70 for illegal parking because there is a water hydrant nearby. Since then I parked my car elsewhere but I have observed since then that there is a brand new Mercedes parking in the same spot almost everyday and even overnight because the owner(maybe a VIP) of the Mercedes is staying bearby and it looks like he owns that spot!I just do not believe that such jungle law still exist in Thomson Ridge!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if the LTA forbid him to be a taxi-driver,they should return him the $30.And also,the LTA should disclose their rules n regulation on what kind of applicants will definitely not accepted so that those ppl wont be wasting their time to apply for the job.They should be more transparent on it.But then again,some ppl here got their point,i mean if u cant apply for a taxi-driver,u can always apply for other jobs.Because taxi-driver dont earn as much as 10 or 20 years ago.If let say u apply for the job n was rejected 10 years ago,i can feel ur frustration.But now the golden period for taxi-driver is over already,now with this kind of economic,many jobs pay have been reduce significantly.So taxi-driver job also not as good as u think now,some even grumble they drive whole day only can cover up the expenses n the fees.</div>
