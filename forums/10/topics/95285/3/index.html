Like running and doing live shooting with someone beside you. And never play 'Pray the bugger don't fall down and accidentally shoot live round into your butt'.<br><br>Yes, yes, they never had a chance at that. But guys cannot play 'carry the baby'. Guys can't play 'period'. Guys can't play 'miscarriage'. Guys can't play 'breAst cancer', 'breAst feeding'. Guys can't play 'push the baby'<br><br>Life is unfair.
