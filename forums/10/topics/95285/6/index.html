            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JusticeLegal:</div><div class="quote_body">Research has shown that 90% of these cases is due to malingering. These people are weak. They cannot face up to the training that they are supposed to go through and they fient illness and purposely make themselves sick inorder to escape army life. So what's all these about suffering? You guys choose to inflict such pain upon yourselves is none of my concerns. Anyway way as I have said, NS is a duty for the stronger sex. You people are suppose to be the head of the families remember? So you all have a moral obligation to serve national service. Since this is a MORAL obligation, it does not entitle you all to an extra pay raise. Moreover, most of you all are just sleeping your life away there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div></blockquote><strong> With all due respect, I am a woman and I am just providing a view </strong>. It is not a moral obligation, it is a LEGISLATED obligation . <strong> Moral obligation suggests a freedom of  choice to walk away while legislated obligations come with PENALTY - JAIL </strong>  Show me the research? 90%? SO are you telling me the 10% are weak because they got injured? It is not a choice for the men to inflict pain on themselves when they are really and genuinely injured because of training. <strong> If you want equality first, you do not define gender as stronger or weaker </strong> . I have a former classmate who is permanently a cripple - not because of malingering...he was crippled on one leg  because he did the parachute jump and something went wrong when he landed. No wonder the guys are cheesed off about you.<br><br><strong> IF you are naive to suggests such posterity , it is best you do not become a  medical doctor at all because you seem to have the tendency to stereotype people with a prejudice based on your presented arguments . Particularly your effortless  rejection of what NS is about disgust me to no end . </strong> Like I said doctoring needs more maturity - you weight your decisions to treat carefully . You are not just mending a broken machine which can be replaced , the patient's life lies in your hand and if he should die....think of his loved ones from parents to children. All human beings deserve that right to non-judgemental healthcare. Good luck to medical school - if they reject you ...it is not because of your gender but rather your attitude.<br><br>And as for being Singaporean , you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Defending singapore is everyone's obligation. Males just have it tougher. You are prejudging all national service men based on what someone you know got it easy.<br><br>If you want to debate about inequality , please present an intelligible argument instead of a ditzy and flimsy type of defence.  Your arguments  reminds me more of  spoilt brats who like to whine when daddy or mommy don't let them have their way. Get off from the ivory tower, my little princess ,and smell the grass and fertilizers . Personally I won't want a future doctor who thinks like this, unless I am a lawyer loves medical litigation.<br></div>
