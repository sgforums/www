In the end it all heads nowhere because both sides have their own problems to handle. Nobody every said pregnancy was simple, or the like, anybody who has a mother would know.<br><br>What drives guys nuts is that while we are expected to grit our teeth about the tough issues in our lives, we have ladies like such barging in and complaining about how easy NS is compared to their problems, and how unfair life is for them. Please, if you haven't been there don't open your gap. If we don't downplay your female problems please have some courtesy and stop yabbering as if it is the end of the world and how great and easy it is to be a guy.<br><br>Try living shorter, more stressful and dangerous lives, the reason why we have less biological liabilities is so that we can make sure the biologically liable and whiny gender can survive. If we don't make so much noise about our part of the bargain to keep the species going, please make things easier for everyone by clamming up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Ah, but it's unfair.<br><br>Physical liabilities has made women as possession in history.

The world is unfair.<br><br>Very. Unequal.<br><br>Aye, the Government can never compensate back the time loss, no matter what, even if they force employers to give three times the pay we're working for. We still lose 2 years. The two years of service is important. So what is right and what is wrong?<br><br>This is a chicken or egg question. Do you like orange or do you prefer apple?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Three reasons why women are not discriminated in today's society:-<br><br>(1) NS service handicaps in establishing career by the period of NS - 18 months.<br><br>(2) Women Charter - guarantees or almost guarantees women of rights to share half the share of husband's property upon divorce.<br><br>(3) Independence of women due to equal educational opportunity.<br><br>Under the new social or political conditions of today, women are generally more assertive, and are less dependent on husband for a living.<br><br>Under women's charter, because of the almost automatic right to share half of husband's property and not the other way, women today would on the slightest ground seek divorce in order to take the monies from divorce and enjoy her riches or windfall hardly earned by her instead of continuing to safeguard sanctity of family as compared with more virtuous women of the good old days.<br><br>While women generally secure equal opportunities, they are generally not bound by cultures or customs to provide for the family and would quit a job and expect husbands to continue working and providing for the family the rest of the years. Where both wife and husband are working, it is the husband who has to foot the main bills and expenses while women keeps her earnings for herself.<br><br>The working women are equal to men in today's society but the old women charter remains the same based on the old days' assumptions that women are dependent on husbands for living. Actually women are quite well to do in most cases.<br><br>Yet, there is no hurry to change for political expediency. Family today is no longer as stable and is becoming unstable with many broken families. The problem is : laws are encouraging divorce and broken families. Isn't it time to change the inequity if we want to encourage men to marry and women not to divorce. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Not ALL women want the same things, it's the higher level WORKING women who want a bigger piece of everything. They benefit most from the Women's Charter, they benefit most from the PM's new baby-churning project,  they want more equal treatment in the office and they find it the easiest to look down on men whom they think are playing ma-sah ma-sah in the army <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>But don't fret, men! No point squabbling with this breed of women or telling them to clam up. They won't. Not only do they look down on men, they turn on women too - some woman doctor actually shamelessly insinuated, in the ST Forum page, that there's a difference between working and non-working baby-making women. Like a "professional" womb is more worthy than a "domesticated" womb lah.

            <div class='col-md body'>As a woman, I think I need to answer this<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gerrykoh:</div><div class="quote_body">Don't complain or later the girls have to do NS.<br>Also the quota for females in Medical Faculty. Think should be correct cos most of the girls become GP, they don't specialise.<br>Also if too many highly educated girls, then there will be a problem- cannot find enough highly educated guys to marry, most will end up -spinsters! </div></blockquote>Highly educated women have their choice to marry whoever they want and a choice to remain single . After all this is not the ancient times. After all are u saying that men are dumber than women in the aspect of academic achievements since  highly educated women" cannot find enough highly educated guys"?<br><br>Quota for females in the medical faculty - there is a reason  -however I am of a view that every one has to go in based on their own merit not including their gender. It is not that women become GP and don't specialise. The problem is that medicine is a male dominated profession as with law. Men tend to see women as a potential to quit their jobs and have babies and therefore restrict the quota based on what they think is going to happen.<strong><br><br>It could be a high probability that the physiological side of things- the 9 months gestation period that creates the quotas.</strong> Probably what they are worried about is women leaving the medical profession after getting pregnant because of the medical risks involved in pregnancy (i.e. if a woman is pregnant certain drugs like anaesthetic gases can affect her)  and potential exposure to pathogens in the hospitals (hospitals are teeming with germs) which may affect the unborn child directly . All I know doctoring is all about clinical skills ...if u keep away for too long , you lose them . However maternity leave shouldn't be a problem because we have nurses who are pregnant and coming back to work after the birth.   I don't know many female doctors but I know a few successful female lawyers with families , who had to struggled against a male dominated profession at all odds.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JusticeLegal:</div><div class="quote_body">In short, Singapore is a country that practises gender inequality since males get all the advantages. 2 years of national service is nothing.

If all women are to be absolutely equal and, then shall we all do national service?  Your argument  " men being the stronger sex should  defend us" just makes my skin crawls . It is up to everyone to defend their country with all they got.  Elizabeth Choy was a war heroine who helped POWs in WW2, who defended Singapore and got imprisoned. She got tortured for that.  That is what a woman did in bravery to help those who tried to defend us.<strong> Israel has national service for girls</strong> , even girls can do national service.<br><br>I say let the men keep the NS benefits - they deserve to. National Service is not just nothing- they are actually sacrificing 2 years of their lives in preparation to protect everyone in Singapore. 2 years Of THEIR LIVES  which they could use to build a good career or maybe do something they like. My dad could have been rich  if NS was non existent. It took away his job opportunity overseas and once an opportunity is missed - it seldom returns. I think we should have a little more respect for those defending Singapore than bashing up NS and Singaporean men over your frustration in medical school quotas.<br><br>Now the part about beaten by husbands , oogled and sexual harassment - there are laws to protect women against abuse- two words I have to say about that : USE THEM. just be thankful you are not living in saudi arabia or in afghanistan (under the taliban) where women have no rights at all.
