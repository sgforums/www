Okay, we should look at all these things," Syed Hamid was quoted as saying by the state Bernama news agency.<br><br>"The governments (of OIC) countries should look and we must not allow Israel to do what it wants," he said, but added that Muslim countries had to act according to international norms and principles.<br><br>Syed Hamid also criticised a United Nations draft resolution on ending the conflict which has been rejected by Lebanon because it does not call for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from its territory.<br><br>"I think we must not look at Israel only. We must also look at what Lebanon wants. I think it is unfair, imbalanced and unjust to just look at what Israel wants," he said.<br><br>"The world should not be dictated just purely by Israeli desire but it must be incorporating justice and fairness in the international system," he said.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
