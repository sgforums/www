The crux of 377A is about acts behind closed doors. Is the Indian language mainly used behind closed doors?</div></blockquote>I apologise - perhaps the use of the Indian language is not appropriate. Let us hence consider the example of religious practices, which can be done behind closed doors - the example perhaps of eating bread for communion.<br><br>To answer your counter-challenge (point 2), So what if the eating of bread as a religous act is allowed? I agree, there is no consequence, it is after all a private act and as long as you don't forcefeed say a Muslim into eating bread as a symbol of Christ-Worship, so what if the eating of bread is allowed?<br><br>Have you however considered the converse.

Will that not count in a way of religious discrimination, when the private worship practices of a religion is deemed unnatural (i mean, bread was never naturally used as a symbol for the flesh of Christ), and any partakers in this activity is liable to litigation? Therefore one must answer both sides of the question when using the phrase "So What" to have a more logically defensible argument.<br><br>You also talk about the concept of the "Big Picture". I agree with you that the Big Picture is important. Consider the "big picture" of what is essentially a discriminatory act against a minority - going against their civil right of intercourse with a consenting individual. Given such a precedent, what prevents Parliament from banning other actions within the civil rights of a Singaporean as illegal? Using the same example, if the government can erode the civil rights of a gay of intercourse, why can the government not erode the civil rights of a Christian to freedom of religious worship?<br><br>Therefore considering the "Big Picture" also tells us that the need to repeal 377A is important in protecting the sancity of civil rights of Singaporeans - that there are some sacred basic rights granted to every Singaporean that cannot be superseded by another law.<br><br>I hope for interesting replies supporting/opposing the above argument.</div>

So what if the eating of bread as a religious act is not allowed? Will that not count in a way of religious discrimination, when the private worship practices of a religion is deemed unnatural (i mean, bread was never naturally used as a symbol for the flesh of Christ), and any partakers in this activity is liable to litigation? Therefore one must answer both sides of the question when using the phrase "So What" to have a more logically defensible argument.<br><br>You also talk about the concept of the "Big Picture". I agree with you that the Big Picture is important. Consider the "big picture" of what is essentially a discriminatory act against a minority - going against their civil right of intercourse with a consenting individual. Given such a precedent, what prevents Parliament from banning other actions within the civil rights of a Singaporean as illegal? Using the same example, if the government can erode the civil rights of a gay of intercourse, why can the government not erode the civil rights of a Christian to freedom of religious worship?<br><br>Therefore considering the "Big Picture" also tells us that the need to repeal 377A is important in protecting the sancity of civil rights of Singaporeans - that there are some sacred basic rights granted to every Singaporean that cannot be superseded by another law.<br><br>I hope for interesting replies supporting/opposing the above argument.</div></blockquote>I can't provide u with an interesting reply.U talked about sacred basic right.First,geys shoud convince us homo is good  --- no right or wrong is nonsense.If homo sex is wrong or bad,do u want that kind of right?</div>
