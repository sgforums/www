However, according to Section 375, rape is committed when the defendant has intercourse with a girl under the age of 14, regardless of consent.  After a bit of digging around, the impression I get is that the age of consent is a figure arbitrarily set, and in some systems the figures were set in the late 1800s.  However, if you consider research into cognitive development, the ability to provide consent comes about after the age of 15 or 16 (depending on whose research you read), so 14 is in fact a liberal standard.</div>

Like .. I suck your dick .. you feel shiok right? I poke your backside you feel shiok right? In fact, homosexual acts seem to provide faster, instant gratification compared to heterosexual acts.</div></blockquote>I think it's interesting that you should hold this opinion, especially since Section 377 states:<br><br><blockquote>Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse <strong>against the order of nature</strong> with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.</blockquote>That being the case, you should logically be arguing for repeal of 377A.</div>

Or when a doubt exists to whether the party being exploited has the ability and sound judgement to give consent in the first place, like in the case of the underaged?</blockquote>If abberrant behaviour reflect lack of sound judgement, how is it that adults with abberrant behaviour are still deem to have sound judgement?<br><br>Note that in Crosshairs' reply, it is implicit that adults have the ability and sound judgement to give consent, is it not?</div>
