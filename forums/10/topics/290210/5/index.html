His words do have a way of getting me worked up...but we have to realise that when a person's view is so "focused" and relentlessly narrow, we the people who know better, should try to educate rather than reprimand. And if he refuses to listen to reason, we have to know when to stop trying to reason as well.<br><br>I went through the excruciating process of 'educating' my own parents to get them to see the side of homosexuality that isn't told to the general public. After 3 years of give and take, we've come to a comfortable situation where my parents now know that what they were taught about homosexuality in the past, and what is filtered through in the media today isn't adequate in helping people understand this lifestyle.<br><br>So just like my parents, i expect there are alot of people out there who have been 'nurtured' to view things in a narrow perspective, and cannot be helped unless special focus is given or a real life experience happens to them personally to help them uinderstand, like in the caseof my parents having a gay son.</div>

Don't compare us with them. 377A should rightfully be dismantled because it cannot and should not be enforced. The only reason it is still around is to keep people like you happy so you will carry on with your daily activities and our society function without unecessary distruption having your need to see unjust discrimination written in black and white, nothing else.<br><br>I hope you can see through the act. But again I don't think you are intelligent enough to.</div>

Can i ask,<br><br>Will you endorse a law that says<br><br>"The use of the Indian Language should be banned and any offender will be fined $1000" OR<br>"The eating of bread as a religious act is an offence liable to 5 weeks in jail"<br><br>if the government ASSURES you this law is a paper tiger and will never ever be enforced?<br><br>Since the law is not enforced, then it is not discriminatory to Indians/Christians, so going by the same argument you give for 377A, isn't it acceptable to make the above two statements laws?</div>
