My agenda is to expose narrowminded people like you. Because you incite hate against a group of people for no better reason other than the fact that you do not share their gender orientation. They do no harm to you, yet you want to see them prosecuted, and you turn around and claim to be the victim. Ever seen a bully hit a boy and then in an instant run to the teacher and claim that he was bullied? That's being shameless. In case you didn't know, this is called discrimination. Discrimination of this nature has no place in the modern society.<br><br>You have a narrow worldview which can be simplified into the phrase "It's me against them, and I must be right so they must be wrong". It's like saying a coffee drinker is of a better class than a tea drinker. It's like saying red is better than blue. Of course people like you do not consider the possibility that you could have very well been born like them, and the tables would have turned. But no, I don't think you have the mental capacity to consider alternate events. All you do everyday is to harp on the fact that they cannot reproduce and you can, as if it is some sort of crime. If it were a crime, I challenge you to bring charges to all those who are unable or unwilling to reproduce through heterosexual intercourse.<br><br>All they were asking is to be left alone to do what they want to do. You know what that means? That means they don't want to bother you. And you must Kay Poh. KAY POH!!! You have a day job? You got mouths to feed? I don't think so. Its people who do not have any meaning in their lives who try to interfere in how other people lead their lives. And that is you. If you so hate their kind, then don't watch their shows, don't buy their goods, I am sure you can do without them having a part in your meaningless existence.<br><br>Pat Robertson loves people like you. And I am sure Ted Haggard wants to love you too. You should go to america and join Fred Phelps. They will welcome you with open arms and you can find plenty of love in their embrace.</div></blockquote>So  u admit u bash me.So pls don't cry geys are the bashing boys!<br><br>Do u have a selfish motive on this topic?<br><br>My position is i accept geys but homo is wrong.I can't debate with a basher.</div>

Like .. I suck your dick .. you feel shiok right? I poke your backside you feel shiok right? In fact, homosexual acts seem to provide faster, instant gratification compared to heterosexual acts.</div>

What scientific basis for sexual attraction to close relative? Surely there is scientific basis for sexual attraction between different genders isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2. No comments.<br><br>3. But protecting animals come under the preview of animal laws isn't it? I mean those laws that fine you if you are seen causing harm to animals. If I can prove that no harm is caused to the animal .. why shouldn't beastality be allowed? Maybe the dog goes oww oww like a zhabor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
