              <h1>Support Mr Chiam See Tong’s call to abolish the GRC system and reform the media</h1>
              <p><strong>By Fang Zhi Yuan</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Veteran opposition MP Chiam See Tong on Wednesday called for the
              current Group Representation Constituency (GRC) system to be abolished.</strong></span></p>
              <p>If this cannot be done away with, then it should be modified from
              the present five to six members to two, comprising an ethnic and a
              Chinese members, he said. He also suggested that the the two-member GRC
              be limited to 20.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nowhere in the world including countries with significant ethnic
              minorities such as Malaysia, Indonesia, United Kingdom and France do we
              find a similiar electoral system to entrench the incumbents in power
              under the guise of ensuring minority representation.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Since the introduction of the GRC system in 1988, the size of the
              GRC have ballooned from the initial three to six. During the last
              general elections, there were only 9 single constituency seats. The
              smallest GRC is in Aljunied with five members.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In spite of the PAP and the state media’s insistence that GRC is
              necessary to ensure that minority voices are heard in Parliament, few
              Singaporeans believe that the set up has little to do with curbing the
              growth of the opposition in Singapore.</strong></span></p>
              <p>How do we get Rajaratnam, E W Barker, Othman Wok and Jeyaretnam into
              Parliament before the GRC system was introduced? These ethnic minority
              candidates fought and won in single wards against Chinese candidates.
              Jeyeretnam, in particular won two elections in Anson which is
              predominantly Chinese.</p>
              <p>The electoral boundary review committee which is under the purview
              of the Prime Minister’s Office reserves the right to redraw the
              electoral boundaries here and there at any time without the need to
              provide any explanations for doing so thereby leading to rampant
              gerrymandering to serve the political interests of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Enclaves with a high level of opposition support were taken out and
              merge with another constituency to dilute the opposition vote.</p>
              <p>We have seen this in Eunos and Cheng San GRC which was nearly won by the Workers’ Party in 1991 and 1997 respectively.</p>
              <p>Eunos GRC is now cut and divided amongst East Coast and Marine
              Parade GRCs while Cheng San GRC has been absorbed into Ang Mo Kio GRC
              under the Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>The PAP has no qualms shifting the goalposts to bolster their
              chances of winning in every elections even in GRCs which have been an
              impenetrable fortress for them so far.</p>
              <p>Though I support Mr Chiam’s call to abolish the GRC system, it is
              highly unlikely that the PAP will have the political will and courage
              to do away with a system which has served them so well over the past
              two decades.</p>
              <p>In addition to reducing the size and number of GRCs and increase the
              number of single constituency wards, may I suggest that we include a
              clause for all first time PAP MPs such as Indranee Rajah and Lee Bee
              Wah to fight one on one in single member constituencies (SMCs) instead
              of hitching a free ride into Parliament on the coat-tails of ministers.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam also called for a freer media ‘where more news of the
              opposition is allowed’, including the activities of the two incumbent
              opposition MPs.</p>
              <p>With the PAP firmly in control of SPH and enjoying a virtual
              monopoly over the media industry in Singapore, it is almost impossible
              to expect the media to liberalize itself to go against its political
              master.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have no more time to lose. We are lagging far away
              behind our neighbors Malaysia where a new media revolution is gradually
              changing their political landscape.</p>
              <p>The 2008 political tsunami which hit the shores of Malaysia leading
              to the loss of the customary two-thirds majority enjoyed by the Barisan
              Nasional (the Malaysian version of PAP) in Parliament is not a freak
              result.</p>
              <p>It began 10 years ago from the reformasi movement to free Anwar
              Ibrahim who was detained for 6 years under the Internal Security Act by
              Mahathir and the setting up of an independent online media -
              Malaysiakini to provide Malaysians a real alternative to the state
              controlled media.</p>
              <p>Malaysiakini has an online readership larger than all the mainstream
              papers today. There is a proliferation of socio-political news blog of
              late with new players such as The Malaysian Insider, The Nut Graph and
              the Chinese Merdeka Review adding to the chorus of independent voices
              to counter the state propaganda.</p>
              <p>Barisan Nasional, despite dominating the civil service, police and
              print media, is expected to lose the next general elections due to be
              held in 2012 if current trends persist. This is unimaginable almost a
              decade ago.</p>
              <p>As a keen observer of the political developments across the
              causeway, I notice a similiar awakening of political consciousness
              amongst Singaporeans though the pace is still pretty slow at the moment.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are more willing to express differing views contrary to
              the establishment openly compared to 10 years ago and to mobilize
              fellow citizens for a cause.</p>
              <p>The recent Aware saga and the ongoing petition drive to ask Lee Bee
              Wah to relinquish her position as STTA President are ample proof that
              Singaporeans are becoming more politically active, mature,
              and assertive. We are no longer contented with a nanny state telling us
              what to do. We want to have our voices heard by the government and we
              want to have a say in how the country is run.</p>
              <p>There is also rising interest in socio-political blogs which are
              usually less popular compared to celebrity and entertainment blogs.</p>
              <p>In the last six months, the two leading socio-political blogs of
              Singapore have seen a 100% leap in readership. A Straits Times article
              by Jeremy Au Yong last year reported The Online Citizen as having an
              alexa.com ranking of 1745 in October 2008. Wayang Party’s ranking is
              only 5,945 in the same period.</p>
              <p>Today, both blogs are not ranked in the top 600 of the most visited
              sites in Singapore. Established blogs like Yawning Bread and newcomers
              like The Kent Ridge Common have also seen an increase in their
              readership.</p>
              <p>We must seize the moment now to set up an independent online news
              daily run by professional journalists in the mould of Malaysiakini to
              give the mainstream media a run for its money.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I call on opposition politicians, journalists, activists and all
              Singaporeans interested to lead Singapore to the next stage of
              political development to pool their funds and resources together to
              register a company to run this “Singaporekini”.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I believe such a news blog run by full time profesional journalists
              will be a hit in Singapore and it will take no longer than 6 months for
              it to establish itself as a credible alternative to the mainstream
              media.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The next generation of voters will be spending more time on the
              alternative news media than the print media which is fast losing its
              appeal for its lacklustre, biased and toothless reporting.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Once we break through the PAP’s monopoly on the control and
              dissemination of news, it will take no more than two elections for
              Singaporeans to regain their rights as proud citizens of their land by
              booting the despotic PAP out of power forever.</strong></span></p>
