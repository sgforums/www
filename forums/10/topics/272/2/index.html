            <div class='col-md body'>eh...was just wondering, you people talk as if you people has gone thru wars, or are experts at military (and home) defence. anyone here, fought in the war against the japanese during the WWII in Singapore? i dun think so. Even me, i am not well-versed in defence issues. But one thing for sure, i know it is always easy to suan people, and act tough in the forum, as afterall, you guys are typical singaporeans, talk in forum like real, but when come back to reality, all suddenly siam.<br><br>anyway, say watever u all want to say. the truth is, and i guess everyone knows, but just don't want to admit, is that, Singapore definitely has no chance at war (let's say with USA, can win meh?). that is why, it is much better to prevent wars, and treat other countries nicely. Like USA, u think they are nice to other countries? they say watever they want, cos' no one dare to fight them back. Well, guess LKY use the brain of the country more than the brawn for national defence. we make peace, and make bonds with other countries, and hope that, we don't have to come to the point of waging war.<br><br>however, having an army, a navy or an air force, gives us, at least the chance to fight back, if all means fail (like talks and so on...). but, let's be realistic, if we do get into a war, we will not win, but i think we will still fight. war is not the issue, the issue here i think (think only, me not some expert in defence ah...) is defence. if we have no army at all, ppl will take advantage of us (and there is no country in the world, without a military...), and i guess it is a form of deterrence.<br><br>NS in singapore, is a part and parcel as a singaporean. u dun like it, you find ways to escape it from chao keng, migrate to another country, change sex, or watver. the point is, if u think u want to stay in singapore, and be a singaporean, then serve NS. talk so much no use. it is sealed, the fate of male singaporeans to serve NS.<br><br>well, one thing for sure, i have gone thru NS. I like NS, it made me fitter, made me more manly then before. (i came in as a JC boy, i came out as a man) i seriously think NS is an eye-opener. u see offficers who use power to tekan u, and u jusz take the crap, and take it as a life lesson. then, u realise that, afterall 2 1/2 yrs spent doing NS, is not so bad afterall. Yes, of course, some would say, i can do much more for singapore if i go work or start businesses like those young millionaires in USA. but that is USA, this is Singapore. Eventhough NS is not the a good option, it is our only best option to defend our country.<br><br>yes, sure, malays are not trusted, despite being the natives of Singapore. i can understand that, but when malays are discriminated, which have not happened yet, i will not tolerate it. So what if there is no BG who is a malay, or watever. All these measures, i believe are in place, to ensure that our country has the highest chance to fight our enemies, afterall we are a red dot in the centre of the MALAY peninsula, so obviously, malays (rather muslims) will think twice if they have to fight enemies of the same race or religion. anyway, don't worry too much, war in singapore, i don't think will ever materialise, and don't ask for it.<br><br>we might live harmoniously with each other, but we are in fact accepting each other grudgingly, u know it, and i know it. Garmen also knows it. but wat to do? our society is so scared of making our intentions known publicly except behind the monitor console (to hide oursleves behind the masquearade of a cybernickname, and life.)<br><br>life in singapore, is good, much better than in other countries, NS is just something which we have to do, whether we like it or not. If we don't we can get out of singapore, but when we re-evaluate things, we know that NS is a small price to pay for peace, prosperity in Singapore, eventhough, there are plenty of things in Singapore which we might not be happy about. It's life, and NS is a part of a male singaporean life. IF you are a male, and u have not gone thru NS, you have not grown into a male singaporean yet. NS is a privilege. To serve our country is a privilege, if we keep on dwelling on the hope that garmen would strike off NS, then, dream on. You cannot even rationalise why bubble/chewing gum had to be banned, you want to touch the issue on state's defence?<br><br>anyway, there is one irony about NS. you can have a person leading the whole platoon, having important roles in defending the country (let's say a PC who is 19-20 yrs), and u have NSman who can hold weapons, be exposed to war tactics, the atrocity of wars, killings and bla bla, but i was wondering, how come, NSman, who are below the age of 21 are by law not allowed to watch an RA film. weird huh? cannot watch people having sex, or shout profanity or war or watver deemed restricted, but can make us use m-16, can brainwash us to fight in a war.<br>just wondering..<br><br>anyway, i feel that being singaporean or not, is not the issue. it is being human which is more important. we have to be responsible as a human, for what life has given us. In Singaporeans' context, this life we have, is all thanks to our country, and of course, as a responsible human, we should just do our part, and accept NS as it is.<br><br>hmm... guess wrote too much, anyway, it's just my opinion, and it is not based on any expert's views at all. if u all want to slander me go ahead, i accept. anyway, this is a forum, and singaporeans love forums, because at least not like the speaker's corner, need to register with the police, then can whack a person. so have fun, criticising others, and say profanities in this forum, singaporeans need more such facilities to let us channel out our frustration, which we had for so long (due to the system in our country) Happy New Year! have fun <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
