Mind wad you say.noe nuttin about warfare, shut up. If you underestimate Singapore and despised her so much, get out of Singapore. imigrate to other place. I'n serious. Go AWAY! Singapore doesn't need people like you. We go to NS, so as to protect out loved ones and properties in case of an emergency. We protect the hardwork of our government since our independence. This beautiful and powerful small country, doesn't need a coward,brat,bastard like you. Any way, people liek you are useless in our society. totally useless!<br><br></div>

Do they respect those who have given their lives to defend Singapore?  From the way I look at it, NO.<br><br>"In this world, where young millionaires are getting more and more common in USA who created softwares, the value of time is no longer as worthless as the previous generation, the opportunity cost is too high for any youngsters to join NS and the By Law Choice is so underpaid.

Follows by, Countries like korea and Taiwan, who faces more immediate danger compare to singapore , onli have 0.5-1 yr NS training, we are not Israel (SG Army is built upon Israeli's fundamentals)!We are a peaceful little island."<br><br>Peaceful my ass.  Not being in a state of war, doesn't mean we are at peace and happy with everyone and everyone is happy with us.  We do have some regional "friends" who have threatened to cut our water supply, stop supplying food, and even threatened a military stance.  They have refused military flights over their airspace totally and have caused the death of a British Naval Aviator.  To think that we are not the Israel of South East Asia and that we will permanently be friends with others is foolish.  We have a muslim minority nation, look at the 2 largest neighbour surrounding us, they ARE a muslim majority nation.  We are currently on somewhat friendly terms with them, but things might change.  Leaders have been overthrown and who knows what the next leader would do?  They do possess formidable armed forces and can launch an attack on Singapore.  However, I can say that Singapore will not fall simply because we have NS and more than enough people to defend the country.  You may ask, 350,000 people to defend 648 sq kilometers of land... isn't that a waste of manpower?  My friend, in war, one cannot always defend.  One must continuously attack and defend.  Carry the war to the enemy, and make their blood spill on their own soil.  Make them bleed for their aggression, it lowers their morale and will to fight.<br><br>"Keeping talents in camp , hoping to get them to sign on wif the army, DREAM ON !

Sentosa does not even have its own population, how the hell does it declare independence?  Why do people need such high pay while serving NS for?  You are technically in school, learning military skills, physical training, food is provided, shelter is provided. YOu only go out on weekends, are u saying that find that an allowance of $50 for 1 day too little?  And honestly, I don't think that having O'levels means you are talented.  Truthfully, being a civillian myself, I feel that YOU are the disgrace to the whole SAF.<br><br>People who have read his words.  His words are that of a self-defeating fool who thinks that we cannot win a war.  I beg to differ, Singapore already has capabilities to project its military power BEYOND the region.  Singapore being a small island nation, with its infrastructure so packed, does not have the luxury of defending.  There is hardly and defensively feasible terrain for modern warfare, and thus we must have the ability to take the war to the enemy.  Make them have to fight through their own soil in order to get to ours.<br><br></div>
