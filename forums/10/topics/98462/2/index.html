            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, Qitai, I will do this on a personal favour. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The MNC will do this to reduce taxes. For example, MNC will always choose a place with very low tax to be its base of revenue collections. It will open up an operation in Singapore which may have higher taxes. Thus, to avoid being taxed too high in Singapore, through internal pricing, it will say the MNC's base provides certain raw material or services and charge this into the operation in Singapore. Now, it would become a cost factor to the Singapore's operations, which is not necessary so if it purchase the raw material DIRECTLY from the suppliers. But due to the "centralize" policy, it has to buy from the MNC's base, giving it a profit determined solely by the MNC alone! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thus through such schemes, MNCs literally "transferred" earnings out of the Singapore's operations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In HDB's case, the govt could well give HDB the one time off endowment fund to start off, lending to HDB flat buyers, earning interests from them, then use these earnings to really subsidize the flats it sold. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> But no, this will not do because it will not show that HDB is "losing money" in giving subsidies to Singaporeans! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I suspect the "Capital Expenditure" on Land is the "premium" HDB is asked to pay govt for use of land that HDB itself might have acquired throught he Land Acquisition Act. This premium is the result of the "price difference" between acquired price and market price. HDB is deemed merely as "proxy holder" of these land on behalf of the Govt. When it uses them, it has to pay the Govt. This is why it must use "MARKET SUBSIDY" concept to sell the idea that HDB is in deficits because it is giving "subsidies"! And to illustrate this point, the "subsidies" are shown as "govt grants" to HDB! But they didn't tell the whole story; HDB may be "losing money" but the Govt is not! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> In fact, wouldn't one be curious about HDB's claim that it has so much reserves accumulated from the past even when it is "losing money" in providing the "market subsidies"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>This is like saying the MNC's Singapore operations are losing money but the MNC with its base, are not losing money from Singapore's operations by means of these internal pricing! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qitai:</div><div class="quote_body">Additionally, I am disappointed with this response since you clearly stated that they had some "creative" accounting.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear sgdiehard,<br><br>It is quite normal for people to grill us on various issues. I think it is a good practice, both for Singapore's development as well as alternative parties. This is due to the fact that Singaporeans have been subjected to various social engineered opinions on "Opposition" on the whole that they are trouble makers, useless, not contributing to Nation building etc. It is only due prudence for people to check for themselves what we really are and stand for. If they are not doing it but simply take what the proporgandas as "truth", then we will not have the chance to fight back to clarify such distorted views!<br><br>Thus, I think it is good opportunity and sparring sessions for us to engage in this grilling. It sharpens our minds, provides an opportunity for us to demonstrate the right perspective of Workers' Party.<br><br>Of course, for PAP, as an incumbant, they have their vast advantage over us. It seems that the mass media has done a good job to show the BEST side of PAP and thus, nobody ever doubt the "abilities" or "substance" of PAP members or even MPs. This, in turn, result political complacency on PAP's as well as voters' part.<br><br>I think in the long run, it is good for us, bad for PAP. It makes us more "all rounded", formulate our views on various issues as we are expected to be "proficient". Most of the views I have put up here are really NOTHING NEW to me, though they are my original thoughts and views. I have long formed opinions and views on various issues based on my learning and training in economics, most importantly, common sense. It is just a matter of reorganizing these views back and draw it out of memories. But it could be quite taxing at times, because I need to consider my target audience' level of understanding.<br><br>Thus, you can see that I have so far, never run away from questions posed to me, as a form of grilling. I welcome them, in fact.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Do we need to grill each opposition member on all issues before we accept them?

Surely you are famous in YPAP forum for being the least 'objective'. I have talked to so many PAP members and supporters before. Your comments make you the most partisan I have seen. Objective? You can be compare to QXP of Sammyboymod forum who is madly pro-opposition.<br><br>And the way you talk, you give people the impression you are a gentleman. Maybe you are one. But you can be described as a 'si wen bai lei'.<br><br>Lastly, stop your lies on knowing Yaw as your 'good friend'. AFAIK he doesn't remember knowing anyone like you. If you want  to prove what you are saying is not lies and if you got the guts, show your face at WP openhouse on Mondays.<br><br>EmptyCage</div>

He brought in defamation in such survey-like topic. Which is rather politically funny to WP's Gomez who publise his thoughts on Self-Censorship (of audience to media), suggesting fear (eg) as a reason. I was 'hehehe' at his notion. Of course, common sensically, I don't have to lie in such open-ended survey-like topic. It's a fact that I am not here to condemn. How am I suppose to comment otherwise on Goh? I almost hoping Goh to go on further. But that'd certainly having the entire WP embarassed if such talks of defamation initiated by a legal-clueless goes on.<br><br>Besides, whether Goh is good as MP or not, is beneificial or cost to a government under representative election system.

So don't jump guns.<br><br>Besides, indeed, to win election is to win hearts and minds of the people. But that's only as superficial as saying to cook well, you need tomato and sugar.<br><br>A true blue political figure is someone who <strong>can</strong> provide the ultimate correct path to govern; and lead by having faith longing for prosperity. Popularism, especially because of a common enemy, never last long. Even if you manage to topple PAP. Would popularism or even fanatism ensure political stability? I clearly doubt so.<br><br>Equally, you can call me a clown, but that doesn't mean anything in real. MM had been called many things under the sun. But he's still there. Many people condemn MM for even election cheat suspicions. But no one dare to contest him in general, not to say win.<br><br>A leader who focus on such support won't necessarily last. Many who find Dr Chee popular, now find Mr Chiam more attractive. Such fickle-mindedness means only a random regime, not to even say a confirmed political stability.<br><br>Before Goh really understands, and is prepared, my view on him remains.<br><br>I must repeat again. I have little intention even to dissuade opposition candidate to go on field. Currently, only Mr Chiam remains as a more worthy opposition figure of notice. It's a pity the SPP chief has not been lucky to get political talents to assist him. Anyway, if Mr Chiam plays well, he'd get to keep his constituency again.<br><br>I don't know for the MM, SM or PM and others... But I see it more beneficial to have Mr Low and Mr Chiam around in Hougang and Potong Pasir than to just eject them. Hence my best wishes for Mr Low and Mr Chiam on the coming election.<br><br>Mr Chia, I don't speak on behalf of any party. Just sharing my personal views.

In a state with such <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perceived</span> status of freedom of speech, cyberspace conveniently (common sens-ically) becomes a warm bed for opposition participation.<br><br>Rest assure, your suspicion is overblown. I don't speak for any party, usually. I don't have what agenda. And I don't take it well with anyone with too heavy a stint of party politics. Which is, in addition to Goh's previous attempts on myself, why I single out Goh.<br><br>In order not to further embarass Gomez, I have quickly pointed out to Goh, and Ti Lik, certain issues of pursuing along such line of their <span style="font-style: italic;">discussions</span> so that WP won't get stuck in their overzealous attempts.<br><br>Many people like to see and hear what they like. Which is why I rather discuss things than jumping on too much guns.<br><br>Anyway, in reality, party warfares would sort of be a norm, but there must be a certain limits maintained by someone strong enough to maintain. There is no need to just bash irrationally on anything PAP. Respect is mutual.<br><br>I am certain that many mature politicians in PAP do respect worthy opposition leaders and, in fact, members for their merits. Likewise, there are PAP leaders and members that perhaps would be respected by the opposition leaders and members. If Goh and Ti Lik would like to discuss matters, I am sure it would invite sincere comments from Singaporeans of all walk, party aside. As it concerns all Singaporeans, PAP or opposition.<br><br>For the good of our local political future, and for the good of the people as a whole, my best regards to all the stars in the future at both sides of the camps. Hopefully, we all do remember we are all Singaporeans.<br><br>On Goh MS. Don't worry about my comments on Goh. I have no agenda on crushing him or what. I am basically a very simple and easy-going element in this mess of party warfare... so can't possibly have any important agenda behind. So rest assure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So all of you are concern about Singapore and the people... Do prove that to all of us, and work hard for the people. I trust that everyone here will contribute their fairshare alongside the incumbent's leadership. A common properous future should be everyone's objective, hence.<br><br>So I look forward the time for all parties to hold hands and walk together. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I really must return to YPforum now. And send my regards to Yaw.<br><br>Best regards. And happy New Year too.<br><br>Elfred.</div>
