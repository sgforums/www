            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Elfred,<br><br>Honestly, I have tried hard to look from a perspective outside knowing Meng Seng and being in the WP, I remain to see him more as an issue-person than a personal-person <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Perhaps the reason is because he has singled you out too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, I don't profess to have read every single posting of anyone, so I am unsure of what is the prologue to all these and shall not judge.<br><br>I, too, hope that it is Singapore and not ruling party that matters, though I have reservations that a sizeable number of people within the PAP think this way.<br><br>Is politics up worth for a bloody battle? Catch the movie "Taegukgi" and I think for many, the answer is in there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Elfred:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear SGLoyalist,<br><br>I am aware of oppositions' movement in the cyberspace. In a state with such <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perceived</span> status of freedom of speech, cyberspace conveniently (common sens-ically) becomes a warm bed for opposition participation.<br><br>Rest assure, your suspicion is overblown. I don't speak for any party, usually. I don't have what agenda. And I don't take it well with anyone with too heavy a stint of party politics. Which is, in addition to Goh's previous attempts on myself, why I single out Goh.<br><br>In order not to further embarass Gomez, I have quickly pointed out to Goh, and Ti Lik, certain issues of pursuing along such line of their <span style="font-style: italic;">discussions</span> so that WP won't get stuck in their overzealous attempts.<br><br>Many people like to see and hear what they like. Which is why I rather discuss things than jumping on too much guns.<br><br>Anyway, in reality, party warfares would sort of be a norm, but there must be a certain limits maintained by someone strong enough to maintain. There is no need to just bash irrationally on anything PAP. Respect is mutual.<br><br>I am certain that many mature politicians in PAP do respect worthy opposition leaders and, in fact, members for their merits. Likewise, there are PAP leaders and members that perhaps would be respected by the opposition leaders and members. If Goh and Ti Lik would like to discuss matters, I am sure it would invite sincere comments from Singaporeans of all walk, party aside. As it concerns all Singaporeans, PAP or opposition.<br><br>For the good of our local political future, and for the good of the people as a whole, my best regards to all the stars in the future at both sides of the camps. Hopefully, we all do remember we are all Singaporeans.<br><br>On Goh MS. Don't worry about my comments on Goh. I have no agenda on crushing him or what. I am basically a very simple and easy-going element in this mess of party warfare... so can't possibly have any important agenda behind. So rest assure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So all of you are concern about Singapore and the people... Do prove that to all of us, and work hard for the people. I trust that everyone here will contribute their fairshare alongside the incumbent's leadership. A common properous future should be everyone's objective, hence.<br><br>So I look forward the time for all parties to hold hands and walk together. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I really must return to YPforum now. And send my regards to Yaw.<br><br>Best regards. And happy New Year too.<br><br>Elfred.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Elfred,<br><br>First of all, you must learn the law on defamation.

Well, put it this way, if that'd be the case, you'd probably be the first to be sued for a (twisted) comment on myself in YP forum (eg). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Let's not talk about defamation.<br><br>You seem to equate me with PAP...???

I don't see any motive of myself even linked to anything but a account of my personal views to be shared by the topic.<br><br>You wanna sue on such personal opinions presented?<br><br>Look at the way you reply? Simply jump to an assertion you would be able to sue me to bankruptcy for the private opinion that you ain't appropriate for clean politics. Is this the cut of a leader who jump guns? What about your assertions on HDB and GST directed at the party's ministries and hence ministers? How many times do you think you wanna be sued on your opinion on the incumbent as well?<br><br>Grow up, Goh. You ain't really appropriate. And please, this is a citizen's personal view. Or you suppose I can't even have such right to express a simple view or I must lie, to which not of my sincere view? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Or you wanna call the ISD to silent me?<br><br>Please lah.<br><br>By the way, to inform EC and you, my pressence here is due to the boring day when YPforum was closed for the day.<br><br>I am shifting back to that forum, anyway.
