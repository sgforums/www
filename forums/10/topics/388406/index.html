              <p><span class="time">January 18, 2010</span></p>
              <p>I am a resident in Dover Road for over 30 years and am recently affected by the Enbloc/SERS upgrading and have to shift about 500m from my existing home to the new ones at Blocks 28A to D at Dover Crescent.</p>
              <p>I do not have any outstanding summons with the HDB nor do I own a vehicle. I love my home and the residents in the small area of Dover are a very closely knitted bunch.</p>
              <p>The HDB has inconvenienced and endangered residents, handicapped and pedestrians as well as other road users by using the Handicap Lots at Block 28C to dump sand and debris. This prevents the handicapped residents and members of the public from using the handicap lot. Residents in the process of moving and unloading do not have a proper space to park their vehicles to unload.</p>
              <p>The Loading and unloading Bay at Block 28C is fully blocked and taken up by the HDB contractor’s Debris Container.</p>
              <p>Next, the service road for Emergency vehicles between Block 28A and 28B is partially blocked and used by HDB contractors to dump debris and waste as well. The rubbish bin centre right beside the present debris dump site is utilized. This is unsafe as it is right beside the NTUC supermarket and the Food Court. Besides posing as a potential danger to residents and pedestrians, it also prevents emergency vehicles from reaching the inner blocks should there be a need to.</p>
              <p>This has been going on for weeks. I have sent 3 emails to hdbcarparks, made 4 calls to the HDB Parking enforcement unit as well as 2 calls to the Clementi Branch Office yet no one bothered to reply me and the blockages continue to exist. I left my name, NRIC and phone number with every call.</p>
              <p>All this while, I have witnessed so many parking attendants in the area issuing summons to residents who parked their vehicles along the same service road to do their unloading. It’s obvious that with the HDB contractors utilizing the unloading bays for their own purposes, other residents have no choice but to park as close to the unloading bay as possible to do their unloading. Sadly, this also means an immediate offence and summon issued. No grace limit is expected if one parks illegally along the service road.</p>
              <p>I do not even want to start with the allowance of HDB contractors’ vehicles allowed to park overnight in the service Roads. Too much to say all at once.</p>
              <p>HDB has also made their official stance that all vehicles parked along the service road for emergency vehicles will be summoned immediately as it prevents emergency vehicles from entering if needed. Handicapped Lots are even used to hold sand. What kind of message is HDB sending to the residents?</p>
              <p>HDB is acting in an arrogant and high handed manner as they have totally ignored all my calls and emails without reverting back to me and continue to commit offences and break the very laws they enacted while causing inconvenience to the residents and at the same time continue to book other residents and motorist in the vicinity for committing the same offence as the HDB themselves.</p>
              <p>Who am I to refer the matter to if the HDB themselves break the laws the enacted and totally ignore my requests for them to behave responsibly and to rectify the situation?</p>
              <p>I asked a parking attendant why they do not issue a summons to the HDB contractors using the handicapped lots as well as they loading and unloading bays for their own storage and my reply was that they are not empowered to book them.</p>
              <p>As this is written, the booking of other vehicles continue while the HDB contractors carry on doing as they like. It is absurd and unreasonable to continue to book other residents for offences that the HDB themselves are guilty of committing. This reeks of discrimination and double standards. Who is going to fine the HDB?</p>
