              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you know that the hands behind the recent riots in Tibet are essentially the same as those who were involved in toppling legitimate government else where in the Eurasian heartland. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ever heard of the National Endowment for Democracy? An NGO funded by the US government, set up by the Reagan Administration in the 80s to do the job of the CIA. This organization was responsible for many covert actions against local governments from Serbia to Georgia and the Ukraine. It is said to support 5 major Tibetan exile groups.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ever heard of the Albert Einstein Institution? funded by George Soros and the US government, which provided advanced training and advice to 5 leading Tibetan NGOs in Feb this year prior to the riots.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ever heard of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation? a German think tank to the Free Democratic Party, which has actively been involved in the Tibetan independence movement. This group is “credited” with giving the impetus to the current anti-Chinese Tibet campaign that violently forced the interruption of the Olympic torch relay in Paris. They also helped organized the 5<sup>th</sup> International Tibet Support Groups Conference in Brussels, which called for global protests to disrupt 2008 Olympics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Finally, the 5 exile groups issues a statement to use this historic movement to bring Tibetan freedeom movement back to Tibet, and another uprising to end China’s sovereignty over Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you not know to the truth, or you chose to believe in only what the western says? Is your problem that of ignorance or integrity?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You chose to cut and paste your chosen section of an article taken from the online encyclopedia, when the article is clearly marked “The neutrality of this article is disputed”! and you also blatantly refused to acknowledge the challenge if you believe in the truth of what was published. Your information that lack integrity reflects very much on your personality. No?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Truth cannot be denied, and cannot be argued. These are your words, but your ignorance and the lack of integrity make a mockery of what is truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Innocent people in China had died as a result of the riots and unrest, as a result of the groups that allowed themselves to be played by foreign political power. The blood of those innocents does stain the hands of those who had one way or another advocated such mindless violence against innocent people. You got to cheek to talk about morality?”<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="bdl1"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hong Kong (UPI) Mar 21, 2008 </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; "><br></span><span class="btx1"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Elite ground force units of the People's Liberation Army were involved in China's recent crackdown on Tibetan protesters in Lhasa. A substantial number of images show that the new T-90 armored personnel carrier and T-92 wheeled armored vehicles belonging to the elite ground forces appeared on the streets of Lhasa the same day the crackdown began. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="btx1"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">China has denied the participation of the army in the crackdown, saying it was carried out by units of the armed police. Such equipment as mentioned above has never been deployed by China's armed police, however. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">To cover up the involvement of regular armed forces in the crackdown, all of the armored vehicles covered the traditional red star of the PLA Army with white cloth. The red stars painted on the steel helmets of the troops were also erased.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Only a very small number of the PLA's group armies are armed with T-90 APCs, while the T-92s are used by its rapid reaction force units. The T-92s deployed in Lhasa are equipped with 25-mm guns. The export variant of this vehicle is called the WMZ-551A. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The variant of this armored vehicle that China has exported to Sudan is equipped with a 30-mm 2A72 artillery gun, manufactured under a technology-transfer agreement with Russia. In addition, a large number of "Dong Feng" trucks, the mainstay transport vehicles of the Chinese and Burmese armed forces, also made their appearance on the streets of Lhasa. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Judging from the military equipment that arrived so quickly in Lhasa, the 149th Rapid Reaction Division of the No. 13 Group Army under Chengdu Military Region and the No. 52 Mountain Infantry Brigade under the Xizang Military Region may have been involved in the crackdown operations. These are the crack combat units with the most outstanding rapid reaction capability in China's southwest region. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The No. 52 Mountain Infantry Brigade was the first combat unit in the Tibet region to receive T-92 wheeled armored vehicles. In operational exercises held on the Tibetan plateau around 2001, this brigade was first seen armed with the T-92. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The fact that the trump rapid-reaction combat units of Chengdu Military Region entered Lhasa at such a fast pace deserves high attention, as does the fact that the troops entered Lhasa with such heavy equipment. This author's analysis is that the newly built Tibet railroad has given China the capability to transport troops very rapidly. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In recent years, in order to reinforce the combat capability of the PLA forces directly facing India, troops in the Chengdu, Xizang Tibet and Xinjiang Military Regions have been given priority attention. The other mountain infantry brigade under the Xizang Military Region, No. 53 Mountain Infantry Brigade, has also basically completed the process of having its equipment replaced. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The No. 13 Group Army under the Chengdu Military Region has also greatly reinforced the buildup of its army aviation units, which are now equipped with S70 and Mi17-V7 helicopters capable of flying over the Tibetan plateau. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other combat units of the PLA specializing in plateau and mountain operations include the Lanzhou and Xinjiang Military Regions. The 61st Rapid Reaction Division of the No. 21 Group Army under the Lanzhou Military Region and the No. 6 Mechanized Infantry Division and No. 4 Motorized Infantry Division under the Xinjiang Military Region both have substantial experiences in plateau and mountain operational exercises. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Due to the increased presence of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, the above combat units of the PLA Army are being armed with new equipment at the fastest pace. Meanwhile, they are also the mainstay forces to guard against independence activities in the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang Autonomous Region of northwest China. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, the world is divided between the rich and poor, and the gap is getting wider everyday.

Has the Tibetans in exile sent money back to improve the life of their people in Tibet, like the overseas Chinese did in the 80s?</span></p>

              <p>There are even Singaporean who want to leave their homeland in search of what they think is a greener pasture. They made their choice.</p>
              <p>2.5 million Tibetans are living in their homeland now, increased from 1.2 million in 1964. Have their unique culture been changed in anyway? NO. Before the riots thousands of people visited Lhasa and surrounding areas, attracted by its unique culture and have witnessed the original tibetan culture.</p>
              <p>So far no starbuck nor coffeebean nor macdonald is seen there. I hope it will be kept that way.</p>
              <p>I guess some of the tibetans in exile will not be allowed home, until they denounced their link with foreign interest groups that have ulterior political motive. Many of them are probably second generation in exile. Hope they have been able to build their own temple in the free countries they are residing now.</p>

              <p>2 - <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">maintaining their culture - if you are a singaporean, no one would stop you from maintaining your culture by living in a banana leaf house without any electricity, water, clean food or medial help. Same thing could be said of tibetians. China merely offer tibetians a better standard of living if they choose to accept it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3 - Why must China invade it? - this statement can only be describe with one word, IGNORANT. That statement is the same as me asking "Why must USA invade New York?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4 - Why must they change their livelihood when they are happy with what they are - Life is full of changes. Most people want changes for the better. How do you know tibetians do not want changes for the better? Are they sadists? choosing suffering over comfort? are you saying that tibetiens are only happy when they are suffering and treated like slaves? (it is a historical fact that the tibetian ruling class treat the rest of the tibetiens like slaves)</span></p>
              <p>5 - <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Tibetians do not need modern technology, they merely want to maintain their unique culture. - Are you a tibetian? How do you know what they want? If you really believe that, go live in your banana leaf house without any electricity, water, clean food or medial help. Get your facts right first, the protestors are french, spanish, americans and so called tibetians who choose not to be in tibet for large number of years.
