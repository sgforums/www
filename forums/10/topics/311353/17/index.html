              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Please read the news have your hear news about the protest from London, Paris, SFO. Did you see any government came out and supported any of these protest? The answer is NO. Chinese official had already warned every gov and states not to protest or set any legislature motion to boycot the Olypmic. Even California Gov came out against politising the Game. Consequences of such protest will be met with impunity from China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Until you wake up and smell the air.  You seriously think this is another Western Propagandists!!!  The Protest are all by the people, civilians practice their Rights. A concept is hard to practice in SG. but that doesn't mean it is not practice around the globe.  </p>

Reportedly the situation is tense and the monastery put under tight control by the Chinese authorities. <br><br>Since the first week of October 2005, “work team” officials have been conducting the “patriotic education” campaign in the monastery. During the Campaign, on 23 November 2005, the monks were ordered to sign a document denouncing the Dalai Lama as a “separatist” and to pledge their loyalty to the Chinese government by accepting “Tibet as a part of China”. The monks showed their disagreement to the official directive and refused to sign the document. Among the monks, five showed strong reactions against the document and the officials. They were immediately expelled from the monastery and handed over to the Public Security Bureau (PSB) Detention Centres in their respective places of origin</span></p>

              <p>Hi...</p>
              <p>Firstly I dont totally blame the Western civillians holding placards and even waving Tibetan flags. I dont totally blame them. It is very human isnt it..?</p>
              <p>They are also victims themselves. They dont know much but they have a certain belief or a picture in their mind, created by their media, the same media which conned them into supporting Iraq war afew years ago. It is not really their fault.</p>
              <p>Maybe for me, I imagine, if I read CNN, watch American news, I will form a picture in my mind too.  An example, now I have a picture in my mind that Zimbabwe is bad and Rubert Mugabe is bad, why, because I read CNN and they say about him cheating elections and that his party and his war veterans there took over white-owned farms. </p>
              <p>So now in my mind I form a bad impression about Zimbabwe, without me really knowing the history of Zimbabwe, what is its racial relations, and what is the whole deal the land-reform is about. I have no idea about all these things, never talk to a Zimbabwean, never been to Zimbabwe, dont know anything. So what do u expect..?</p>
              <p>Similarly those Western people, I even saw a young white woman painting her face in Tibetan flag pattern. I really wonder if she really knows what she is involving herself in.</p>
              <p>But again, I dont totally blame her, I mean what do u expect..? Media is very powerful, people with some knowledge and familiarity can notice a few things, such as us in Asia, but what do u think someone like her in her place will think and behave...?</p>
              <p>And if we make another important note, I think it's important not to assume all Tibetans want independence. Why I say so.....if we look at those Tibetan protestors on TV, they are the group of people who are Exile Tibetans. Actually they dont represent Tibetans. They are overseas Tibetans, living in foreign countries, and many are decendants of political Tibetans or fighters who fought and lost in the 1950s war funded by CIA. They are political opponents of China.</p>
              <p>A similar example is Exile Cubans. In foreign country, in Miami now there are alot of Exile Cubans and they are decendants of political groups who opposed and fought Castro and helped by CIA in the past. Now they are still noisy and political, but do u think those Exile Cubans living in Miami represent the average Cuban people inside Cuba..?</p>
              <p>Those Exile Cubans hate Castro and want to overthrow him, but in Cuba itself, how come Castro can make speeches attended by so many people..?  So do they represent the average Cuban in Cuba..?</p>
              <p>And those overseas Exile Tibetans....what do u think..? Do u really think they represent the average Tibetan in Tibet..? I think quite afew of them are actually born in those Western countries, and never even set foot in Tibet, or China. They are in their own orbit and still living in a time warp, while in Tibet, things are changing and the society is moving.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, not only people from other provinces live in Tibet (and Dalai
              Lama making a rather racist statement of 'cultural genocide' and
              'demographic aggresion', make ur own judgement) , but also many Tibetans live in other provinces too.</p>
              <p><br>One or two more generations, and these political  Exile Tibetans will just naturally vanish, their cause will be irrelevant and obsolete.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In order to achieve both internal and external progresses appropriate for modern times, having modern education is extremely important.

Seventy or eighty such students could study <strong>Tibetan language as their main subject and achieve excellence in </strong></span><strong>projecting one's national identity and in preserving our cultural heritage</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">. Twenty or thirty such students could study Chinese language as their main subject and make efforts to achieve professional qualifications in modern specialised subjects.

              <p>The turtle soup topic pop up because some chinese in this forum
              think that the WEST continue to be bias against china. And that
              Eating up the entire species is bias against china and china
              bashing. But of course why do you care to eat up another country

              <p>Well Loo at the  Olypmic torch it got extinct 3 times in

              demonstration of displeasure of the people. A concept that you

              <p>You have absolutely mis-represented my original argument. My argument was not that it is  wrong for the West to criticize the eating habits of other races (although that in itself could be argued against ).</p>
              <p>My argument is that in the article from Reuters I cited, the author fails to provide any justification for the claim that China is reponsible for the decline of Texas' turtle population and yet it did prevent the author of that article from putting the sole blame on China. What would the intention be?</p>
              <p>Remember the external truth of the claim itself is immaterial in this case. If the author believed that her claim is true, she should have provided justification and substantiation. Then her criticism on China would be a fair one. The fact that she did not provide any substantiation for her claim  means that she herself is uncertain with respect to the truth value of the claim. But that did not prevent her from asserting precisely this claim and censuring China based on it. What are the intentions, if other than slandering and black-washing China, I ask? </p>
              <p>You cited another article which explicitly lists the statistics of turtles being exported to Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. That is immaterial, if you followed the logic of my argument. The truth remains that the author of the Reuters article was not able to produce or cite such statistics. Therefore, her allegations were not in good faith. I hope you are cognizant enough to follow the logic.</p>
              <p>If somebody is making accusations against you without providing any evidence, what would that be called? Think about it. </p>
              <p>The link to that article is provided here once again if someone is interested: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1021710120070722">http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1021710120070722</a></p>
              <p>My point therefore is not about Western criticism per se. For instance, if they say that the Chinese government is suppressing freedom of speech, I would wholly agree because it is true.</p>
              <p>It is about them lodging allegations against  China often with no substantive evidence (as illustrated by the two examples I cited in my original post). In the height of this, some of them were quick to craft evidence to blackwash China as shown in the numerous Tibetan reports where Nepalese and Indian police brutality scenes were used in reports that censure China for cracking down on "peaceful protests". One of the numerous examples is provided below, which after almost one month, is still shamelessly existing on the Times online website with all the atrocious factual errors:</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">On the issue of independence, he reiterated that what he is seeking is meaningful autonomy for the Tibetan people.<br><br>See the official website of the Dalai Lama.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>One thing that comes to my mind is this: Suppose there are a hundred Tibetan students.

The reality of the situation in Singapore then was such that one had no choice but to rely on English language if one is to become modern educated. So we had a whole generation of Singaporean Chinese who can’t speak Chinese, don’t know their cultural heritage. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Then the government started streaming, so that the “twenty or thirty students could study to achieve professional qualifications in modern specialized subjects”, these are now called “Elite”. But the “Seventy or eighty such students” also want to be modern, who wants to preserve national identity and preserve cultural heritage. So the English speaking Singaporean Chinese thought they all can be “</span><span style="font-family: å®‹ä½“;  " lang="ZH-CN">ç²¾è‹±</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">” , but then the world changed with China coming up, so everybody learn Chinese and the “</span><span style="font-family: å®‹ä½“;  " lang="ZH-CN">ç²¾å�Ž</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">” evolve, so the ““</span><span style="font-family: å®‹ä½“;  " lang="ZH-CN">ç²¾è‹±</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">” run to Australia, and from there they shout for “FREE SINGAPORE”.</span></p>

              <p>Let me briefly sum up what happened in the past few weeks:</p>
              <p>A group of Tibetans , for whatever reason decided to go to the street with long knives and bricks and attacked and killed anybody that looked Chinese. In addition, they set fires on shops and looted banks and stores. They also burned some civilian han Chinese alive.</p>
              <p>The Chinese anti-riot police intervened albeit with great constraint.</p>
              <p>The Western media all report in one voice: Chinese troops are cracking down on peaceful Tibetan demonstrators. They had to use pictures from India and Nepal for effect.</p>
              <p>World-wide anti-China sentiments are incited and the voice for boycotting Olympics is growing all the more shrill.</p>
              <p>Chinese nationals pointed out the factual errors of Western media reports. They are summarily told that they have been brainwashed by the Chinese government, (although CNN actually bothered to issue a statement in its defense, which by the way we provided a robust rebuttal to). Chinese nationals are also told that the Chinese media is rotten and logically they have no right to criticize Western media which of course is fair and all-rounded with no agenda behind it. </p>

              <p>That is precisely the point. To think that the Americans and Germans and Frenchman genuinely care about the welfare of Tibetans and Tibetan culture is to me rather laughable. </p>

              <p>That is absolutely true. A world in which the West (USA especially)  is allowed to throw its weight around without any constraint is a very very dangerous place, as we have seen in Iraq and the middle east at large. </p>

              <p>Well, pragmatism is the principle on which Singapore survives. </p>
