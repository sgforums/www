              <p><strong>I agree with you. Protection of cultural values and identity is important.</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever thought what is the nature of Singapore? A brokerage land/ a trading post/ Emporium.  A Singular culture identity for Singapore or a multi ethnic culture for Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>singapore education system has always reflect how singapore survived thru times. It adapted and changed over time depended upon state of influence. Yesterday English, Today Mandarin. Tomorrow - Hindi.  Day after tomorrow .......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Preservation of culture fall into social and home custom, as such personally I am not sure what you are trying to preserve given the influence of China in the region. Assertion of Chinese culture will be in SG. But excessive will result in displeasure of other races in SG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have always believe that You have to be born a Human Being first before you can be associated with any Race, Culture, or Religion.  I thought your Taoist would favor a more balance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the only way education system in Singapore can do is to reflect A balance of culture uderstanding with a global perspective of tolerance.  You are not going to see Singaporean sit in Singapore and not going to be living or working abroad.</p>

              <p>..<em>.each civilization is born in some inexplicable fashion and, after
                      a slow start, enters a period of vigorous expansion, increasing its
                      size and power, both internally and at the expense of its neighbors,
                      until gradually a crisis of organization appears.</em></p>
              <p><em>When this crisis has
                      passed and the <strong>civilization has been reorganized, it seems somewhat
                      different. Its vigor and morale have weakened. It becomes stabilized
                      and eventually stagnant.</strong></em> After a Golden Age of peace and prosperity,
                      internal crises again arise.</p>
              <p><em>At this point there appears, for the first
                      time, a <strong>moral and physical weakness which raises,</strong></em> also for the first
                      time, questions about the civilization's ability to defend itself
                      against external enemies.</p>
              <p><em>Racked <strong>by internal struggles of a social and
                      constitutional character, weakened by loss of faith in its older
                      ideologies and by the challenge of newer ideas incompatible with its
                      past nature, the civilization grows steadily weaker until it is
                      submerged by outside enemies, and eventually disappears.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>...The Age of Expansion is generally marked by four kinds of
                      expansion:</em></p>
              <p><em>(1) of population,</em></p>
              <p><em>(2) of geographic area,</em></p>
              <p><em>(3) of
                      production, and</em></p>
              <p><em>(4) of knowledge.</em></p>
              <p><em>The expansion of production and the
                      expansion of knowledge give rise to the expansion of population, and
                      the three of these together give rise to the expansion of geographic
                      extent...</em></p>
              <p><em>...Eventually, in most civilizations the rate of expansion begins to decline everywhere.</em></p>
              <p><em>it is this decline in the rate of expansion of a civilization which
                      marks its passage from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict.
                      This latter is the most complex, most interesting, and most critical of
                      all the periods of the life cycle of a civilization. It is marked by
                      four chief characteristics:</em></p>
              <p><em>(a) it is a period of declining rate of
                      expansion;</em></p>
              <p><em>(b) it is a period of growing tensions and class conflicts;</em></p>
              <p><em>(c) it is a period of increasingly frequent and increasingly violent
                      imperialist wars; and</em></p>
              <p><em>(d) it is a period of growing irrationality,
                      pessimism, superstitions, and otherworldliness.</em></p>
              <p><em>All these phenomena
                      appear in the core area of a civilization before they appear in more
                      peripheral portions of the society...</em></p>
              <p><em>...The decreasing rate of expansion of the Age of Conflict gives rise
                      to the other characteristics of the age, in part at least.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>After the
                      long years of the Age of Expansion, people's minds and their social
                      organizations are adjusted to expansion, and it is a very difficult
                      thing to readjust these to a decreasing rate of expansion.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Social
                      classes and political units within the civilization try to compensate
                      for the slowing of expansion through normal growth by the use of
                      violence against other social classes or against other political units...</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em> ...The diffusion of material elements from one
                      society to another has a complex effect on the importing society.<strong> In
                      the short run it is usually benefitted by the importation, but in the
                      long run it is frequently disorganized and weakened.</strong> When white men
                      first came to North America, material elements from Western
                      Civilization spread rapidly among the different Indian tribes. The
                      Plains Indians, for example, were weak and impoverished before 1543,
                      but in that year the horse began to diffuse northward from the
                      Spaniards in Mexico. Within a century the Plains Indians were raised to
                      a much higher standard of living (because of ability to hunt buffalo
                      from horseback) and were immensely strengthened in their ability to
                      resist Americans coming westward across the continent. In the meantime,
                      the trans-Appalachian Indians who had been very powerful in the
                      sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries began to receive firearms,
                      steel traps, measles, and eventually whiskey from the French and later
                      the English by way of the St. Lawrence. These greatly weakened the
                      woods Indians of the trans-Appalachian area and ultimately weakened the
                      Plains Indians of the trans-Mississippi area, because measles and
                      whiskey were devastating and demoralizing and because the use of traps
                      and guns by certain tribes made them dependent on whites for supplies
                      at the same time that they allowed them to put great physical pressure
                      on the more remote tribes which had not yet received guns or traps. <strong>Any
                      united front of reds against whites was impossible, and the Indians
                      were disrupted, demoralized, and destroyed.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>In general, importation of
                      an element of material culture from one society to another is helpful
                      to the importing society in the long run only if it is</em></p>
              <p><em>(</em><em>a) productive,</em></p>
              <p><em>(</em><em>b) can be made within the society itself, and</em></p>
              <p><em>(</em><em>c)
                      can be fitted into the <strong>nonmaterial culture of the importing society
                      without demoralizing it.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong> The destructive impact of Western Civilization
                      upon so many other societies rests on its ability to demoralize their
                      ideological and spiritual culture</strong> as much as its ability to destroy
                      them in a material sense with firearms.</em></p>
              <p><em> When one society is destroyed by the impact of
                      another society, the people are left in a debris of cultural elements
                      derived from their own shattered culture as well as from the invading
                      culture. These elements generally provide the instruments for
                      fulfilling the material needs of these people, <strong>but they cannot be

              <p><em>The destruction of traditional Chinese culture under
              the impact of Western Civilization was considerably later than the
              similar destruction of Indian culture by Europeans. </em></p>
              <p><em>This delay arose
              from the fact that European pressure on India was applied fairly
              steadily from the early sixteenth century, while in the Far East, in
              Japan even more completely than in China, this pressure was relaxed
              from the early seventeenth century for almost two hundred years, to
              1794 in the case of China and to 1854 in the case of Japan. </em></p>
              <p><em>As a
              result, we can see the process by which European culture was able to
              destroy the traditional native cultures of Asia more clearly in China
              than almost anywhere else.</em></p>
              <p><em>The traditional culture of China, as elsewhere in
              Asia, consisted of a military and bureaucratic hierarchy superimposed
              on a great mass of hardworking peasantry...</em></p>
              <p><em>...Until 1841 Canton was the only port allowed for foreign imports,
              and opium was illegal. </em></p>
              <p><em>As a consequence of Chinese destruction of
              illegal Indian opium and the commercial exactions of Cantonese
              authorities, Britain imposed on China the treaties of Nanking (1842)
              and of Tientsin (1858).</em></p>
              <p><em> These forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain
              and to open sixteen ports to foreign trade, to impose a uniform import
              tariff of no more than 5 percent, to pay an indemnity of about $100
              million, to permit foreign legations in Peking, to allow a British
              official to act as head of the Chinese customs service, and to legalize
              the import of opium. </em></p>
              <p><em>Other agreements were imposed by which China lost
              various fringe areas such as Burma (to Britain), Indochina (to France),
              Formosa and the Pescadores (to Japan), and Macao (to Portugal), while
              other areas were taken on leases of various durations, from twenty-five
              to ninety-nine years. </em></p>
              <p><em>In this way Germany took Kiaochow, Russia took
              southern Liaotung (including Port Arthur), France took Kwangcho-wan,
              and Britain took Kowloon and Weihaiwei. </em></p>
              <p><em>In this same period various
              Powers imposed on China a system of extraterritorial courts under which
              foreigners, in judicial cases, could not be tried in Chinese courts or
              under Chinese law...</em></p>
              <p><em>...In Asia generally, the revolution in weapons (meaning muskets and
              later rifles) came before the Agricultural Revolution or the Industrial
              Revolution.</em></p>
              <p><em> Indeed, most firearms were not locally made, but were
              imported and, being imported, came into the possession of the upper
              class of rulers, bureaucrats, and landlords and not into the hands of
              peasants or city masses. </em></p>
              <p><em>As a result, these ruling groups were
              generally able to maintain their position against their own masses even
              when they could not defend themselves against European Powers.</em></p>
              <p><em> As a
              consequence of this, any hope of partial reform or of a successful
              revolution early enough to be a moderate revolution became quite
              unlikely...</em></p>
              <p><em>...In China the people could not get weapons because of their low
              standards of living and the high cost of imported arms. </em></p>
              <p><em>As a result,
              power remained in the hands of the army, except for small groups who
              were financed by emigrant Chinese with relatively high incomes
              overseas. </em></p>
              <p><em>By 1911 the prestige of the imperial regime had fallen so low
              that it obtained support from almost no one, and the army refused to
              sustain it. </em></p>
              <p><em>As a result, the revolutionaries, supported by overseas
              money, were able to overthrow the imperial regime in an almost
              bloodless revolution, but were not able to control the army after they
              had technically come to power...</em></p>

              <p><em>...Most stable and primitive societies, such as the American Indians
                  before 1492 or medieval Europe, have no great population problem
                  because the birthrate is balanced by the death rate. </em></p>
              <p><em>In such societies
                  both of these are high, the population is stable, and the major portion
                  of that population is young (below eighteen years of age).</em></p>
              <p><em> This kind of
                  society (frequently called Population Type A) is what existed in Europe
                  in the medieval period (say about 1400) or even in part of the early
                  modern period (say about 1700). </em></p>
              <p><em>As a result of the increased supply of
                  food in Europe after 1725, and of men's increased ability to save lives
                  because of advances in sanitation and medicine after 1775, the death
                  rate began to fall, the birthrate remained high, the population began
                  to increase, and the number of older persons in the society increased. </em></p>
              <p><em>This gave rise to what we have called the demographic explosion (or
                  Population Type B). </em></p>
              <p><em>As a result of it, the population of Europe
                  (beginning in western Europe) increased in the nineteenth century, and
                  the major portion of that population was in the prime of life (ages
                  eighteen to forty-five), the arms-bearing years for men and the
                  childbearing years for women.</em></p>
              <p><em>At this point the demographic cycle of an expanding population
                  goes into a third stage (Population Type C) in which the birthrate also
                  begins to fall. </em></p>
              <p><em>The reasons for this fall in the birthrate have never
                  been explained in a satisfactory way, but, as a consequence of it,
                  there appears a new demographic condition marked by a falling
                  birthrate, a low death rate, and a stabilizing and aging population
                  whose major part is in the mature years from thirty to sixty.</em></p>
              <p><em> As the
                  population gets older because of the decrease in births and the
                  increase in expectation of life, a larger and larger part of the
                  population has passed the years of hearing children or bearing arms. </em></p>
              <p><em>This causes the birthrate to decline even more rapidly, and eventually
                  gives a population so old that the death rate begins to rise again
                  because of the great increase in deaths from old age or from the
                  casualties of inevitable senility. </em></p>
              <p><em>Accordingly, the society passes into
                  a fourth stage of the demographic cycle (Population Type D). This stage
                  is marked by a declining birthrate, a rising death rate, a decreasing
                  population, and a population in which the major part is over fifty
                  years of age...</em></p>
              <p><em>...   This diffusion of pressure outward from the western European
                  core of Western Civilization can contribute a great deal toward a
                  richer understanding of the period 1850-2000. </em></p>
              <p><em>It helps to explain the
                  Anglo-French rivalry about 1850, the Anglo-French alliance based on
                  fear of Germany after 1900, the free-world alliance based on fear of
                  Soviet Russia after 1950, <strong>and the danger to both Western Civilization</strong> and Soviet Civilization <strong>from Asiatic pressure by 2000.</strong></em></p>

              <p>Check out this article written by a <strong>western researcher</strong> before all this started. Tibetan buddhism is very different from the buddhism that you or I are familiar with. Some rituals are pretty barbaric, like 'tian zhan', meaning cutting up and feeding dead bodies to eagles (or is it vultures?). I also remember seeing a documentary where they had some kind of percussion musical instrument made from a child's scalp. I was only 8 years old then and it made me really sick...</p>

              <p>Tibet is a mountainous region of hard rocks, burial land is scarce, as is arable land for farming. Wood for cremation is also scare.

              <p><em>perharps this is another propaganda. it works both direction. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>"The Olympic Games are not the place for demonstrations."</em> Aren't they? Actually, the Olympics seem an ideal place for demonstrations. Not only are the world's media there with cameras running, but the modern Olympics were set up with a political purpose: to promote international peace by encouraging healthy competition among nations. Hence the emphasis on national teams instead of individual competitors; hence the opening ceremony — since copied by other sporting events — as well as the national flags and national anthems.</p>
              <p>These elements make the Olympics special, different from other international competitions, but they also sometimes give the Games a nasty edge. The old U.S. vs. U.S.S.R. basketball rivalry; the parade of East German women with husky voices; the lists of who has won how many medals — all of that is evidence of the decades-old politicization of the Olympics. There were black-power demonstrations at the 1968 Mexico City Games. A Palestinian group attacked and killed Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Games. Australian aborigines protested at the 2000 Sydney Games. And everything associated with the 2008 Olympics, from the massive Beijing building program, to the Olympic torch that is due to be carried across Tibet, to the Chinese Olympic committee's Web site (which describes China's commitment to "promoting mass sporting activities on an extensive scale, improving the people's physique, and spurring the socialist modernization of China") is blatantly designed to promote the domestic and international image of the Chinese state, too.</p>

              <p>No, but I would not preach to them. The British, and a few zealots, demonised the custom, which was voluntary and optional. It was "their way" and I won't argue with them over it. It is their business.</p>

              <p><br>Sorry I can't agree with you there... I think it is the duty of enlightened people to spread civilisation everywhere.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the widow-burning custom cannot be described as wholly voluntary. There might be a few widows who loved their husbands so much that their wanted to die and join him (errrmm... I wish I will have a wife who loved me that much... but I wouldn't wish her to die with me...), but the vast majority were forced by social pressure to do so. If they do not, they will become a social pariah and be mistreated by their community for the rest of their lives.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The Chinese Communist party (CCP) is responsible for the total destruction of all traditional Chinese culture in the last 60 years. Doing such evil involved huge manpower and resources to spread the CCP's ideology of class struggles and hatred… It was a large-scale brainwashing. It poisoned a lot of young people to pave the way for the Cultural Revolution," Jin said.</p>
              <p>"During the appalling and unprecedented Cultural Revolution, countless families were destroyed and a large number of people died of unnatural causes. People were brutally persecuted, from intellectuals to common citizens. Many teenagers served in the Red Guards at that time. They became the communist regime's vicious thugs. This is one typical example of how the communist party culture poisoned the Chinese people, and these kinds of examples are countless. Today, the so-called artistic performances produced by the communist regime's party culture are permeated by its ideology of hatred, violence, immorality, and vulgar fun," Jin said.</p>
