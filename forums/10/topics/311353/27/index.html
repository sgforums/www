              <p>The vast majority of American's don't give a damn about Tibet. If China would just improve it's treatment of the Tibetan people even less westerners would care what goes on there.</p>
              <p>The protesters you see on TV are a very small minority. Ironically with the exception of a few Tibetans living in America. These are the very same people that routinely protest the War in Iraq, President Bush, The World Bank, the WTO, and Israel. They also routinely protest in favor of abortion rights and gay rights. It would be very inaccurate to portray the anti-Chinese protesters as part of a US propaganda machine.Or even as typical Americans.</p>
              <p>And for the record I support the decision of President Bush to attend the opening ceremonies at the Olympics in Beijing.</p>
              <p>As for the American Indians, They fought and killed each other for territory long before the white man came. I am very pleased that the Europeans brought my mothers people out of the stone age. Many of my cousins are Cherokee. They are not currently being oppressed by the US government.The past is past. The world was a different place hundreds of years ago. The misdeeds of the United States in the distant past is no excuse to mistreat Tibet. Yes the US slaughtered many aboriginal Americans. That's very true. Did those misdeeds justify the Japanese invasion of China and Korea during WWII?</p>
              <p>As far as the CNN comments go. Those comments were made by one man expressing his opinion about the current government of mainland China. He was not being critical of all Chinese people. CNN routinely says more negative things about President Bush and the Republican party than it does about China. If CNN were part of a US conspiracy to spread US propaganda why would it be allowed to be so critical of the Bush Administration and the United States Government?</p>

              <p>Eddie Lee,</p>
              <p>You refered to 'mistreatment' of Tibetans. What are
              these so-called mistreatments? Where did you get this idea of
              mistreatment notion from?</p>
              <p>You said Native Indians in US now have
              a better life than before and not being mistreated. I believe that. In
              fact if Im not wrong, they get some sort of special treatment or
              positive discrimination from the government.</p>
              <p>Guess what, why do u think the situation is different with ethnic Tibetans in China?</p>
              <p>Why do some people have this concept in their mind that Tibetans are 'mistreated' ?</p>
              <p>Maybe
              this question should be asked first because this is one of the biggest
              misconceptions which is the basis of many people's sympathy towards
              Tibetan movement. Have u actually thought that this could actually be
              not true?</p>
              <p>Have u ever thought that this notion could be false?</p>
              <p>I believe you are right on another count though, not many
              Americans care about Tibetan issue. In fact, there shouldnt be any
              issue whatsoever. Those exile protesters are descendants of failed
              1950s war. They are a special group. Do they represent Tibetans? I
              think they represent the monk class and their followers. The younger
              ones of them, in their 20s-30s, I think never even set foot in China or
              Tibet itself. They are born in foreign countries, still live in their
              own orbit, and still hung up on so called independence. Meanwhile in
              Tibet itself, times is moving.</p>
              <p>Now tell me, do they represent average Tibetans living in Tibet? Do you believe that?</p>
              <p>Just as you dont believe American protesters who joined those exile Tibetans represent the majority of Americans, I think those Tibetan protestors dont represent the majority of Tibetans as well.</p>
              <p>Just yesterday I watched TV interview of so-called Prime Minister of Tibetan goverment-in-exile.</p>
              <p>Guess what, he is a monk, wearing a monk robe, and at the side table, there was a picture of Buddha photo.</p>
              <p>So this monk is the prime minister of Tibetan people?</p>
              <p>Are you sure Tibetans want him?</p>
              <p>From
              that TV interview what can we conclude? They are just sore losers of
              the 1950s war, the monk class who got overthrown and their lands
              re-distributed to Tibetan peasants. They are sore losers and political
              opponent of China, but still acting like they are the rulers of Tibet,
              and still have the cheek to appoint themselves and call themselves
              fancy names, like Prime Minister of government-in-exile.</p>
              <p>Who appoint them? Themselves? They still think they are the rulers or Tibet?</p>
              <p>This
              is another big misconception, that majority of Tibetans ordinary people
              actually want independence, or even so-called greater autonomy. Who are
              these 'people' actually? Please pay attention, and pay a close
              attention.</p>
              <p>And lastly I want to point out....you said there is no American
              propaganda. If you really believe that, then I dont know what to say.
              There is propaganda everywhere, even in Western media. Let me ask you,
              do u think Saddam's vilification is a form of propaganda or not? WMD in
              Iraq is a form of propaganda or not? Recently Prince Harry was shown
              fighting in Afganistan, those series, do you think is a propaganda or
              not..?</p>
              <p>Not many people are so foolish to miss propaganda
              excersices, and I for one, is not fooled. I can see clearly whats going
              on. Several western countries launched a concerted effort to sabotage
              China and are still continuing with their information warfare.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you another question, maybe you are familiar with.</p>
              <p>Not
              long ago the western media launched stories of defective Chinese goods.
              Is this a form of propaganda or not? Something natural? What do you
              think? Any rational person can see whats going on. How many percent of
              goods are actually defective? Why didnt they show the working goods? What is the purpose behind it?</p>
              <p>I
              read and follow the development of this Tibet information warfare. Alot
              of Chinese are angry of the so-called 'media bias'. I think this is too
              tame. This is not a simple 'media bias' like how the media has bias
              towards a certain American Idol contestant for example. This is a
              deliberate and concerted, organized effort backed by their governments
              to sabotage China. I am sorry if you cannot see this.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for your response Meat Pao.</p>
              <p>Most information from
                                      Tibet comes from recent immigrants, exiles,Tibetan Buddhists and NGOs operating in
                                      Tibet. I obviously don't believe everything that I hear from these
                                      people.</p>
              <p>The recent problems with Chinese goods was not a
                                      propaganda ploy. Many US companies lost millions of dollars. Personally
                                      I hold US companies equally responsible for the manufacturing and importing of
                                      toys containing unsafe amounts of lead. If that was nothing but US
                                      propaganda why did the government of China execute several people over
                                      these unsafe products (if they didn't exist).Please keep in mind that many international companies manufacture their products in China. In addition to US toy companies US retailers were also hit very hard.</p>
              <p>Products that work properly are not a problem and not
                                      newsworthy. The excellent hiking boots (made in China) that I am wearing right now are durable well made boots. That's not news. If they were to mysteriously burst into flames
                                      that would be news worthy.</p>
              <p>As for Sadam Hussein it would be hard
                                      not to vilify someone who used chemical weapons against his own
                                      citizens. All governments have their own agendas and propaganda to some
                                      extent. But the US government has no control over it's media. If you
                                      pay attention to the American mainstream media you will see more stories
                                      critical of the United States than any other country. Including China!</p>
              <p>I suspect that you may be suffering from your own media bias and anti US propaganda.</p>

              <p>In truth I detest the American media. But for reasons that you are probably not even aware of.</p>
              <p>More than 95% of the US media belongs to one political party (the Democratic party).</p>
              <p>The US media is very biased when it comes to reporting the news in that regard.</p>

              <p>I
                                  would much rather live in Laos than The Kingdom of Cambodia ( or

                                  is similar to Thailand in some ways. But without the whores, drugs, pollution or crime.</p>
              <p>But
                                  if your are going to compare the two countries. Please keep in mind
                                  that Cambodia is still recovering from having as much as 25% of it's
                                  population murdered by the Khmer Rouge (crazy, radical communists lah).</p>
              <p>I seem to remember China coming to rescue the Khmer Rouge when the Vietnamese tried to intervene in 1979?</p>
              <p>(If I have the wrong date please let me know)</p>
              <p>I agree that both sides of this debate should abandoned old fashioned cold war concepts.Like it or not the economies of China and the USA are now codependent.</p>

              <p>Lao is not much different in terms of pains they suffered.. They went through long period of western colonization and wars brought about by 'democratic' countries. And Cambodia is rife with corruption.</p>
              <p>Vietnam is worse. One million were killed in bombs and WMDs brought about by 'democratic' country and assisted by its ally like Thailand, my country. Now 'communist' Vietnam is rising while 'democratic' Thailand is running around in circles about amending the constitutions, which is such a waste of time when evading the law and abusive interpretation of law have become a norm.</p>
              <p>Back to China. This made me believe that China has its own reason to be as it is now.</p>

              <p>I don't think communism in each country is the same. For example, North Korean communism is quite destructive to its people. So you can't generalize communism, democracy or absolute monarchy as good or bad.</p>
              <p>And you're right. China came to the realization not just after the return of Hong Kong but also after the breakaway of many republics from Russia. Clearly China adjusts, adapts, and prioritizes while realizing their limits. They cannot just simply take advices from or bow to the West. Otherwise, they would have followed the Russian course.</p>

              <p><br>it has been going on for quiet sometime that TV news networks are now entertaining rather than reporting. I continue to see that in major network. This shfit has been largely i believe due to the changed of business ownership within news media companies.  I also think that is a major misperception from most people living in  Asia since news media are more state owned and public rely on media to get information there is a perceived responsible reporting as part of the ethics and also a tools for govt to send out message.</p>
              <p>These days I find that a more information news approach that provide a decent perspective would be PBS News Hour Jim Lehrer.</p>
