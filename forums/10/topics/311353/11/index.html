              <p>To you, only news from Free Tibet carry the truth. News published in Singapore are definitely pro PAP and PAP is pro PRC and therefore not credible.</p>
              <p>I question all pictures, vidio or any reports from anybody. Why? because pictures and vidios can be fake, altered with modern technologies. Even the best journalists truest to his profession can only be on one side telling a one sided story but not on the other side to give a full report. You show pictures of tibetans killed, I saw on news Chinese who described how his sister was trapped and burnt to death when mobster set fire to their shop. Who deserve any of these?</p>
              <p>This kind of riots is not the same as the protests you see in KL or even in Seoul where tear gas and water canon are used to battle flying rock and molotov cocktails. When the mobsters started killing innocent Chinese passersby, setting fires to houses of innocent civilians, then you can expect more quicker and more drastic actions. I read a report quoting a news footage from a Canadian TV that in Gansu a few hundreds tibetans on horseback attacked a local government building guarded by a hundred police. What would you do if you were among the police?</p>
              <p>If the riots in China now is a coordinated effort to free tibet, like what Sun Yet San did in overthrowing the Qing regime, once order given, every single tibatan rise up and is prepared to die to free tibet, there is a reason for outsiders to show support.</p>
              <p>At the moment, even the dalai lama in exile denied any involvement. All the sporadic riots here and there, killing innocents people instead of attacking soldiers barrack, are nothing but to disrupt stability and peace.</p>
              <p>Who are you supporting?</p>

              <p>oh ... okie ... now I'm getting confused ... or rather, you are ? ....</p>
              <p>can I presume from post above, that you think it's alright for a rebellion like the Sun Yat Sen lead one to overthrow a regime ? ... and that you'll support such a move ? ....</p>
              <p>mind you, the Qing goverment was the legitimate goverment of China when Sun Yat Sen lead the against them ... or are you going to say that they are not chinese, but manchus ? .... so the Qing dynasty were not legitimate rulers of china then ? ... if so .... when you said that tibet was under the Qing's control then, doesn't that make it illegal ? ... isn't it like saying, a king has two slaves, one day, one of the slaves rebelled and overthrew the king, so now the first slaves owns the second slave as well .....</p>
              <p>next then, what the different between Sun Yat Sen's campaign and dalai lamas ? ... I see many parallels ... both were travelling overseas drumming up support (including in Singapore, staying at the famous "wan ting yuan") .... next, the initial troubles had nothing to do with him (wuchang uprising etc) .... people were too fed up with the current rulers ... and took to the streets ... armed ..... with violence ... you say that the tibetans were violent, and thus had to be put down ... Sun Yat Sen's friends were pretty violent too when they overthrew the Qings,... so they were wrong to have done what they did in your books then ? ....</p>
              <p>isn't it hyprocrisy on your part then, or just confusion ?  .... when you say people should support something like what Sun Yat Sen did, that is, the overthrowing of an oppresive regime .... and in the previous breathe, now say that peace and stability is the most important, and the most important thing now is to stop the rioting ? and that violence is wrong ? ...... mind you these are all your own words ... you imply that Sun Yat Sen was right to lead the overthrow of the regime, you may even support it ....  ... now you're saying that the demonstrations to agitate for independence and freedom is wrong ? And don't come comparing Sun Yat Sen with the Dalai Lama .... they are not the same ....  the former had no qualms about armed violence to achieve his aims ... the dalai lama does not want violence for religious reasons ... but that is in now was indicative that tibetans does not want freedom and independence, else we wouldn't be seeing what we are seeing now ....</p>
              <p>or are you now going to use something lame like "show me that every tibetan is prepared to die for tibet " ? ....</p>
              <p>remember that many already have .... <a href="http://www.freetibet.org/press/kirtiphotos.html">http://www.freetibet.org/press/kirtiphotos.html </a></p>
              <p>and also remember that during the time of the Qings, the revolutionaries were called "luan dang"... terrorists, by the Qing goverment as well .... (that is, until  they succeeded, then they became revolutionary heros, right ? )</p>
              <p>is the benchmark for your support then, whether a rebellion is successful or not ? ...or is it really, because Sun Yat Sen was a chinese .... your racial and cultural chauvinism at work again ? ....  china and the chinese seems to be a big part of your argument ...... why do you call yourself SGdiehard then ? ... remember, a surfeit of racial and cultural pride is not good in a multi-cultural society like Singapore ...</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: large;"> Stand With Tibet</span><br> <br> Dear friends,<br> <br> After decades of repression under Chinese rule, the Tibetan people's
              frustrations have burst onto the streets in protests and riots. With
              the spotlight of the upcoming Olympic Games now on China, Tibetans are
              crying out to the world for change.<br> <br> The Chinese government has said that the protesters who have not yet
              surrendered "will be punished". Its leaders are right now considering a
              crucial choice between escalating brutality or dialogue that could
              determine the future of Tibet, and China.<br> <br> We can affect this historic choice--China does care about its
              international reputation. China's President Hu Jintao needs to hear
              that the 'Made in China' brand and the upcoming Olympics in Beijing can
              succeed only if he makes the right choice. But it will take an
              avalanche of global people power to get his attention--and we need it
              in the next 48 hours.<br> <br> The Tibetan Nobel peace prize winner and spiritual leader, the Dalai
              Lama has called for restraint and dialogue: he needs the world's people
              to support him. Click below now to sign the petition--and tell
              absolutely everyone you can right away--our goal is 1 million voices
              united for Tibet:<br> <br> http://www.avaaz.org/en/tibet_end_the_violence/97.php/?cl_tf_sign=1 <br> <br> China's economy is totally dependent on "Made in China" exports that we
              all buy, and the government is keen to make the Olympics in Beijing
              this summer a celebration of a new China, respected as a leading world
              power. China is also a very diverse country with a brutal past and has
              reason to be concerned about its stability -- some of Tibet's rioters
              killed innocent people. But President Hu must recognize that the
              greatest danger to Chinese stability and development comes from
              hardliners who advocate escalating repression, not from Tibetans who
              seek dialogue and reform.<br> <br> We will deliver our petition directly to Chinese officials in London,
              New York, and Beijing, but it must be a massive number before we
              deliver the petition. Please forward this email to your address book
              with a note explaining to your friends why this is important, or use
              our tell-a-friend tool to email your address book--it will come up
              after you sign the petition.<br> <br> The Tibetan people have suffered quietly for decades. It is finally their moment to speak--we must help them be heard.<br> <br> With hope and respect,<br> <br> Ricken, Iain, Graziela, Paul, Galit, Pascal, Milena, Ben and the whole Avaaz team<br> <br> PS - It has been suggested that the Chinese government may block the
              Avaaz website as a result of this email, and thousands of Avaaz members
              in China will no longer be able to participate in our community. A poll
              of Avaaz members over the weekend showed that over 80% of us believed
              it was still important to act on Tibet despite this terrible potential
              loss to our community, if we thought we could make a difference. If we

              <p><em>The Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) campaigns for justice for the
                      Palestinians.  As we approach the 60th anniversary in 2008 of the
                      dispossession of the Palestinians of their homeland in 1948, PSC is
                      building a mass solidarity movement with the aim of effecting changes
                      in consciousness, policies and actions in Britain and at an
                      international level. PSC calls for Palestinian self-determination,
                      and campaigns against the Israeli state’s repression of the Palestinian
                      people.  We lobby the British government to end the arms trade with
                      Israel, and to press Israel to abide by international law, end its
                      illegal occupation and allow the return of refugees.</em></p>

              <div class="quote_body">next then, what the different between Sun Yat Sen's campaign and
              dalai lamas ? ... I see many parallels ... both were travelling
              overseas drumming up support (including in Singapore, staying at
              the famous "wan ting yuan") .... next, the initial troubles had
              nothing to do with him (wuchang uprising etc) .... people were too
              fed up with the current rulers ... and took to the streets ...
              armed ..... with violence ... you say that the tibetans were
              violent, and thus had to be put down ... Sun Yat Sen's friends were
              pretty violent too when they overthrew the Qings,... so they were
              wrong to have done what they did in your books then ? ....
              <p>isn't it hyprocrisy on your part then, or just confusion ? 
              .... when you say people should support something like what Sun Yat
              Sen did, that is, the overthrowing of an oppresive regime .... and
              in the previous breathe, now say that peace and stability is the
              most important, and the most important thing now is to stop the
              rioting ? and that violence is wrong ? ...... mind you these are
              all your own words ... you imply that Sun Yat Sen was right to lead
              the overthrow of the regime, you may even support it ....  ...
              now you're saying that the demonstrations to agitate for
              independence and freedom is wrong ? And don't come comparing Sun
              Yat Sen with the Dalai Lama .... they are not the same .... 
              the former had no qualms about armed violence to achieve his aims
              ... the dalai lama does not want violence for religious reasons ...
              but that is in now was indicative that tibetans does not want
              freedom and independence, else we wouldn't be seeing what we are
              seeing now ....</p>
              <p>or are you now going to use something lame like "show me that
              every tibetan is prepared to die for tibet " ? ....</p>
              <p>remember that many already have .... <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.freetibet.org/press/kirtiphotos.html">http://www.freetibet.org/press/kirtiphotos.html</a></p>
              <p>and also remember that during the time of the Qings, the
              revolutionaries were called "luan dang"... terrorists, by the Qing
              goverment as well .... (that is, until  they succeeded, then
              they became revolutionary heros, right ? )</p>
              <p>is the benchmark for your support then, whether a rebellion is
              successful or not ? ...or is it really, because Sun Yat Sen was a
              chinese .... your racial and cultural chauvinism at work again ?
              ....  china and the chinese seems to be a big part of your
              argument ...... why do you call yourself SGdiehard then ? ...
              remember, a surfeit of racial and cultural pride is not good in a
              multi-cultural society like Singapore ...</p>

              <p>is that your benchmark ? ....</p>
              <p>and I did say don't compare Sun Yat Sen with the Dalai Lama, which our friend sgdiehard was doing in his confusion. he seems to think that a coordinated uprising against the chinese regime is to be supported, a la sun yat sen, is to be supported, I quote him here:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">"I</span><span style="color: #3366ff;">f the riots in China now is a coordinated effort to free
                                      tibet, like what Sun Yet San did in overthrowing the Qing regime,
                                      once order given, every single tibatan rise up and is prepared to
                                      die to free tibet, there is a reason for outsiders to show
                                      support." </span></p>
              <p>maybe you'd like to sort out his confusion with him ? ... first, he says tibet belongs to china, but now he says if tibet stages a co-ordinated uprising, then outsiders should show support .... hmmmmmmmm ....</p>
              <p>so ... you believe, and I quote from your post, that "<span style="color: #3366ff;">Dalai Lama is not behind this riot. The
                                      riot is planned by someone else.</span>"</p>
              <p>You do not believe in the official chinese version of the events,  that the riots were orchestrated by the "dalai lama clique" then ? ... not surprisingly, I don't put much stock in the pronouncements of that goverment either.</p>
              <p>i am not sure I agree with you that the current troubles in tibet has it's roots in Mao's policies, it seems a bit to easy to blame a man long dead for the troubles, but the problem is easily rectified, and I certainly don't agree with you that Buddhism in tibet is protected by the chinese central goverment, or else it will suffer the same fate as buddhism in India, India is the birth place of Buddhism and it is certainly flourishing there, some forumers just made pilgrimages there too ... I'm sure if you take it up at the Buddhism forum, they'll tell you the opposite is true,</p>
              <p>but however, the practise of Buddhism in Tibet is no longer free, we now see two different lamas on both sides of the fence, one recognized by the tibetans, another installed by the Chinese goverment ... is the Chinese goverment trying to play Buddha ? ....</p>
              <p>one thing I failed to understand before, is why go through all the hassle and trouble of invading and subjugating another country, if it's just for the sake of buffer zones against bigger enemies ? .... I was just arguing with a PRC classmate online yesterday night as I got going here as well ... and he offered me a startling insight, something which i never knew about before .....</p>
              <p>You know why China will never set Tibet Free now ? .....</p>
