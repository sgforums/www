              <p>Though i must agree that the tibetans are harsh in their protest this time, im sure you know the chinese communist government well. There was a mass slaughter in tian an men during 1991 protest against communist government. Many protestants were killed just by demonstrating in the fields. The communist armies killed thousands of them. This fact is hidden for a very long time till the world has almost stop spoken bout it or even forgotten it. We must not forget bout it. This is something that happened. We must not let something like this happen again.</p>
              <p>You know who is more peaceful and who is not. Who are higher authorities and who has not. Who has freedom and who is incharge of freedom.</p>

              <p>to be frank, tibet should belong to china. From a history perspective, tibet is only independent for a slight time when china went through internal war and british involvement. So china determine his country size is before his internal war which to a certain extent is not wrong.</p>
              <p>When china invade tibet, they also do not use force but sign a document through dialogue... (in a certain way tis is true). Compared with british invasion the casualties r much lesser...</p>
              <p>In recent time china had spent a lot of resources on tibet to modernise it. They even build a fast train to tibet at a high cost. Talking about ruling, they did not do anything bad to tibetians.</p>
              <p>Recent turn of events is also beyond one expectation, but I do not disagree with china hard stance. The situation is spiralling out of control and the people have become racial discriminating one another.</p>
              <p>The only thing I hate is china trying to lie and cover up wat happened. I think tat is immature, counter productive and spoil his own reputation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking about revolution and over throwing the government... u do it when u got a good reason to... so far china is treating tibetian better than their own people. And china is trying to improve over the years... They have a sudden jump in income and sudden improvement in standard of living. They have access to better education and better facilities and better transport links. They have some degree of autonomy over their own region as well. Now... why should they revolt ? Why should they use force on innocent chinese stall holder or innocent chinese on the street ?</p>
              <p>Lets say the native american Red indians or australian arbogines gang together and start to loot the caucasians stalls and kill their people and fight with the authorities... wat do u think the american or australian will do ? If u ask me, british is worse in determing whose countries belong to who. Is america belonging to red indian or the caucasians ? Is australia occupation legal ?</p>

              <p><br>This is where something said is wrong. You said the china government did not hurt the tibetans. Where you hear that from? When they were claiming tibet in the 1950s, thousands of tibetans were killed because they didnt want china to rule over them. Dont say let bygones be bygones. Think about it. If someone kills our forefathers in Singapore, would you still hang out as if nothing has happened. The younger generations of tibetans are just wary of this truth. They cant immagine the fact that china government killed their people in the past. Just like how japanese soldiers killed many of our ancestors in singapore in 1942, how can you forget bout it?</p>

              <p>If u talk about killing thousands of people, when they start their invasion the casualties r minimum. They did not kill their soldiers but ask them to surrender peacefully and even give them money to return home. If u compare to the Yuan dynasty or the British invasion or the Napalese invasion, they really kill thousands of their people. However there is some problem after the invasion which many of the people died... like the rest of china... But in recent times there is no such dealth etc</p>
              <p>If u talk about Japanese, to be perfectly honest I feel little over it now.. In fact I even learn some japanese, appreciate their culture and buy their product more than any other product. I really don't consider the past war when I interact with them</p>

              <p>Some ppl here side Communist China just becoz Mainland China is ruled by Chinese.But let us not forget here,they are Communist!!!!</p>
              <p>I am also Chinese,i also hope to see China glow into a powerful nation.BUT,if China under communist controlled,then i would rather see it fall!!!I would rather see Tibet,Taiwan n even Xinjiang go independant.</p>
              <p>Why?Becoz those Chinese Communist Pigs have no feelings for others.Not only other races,they will even kill their own Chinese ppl in order to stay in power.Remember 1989 Tiananmen incident?How many Chinese who are unarmed were killed or run over by tanks?And Funlungong incident,how many Chinese were killed by the Communist government?</p>
              <p>It is just like in a family,if u are one of the family member,and your father happen to be a dictatorial person.Everytime beat up your siblings n mother for no reason,insult your friends n humiliate u infront of them.Even if u are identical to him,as u are his son,will you still "side" him when he do wrong things?Think about it,if we dont know how to differentiate between right n wrong,we are no different than animals,and in this case,those communist pigs!!!</p>

              <p>When a nation is just starting up, they have to use hard handed method to ensure (maybe) 100 years of peace before the country is stabilised, educated and rich enough before they think about democracy.</p>
              <p>I agree tiananmen is cruel and falungong is unjustified. However I also felt tat china is hard to be ruled. Do u think tat within 1 year everybody and everything in china changes and it can become a country like america or england ? I think they still need 50 years</p>
              <p>If u look at the countries tat was not ready and go into democracy, u realise a lot of problems will surface by looking at countries like Iraq or even indonesia and india. India have been democractic for decades but its development pales in comparison with china. (China 3rd largest economy in the world, india is 12th). Indonesia economy grow the highest under suharto's rule as well even though he is also a dictator</p>

              <p>i agree. the old textbook definition of communist china can now be flushed down the toilet bowl.</p>
              <p>i think the chinese rulers are smart, they play the communist book when it comes to law and order and political administration, but it laxes in economic terms. in a real sense, we shouldn't be seeing ferraris and bentleys on the chinese road if communist china prevails in the strictest sense.</p>
              <p>but your notion of a dictatorship democracy is a paradox, though not in reality. it can be felt to a certain extent closer to home too. </p>

              <p>The Tibetan rioters went to the street, setting shops
              (specifically targeting shops owned by Han people) on fire, hacking
              people with axes and generally wrecking other havoc they are
              capable of. Yet, these people are portrayed as peace-loving,
              suppressed victims by Western media? Well, I am not surprised.
              Western media has been habouring an admirable amount of bias
              towards China for a long time, even at the cost of twisting facts.
              Yet, they think they have the moral high ground to accuse China of
              spreading propaganda. I guess they do not know that they live in
              glass houses themselves. </p>
              <p>Western countries colonized most parts of the world, stealing
              land from natives (USA, Australia...) and inflicting
              great atrocities in the process. Now they think they have
              the moral high ground to lecture us on Tibet? Let's set aside
              whether Tibet should belong to China for the moment. If one's
              argument is that invasion in itself, regardless of its consequences
              (good or bad), is unjustified and must be reversed, then naturally
              white American and Australians must get out of USA and Australia
              and go back to Europe. After they have retreated from those lands,
              we could discuss Tibet. Otherwise, please kindly back
              off. </p>
              <p>If one accuses me of diverting attention from the issue, then I
              must ask this simple question: If white Americans are living in a
              land they illegally stole from native Indians and Han Chinese are
              living in a land they illegally took from the Tibetans, why does
              one point fingers at the Chinese but not Americans if the
              wrong-doing is the same? I am not trying to justify Chinese
              occupation of Tibet, but singling out one country and ignoring
              another speaks volumes about one's neutrality, or the lack
              thereof. </p>
              <p>And... it is America that IS throwing its weight around the
              world, invading other sovereign nations and causing all sorts of
              friction and animosity. They self-righteously think that their
              ideology is superior to others and thus
              they aggressively export and impose their systems on
              other countries. Those who resist this ideological assimilation are
              punished one way or the other. And why is someone accusing China of
              chauvinism instead? </p>

              <p><br>Captial punsihment law is ok to me, ONLY with evidence of the conivcted. But China is the exception of what i stated. China is STILL under communism no matter how you speak of it, and this fact cannot be denied. Yes its an open country now but the systm is still communism based. Ok, lets assume that China government does nothing wrong and so on. Ok lets not go against them. But hey, look at how they accuse the dalai lama of doing wrong when there is no evidence at all. Well, they claim they do have evidence, but why not show it to the world first? Action speak louder than words. If they want to find fault, why should it always be a buddhist monk just because he is labelled as a tibetan spiritual leader? WHY?</p>

When China is powerful, the whole world will have peace. That is the difference between china and the west.<br>I will be more than happy to see China become a democratic country like singapore where everyone has a choice and freedom of speech. But if china fall, a lot more people will suffer. The new countries may not use democratic political system. Then without this potential competitor, US will change its target to other country, singapore probably will lose its value to stand between the 2 powers. Note that before Russia fall, US treated China as good friend, after russia fall, everything changed.</p>

              are you comparing your own country to one which is of such unsavory
              repute to you ? ... comparing China to other "imperialist powers"
              as you've put them as ... is it a tacit admissible of similar
              behavior as those "imperialist powers", to ignore what I've
              previously said about "learning from the good, and not the bad" ...
              if you acknowledge that what the whites did to the natives in
              Australia, the US, and across the new world was bad, why are you
              trying to justify China's action by comparing the occupation Tibet
              with these countries ....</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">China too, had suffered invasions and occupations
              in her past, including most recently, under the japanese (which the
              Chinese goverment and people would never let anyone forget) ....
              one would thought that having suffered foreign occupation herself,
              she wouldn't want to impose it on another .... but no ! ... now,
              you think it's fair to say "tibet now belongs to China, it's a fact
              and will never be reversed, so forget and get over it already !?!?
              .... double standards ? ... chauvinism ? ... I think it's starting
              to smell like fascism ....</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">and just on the record ... I would like to ask
              you for your views on the sovereignty and ownership issues of the
              spratley islands ... who do you think owns these islands ?
              ...”</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, I am not in favor of using
              such simple metaphorical examples (criminals A and B etc.) to
              illustrate something as complex as international politics and power
              arm-twisting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is because in
              international politics, there is no dedicated policeman to catch
              criminals and definitely no judge to make an impartial
              verdict.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">And international reality is
              based on interpretation and perception, which in turn is decided by
              power relations. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is Tibet a problematic
              case? Why are we discussing it now? This is because the West is
              making a case out of it for their political objectives. IT IS A
              POLITICAL STATEMENT Do not give me the crap about how they care for
              Tibetans and Tibetan culture and all. It takes one a pair of
              healthy eyes and a sane mind to see that they don’t. You may have
              faith in their inherent goodness. But most of us don’t. Do you
              honestly believe that YOU would be discussing the “miserable
              subjugation” of Tibetans IF THEY did not make a case out of it to
              begin with?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">My answer to the question “why
              do the white man’s faults absolve China of its wrong-doings” is
              predicated on the following understanding:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reality is based on
              interpretation and perception. International reality is contingent
              on political interpretation and perception. Something is not
              inherently right or wrong. It is right or wrong only when one
              interprets it to be one way or the other.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As such, the Chinese occupation
              of Tibet (let’s assume for now that Chinese occupation of Tibet
              started only in 1950, which is not a correct assumption but it is
              not the crucial point here) was not a wrong-doing until the West
              started to make a wrong-doing INTERPRETATION out of it (for the
              sake of their political objective).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, the Tibetan issue is
              not to be interpreted and discussed in isolation but with respect
              to its political motivations. For that reason, there is absolutely
              no point in discussing the inherent right/wrong of Tibetan
              occupation. It must be discussed, again as I said with respect to
              the political objectives behind it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Since it is a political
              statement, as my argument above pointed out, of course, my response
              to the Tibetan issue is also a political one: If you are making a
              case out of Tibet, I am going to make a case out of North America
              and Oceana so that your case of Tibet starts to sound less
              convincing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Once again, international
              reality is based on interpretation and perception, which is in turn
              decided by power relations. One ignores this fundamental point at
              one’s own folly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">By the way, since I do not know
              much about nansha qundao, allow me to refrain from commenting on
              it. </span></p>

              <p>Look at the history, how many world war, how many invasion is
              initiated by communist country? Do you know Hilter was elected in
              election? Hong Kong during the British colonisation has no election
              at all, did you hope hong kong to fall also?<br> History has showed again and again that when China is weak, the
              whole world will be chaotic. When China is powerful, the whole
              world will have peace. That is the difference between china and the
              west.<br> I will be more than happy to see China become a democratic country
              like singapore where everyone has a choice and freedom of speech.
              But if china fall, a lot more people will suffer. The new countries
              may not use democratic political system. Then without this
              potential competitor, US will change its target to other country,
              singapore probably will lose its value to stand between the 2
              powers. Note that before Russia fall, US treated China as good
              friend, after russia fall, everything changed.</p>

              <p>Precisely, the USA now throws its weight around the world, doing whatever they want. It is a very dangerous situation. We need another country with a sufficiently different ideology and comparable military and economic might to keep USA 's power in check. No country can assume this role at the moment. It is sad. </p>
