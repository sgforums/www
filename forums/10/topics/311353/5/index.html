              If Mainland China still under the rules of Communism or socialism or dictatorial rules,any parts of China like Taiwan n Tibet is eligible to break from China.[
              ]
              I dont know how many of you have watch China program CCTV or Phoenix Channel before.I remember during Chinese New Year that time,i watch CCTV Channel and the Chinese leader Wan Jia Bao(He is the Chairman of the Communist party)visit a police headquarters.[
              ]
              He say greetings to all the fellow police officers on duty during the holiday.Then he ask them eat already or not?All the officers,and i mean all,reply "uniformly" that:We have already eaten,thank you Chairman for your concern,we will sacrifice for the sake of socialism and Chairman etc....."(the exact sentence is quite long).Then the Chairman smile happily n crap his hands and so do all the officers.[
              ]
              I was like WTF,are they acting a show or what?Obviously,the questions and answers was "preset" and train over n over again.It is so fuking "Fake"!!!I can tell you guys,those Chinese Communist politicians are living in their own "fantasy world",their physco minds are even more serious than our PAP leaders.

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Get your facts right first.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tibet was not an independent country in 1950.
              Go back to history, Tibet was ruled by emperors for many
              decades but was invaded by Dzungars, the mongols in 1717. Emperor
              Kangxi sent two military expeditions to drive the mongols out in
              1718 and 1720, and installed the 7th Dalai Lama with administrative
              power in 1751.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Again 1788 and 1791, Tibet was invaded twice
              by the Nepalese who were repelled by the Qing Government. During
              this period of time, Tibet was already part of China, otherwise why
              do you think the Qing Dynasty would send soldiers to defend
              them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1904, with the decline of the Qing
              dynasty, the British invaded Tibet forcing a treaty to allow free
              passes for British and Indians into Tibet. "Despite the
              mutual agreement, the British expedition did take the lives of a
              few thousand unprepared Tibetan soldiers and civilians. The biggest
              massacre took place on March 31, 1904 at a mountain pass halfway to
              Gyantse near a village called Guru…" But even the Brits, they
              recognized Tibet as part of China.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">In the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907,
              drafted by the British, Britain recognized the “suzerainty of China
              over Thibet" and, in conformity with such admitted principle,
              engaged "not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through
              the intermediary of the Chinese Government."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Read what else after that, but basically
              after going through WW2 and civil war, PRC was consolidating its
              territory and Tibet uprising in 1950 was met with brutal
              suppression.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The history of Tibet with China may not go
              back as long as the Jews with Palestine, and the relationship
              between the Tibetan and Chinese may not be as complicated as that
              between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but you cannot just
              start the world from 1950 and ignore what happened
              before.<span>  </span></span></p>

              <p>hehe, moral statement again. If I used the words "brutal suppression" instead of "successful containment", I state my disapproval. But get down from your moral high ground.

              <p>of course you don't ... cos you can see the other dude slapping yourself .... and don't go around accusing people of having no knowledge of history when your history based argument gets rebuted ... that only makes you sound like the chaps from the country you're trying to defend ... you know that was a flawed argument, don't you ? ... did you read my other post about what you've written about western bias and double standards ? .... "Hao De Bu xue Xue huai de? "... that applies to your posts as well ....</p>
              <p>how can you justify the conquering and subjugation of one country by another simply because other countries (read: western powers if you prefer) ... has done so in the past ? ... saying that tibetan culture was based on oppression and slavery is like saying that the whites were justified in subjugating the aborogines in austrlia cos they were half naked savages isn't it ? .... but of course ... you haven't replied to my analogy of "teacher teacher, why catch me only, others were cheating also, not fair ! ... instead of picking up the best parts of other countries, you're trying to justify picking up the imperialist game from the "imperialists "themselves ? ...  </p>
              <p>you remind me of those report from china TV shows, after the rash of consumer product scares ... lead paints in dolls, dodgy foods and what not, instead of coming clean and improving quality, the chinese goverment embarked on a campaingn of tit for tat banning, banning potato chips from the US, and what not ... it's so cute ... like a spiteful little boy caught committing a thieft .... </p>
              <p>of course, no body saw the police open fire ... yet (though you may like to search for the latest BBC articles and pictures ... but you're gonna claim western bias and doctored photos ? ... )</p>
              <p>but it is an undeniable fact that tibetan civilians were killed, even if the numbers were in dispute ...</p>
              <p>before you go further on the name calling .... and before I label you a chinese cultural chauvinist too ... would you like to make a moral stand on the PRC's suppression by force on the tibetan civilians ? .... would you like to take a moral stand on the killings ? ..... or are you just going to shy away from the question ... just like the other dudes too ? ...</p>
              <p>am I ignorant ? ... or are you really but a chinese chauvinist trying to find justification trying to selectively interpret history ? ...</p>
