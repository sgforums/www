              <p> "this thing is as intractable as the israeli-palestinian issue." </p>
              <p>Actually no I dont think it is. Nor should it spiral into such a situation. Like someone else said, Tibetians in China live way better lives than Palestineans. Ask any Palestinean. It is a virtual hellhole with zero infrastruture, no means of escaping the poverty, death and violence, with no hope at all unlike the Chinese developed Llhasa.</p>
              <p>Palestineans can also fire all the rockets all they want - but it will not get them the state they desire. If China was a strong and powerful democratic country, it could be the honest broker  that the Middle East needs, but thats just a fantasy.</p>
              <p>Btw isnt Israel the invader of Arab land? And Israel didnt exist prior to 19xx (cant remember when).</p>

              <p>No point arguing IMHO. Fatum, I will support you if you can get a couple of Causasians to protest with you in front of the Chinese embassy, that way you will be immune to any PAP recriminations.</p>
              <p>If not, will be like SDP stupid Indian, Chinese locals get arrested. If the Westerners really cared about democracy, they wouldnt set up news agencies in Singapore and report on the rest of the region but NOT SINGAPORE itself. To me that hypocrisy on the highest level. "Democracy for me, but none for thee"</p>

              <p>are you justifying the atrocities being conducted now by the PLA against the tibetans because other countries had similar episodes in their past ? ... because other countries did it too ? ....</p>
              <p>I shall repeat my arguments for the FIFTH time ... aren't you like the spiteful little kid in school who got caught stealing or cheating, and instead of being ashamed ... goes around accusing the teacher of bias ..... shouldn't the kid actually be ashamed of cheating in the first place ? .....</p>

              <p>I dont think that Poh Ah Pak believes that the riots are foreign instigated or that the Dalai Lama actually ordered the riots (as opposed to what is coming out of the Communist Party). He disagrees, as I do, that Tibet should become an independent country.</p>
              <p>Some of the Tibetians are protesting for COMPLETE independence (which the Dalai Lama does not advocate) whereas Singaporeans (would if they could) protest for free and fair elections and against an unfree media.</p>
              <p>If you ask the Tibetians, not all of them would agree to independence as well. Its called democracy isnt it?</p>

              <p>On the other hand Singapore is evidently being propped up by the USA ironically because the PAP always like to point out they have America's Navy ready to fight on Singapore's behalf. PAP says foreign powers behind activists to deflect attention.</p>

              <p>and isn't it funny, so you say you support democracy ? .... but not for tibet ? ... did the people of tibet have a choice of choosing to be part of china or not ? .... or do you say conditions are not right ? .. when would be the conditions be right for a conquered people ? .... when the culture is dead, the people assimilated ? ... so you do have double standards don't you ? .... again ... it's really the chinese cultural chauvinist part of you speaking isn't it ? .... so when are you posting those gopalan passages again ? ...</p>

              <p>It is true that the US cruelty on the natives and other minority in the red indian continent shouldn't be an excuse for China to suppress the separatists in their own country.<br>In fact, china never use this as an excuse. I am surprised that they didn't use this. It is very obvious to compare "invasion to massacre a race that is protecting their own land and culture" and "suppressing violence separatist without shooting a single bullet"<br>But when we criticize, we have to understand what is our motivation. ok. if we criticize china internal affairs while ignoring a more serious wrongdoing done by US, we are practicing double standard and discrimination, and taking advantage of this time during Olympics preparation period.</p>
              <p>Come on, in less than 100 years, the red indians are being wiped out. For tibet which is under china rule for thousand years, still retain their culture, language, people. Look at indonesia please. We are educated people, pls do a comparison chart.<br><br>It is true that some past china leaders suppress the tibetans cruely, I condemned that too. I refernig to Mao Tze Dong. But during his era, the entire china nation is the victims be it in Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai and so on. Did Beijing declare independence because of this Mao Tze Dong? No. Now Mao is gone already. Are we going to do more thing to punish the victims? Of coz not.</p>

              <p>Make no mistake, if the USA wanted to make a regime change in Singapore, it would be over in 2 seconds flat and the much touted American Navy would be shelling Singapore instead of protecting it. If anyone has a "foreign power" agenda, it would be the PAP.</p>
