              <p>Yeah, coalesce and emerge as a nation. Without

              <p>Please read my thread carefully - I dont sanction whats has
              happened to the Tibetians because the Westerners has committed
              similar atrocities in the past. But the Communist Party of China
              can always point to them and use them as an excuse. And they can
              also apologize 150 years later. What benefits does total
              independence bring to a landlocked, mountainous region which
              ultimately depends on China for trade? I dont believe in cultural

              one day and decide to build them for fun. We came in and we DID

              <p> just one answer.</p>
              <p>The Temples in Tibet are still there right? Good. According to you, as long as the temples(mosques in Singapore) are still there, everything is just peachy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, caucasians are one of the 4 major races in singapore. remember? Or do you assume the only impact on culture here came from us chinese? My aren't you full of yourself.</p>
              <p>Cultural genoxide doesn't HAVE to happen. But it inevitably happens when a culture interacts with another. If you think the Miao culture has not changed a single bit in it's decades of interaction with the Han one, I fear you are misguided.</p>

              <p>Not that should be a reason but vice versa because a region is a viable economic entity doesnt mean it should be independent (like California for example). The Dalai Lama does not want independence at all but greater autonomy I am guessing for the same pramagtic reasons.</p>

              <p>2.) okie, nevermind universal values, since it doesn't appear to be in your books ... so, again, in your books, it's alright for one country to invade another, take it over, and 60 years later, say, viola ! ... the second generations, third generations are all citizens of our country, they have no cause for complaints or to agitate for independence, since they were born in "our country"... so any seperatist movement is really "treason"? ... you're basically advocating force and power and the primary determinants of legality isn't it ?</p>
              <p>3.) brush up on YOUR history ... Hong kong was ceded in perpetuity ... only the new territories came with a termed lease ... which ran out in 97, at which the chinese demanded the whole colony back ... again, there's the problem .. hong kong was always part of china, of course .... but the brits took a chunk back ... and it's right for the chinese to get it back .... but when the chinese took over one WHOLE OTHER COUNTRY .... you want that other country to suck it up ? ..... wow ... just wow ....</p>

              <p>Not that should be a reason but vice versa because a region is a
              viable economic entity doesnt mean it should be independent (like
              California for example). The Dalai Lama does not want independence
              at all but greater autonomy I am guessing for the same pramagtic

              <p>1.) so if some invaders came along and take over and rule you,
              and you're unhappy with the rule, it's wrong to protest against
              them cos it's "legit" ? ...</p>
              <p>2.) okie, nevermind universal values, since it doesn't appear to
              be in your books ... so, again, in your books, it's alright for one
              country to invade another, take it over, and 60 years later, say,
              viola ! ... the second generations, third generations are all
              citizens of our country, they have no cause for complaints or to
              agitate for independence, since they were born in "our country"...
              so any seperatist movement is really "treason"? ... you're
              basically advocating force and power and the primary determinants
              of legality isn't it ?</p>
              <p>3.) brush up on YOUR history ... Hong kong was ceded in
              perpetuity ... only the new territories came with a termed lease
              ... which ran out in 97, at which the chinese demanded the whole
              colony back ... again, there's the problem .. hong kong was always
              part of china, of course .... but the brits took a chunk back ...
              and it's right for the chinese to get it back .... but when the
              chinese took over one WHOLE OTHER COUNTRY .... you want that other
              country to suck it up ? ..... wow ... just wow ....</p>
              <p>4. where did this come from ? ... </p>
              <p>5. that is your own observation sir ... but I observe that if
              the tibetans were fighting like the chechens against the russians
              today, maybe they wouldn't have been subjugated ... perhaps because
              they were hapless, peaceful buddhists, that they got taken over
              ..</p>
              <p>6. you imagine the majority of tibetans feel that way ? ... that
              because they are the second and third generations born after the
              invasion .. they'll feel more chinese and not tibetan ? ..... why

              <p>my reply to the first point is at the "other" thread ....</p>
              <p>2.) again, that doesn't make it right .... why do you think we've been having this argument ..... so far, you have resisted putting things in a black and white morale perspective ... so here goes ... do you think it's right for one country to invade another ? ... simple question ... nevermind the moralizing about "tibetan slave culture " and winds of change and regime change and what not .... it smells like the US invading Iraq and effecting a "regime change" because Iraqis are "being oppressed" when the whole world knows it's really about the oil ... nor does that makes it any more legal, right ? .... and I don't think the Iraqis are any more better under the US now then they were before under saddam, if not worse ... same thing for the tibetans .... and if the "backward tibetan culture" is legitimate pretext for invasion in your eyes, then do you view the colonizing and "assimilation" of other native peoples, like the australian aborogines, and the native americans, in the same way then ? .....</p>
              <p>3) I should gently remind you that tibet was a fully functioning, independant, sovereign nation before the 1950 invasion ... with it's own goverment, it's own military, it's own civic structures ... the only difference was that it got taken over ...</p>
              <p>6) funny ... my point was that second and third generations tibetans, born under chinese rule, still desires independence and freedom from chinese rule ... they are not, as you imply that you would be in similar circumstances, oblivious or apathetic about being foreign domination ....</p>
              <p>finally ... let's see if it can end here ... nevermind about nobody giving a fark 100 years from now, or "shit happens"and what not .....  do you think it's right for one country to invade by force another country ? .... yes ? ... no ? ....</p>

              <p>"it smells like the US invading Iraq and effecting a "regime change" because Iraqis are "being oppressed" when the whole world knows it's really about the oil ... nor does that makes it any more legal, right "</p>
              <p>No but the US did so anyway. The Americans are not that worried about international law (I personally disagree with that stance) but more about the price they have to pay in terms of their economy and lives lost.</p>
              <p>Let's say Tibet does seceed successfully but with a hostile China imposing an embargo on it - what good does it do for the Tibetians? I mentioned the Miao (Hmong) people who are integrated into China and Chinese society but not fully assimilated - that should be the goal for the Chinese government by granting greater autonomy and recognizing the Dalai Lama's SPIRTUAL authority, as does the Italian government to the Pope in Rome.</p>
              <p> The Papal State is an "independent" country recognized by the UN but in reality it owes it existence to Italy.</p>

              <p>Free Tibet?</p>
              <p>Why Tibet?</p>
              <p>There are so many areas to be "freed".</p>
              <p>What about the kurds in Turkey?</p>
              <p>What about Basques in Spain?</p>
              <p>What about native americans in USA?</p>
              <p>Who is going to free them?</p>
              <p>I would rather free Palestine from Israeli occupation first, rather than worry about Tibet.</p>
              <p>Free Tibet?</p>
              <p>Nothing but anti-China propaganda with a hidden political motive behind it.</p>
