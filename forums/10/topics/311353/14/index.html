              <p>To be frank, I like fatum argument when he mention about the many "modified" or "blackout" news  in china. True, Singapore, British or US may modify their news too but the amount of news altered in china, even the news tat is sure to be found out, is tremendous. On one hand they deny shooting any people from tibet then the very next day they say they shot some people then after tat they say they shot more people. China have lost a lot of credibility and no one take their words seriously. Tat is something china must work on</p>
              <p>If u talk about US, to be frank I don't like them to have a monopoly on controlling the world as well. If u look at Iraq, and the many people who they had killed for no good reason (they have no WMD and no link with Al Qaeda) and how they force people to go into tis war, u will realise US is no much better than China. Is the casualities in Iraq lesser than the casualties in Tibet or Tiananmen ?</p>
              <p>I don't remember the wedding party of one Iraqis family tat is bombed attacking the US army either</p>

              <p>'The Chinese government at first attempted to reform Tibet's social or religious system in Ü-Tsang. Eastern Kham and Amdo were incorporated in the provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai respectively. Western Kham was put under the Chamdo Military Committee. In these areas, <a title="Land reform" href="/wiki/Land_reform"><span style="color: #0066cc;">land reform</span></a> was implemented. This involved communist agitators designating "landlords" — sometimes arbitrarily chosen — for public humiliation in "struggle sessions." In conjunction of land reform, Chinese government abolish slavery and the Tibetan serfdom system of unpaid labor.'</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Tibet#Rule_of_the_People.27s_Republic_of_China">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Tibet#Rule_of_the_People.27s_Republic_of_China</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While china's government isn't in the right, I will not say that tibetians is a liberal country for everyone to follow where slavery is praticed until the chinese came in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And from what I've read, the PRC has improved the standard of living in tibet as compared to them ruling tibet themselves. Like some middle-eastern countries, tibetians don't seem to be living in the 20th or 21th century to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also look at this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism#Tibet_.2813th_century_until_1959.29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism#Tibet_.2813th_century_until_1959.29</a> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I doubt that letting the clergy to own basically slaves is a good thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But free tibet does not mean a better life for tibetian people. Look at Iraq now, US is screaming free Iraq a few years ago, and now, Iraq is a better country under saddam as compared to today, where it is governed by the US ( more or less).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hardly a shinning beacon of democarcy. Something, a country need a certain level of maturity before it can be given self-ruled or democracy. Same goes to most countries in africa, they are better off as colonies in UK.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of the posters are simply saying china is oppressing tibet, and assume that tibetians can have a better life if they have self-government. I'm just trying to tell them that they need to balance the issue first before yelling stuff like free-tibet.</p>

              <p>To be frank, I like fatum argument when he mention about the
              many "modified" or "blackout" news  in china. True, Singapore,
              British or US may modify their news too but the amount of news
              altered in china, even the news tat is sure to be found out, is
              tremendous. On one hand they deny shooting any people from tibet
              then the very next day they say they shot some people then after
              tat they say they shot more people. China have lost a lot of
              credibility and no one take their words seriously. Tat is something
              china must work on</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Judging from the scale of the riot. I am not surprised that more and more people will be shot. The first day, the police still can close on eye amidst the destruction of the public facilities and shops, the next day when more people involved and more destruction are done, the police must take action else they will be considered as irresponsible.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is Tibet a problematic case? Why are we discussing it now? This is because the West is making a case out of it for their political objectives. IT IS A POLITICAL STATEMENT Do not give me the crap about how they care for Tibetans and Tibetan culture and all. It takes one a pair of healthy eyes and a sane mind to see that they don’t. You may have faith in their inherent goodness. But most of us don’t. Do you honestly believe that YOU would be discussing the “miserable subjugation” of Tibetans IF THEY did not make a case out of it to begin with?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">My answer to the question “why do the white man’s faults absolve China of its wrong-doings” is predicated on the following understanding:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reality is based on interpretation and perception. International reality is contingent on political interpretation and perception. Something is not inherently right or wrong. It is right or wrong only when one interprets it to be one way or the other.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">As such, the Chinese occupation of Tibet (let’s assume for now that Chinese occupation of Tibet started only in 1950, which is not a correct assumption but it is not the crucial point here) was not a wrong-doing until the West started to make a wrong-doing INTERPRETATION out of it (for the sake of their political objective).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, the Tibetan issue is not to be interpreted and discussed in isolation but with respect to its political motivations. For that reason, there is absolutely no point in discussing the inherent right/wrong of Tibetan occupation. It must be discussed, again as I said with respect to the political objectives behind it. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Since it is a political statement, as my argument above pointed out, of course, my response to the Tibetan issue is also a political one: If you are making a case out of Tibet, I am going to make a case out of North America and Oceana so that your case of Tibet starts to sound less convincing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Once again, international reality is based on interpretation and perception, which is in turn decided by power relations. One ignores this fundamental point at one’s own folly. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">By the way, since I do not know much about nansha qundao, allow me to refrain from commenting on it. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Did you type all this just to
                  prove the point that it is ok for Western media to lie and write
                  misleading reports because Chinese government was not forthcoming
                  with news? And then you stentorianly lecture in the following
                  paragraphs that A’s wrong-doing does not absolve B’s

                  point 15 times now, I shall type out everything yet again just for
                  you .... first, read this thread's topic title ... it says free
                  tibet, not free Iraq, free palestine, or, like what our dear friend
                  here would like, free lakota ...</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I
                  would like to ask you, if a criminal was caught in the act of
                  murdering someone, would it be an admissible defense for him to
                  claim in court " Hey ! ... tis unfair ! .. why me ? ... why single
                  me out ? ... if you want to charge me with this crime, you must
                  first indict and charge every other murderer ! ... if not, this is
                  unfair treatment ! " ... even if it is indeed blantantly unfair in
                  your books ... do you think it absolves the fellow of his crime ?
                  .... makes him any less guilty ? ....</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">secondly, yet again, I would like to ask you, why
                  are you comparing your own country to one which is of such unsavory
                  repute to you ? ... comparing China to other "imperialist powers"
                  as you've put them as ... is it a tacit admissible of similar
                  behavior as those "imperialist powers", to ignore what I've
                  previously said about "learning from the good, and not the bad" ...
                  if you acknowledge that what the whites did to the natives in
                  Australia, the US, and across the new world was bad, why are you
                  trying to justify China's action by comparing the occupation Tibet
                  with these countries ....</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">China too, had suffered invasions and occupations
                  in her past, including most recently, under the japanese (which the
                  Chinese goverment and people would never let anyone forget) ....
                  one would thought that having suffered foreign occupation herself,
                  she wouldn't want to impose it on another .... but no ! ... now,
                  you think it's fair to say "tibet now belongs to China, it's a fact
                  and will never be reversed, so forget and get over it already !?!?
                  .... double standards ? ... chauvinism ? ... I think it's starting
                  to smell like fascism ....</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">and
                  just on the record ... I would like to ask you for your views on
                  the sovereignty and ownership issues of the spratley islands ...
                  who do you think owns these islands ? ...”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, I am not in favor of using
                  such simple metaphorical examples (criminals A and B etc.) to
                  illustrate something as complex as international politics and power
                  arm-twisting.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is because in international
                  politics, there is no dedicated policeman to catch criminals and
                  definitely no judge to make an impartial verdict.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">And international reality is based
                  on interpretation and perception, which in turn is decided by power
                  relations. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is Tibet a problematic case?
                  Why are we discussing it now? This is because the West is making a
                  case out of it for their political objectives. IT IS A POLITICAL
                  STATEMENT Do not give me the crap about how they care for Tibetans
                  and Tibetan culture and all. It takes one a pair of healthy eyes
                  and a sane mind to see that they don’t. You may have faith in their
                  inherent goodness. But most of us don’t. Do you honestly believe
                  that YOU would be discussing the “miserable subjugation” of
                  Tibetans IF THEY did not make a case out of it to begin
                  with?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">My answer to the question “why do
                  the white man’s faults absolve China of its wrong-doings” is
                  predicated on the following understanding:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reality is based on interpretation
                  and perception. International reality is contingent on political
                  interpretation and perception. Something is not inherently right or
                  wrong. It is right or wrong only when one interprets it to be one
                  way or the other.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">As such, the Chinese occupation of
                  Tibet (let’s assume for now that Chinese occupation of Tibet
                  started only in 1950, which is not a correct assumption but it is
                  not the crucial point here) was not a wrong-doing until the West
                  started to make a wrong-doing INTERPRETATION out of it (for the
                  sake of their political objective).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, the Tibetan issue is
                  not to be interpreted and discussed in isolation but with respect
                  to its political motivations. For that reason, there is absolutely
                  no point in discussing the inherent right/wrong of Tibetan
                  occupation. It must be discussed, again as I said with respect to
                  the political objectives behind it. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Since it is a political statement,
                  as my argument above pointed out, of course, my response to the
                  Tibetan issue is also a political one: If you are making a case out
                  of Tibet, I am going to make a case out of North America and Oceana
                  so that your case of Tibet starts to sound less
                  convincing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Once again, international reality
                  is based on interpretation and perception, which is in turn decided
                  by power relations. One ignores this fundamental point at one’s own
                  folly. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">By the way, since I do not know
                  much about nansha qundao, allow me to refrain from commenting on
                  it. </span></p>

              <p>oh no ... I posted up some very uncomfortable observations (understandably, for you), not to show you that  "<em> it's okay for western media tolie and write misleading reports</em>" but to show you why people around the world are more prepared NOT to believe in the Chinese version, simply because they didn't have a very good track record at reporting the "truth" ... just like the SARs crisis, only when people around the world started dying, did the official stance started backpedalling ? .. or, if you prefer not to remember the international food scares I Iisted above, do you believe the recent spate of fake infant milk formula scandals in china, only recently ? ....  those  were  sold in China itself mind you ... are you going to say "mei you !" too ? ... that the infants didn't die, .... I guess Tiananmen was still an uncomfortable sore point for you chaps eh ? ... or the covered up peasant riots in Guangdong and else where ? .... </p>
              <p>So if it's hard for the foreign public to believe it when the chinese goverment comes out and say that that the food exported is safe, that there were no health epidemics, how would you expect outsiders, the foreign public, to believe the official chinese line about tibet ? ... after all, people remember the tanks against students in Tiananmen ..... and all the more so when foreign reporters and visitors are now being barred from Tibet ? ... I remind you that there are no such bans in Iraq if you still want to try to deflect and point fingers .....</p>
              <p>Thus, you can thump your chest in indignation here all you want, but how are people outside really going to connect the dot for themselves ? ... so other than the people who would already be predisposed to believe because of ethnic and nationalistic pride ..... how are people going to be expected to believe in the official Chinese line in the light of these ? ...</p>
              <p>You like to use the actions of the west for example, but the fact remains that their version remains much more platable than the Chinese press, like to remember Iraq ? ... Abu Gharib ? ... Remember that it was the WESTERN PRESS that broke that story, it was the WESTERN PRESS that kept up the attention on Guantanamo, it was the WESTERN PRESS that reported all the abuses that came to light in Iraq, to quote the sources listed by indignant people here ... Such Irony, isn't it ? .... The WESTERN PRESS had no qualms about indicting their own goverment for perceived wrong doings, the people here had no qualms about quoting them here, but when negative reports on Tibet and China comes out, it all becomes a western plot ? ... don't you think there's two standards being adopted here ? ....</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">no, of course you wouldn't .. because you cannot provide a satisfactory answer to my analogy, because you know it's no defense at all, in logic or in a court, for a bully to point fingers at another bigger bully for the crimes he commited ... so now it all becomes " POWER RELATIONS", based on interpretation and peception, eh ? .... fudging and avoiding the questions ? ... power relations ... something you learnt in political education classes ? ... yes you're right, there's no real (read: powerful enough) policeman to catch the criminals, no court to pass judgement ....  else I guess Tibet would still be free ? ... so it all becomes a game of power politics to you then ? ..... </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">might .... is right ? ....</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Since you say that any debates like this should be an all encompassing discussion, again, I invite you to read up on the "spratley islands" yet again ... because there are also issues of territorial ownership and sovereignty involving China  against different countries around the region .... or you'd would still prefer NOT to commit to an answer there too ? ... or isn't it really because I may hold it up as an example of unilateral land grabbing by your goverment if you affirm chinese ownersip,  (just ike in Tibet) and pride forbades you to say otherwise ? ...  it's okay you know, while both Tibet and the Spratleys have lots of oil, there are no natives on the islands with charismatic religions leaders who may form a "clique" in exile to continously embaress the your goverment or to "instigate violence " there .....</p>

                                                  very good track record at reporting the "truth" ... just like the
                                                  SARs crisis, only when people around the world started dying, did
                                                  the official stance started backpedalling ? .. or, if you prefer
                                                  not to remember the international food scares I Iisted above, do
                                                  you believe the recent spate of fake infant milk formula scandals
                                                  in china, only recently ? ....  those  were  sold in
                                                  China itself mind you ... are you going to say "mei you !" too ?
                                                  ... that the infants didn't die, .... I guess Tiananmen was still
                                                  an uncomfortable sore point for you chaps eh ? ... or the covered
                                                  up peasant riots in Guangdong and else where ? .... </p>
              <p>So if it's hard for the foreign public to believe it when the
                                                  chinese goverment comes out and say that that the food exported is
                                                  safe, that there were no health epidemics, how would you expect
                                                  outsiders, the foreign public, to believe the official chinese line
                                                  about tibet ? ... after all, people remember the tanks against
                                                  students in Tiananmen ..... and all the more so when foreign
                                                  reporters and visitors are now being barred from Tibet ? ... I
                                                  remind you that there are no such bans in Iraq if you still want to
                                                  try to deflect and point fingers .....</p>
              <p>Thus, you can thump your chest in indignation here all you want,
                                                  but how are people outside really going to connect the dot for
                                                  themselves ? ... so other than the people who would already be
                                                  predisposed to believe because of ethnic and nationalistic pride
                                                  ..... how are people going to be expected to believe in the
                                                  official Chinese line in the light of these ? ...</p>
              <p>You like to use the actions of the west for example, but the
                                                  fact remains that their version remains much more platable than the
                                                  Chinese press, like to remember Iraq ? ... Abu Gharib ? ...
                                                  Remember that it was the WESTERN PRESS that broke that story, it
                                                  was the WESTERN PRESS that kept up the attention on Guantanamo, it
                                                  was the WESTERN PRESS that reported all the abuses that came to
                                                  light in Iraq, to quote the sources listed by indignant people here
                                                  ... Such Irony, isn't it ? .... The WESTERN PRESS had no qualms
                                                  about indicting their own goverment for perceived wrong doings, the
                                                  people here had no qualms about quoting them here, but when
                                                  negative reports on Tibet and China comes out, it all becomes a
                                                  western plot ? ... don't you think there's two standards being
                                                  adopted here ? ....</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, I am not in
                                                  favor of using such simple metaphorical examples (criminals A and B
                                                  etc.) to illustrate something as complex as international politics
                                                  and power arm-twisting.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is because
                                                  in international politics, there is no dedicated policeman to catch
                                                  criminals and definitely no judge to make an impartial
                                                  verdict.</span></span></p>

                                                  international reality is based on interpretation and perception,
                                                  which in turn is decided by power relations.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">no, of course you
                                                  wouldn't .. because you cannot provide a satisfactory answer to my
                                                  analogy, because you know it's no defense at all, in logic or in a
                                                  court, for a bully to point fingers at another bigger bully for the
                                                  crimes he commited ... so now it all becomes " POWER RELATIONS",
                                                  based on interpretation and peception, eh ? .... fudging and
                                                  avoiding the questions ? ... power relations ... something you
                                                  learnt in political education classes ? ... yes you're right,
                                                  there's no real (read: powerful enough) policeman to catch the
                                                  criminals, no court to pass judgement ....  else I guess Tibet
                                                  would still be free ? ... so it all becomes a game of power
                                                  politics to you then ? ..... </p>

                                                  ....</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Since you say that
                                                  any debates like this should be an all encompassing discussion,
                                                  again, I invite you to read up on the "spratley islands" yet again
                                                  ... because there are also issues of territorial ownership and
                                                  sovereignty involving China  against different countries
                                                  around the region .... or you'd would still prefer NOT to commit to
                                                  an answer there too ? ... or isn't it really because I may hold it
                                                  up as an example of unilateral land grabbing by your goverment if
                                                  you affirm chinese ownersip,  (just ike in Tibet) and pride
                                                  forbades you to say otherwise ? ...  it's okay you know, while
                                                  both Tibet and the Spratleys have lots of oil, there are no natives
                                                  on the islands with charismatic religions leaders who may form a

It is like using the Bible as evidence that God exists. Or citing from opoch times to justify the Falungong’s claim that there is organ harvesting of Falungong followers in China (which by the way, both the Department of State of USA and overseas Chinese dissents have discredited after their independent investigations).  All of which are unreliable because information stemming from an interest group cannot be used as unbiased evidence to support the claims made by this interest group. I am sure you know this point. Don’t you. That is why you were taking another former to task when he was citing from People’s Daily for a pro-China opinion.

Such Irony, isn't it ? .... The WESTERN PRESS had no qualms about indicting their own goverment for perceived wrong doings, the people here had no qualms about quoting them here"</span></span></p>

I do not have to answer your analogy because IT IS AN INAPPROPRIATE ONE. You cannot compare apples and oranges. International politics cannot be judged right or wrong in such a simplistic manner. If you believe it is something other than power relations and power struggles, then you are truly misinformed. </span></span></span></p>

Or else there would be no brutal oppression of Palestinians from the Israelis with the connivance of the US government. Or else there would have been no illegal invasion of Iraq and no threat of an Iran invasion. Or else, the West would leave China's problem to the Chinese.The list goes on and on.

The Mongols attacked all the way to eastern Europe, no countries on the west of China ever recorded the invasion as an invasion from China or the Yuan Dynasty. No Chinese, ancient or recent, nationalist of communist, historian or politican, ever regard any of those countries as part of China. You are the first, obviously a weirdo. Only Korea, referred to the invasion as from the Yuan dynasty from Zhong Yuan, but China also never considered Korea as part of China. You only heart of æ»¡æ±‰ä¸€å®¶äº², never æ»¡å…ƒä¸€å®¶äº². Double talk?<span>    </span></span></p>
