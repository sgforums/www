              <p>I have not seen a negative story about China and/or Tibet since the Olympic Torch was in San Francisco.
                                  It is the people who want to stir up problems between China and the US that keep digging up these old news stories.
                                  American news viewers have a very short attention span. They have already moved on.They are much more interested in the bowling skills of their future president, their favorite celebrities, and the price of gasoline.
                                  
                  I think that there would be a lot less misunderstanding  if the people of China were allowed full access to the US media the way that ALL CHINESE television stations are permitted in the United States. By seeing isolated stories it is too easy to get the wrong idea. There is more to the elephant than just his tail.</p>

              <p>Between China and the US there is the gap created by language. Not all American understand what they watch on chinese televisions and neither do al Chinese in China understand what they watch on the american TV.</p>

              <p>I agree with your statement. But I watch the English language channel (from China) everyday. And their are many more Chinese people that speak English than there are American's that speak Chinese.</p>
              <p>My point is that many people don't understand the American media because they only see small parts of it. It is too easy to make an honest mistake. Or to be intentionally misled by people wanting to make trouble.</p>
              <p>There are also Chinese language news and entertainment programs in the United States.</p>

              <p>China should really learn from the Americans...strip their prisoners, force them to play with their genitals and photograph them in the act. They should learn from the Israelis....force the tibetans out their homes and make them live in refugee camps in the Gobi Desert for the next 50 years. They should learn from the British...exile the tibetans to Australia to join their fellow British convicts. They should learn from the Germans....confine the tibetans in concentration camps and exterminate them in death chambers. They should learn from the Saudis...take the tibetan women into their harems and stone them if they commit adultery. They should learn from the japanese...make the tibetans into comfort women and use them as sex slaves.</p>
              <p>And when they have replicated what the United States, Israel, Britain, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Japan have done to foreigners in their control, perhaps China can then truly say to the world, "We have arrived!"</p>

              <p>Good point! China <strong>should learn</strong> from the Americans. The mistreatment of prisoners by the US government was exposed and made public by America's free press. Too bad the people of China and Tibet do not posses such a basic human right as freedom of speech and freedom of the press.</p>

              <p><br>Any emerging Asian power is seen as a threat to the west.America should work with China instead of instigating fear and hatred.Whoever America has made enemy with is being wooed by China and its is not that China go around to poke fire into the American interest.Fuck the American destructive foreign policy and tell them straight in the face how wrong they are in many places.</p>

              <p>An ABC News review of dozens of Rev. Wright's sermons, offered for sale by the church, found repeated denunciations of the U.S. based on what he described as his reading of the Gospels and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">treatment of black Americans</span>.</p>
              <p>"The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing 'God Bless America.' No, no, no, God damn America, that's in the Bible for killing innocent people," he said in a 2003 sermon. "God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme."</p>
              <p>In addition to damning America, he told his congregation on the Sunday after Sept. 11, 2001 that the United States had brought on al Qaeda's attacks because of its own terrorism.</p>
              <p>"We bombed Hiroshima, we bombed Nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon, and we never batted an eye," Rev. Wright said in a sermon on Sept. 16, 2001.</p>
              <p>"We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans, and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards. America's chickens are coming home to roost," he told his congregation.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Amercian could do well to listen to Rev Wright  iso  pushing their American value to other countries.</span></em></p>
