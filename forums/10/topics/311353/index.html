              Those Communist Pigs forced ppl to resort to violence.I am sure even if the protestors holding a peaceful protest,the police will still violently stop the protest.
                  
                  
              If u are the protestors,protest peacefully also get beat up,protest violently also get beat up,which method of protest will u choose?

              <p>If the Communist Party didnt brutualize the Tibetians and granted the Tibet and the Dalai Lama greater autonomy like the Pope in Rome, we wouldnt have this cycle of violence.</p>

              <p>Sure, it's bad...but it's a crime no one is innocent of. It's a fact of life. What do you think happened to Singapore? Would you like to revert this back to a fishing village to preserve it's culture too?</p>

              <p>Yeah but its not WORSE than what happened in Australia 150 years ago. Look at the plight of Aborigines now - almost completely decimated, living in almost subhuman conditions. 150 years in the future China could say its sorry what.</p>
              <p>Or it can now do or should have done is to address the economic inequalities the Tibetians face. Not interfere with their religion and not preach socialism.</p>

              <p>Yeah but its not WORSE than what happened in
              Australia 150 years ago. Look at the plight of Aborigines now
              - almost completely decimated, living in almost subhuman
              conditions. 150 years in the future China could say its
              sorry what.</p>
              <p>Or it can now do or should have done is to address the economic
              inequalities the Tibetians face. Not interfere with their religion
              and not preach socialism.</p>

              <p>So you ARE that naive. You DO think the tibetians will gain independence without violence.</p>
              <p>Erm. Have you even SEEN an Aborigine? In that twisted fantasy of yours, do they live in caves? Aborigines left in Australia are given equal, if not more rights than the average Australian. Much in the same way Malays are given special previleges in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cultures rise and cultures fall. If you want to protect cultures, let's also take to task the Tibetians for destroying cultures long past to create the one they have now. Just because an event is tragic does not mean it is not the natural course of things.</p>
              <p>Tibet IS part of China now. Has been for many years. Entire generations have been born under the current arrangement. And NOW you want to liberate Tibet?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, Singapore has had it's own violent riots. Hey I remember stories of a Malay one. Should we all leave now and return it to the native Malays? Or do you deny our presence here has had a significant impact on it's "culture"?</p>

              <p>And invasion is an invasion. It matters not if there was violence. An invasion by any other name is still an invasion. My ancestors DID move here.

              <p>LOL at your example of burning widows. Good on you. You have just raised an example of a culture that was merged with another to create new ones. The reason we don't still have it is because the traditions have interacted with others and merged.</p>
              <p>We're Asian. Our culture is mostly biased towards males. It is the influx of western culture post-feminism that affected our own, forcing a merging of ideas that led to gender equality. Would you like to revert back now? To save your dying culture?</p>

              <p>Cultures dying or mutating has nothing to do with morals. It is simply the winds of change. It is the natural order. It has no right or wrong. When a nation loses a culture, it always gains a new one. That's how it is. Like I've said many times...the Tibetians alone would probably have experienced many cultures throughout the ages that have risen and fallen to new ones. And you're so excited about saving the current one. Do you not realise it is itself responsible for destroying it's predecessor? Should we revive THAT one instead? If we trace it back far enough, Tibetians weren't even buddhists. Should we now proceed to destroy the temples there for invading the tibet culture?</p>

              <p>The plight of the Aborigines have little to do with the loss of culture. They faced discrimination for many years, and have only recently come out of the shadow. No idea why you think this is even relevant.</p>
              <p>Also, is the path to autonomy going to be non-violent? Twisting the words around will not change the fact that any change will have to result from violence.</p>
              <p>Beneficial impact on malay culture? We're talking about change here. There is no good or bad. How would you know the changes China impose on Tibet will not result in benefits?</p>
              <p>I have news for you uncle. We DID impose our ways on the malays. You see the temples and churches? The malays didn't wake up one day and decide to build them for fun. We came in and we DID change things. And that's all that matters. The native malays lost a culture and gained a new one. We are currently living in it.</p>

              <p>Yeah, coalesce and emerge as a nation. Without bloodshed. By your reasoning, Singapore should have fought a war of independence (and lost) if Malaysia didnt agree to secession.</p>
              <p>Please read my thread carefully - I dont sanction whats has happened to the Tibetians because the Westerners has committed similar atrocities in the past. But the Communist Party of China can always point to them and use them as an excuse. And they can also apologize 150 years later. What benefits does total independence bring to a landlocked, mountainous region which ultimately depends on China for trade? I dont believe in cultural genocide has to happen - the Miao people still preserve their languages, customs and etc. as do other non Han minorities.</p>
