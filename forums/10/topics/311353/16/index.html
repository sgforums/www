              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">As Chinese turtles become increasingly rare, Parham said, farmers have been turning to non-native species. Sliders and snapping turtles from the United States are a growing part of Asia's farming trade. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">Commercial-scale harvest of wild turtles in the U.S. for export to China is a growing phenomenon, subject to only minimal regulations in many areas, he noted. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">"Some of these turtles inevitably escape into the wild, potentially spreading disease or competing with native Chinese species," Parham said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">Impacts are also expected at the other end of the supply chain. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">The nonprofit World Chelonian Trust documented exports of more than 700,000 wild-caught U.S. turtles from 2003 to 2005. The majority went to Asian turtle farms and food markets. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">China's appetite for turtle soup has already reduced populations of Maryland's state reptile, the diamondback terrapin. The state legislature is now considering bills that would permanently ban commercial terrapin harvests. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">"This is definitely a growing trend, and we are very concerned about it," van Dijk said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">Parham also points to a more recent example from Texas. As reported in several newspapers, a local businessman has been recruiting assistants to help capture 300,000 wild turtles a year for export to Asia. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">A week or so into a new job in Beijing not many months ago, young American journalist Wendy Lee joined friends for a meal at a popular restaurant in the Chinese capital.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The California native's Chinese was a bit rusty, so when time came to order her meal she let one of her friends pick the dish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The waiter came back carrying a live turtle in a bag and showed it to us," Lee recalled last week during a gathering of journalists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The turtle was to be the main course of the group dinner, she learned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Later, in Hong Kong, Lee discovered a popular dessert, often sold on the street, that "looks like brown Jello, but doesn't taste like it," has ground turtle shell as one of its ingredients.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Turtle, as Lee came to realize during her stay in China, is a hugely popular dish in this largest of Asian nations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And that popularity coupled with a thriving China's integration into the world economy has created trouble for Texas turtles.</span></p>
              <h3 style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">A drain on population</span></strong></span></h3>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Many of the turtles being consumed in China today come from Texas waterways. And that drain on Texas turtle population has wildlife managers, biologists and others with interest in natural resources concerned about the impact of the nearly unregulated harvest on the state's wild turtles. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Demand for turtles as food has stripped China of its wild turtle populations. So, while commercial turtle farms are springing up in the country, much of the demand for food turtles is being met through importing turtles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Texas has become a source of that supply.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">For the past several years, tens of thousands of Texas turtles have annually been collected from the wild and shipped, live, to the Far East where they've ended up on plates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to admittedly imprecise data collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department through its eight-year-old non-game permit system, an average of about 95,000 wild-caught Texas turtles annually are being collected or purchased by dealers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Some of those turtles — diamondback terrapins, box turtles — are destined for the domestic and international pet trade.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">But the majority — common snapping turtles, softshells, musk and mud and map turtles and red-eared sliders — are fated for the food market.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Data collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which monitors export of wildlife, documented 256,638 Texas turtles exported through the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, alone, from 2002-05.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The majority of those quarter-million turtles were "food" turtles.This development of the turtle trade caught Texas wildlife officials somewhat by surprise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We are moving into an area where there is a demand — a seemingly unlimited demand — for a resource that wasn't there, before," Matt Wagner, director of TPWD's wildlife diversity program, told the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission at an April 4 meeting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Turtles — with the exception of a handful of species, such as sea turtles, designated as endangered or threatened — fall into the broad category of "non-game" wildlife under Texas law.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And Texas law long has put few, if any, restrictions on taking of non-game wildlife.</span></p>

              <p>You could do all you can to try to put me down (saying that we have low self-esteem or whatever), but the piece I wrote provides  convincing evidence that the Western media is biased as far as reporting on China is concerned. I have provided my argument from three angles: analysis of the articles themselves, provision of opinions from an overseas Chinese resident, citing from a third-party media (Straits Times, namely). You could continue to divert  attention with your anti-China diatribe but that does not affect the veracity of my argument with respect to Western media. </p>
              <p>It is often times the case that when Chinese opinions are not heard, people in the West censures the Chinese government for suppressing its people's freedom of speech. However, when we do speak up but when our opinions diverge from the Western perspective on our own country, we are summarily accused of "brain-washed" or "spreading government propaganda". Oh well... </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The general intelligence, mental capacity and sense of social justice of both the mainland and overseas Chinese is quickly dismissed by the West when our opinions do not echo their views on our own country</span>. Apparently only Chinese dissidents have the  the ability to "think" or to "use one's mind" (to quote your phrase). The rest of us are just, well, mind-less.  </p>
              <p>This observation is shared by an independent American blogger who wrote an entry on the recent spate of Chinese netizens exposing Western media's bias and inappropriate manipulation of evidence.  He noted that the opinions from the Chinese netizens are hardly acknowledged by Western media and are quickly dismissed as "government campaigns". He writes:</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Some of the western media outlets picking up the bias story are doing so explicitly to debunk it. Michael Bristow’s piece in the BBC is especially interesting. He notes that “Individual Chinese have also vented their anger in internet chatrooms about these so-called biased reports. They have also been contacting foreign journalists directly – sometimes with threatening messages.” At the same time, he argues that “The criticism appears part of a wider campaign by the Chinese government to make sure its version of events in Tibet and elsewhere is the dominant one.” . <span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In other words, there may be angry Chinese citizens contacting BBC reporters to complain about their coverage, but they’re being controlled by Chinese state media</span></span>."</span></span></p>
              <p>He goes on to remark that this presents a sharp contrast with how Western bloggers are perceived when they try to "<span style="font-style: italic;">debunk errors in media stories<span style="font-style: normal;">": </span></span></p>
              <p>"<span style="font-style: italic;">This is a pretty fascinating contrast to the way western media has reported on blog efforts to debunk errors in media stories. <span style="font-style: normal;">While some reporters have complained about the “pajamahadeen“,  bloggers have also been lionized for their fact-checking functions. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems slightly unfair to assume that Chinese bloggers are incapable of the same techniques of press criticism that their western counterparts have pioneered, or that Chinese bloggers can’t be genuinely upset about what they see as unfair Western critique</span></span></span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">." </span></p>
              <p>Without committing himself to the truth claims made by Chinese netizens, he sharply points our how the West has largely turned a deaf ear to the voices from "other parts of the world" (China, that is, in this particular case): </p>
              <p>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Let me once again remind readers (some of whom are already angrily composing comments to me) that I’m not attempting to evaluate the truth claims of these critiques. I’m surprised, however, by how little traction they’re receiving and how quickly they’re being dismissed by some of the reporters who are being criticized. My point is not that Western media is misinterpreting the Tibet situation<span style="font-weight: bold;"> - it’s a much larger point that people in general are pretty dumb about how people in other parts of the world are seeing events… even when those people are writing in English, telling us precisely how they see the situation</span></span>". </p>

              <p>Another point: there is no doubt that the Chinese government restricts its citizens' freedom of speech. That is a point some of you have picked up again and again. I have absolutely no intention to defend the Chinese government on this. It is rather indefensible from a human rights point of view. </p>
              <p>Some of you have also prided yourself on the freedom of speech enjoyed by Singaporeans. As one of you remarked proudly: "<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Do you not think that all of us here will be Jail in Speaker Corners!!! and if this has not been reported do we know.<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">" </span></span></p>
              <p>Well, I do solute the Singaporean government for allowing an admirable latitude to its citizens as far as speaking freely is concerned and I hope the Chinese government will catch up on this front in their fervor to "learn from Singapore".</p>
              <p>WITH THAT SAID, it did not prevent Western media from censuring the Singapore government for limiting freedom of speech in the country. In fact, as far as I know, Singapore does not fare very well in terms of some international evaluations of media freedom. </p>
              <p>My point here is not to try to put down Singapore. The point is that they (the West) will never stop to harass anyone who cannot do things in an ABSOLUTE accordance with their standards. </p>
              <p>And that I find just repulsive... </p>

              <p>the olympic torch relay now has become a farce. the incidences that happened in london and paris is threatening the beijing games itself. look at the number of body guards and security surrounding the runner. might as well not run.</p>
              <p>potentially, the protests could climax in august. i seriously think china got a problem in its hand. instead of showcasing its better side, it potentially has a ticking bomb waiting to explode in a few months time.</p>

              <p>So what I said previously was proven.....this whole Tibet thing is just a tool for some people who have issues with Sinophobia to throw things at China.</p>
              <p>If you want to say bad things about China, perhaps it is time u should re-evaluate urself, Sir.</p>
              <p>Do a little reflection and self-examination. Your mind is filled with narrow-minded prejudice, hatred, and group stereotypes. If you care so much about the 'right thing', first and foremost clear ur own mind first.</p>

              <p>I read a few posts here where people say they support self-determination for Tibetan people.</p>
              <p>I have a little problem with this logic....</p>
              <p>OK....how should I put it....</p>
              <p>Tibet, is part of China.</p>
              <p>If you want to support referendum, that means u care about the feelings and opinions of the Tibetan people..? Ok.</p>
              <p>But how about the feelings and opinions of the people in Shanghai, in Beijing, in other places...?</p>
              <p>You dont care about their feelings and opinions..?</p>
              <p>Why I put forward such logic...because Tibet is part of China. Tibet is inside China. Every Chinese own as much of each inch of Tibet, as a Tibetan, or anyone else from other provinces.</p>
              <p>Someone from Shanghai also have a stake in Tibet, just as much as someone from Tibet has a stake in Shanghai.</p>
              <p>A Shanghainese own Tibet, as part of his or her homeland.</p>
              <p>A Tibetan own Shanghai, as part of his or her homeland.</p>
              <p>The whole country is called China.</p>
              <p>So, I have a little problem when people say, I support for referendum, or self-determination, independence. This view inherently disregard the feeling of unity of many people inside China. Why should a group of people enjoy a special priviledge or a special status over the majority..?</p>
              <p>Can I, for instance, put this logic to u...</p>
              <p>Let's say a family stay in a house...They are all united as a family...each member of the family own the house, the land they are in...it is their home..</p>
              <p>Can someone, a son, say, I want to separate this room for myself only, all others are not allowed in, or....I want to run this room with my own rules, I want to be independent, separate...</p>
              <p>OK...maybe some people sympathize with this son, but that sympathy disregard the feeling of the other family members. Why should he be allowed to split the house...? What about the feeling of other family members who want to keep united under one roof..?</p>
              <p>He can go to any other rooms, and he owns each inch of the house as much as anyone else, and so does everyone else own a part of any rooms. If he want to split and separate a room for himself, what about others..? They are not people too..? Their feelings dont count..?</p>
              <p>I say, if this errant son want to force his way, it is only right that the father discipline him, and maintain unity and family order.</p>

              <p>He can go to any other rooms, and he owns each inch of the house as much as anyone else, and so does everyone else own a part of any rooms. If he want to split and separate a room for himself, what about others..? They are not people too..? Their feelings dont count..?</p>
              <p>I say, if this errant son want to force his way, it is only right that the father discipline him, and maintain unity and family order.</p>

              <p>MP, i am neither a supporter nor anti-supporter of the current tibet movement. i find that your analogy make a critical assumption that the errant son is a biological child of the parent. what if this so-called errant son is `forced' into the family (for whatever reason) and not biological? having been forced to assimilate into the family (despite being fed &amp; clothed), this person wants out now. i think the view point is then blurred.</p>
              <p>i did not follow the entire discussion here of the detractors and supporters of the free tibet movement/initiative, but i think the critical point here is the inability to unequivocally put a marker(proof) on the sand on when indeed we should consider in history if tibet is part of china or not.</p>
              <p>the soviet union `empire' collapsed years back. the only difference i see here if that the chinese communist is not able to accept any other reality because of the this thing very chinese, called `face', or fear of losing face.</p>

              <p>i am not so certain about this comparison. circumstantial evidence, common grounds or factors of convenience cannot justify a claim. in any case, i do not wish to get into a prolong discussion over this, as i mentioned, i am neutral to this tibeten fight. i just want to highlight some strong assumptions you made in your points, that' all, because those sways the discussion to where you want it to be.</p>

              <p>If we want to look at the history, and the concept of this idea of 'house' , and 'son' , the concept of a country, and whether a group of people is 'forced' to be a son, then this is a perfectly valid comparison, and I make a highlight of this point, and definitely it is not as a 'convinience'.</p>

              <p>The boy may not be born of the family, but when the boy was born, he could not survive the harse environment so the family came to help, he wasn't forced into the family, he grew up, fed and kept warm in the family. Then the family became poor and the boy, by then grown up, wanted to leave. That was the first time the family used force.</p>
              <p>It was way before this century, Tibet was already part of China. China actually installed tibetans administrator giving it autonomous administrative authority. Under the Qing Dynasty, China sent 2 military expeditions to protect Tibet against invading nepalese and mongols. It was in the early 50s when China became communists when some tibetans wanted independence. </p>
              <p>Today there are Bhutan people outside of Bhutan wanting the king to step down, even when the king was preparing to hold the first ever election. Election in Nepal is marred by the separatists who are nepalese. Today everywhere there are people who don't like their government. The question is, do the Tibetans in exile now represent the wishes of all Tibetans? I doubt so. Today, tibetans are not only in Tibet, but also in many provinces in China. Will all tibetans go back to tibet if the current tibet province becomes independent? I doubt so. </p>
              <p>Countries in the west like to think by supporting tibatans they are supporting freedom, but the chinese remember that it was exactly the same countries, the british, american, the french, who tried to tear china into pieces just before the fall of Qing Dynasty. I don't blame China for being suspicious of the motive of some countries in the west.</p>
              <p>It would be wise for all to separate politics from sports and let olympics go on smoothly. It is to nobody's benefit by creating trouble for olympics, definitely tibet will not become independent. Olympics is important to China, in its effort to rejoin the world community. It is not that important for China to give up Tibet for it.</p>

              <p>Man....I dont want to talk about turtles, I like animals too,  that is not what Im complaining, but the point I'm saying is, it is different when someone/ some groups point a torchlight to shine the ugly spots of other people.

If you tell me the racial group or religious group of which that article writer belong to, I can probably come up with a similar article shining a light to an ugly spot.</p>
              <p>We all have ugly spots and pretty spots. We all can look ugly or beautiful. We are all humans.</p>
              <p>This concept is perhaps whats lost by certain people.</p>

              <p>The planet is not getting any bigger,  the demands of all goods and services have increase.  chinese globally need to seriously think about its action and share the global responsiblilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> China already has 5000 yrs of history, Buddist is part of chinese regligion  if the communist hasn't figure out how to negociate peacefully with tibet. What make you think they will!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me put it this way tibet will always be struggling for freedom. (Not to mention the tibetian pysche re-incarnate itself) At somepoint buddish monk globally will come out to the street and protest just like what they did in Myanmar</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You seriously think China has a chance. Unless you burn out all the Chinese Temper. But the minute they burn themselved infront of the camera. China lost the struggle forever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But as I mention the Greaterest lost isn't about tibet or china. The greaterest lost to mankind is about humanity.</p>

              <p>Ya lor, smells like horseshit.
              We must beware of instigators, agitators, propagandists, provocateurs, zealots, charlatans and crackpots.</p>
