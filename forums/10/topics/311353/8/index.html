              I dont think USA will become facist state,becoz they atleast got 2 powerful parties competing each other in the parliamentary seats during each election.
              
              While Communist China are dominated by only one party,Communist party,and there is no such thing as general election in the country.So to me,Communist China will more likely to become a facist nation just like Germany in WW2 than the U.S.            <blockquote>

              <p>"or you is it as you said, democracy for Singapore, but not China, or tibet"</p>
              <p>If I am not mistaken, the thread is not Chinese democracy but "Free Tibet" (Tibetian independence). Chinese democracy is another can of worms as PRC is political sensitive to it.</p>
              <p>Can you imagine going to the internet and you are blocked from websites with the words Chinese democracy (in Chinese as well)? </p>
              <p>"why else defend what cannot be defended ?"</p>
              <p>I guess you have chosen to ignore the rest of the forummers here who give their reasoned opinions on why Tibet should not secede. Even USA does not call for that.</p>
              <p>On the issue of racial IDENTITY, like it or not, regardless of what you believe in, if you are Han Chinese, you step foot into Llhasa few days ago, you are targeted. Same like Caucausians by Islamic terrorists. Or if a person (especially male) ethnically Chinese American works for the US government, he would be presumed disloyal.</p>
              <p>Personally if the violence had gotten any worse, I would have hoped that some people would organize a gathering calling for restraint from all sides, instead of "Free Tibet".</p>

              <p>in case you didn't read the title of this thread, it says "Free tibet"... not free kashmir ... you are really trying the same old trick of pointing fingers at other people doing the same thing aren't you ... for the 12th time ... saying that others are doing the same thing doesn't absolve one of one's own crime ? ... if you're interested, prove it and start a new thread ... not to start spouting here when you're trying prove there there's some sort of bias or hidden agenda in the reporting ...</p>
              <p>chinese media reporting you said ? ...</p>
              <p>try this article .... reprinted from the AFP</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">BEIJING - PRO-TIBET activists said on Wednesday they have been
              bombarded with abusive phone calls and virus emails as they try to
              contact witnesses in Tibet and nearby amid a clampdown following
              anti-Chinese riots.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Matt Whitticase, from the Free Tibet Campaign, said he had received
              calls every two minutes from 4.00 am to 7.00 am on Tuesday in London to
              his mobile number and also at his work number.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'Of course I have no way of saying who the calls were from, but a
              variety of callers (from British mobile numbers) had Chinese accents,'
              he said in an email.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The content was crude, abusive and highly anti-Tibetan in nature. The
              calls also contained the sort of patriotic Chinese music you used to
              hear on Chinese trains and in public places.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'It seemed that the intention was to stop me from working and from making calls.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Lhadon Tethong, director of Students for a Free Tibet, told
              reporters that their New York office had also received abusive calls
              from people speaking Chinese, and added that they had received viruses
              via email.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'We are getting virus attacks that are just shameless... claiming to
              be desperate people inside Tibet. The emails are well-written and
              emotional pleading for us to open the images,' she told reporters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">One other group, which did not want to be identified, told reporters
              its computers had been compromised by virus attacks over the last few
              days.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">AFP received an email on Tuesday from someone claiming to be in
              Denmark, who had attached a file they said were pictures of Tibetans
              shot by the Chinese army. When AFP tried to open the attachment a virus
              warning appeared.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The groups are trying to contact people inside Tibet and the
              surrounding regions to try to find witness accounts of deadly violence
              that has erupted there in the past few days amid anti-Chinese protests.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Journalists, rights groups and activists are being prevented from
              gaining access to almost every part of China where protests are
              reported to have taken place. -- AFP</span></p>
              <p>go on, call all these untrue if you like, call them lies, fakes, fabrications or what not ... but the fact is that tibet is now closed to outsiders, if there is nothing to hide, there's no need to ban .... so it is obvious which version has more credibility ....</p>
              <p>or, like our friend SGdiehard there, says "go on ! ... did you see anybody shot ? ... what evidence ? .. no evidence ! ".... </p>
              <p>of course not ... not when journalists are banned from going anywhere near the troubles ... how convenient eh ... before you want to do any dirty deeds ... get the reporters away first ... rule number one of any totalitarian regime ....</p>
              <p>as for those phone calls and those virus attacks ... I sincerely hope that it's the work of Chinese intelligence and their secret police .... I'd feel much better if it's the workings of a goverment hell-bent on any sort of criticisms, than ordinary citizens unhappy about the tibetans .... because if it's just ordinary chinese citizens doing all these things, I'll start thinking back to those jack-booting Nazi youths of old, or those jihadist hard core islamic militants, do people see the eerie similarity here ? .... ..... and we are witnessing the emergence of a rabid closed minded nationalistic streak ... and the chinese super power is going to be the biggest bully in the neighbourhood in the future .... already, we have people writing something like this below ..</p>
              <p>quoted word for word from the forumer ironbutcherer over at the other thread ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Hi, I am from China. Many good points you have raised,
                                      deathbait! Thank you for representing a sane voice amongst some
                                      less enlightened opinions in this forum.  It never is a
                                      coincidence that the trouble in Tibet is climbing up at this point,
                                      just a few months away from the Olympics. It is part of the scheme
                                      on the part of Western politicians to further smear the image of
                                      China and trying everything they can do wreak havoc in China,
                                       for the sake of their own political objective. Tibetans are
                                      unfortunately a gullible lot, allowing themselves to be used by
                                      anti-Chinese Westerners for the political agenda of the
                                      latter. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">It amazes me that some people are so quick at pointing fingers
                                      at our government for the alleged "cultural assimilation", without
                                      understanding that the "Tibetan culture", as you rightly put it, is
                                      one characterized by slavery. If it is another country that
                                      liberated the Tibetan people from the imprisonment of slavery, they
                                      would probably credited with helping the advancement of a
                                      people/civilization. But not if it is China. Because it is China,
                                      because we represent a different ideology, the West would
                                      consistently and persistently find fault with us even when there is
                                      none. Their objective is clear: to demonize China and continually
                                      pressurize China so that it eventually comes to collapse. But you
                                      know what? All this unjustified and abrasive China-bashing just
                                      hardens our (the common Chinese nationals) resolve that Communism
                                      does need to stay, for lack of a better countering ideology to the
                                      hypocritical West. I am not even a fan of communism. But the West
                                      is helping make it popular amongst us, ironically. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">So it is never about Tibet. It never has been. I doubt the
                                      red-haired barbarians truly cared about the well-being of another
                                      people. It is their political objective,
                                       their perennial desire to conquer the
                                      world with their own ideology and their way of doing things that
                                      compelled them to indulge in this never-ending  China-bashing
                                      orgy. Sadly some less informed Singaporeans / red-hair wannabes are
                                      too eager to join them...</span></p>
              <p>I am still shocked by the kind of things written in the passage above .... red-haird barbarians, red-haired wannabes, anti-chinese westerners, gullible tibetans ... and this is already the post-edited version ... wow .. kind of reminds you of those chaps from the Taleban doesn't it ? .... imagine such views to be representative of the people of the most populous country on earth ... with rising military and economic might, and, as we have seen, the will to use them on other countries and peoples ....</p>
              <p>once again .... for the last time ... if one's conscience is clear, then there is nothing to fear when there's knocking at the doors in the middle of the night ... if there's nothing to hide, there's no reason to be afraid of any criticisms ...</p>

              <p>does anyone here actually realise China has no reason to be democratic?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously. They have a working form of government. Why should they be democratic? Because we are? That's the kind of thinking that led to the Iraq occupation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, Tibet was never a democracy.</p>
