It might become more fascist in the future if there is no equivalent powerful nation to strike a balance with it.<br>They themselves going around the whole world using weapon of massive destruction including chemical weapon to invade different countries with all sort of excuse. Just the 10 year Iraq sanction alone has already killed 1 million of kids. Not to mention those who killed in the war, and worse those who survived and tortured by them. Plus the permenant damage to their economy as well as our oil price.<br>This is only Iraq, how abt many countries worldwide, how abt the Vietnamese that was born retarded as a result of the chemical weapon dropped by US democratic army.</p>

              <p>Mao Ze Dong indeed has done a lot of bad things to the country. But that shouldn't be a reason for the country to disintegrate into pieces.<br>Whether a citizen like the leader or the government or not, he shouldn't use the leader as an excuse of doing something harmful to the country. If you don't want to be part of this country, you can always fill up the forms and migrate. Simple.<br><br>The son of china late leader Deng Xiao Ping was a victim in the cultural evolution, and was thrown from a building to 1st floor causing him crippled. But that doesn't made Deng Xiao Ping any less patriotic. Did he go back his hometown and declare independence? No. He still love the nation so much and try his very best to revitalize the country.<br><br>Tibet is already part of China since Yuan dynasty. The china emperors or the modern government now could have done what the americans has done to massacre the red indians till no more sound to fight for independence.<br>Can you imagine how scary it is, the red indian continent was occupied by red indian, but within few decades the american democratic soldier has killed them until no sound is heard at all by us.<br><br>China didn't do the samething, I really compliment that.</p>

              <p><strong>Who needs unrest in Tibet?</strong></p>
              <p>MOSCOW. (RIA Novosti international commentator Ivan Zakharchenko)
              -Tibetans trying to preserve their culture and traditions deserve
              respect, but that can hardly justify the recent unrest in Lhasa and
              other Chinese cities. The recent unrest was obviously a case of
              inter-ethnic strife.</p>
              <p>Tibetans were simply beating the Chinese who recently moved to the
              region. These are ethnic Chinese of the Han ancestry, which form the
              majority of the population in China. It was strange to read world media
              reports about peaceful demonstrations by monks, which nonetheless left
              behind destroyed shops and cars.</p>
              <p>When similar riots took place in the suburbs of Paris, nobody called
              them peaceful demonstrations. A CNN blog quoted a young woman as saying
              that she landed in the hospital after being beaten by a crowd of
              Tibetans just for being a Chinese.</p>
              <p>The Chinese Xinhua news agency reported 13 deaths and about 300 local
              fires due to the unrest. The Dalai Lama's supporters claim that eighty
              have died and 72 have been wounded.</p>
              <p>Passive on-lookers always have their likes and dislikes. Many Western
              politicians have called on the Chinese authorities to display
              restraint, but nobody has urged Tibetans to stop beating the Chinese.</p>
              <p>With Hollywood's help, Tibet has long had a reputation of a magical
              land, a dream for lovers of exotic destinations and a place where one
              can reach "spiritual enlightenment." In Western mentality, this
              benevolent stereotype contrasts with Chinese communist ideology.</p>
              <p>The Tibetan separatists are seeking independence from China. Beijing
              considers the exiled Dalai Lama a separatist as well. He is the Tibetan
              spiritual leader and enjoys high prestige among the Buddhists all over
              the world. He says that he is not striving for Tibet's independence,
              but for broad autonomy, but Beijing finds it difficult to understand
              the existence of the Tibetan government in exile. The Dalai Lama has
              promised to resign as its head if the riots continue, and urged both
              the authorities and Tibetans to avoid violence.</p>
              <p>Until recently, the government in exile did not disassociate itself
              from the violent actions by the radicals, which reaffirmed Beijing's
              apprehensions.</p>
              <p>Gennady Chufrin, deputy director of the Institute of World Economy and
              International Relations (IMEMO) at the Russian Academy of Sciences,
              expressed the following view: "Although the Dalai Lama does not demand
              independence, his supporters include radicals who are largely
              responsible for making the dialogue with the Chinese authorities
              impossible."</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama is an old man. By tradition, after his death a successor
              to his position is chosen by searching for his reincarnation among
              newborn babies. However, the press reported last November that the
              Dalai Lama suggested a referendum on changing the age-old ritual, and
              allowing the incumbent to choose his successor.</p>
              <p>Some experts believe that using his religious authority in the world,
              the Dalai Lama has gone beyond spiritual leadership, and taken an
              active role in politics. They see this as the root of the problem.</p>
              <p>Recent unrest in Tibet has come as a surprise to many analysts. In the
              last few years, the Chinese government has invested huge funds into the
              Tibet Autonomous Region; it has conducted talks with the Dalai Lama's
              envoys, and given many freedoms to the Buddhist clergy.</p>
              <p>There are two factors that may explain why the riots have taken place
              now - the Beijing Olympics in August, and the unilateral declaration of
              Kosovo's independence. For many years, the Western-supported Albanian
              separatists were fighting for the cessation of this province with the
              now predominantly Albanian population from Serbia. Recently, Kosovo has
              been recognized by the United States, United Kingdom, and some other
              Western countries.</p>
              <p>Knowing that Beijing cannot afford any aggravations on the eve of the
              Olympics, the Tibetan separatists might have also used anti-Chinese
              attitudes for staging riots. Some observers believe that the recent
              violence in Tibet was provoked in order to fan up inter-ethnic strife
              in China and emphasize its problems before the Olympics.</p>
              <p>There is one more factor - the Taiwanese presidential elections slated
              for March 22, and a referendum on the self-governed island's entry into
              the United Nations as an independent state. Presidential nominees are
              already using the Tibetan situation in their election campaigns.</p>
              <p>But no provocation would have worked if everything in Tibet were in
              order. Recently, this henceforth deserted Himalayan region has been
              flooded by Han people that are good at sales and business. This may
              have caused discontent of the local population and resulted in the
              periodic attacks on the newcomers, but this situation is typical not
              only for China.</p>
              <p>Alexander Larin, a leading research fellow at the Institute of Far
              Eastern Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, noted the
              importance of the fact that Beijing has allowed national minorities to
              freely perform their religious rites, and promoted the economic
              development of this mountainous region. He believes that the recent
              outbreak of violence could have been caused by some difficulties in
              relations between the local authorities and the Tibetan population,
              mostly monks.</p>
              <p>Lack of information makes it difficult to be more specific. Foreign
              access to information is very limited; the authorities have blocked
              many Tibetan web sites for fear that some imprudent reports may further
              escalate the violence.</p>
              <p>The Chinese government has emphasized that the police and the army have
              not used force against the rioters; some monks deliberately wounded
              each other and then took photos to stir a sensation. Usually, such
              pictures produce the desired effect.</p>
              <p>Although the situation in Tibet is difficult, experts believe that it
              will not spiral out of control, and that the Chinese government will
              find a way of settling it before the Olympics.</p>

              <p>What was the reason for emptying Pulau Ubin of all the villages - when since 1819, there were peaceful Singaporeans [of all ethnicity] enjoying a low cost of living - in a rural setting - away from the high cost of mainland Singapore ?</p>
              <p>What good is Pulau Ubin to Singapore, especially when the granite quarry on Pulau Ubin had dug itself so deep - in the middle of the island - that it was dangerously below the sea level ?</p>
              <p>Did the residents in Pulau Ubin demanded independence from Mainland Singapore, as they lead a life that is totally different from others in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Will the call for independence of Pulau Ubin ''by the residents of Pulau Ubin'' affect the integrity of the Republic of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>What will happen if those in Jurong decide to be autonomous and declare independence ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately for the Tibetans, from historical records - they were less resourceful, less political motivated, less determined in fighting for independence.</p>
              <p>The Vietnamese - who are ethnically closer to the Han Chinese - were under the rule of China for more then a thousand years; and throughout history, there have been uprising and moves to cut the Emperor's gripping rule from a thousand miles away.</p>
              <p>Different Emperors of China had to send repeated military expeditions to suppress the rebellion from its southern provinces of Vietnam and Yunan; and it was not till the arrival of European colonialist that China was carved up and held separately for more than 100 years.</p>
              <p>After WW2, those parts of China that were seen to be important to the European colonialists were tightly held, while those of less consequence were relinquished to local political controls during the withdrawal of the Europeans.</p>
              <p>The Tibetans - including the Dalai Lhama - are not seeking independence from China, and are prepared to govern themselves as an autonomous region, similar to the HongKong arrangement.</p>
              <p>It is surprising that Beijing is not making much efforts to offer the same ''HongKong'' arrangement to the Tibetans, and more tight fisted towards the Tibetans.</p>
              <p>Does the Beijing Government look at Tibetans differently - preferring the Hans to be more efficient, capable, and ethnically superior than the Tibetans ?</p>

                                      offer the same ''HongKong'' arrangement to the Tibetans, and

              <p>The reason is simple.</p>
              <p>The dalai lama is viewed as a trouble maker and foreign agent.</p>
              <p>Which is true. He is a foreign agent.</p>
              <p>Allow Tibet HK style rule and this lama's ambitions to split Tibet off from china will grow.</p>
              <p>And his western backers will support him.</p>
              <p>That is why no HK arrangement.</p>
