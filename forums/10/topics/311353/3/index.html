              <p>Tibet was ruled by emperors for many decades but was invaded by Dzungars, the mongols in 1717. Emperor Kangxi sent two military expedition to drive the mongols out in 1718 and 1720, and installed the 7th Dalai Lama with administrative power in 1751. 1788 and 1791, Tibet was invaded twice by the Nepalese who were repelled by the Qing Government. In 1904, with the decline of the Qing dynasty, the British invaded Tibet forcing a treaty to allow free flow of British and Indian traders into Tibet. Since when tibet was a sovereign country until China invaded it in 1950?</p>

              <p>My friends...</p>
              <p><br>Please stop using the word 'invasion'.</p>
              <p>This has really bad connotation, and it means u have implicitly swallowed the Western propaganda.</p>
              <p>It is the same by labelling someone as a 'terrorist' or 'freedom figther'. One way means u have taken the perspective of one particular side and not objective anymore.</p>
              <p>Why not say 'Invasion' ?</p>
              <p>My friends, an invasion is when USA troops invade Iraq. It is a clear example when a sovereign country, thousands of miles away, an ocean away, with different race, religion, language, and history, is invaded by another sovereign country. That is invasion my friends. By any objective means we can call it an 'invasion'.</p>
              <p>But how can u call Chinese troops moving to its own territory in its homeland and launching military operations as 'invasion' ?</p>
              <p>Maybe you dont realize this, but dont be fooled by some terms, because it means u have taken the perspective of what some propagandaist want u to believe.</p>
              <p>Another one, just read any Western media in the past few days. All of them describe the rioting mobs there as 'protesters' or 'demonstrators'. Just read, I dont bluff you. Read. Not a single one describe them objectively as 'rioters', or maybe even 'mobs' , which is exactly the accurate and correct term by any measure.</p>
              <p><br>Protesters..? My friends, protesters are people who hold placards peacefully, protesters are like Chee Suan Juan holding placards, at least he is peaceful, that can be called 'protesters'.</p>
              <p><br>I didnt want to talk so much about this, but maybe I say it out now, what makes me really uncomfortable watching the news lately is because those mobs and rioters, they target Han Chinese. They beat them, burn shops, loot, and also, they victimized other non-Tibetans like Muslim Huis.</p>
              <p>What is this..? Protestors..? Demonstrators..?</p>
              <p>That is like calling soccer hooligans as 'sport supporters' when they make riots. Just call them hooligans, and now, in this case, just call them rioters. In fact they are racists rioters. They are the worst type of rioters in this world. It was an ethnic riot. Analysts and so on comment on politics, history, etc, but nobody talk much about the racial aspect.</p>
              <p>Come on now....I give u some straight talk now my friends....u see those young men in their twenties when they riot....do u think they think so much about politics, autonomy, and so on..? I tell u what I believe.......this is a classic case of socio-economic and/ or  racial riot. Local Tibetans riot against lighter skinned and richer Han Chinese, and other non ethnic group of their own. This is no different than some riot in USA between blacks and whites, or recently in France, Paris suburb between Northern Africans and the whites there. In our region we saw other similar riot, in Indonesia and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Why people dont talk about this race aspect...?</p>
              <p>I tell u one more thing....</p>
              <p>I in fact think the Chinese government has been far too lenient. 3 days of rioting, why..?? China has been far too lenient and careful, and mindful of international attention, especially Olympics is near, I think they are being too soft. Actually in any government, the duty is to protect the soveirgnty of the country and ensure safety to life and property of its citizens.</p>
              <p>So, I think the government should in fact enforce the law and order, much more forcefully, and it should.</p>

              <p>Oh, I forgot one more thing...</p>
              <p>Please...when u start to use the term 'communists', please check urself and think what you are doing.</p>
              <p><br>You are swallowing again a piece of propaganda.</p>
              <p>Why are you terming or calling someone 'communist' ?</p>
              <p>Maybe I use an example,</p>
              <p>Imagine if someone who live in another country, under a different system, call someone else a 'capitalist pig'.</p>
              <p>Please think for awhile, what is the perspective of that person?</p>
              <p>He has been brainwashed to think of 'capitalists' as bad people, just as u have when u start to use the term 'communists' to refer to certain people.</p>
              <p>This is another example of what I want to point out, Start reading Western news media report. Many of them would use the term 'communist' such as for instance describing 'communist leadership'. I dont bluff you. Read it.</p>
              <p>Why is it they want to emphasize the word 'communist' ? What do u think..?</p>
              <p>And what is ridiculous here is that some people actually have fallen to their propaganda and start labeling them as 'communist' as well. Here in sgforums.</p>
              <p>Quite sad.</p>

              <p>are you saying "why blame me, the world is picking on me, for something someone else also did in the past, therefore you must have a hidden agenda" ? .... like those reports about food scares and what not ? ... so people who are ranting against hormones laden luncheon meat have hidden agendas ? .....</p>
              <p>from what you've been posting in this thread, i wonder if you're Singaporean .... and if not, i wonder what is YOUR hidden agenda judging from the kind of posts you have been putting up in this forum  ...... you call all that anti-chinese propaganda ? ...

Tibetan friends told her that they are in no way equal citizens of the PRC ... there are many restrictions on them ... for example, they must obtain special permissions to travel overseas, which are granted only after stringent scrutiny .... and they are not allowed to travel to india, where the dalai lama resides, and the tibetans are being edged out of their country due to massive influxes of han chinese in recent years (sounds familiar ? ) ....</p>
              <p>if the chinese goverment regard that region as an integral part of the country .... why the kind of restrictions on the native tibetans ? ..... this is not how a country treats her own citizens ... this is how countries treat the people of a conquered land ....</p>

              <p>i think if the majority of the people think like that up there ... then China has the greatest potential of all countries in the world to become the next fascist state a la Japan of WWII ... is tibet just the appetizer ? ...</p>

              <p>or are you going to tell me nobody's killed, it's all a "western hegemonist ploy" as well ? ....</p>
              <p>how are you going to justify these killings of civilians ? ... are you going to say that hey ! ... it's China's problem, or, again, it's a western powers instigated plot to descredit china during the olympics ("teacher teacher, why you never catch other people, no fair ! ) .... or what ? ... or are you going to make no moral assertions, saying it's neccessary for china to maintain it's territorial integrity ? ....</p>
              <p>what are you then, but a chinese cultural chauvinist ? ... it may be understandable if you were a PRC, like the chap ironbutcherer .... i can sympathise and understand, no one likes other people to criticize his own country ... but you ? ..... that it's a racial superiority thing to you ... is the only conclusion I can seem to come to ? ...</p>

              <p>I'm still curious ... what do you think of the killings of civilians in recent weeks ? .... what is your moral pronouncement ? .... what do you think of it ? .... all you've been talking about, is some vague general statements about it all being propaganda plots instigated by other western powers and what not, and that tibet belongs to china and yadda yadda ....</p>
              <p>care to make your views known on this ? ... do you think it's right for the civilians to be gunned down like this ? .... doesn't matter if you think it's a matter of subjugating a conquered people (like the japanese did to the chinese in WWII ) ... or if it's an internal security exercise (like what the chinese did to the chinese at tiananmen) ..... is it right ? ... or wrong ? ....</p>
