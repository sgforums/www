                                          you are using sources from www.freetibet.org to make a point. It is
                                          like using the Bible as evidence that God exists. Or citing from
                                          opoch times to justify the Falungong’s claim that there is organ
                                          harvesting of Falungong followers in China (which by the way, both
                                          the Department of State of USA and overseas Chinese dissents have
                                          discredited after their independent investigations).  All of
                                          which are unreliable because information stemming from an interest
                                          group cannot be used as unbiased evidence to support the claims
                                          made by this interest group. I am sure you know this point. Don’t
                                          you. That is why you were taking another former to task when he was
                                          citing from People’s Daily for a pro-China opinion. Better practice
                                          what you preach…</span></span></span></p>
              <p>now I am curious, it seems to be that these are unreliable information, because, they were from a special interest group ? ... fine, and People's Daily, in your own words, for a pro china opinion ... is thus, reliable ? Are you supposing that Xinhua or people's daily have no "special interests" ? .... or is it really because these uncomfortable pictures does not conform with your views of things, and you have to backpedal your words ? ... or these conform to your world view ?</p>
              <p>first, chaps here said the pictures doesn't exist, next, they showed chinese deaths,  (in tibetan monk robes ?), next some say these are tibetan rioters shot dead for violence, you said they were tibetans hacked to death ... and then now they were unfortunately caught in a cross fire ? .... Ditto the official chinese line ... first xinhua says no death, then a deaths of han civilians, then some tibetans were killed, but all were violent rioters, and now they say, yeah, a few were caught in the cross fire ..... cross fire ?!?! ... the tibetans are arming themselves with guns now ? .... woah ! ...... it reads suspiciously like the  official chinese line during time of the SARS crisis doesn't it ? ...  ... first there was no epidemic, then only a few deaths, and everything is under control, then it's not spreading at all .... mean while, people in other countries kept dying ......</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">You are either
                                          totally missing the point or you are deliberately diverting the
                                          issues here. I WAS NOT questioning about the CCP’s faults in the
                                          SARS and Food and All. I WAS NOT! But you are so fond of
                                          REGURGITATING all those examples again and again as if they provide
                                          the ultimate answers to the questions that this thread intends to
                                          inspire, apparently to make me "uncomfortable", as you put
                                          it. </span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Listen to this:
                                          I was not questioning the credibility of Western media’s reports
                                          AGAINST THE CHINESE OFFICAL REPORT. Therefore, it is an irrelevant
                                          question from you when you asked:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“how are people going to be expected to believe
                                          in the official Chinese line in the light of these
                                          ?”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">I was not questioning the credibility of the western media either, you really need to do a closer reading of my posts .... I was questioning the credibility of the CHINESE media, I am saying that people would judge China based on her actions in the past, and would judge the word of the chinese goverment and official media based on the words of her past too, as uncomfortable as it is for you .... you can scream that you're diverting the issue ... but do you honestly think the minds of people would operate otherwise ? ... :lol: </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">in case you didn't get all that ... I  shall put it to you again ...</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">The chinese goverment and chinese citizen forumers like you can seethe in indignation for all you want ... but I have shown you, twice now, why people are more inclined NOT to believe in the official chinese media ... people do remember her past history of cover-ups, untruths, if not out-right lies .... the SARS crisis, the poisoned dumplings, and fake blood proteins are the most recent examples to illustrate that ... though I can imagine you thumping your keyboard at me bringing all that up again ....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">When you tell people there's no epidemics, everything was under control, while people overseas are dying, you loose credibility, when you thump your chest and scream that it's all a plot to tarnish china's reputation, it doesn't change the fact that people died of dodgy dumplings and fake blood protein overseas ... and people would remember the local health authorities ban on chinese stewed pork ..... when you tell people one side of the story, but there's a ban on journalists and visitors from overseas, there is thus no way of independant verification .... if only the official, censored and sanitized version of the story is allowed to get out ... people overseas would judge what they hear based on the veracity of what they have heard in the past ...... rhetorics and screaming matches can't change these facts you know ... screaming "MEI YOU !" ... or that " IT"S ALL A PLOT TO DISCREDIT CHINA !" wouldn't change anything at all .....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">so now I shall use an even simpler analogy for you, in the hopes that you can understand ... Have you heard of the story of the boy who cried wolf ? ..... cry wolf too many times, and people will stop believing in you .... and would not believe you when you need them to believe you the most ..... in the light of my above paragraph ... how would the people outside think, really ? .... honestly ? .... dispassionately ? ....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">The ultimate irony here, is that some of the official chinese claims may even be true .... but people will remember the SARS deaths, remember the dodgy goods, and dodgy foods and dodgy drugs ... remember the actions of the chinese goverment in tiananmen, and then, when they listen to rhetorics blaming the "dalai lama clique" blaming it all as an anti-chinese western plot .... listen to the indignations and rantings of the supposedly aggrieved party in this case .... wouldn't it sound suspiciously similar to past rantings ? ... "IT"S ALL A PLOT TO DISCREDIT CHINA" ... yeah ... heard it all before ... just like the time of the last food scares ... and doesn't it sounds suspiciously like osama bin laden's anti-western rants ? ... of a jihad against Islam ? ....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now listen to
                                          this carefully: There is a difference between truthful negative
                                          reports and UNTRUTHFUL negative reports. I am taking issue with the
                                          UNTRUTHFUL negative reports here. Are you trying to justify the
                                          UNTRUTHFUL reports? Is this logic CLEAR  to
                                          you?</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">TRUTH eh ? .. in light of what I have written above .. yet again, what and who would the world likely believe in ? ... what would they take as the "truth" ? .... or you're going to tell me these pictures doesn't show dead tibetans ? .... doesn't show bullet wounds ? .... or they are faked, staged, fabricated ? ...</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;"><a href="http://www.freetibet.org/press/kirtiphotos.html">http://www.freetibet.org/press/kirtiphotos.html</a></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">so who's really to blame for all that ? ... after crying wolf so many times .. what's different this time ? ... the language the same, the shifting official stance's the same, the ban on foreign reporters the same, the vehement anti-western rhetoric's the same .... *blased yawn .... heard it all before .... go on ... " lang lai le ! " ......</p>

              <p>i think the chinese did a poor job managing this crisis. it shot itself in the foot when it refused the foreign press in to report the situation in tibet. now, most foreign reports are one-sided, often critical of the chinese authority. the way it blocked out internet sites and blanket ban of negative reporting of the events unfolding in tibet also position itself in poor light to the international community on their take on censorship and human rights records.</p>
              <p>when its intelligence sense trouble brewing early on, it could have quickly act to quell the unrest through a show of force and willingness to negotiate with the tibeten trouble makers.</p>
              <p>too pre-occupied with the olympic glories, it got blindsided by all these. if the french quarters succeed in persuading some countries to boycott the opening ceremony, it will be a critical failure on the part of the chinese to show the world that 'the leopard can change its spots'.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">One point to be conceded upon is that the Chinese government
                                      does suffer from a credibility problem. This stems on one hand, from the lack
                                      of transparency in the way they handled certain issues. On the other hand,
                                      outside opinions have been wrongly manipulated by Western media to oftentimes
                                      purposefully put China in a negative light.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Below are just a few examples of actual news report with my
                                      commentaries, to illustrate my argument:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is known that the Western world, as the largest consumer
                                      of the earth's limited resources, has been the largest air polluters on this
                                      planet since the industrial revolution. And this trend is likely to continue.
                                      However, it is rising China that apparently needs to be blamed for air
                                      problems, as this news (from Reuters) headline sensationally suggests: In pure
                                      Arctic air, signs of China's economic boom:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/inDepthNews/idUSL042626620070910?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0">http://www.reuters.com/article/inDepthNews/idUSL042626620070910?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0</a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is true that China is contributing to air problems, to
                                      the extent that perhaps every nation is. What baffles me is why China got
                                      singled out, especially in the headline of that news report. Suffice it to say
                                      that the West remains to be the biggest polluters on this planet. Strangely,
                                      India, no less a polluter than China is, rarely gets censured for pollution
                                      problems. So what is the agenda behind such reports that single out China?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another news report from Reuters bears this title: "Texas
                                      turtles ending up in China soup pots". Link to the article is provided below:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1021710120070722">http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1021710120070722</a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The article discusses the shrinking population of Texas turtles,
                                      which the author somehow manages to blame China for. She remarks that it is “China's taste for
                                      Texas turtle meat” that is causing the decline of the turtle population. However, after reading the remaining parts of the
                                      article, one finds no evidence no substantiate this claim. In fact, the article cannot even
                                      prove that the turtles are actually being shipped to China. It only vaguely
                                      reports that the turtles are being exported to “ASIA”. But that clearly did not
                                      prevent the author of the report to make the preposterous claim that China is
                                      the reason for Texas' turtle disappearance. For the less discerning mind, they
                                      would easily be led to believe that Texas' turtle's population decline is
                                      indeed China's faults. What is the agenda behind such reports?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">China also routinely gets criticized for its supposedly
                                      increased military expenditure. As an Editorial in Straits Times on 7 June 2006
                                      points out, "...<span style="font-style: italic;">the Pentagon is focused - not unwisely, because that is
                                      its primary job - on China's continuing military bulk-up. Americans are warned
                                      regularly, through periodic reports and episodic statements, about its
                                      relentless ferocity</span>." America and those who share their views, has been
                                      consistently voicing objections on China's military growth. However, the Editorial sharply points out the hypocrisy: "<span style="font-style: italic;">What precise theory of
                                      exceptionalism would allow the United States to forge ahead militarily,
                                      spending far more of its national treasure on arms both proportionately and
                                      aggregately than other countries, but would also forbid other nations from
                                      doing the same</span>?". Once again, what is the agenda behind censuring China?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Suffice it to say that Western bias hit a sky-rocketing high
                                      in their recent coverage on the Tibet riots. Western reporters have used
                                      pictures from police brutality scenes in India and Nepal to accompany their
                                      sensational report on Tibet, with the apparent objective to show that China was
                                      cracking down on "peaceful demonstrators". Clearly they did not
                                      expect their audience would be discerning enough to tell the difference between
                                      a Chinese face and an India/Nepalese one. If they would not hesitate to use
                                      completely unrelated pictures in their reports, on what basis would one accord
                                      their written reports with credibility?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The following link is just one sample of the "integrity
                                      and objectivity of Western journalism:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3538028.ece">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3538028.ece</a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">CNN and other American media have likewise been editing
                                      photos from Tibet such that the scenes of Tibetan's violent and bloody rioting
                                      is not shown in their reports. This was apparently to fit their report that the
                                      Tibetans were having "peaceful demonstrations" and that the Chinese
                                      police were cracking down on, well, "peaceful demonstrators".</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The deliberate distortion in Tibet reporting practiced by
                                      the Western media is pointed out by one article from New American Media (<a href="http://news.ncmonline.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=0db406a8bd056cbbd2119742f01dba4a">http://news.ncmonline.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=0db406a8bd056cbbd2119742f01dba4a</a>):</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> “<span style="font-style: italic;">Mainstream media is quoting <span style="font-weight: bold;">unverified or unconfirmed
                                      casualty figures</span> and showing <span style="font-weight: bold;">inappropriately edited photos</span>. In one case, CNN
                                      cropped a photo that originally showed Tibetans throwing stones at a Chinese
                                      military vehicle. By cutting the right side where the Tibetan crowd is, the
                                      remaining part of photo becomes a scene of the vehicle chasing running people</span>.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> Western media's bias against China is also palpable as far
                                      as individuals' perception is concerned. A Chinese person (most likely also a
                                      naturalized US citizen) who has stayed in America for the past 20 years, has
                                      the following to say with regard to the extremely unfair portrayal of China in
                                      Western media:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> "<span style="font-style: italic;">And I'm a Chinese living in the US for 20 yrs. I watch
                                      and read news everyday. Out of my 20 years of news reading, I can count with
                                      the 10 fingers of my hand how many times there was ANYTHING positive about
                                      China reported in the news. And on the negative side? Try count the stars. The
                                      fact is the western media is so damn biased against China, that if you read
                                      their news only, you probably think Chinese ppl are still living in the caves.
                                      And then out of no where they'll make you believe China is going to take over the
                                      world. Its just hilarious</span> ."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Official media in other parts of the world (unaffiliated
                                      with China) have also recognized the bias against China from the West. Straits
                                      Times, in its editorial on Mar 26, 2008, while pointing out China's credibility
                                      issue, also takes Western media to task for their lack of objectivity:
                                      "<span style="font-style: italic;">Their (Western media) pathological biases evident when reporting
                                      anti-government events in China have been a persistent weakness</span>.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Suffice it to say that Western bias against China is not just
                                      my "indignant chest-thumping", as one forumer has tried to portray me
                                      as doing, apparently to achieve the purpose of ridicule. Western bias against
                                      China is real. Some elements here seem rather fond of re-cycling and re-hashing
                                      their censorious opinions on China's handling of SARS and whatnot, apparently
                                      for the purpose to justify the distorted reports that the West has been
                                      spinning on the Tibet incident. The weakness of the argument lies in the
                                      failure to see that such blatant distortion of facts should never be tolerated,
                                      no matter to which it is directed.<span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">One’s position starts to look perilously precarious when one
                                      harps unstoppably on China’s problems in an attempt to rationalize and justify
                                      the bias and injustice the West has subjected China to.<span>  </span>One could detect the stench of double
                                      standards here.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">China is indeed beset with many problems (one of which
                                      perhaps is that it has not succumbed to the ideological assimilation the West

                                      Such problems could be discussed constructively. But there is a difference between
                                      a rigorous discussion and pure bashing. When one starts to revel in harping unstoppably on China’s problems in an attempt to rationalize and justify the bias and injustice the West has subjected China to, one's bigotry and ignorance is exposed. </p>

              <p>There is also a view based on religion. Here is one post from BBC's Have your say section:</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;">The Westerners are incapable of changing their biases. The sentiment is rooted in their religion. Christian churches are hostile to China because China does not believe in god. It makes every Christian Westerners mad if you tell them there is no god. Therefore, China is seen as a suppressive monster against Christianity. The Western mother bigots pass such racist prejudice onto their children, generation by generation. In Western media, China is never ever right; not even once.</p>

              <p>1988 when I was in the US, i don;t see that sold in the any commercialized market. 2005 I was shock to see it was sold only in Asia market and it is wildly served in Chinese resturant in California.

It is a popular dish on Claypot. People do not sell part or portion of turtle but they are sold and cook the entire turtle. I was told that Turtle is better than those sold in HKG and China as they are not farm breed.  </p>

              <p>I woundn't put Taoism in the category of religion at least not in the same category as Christianity. The latter imposes a rather restrictive view of the world and is rather intolerant of other religions. Taoism is more about peace in mind and harmonious living i think. </p>
