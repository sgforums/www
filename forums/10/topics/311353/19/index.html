              <p>Communism, as an ideology, do not believe in God, or any religion. They are afraid of any grouping of people different from their ideology, religion is one of such grouping. I fully agree with you on the castastrophe brought to Chinese society in the attempt to destroy religion, culture and tradition during the cultural revolution.</p>
              <p>But Tibet is part of China is a fact that is beyond the communists in China. If one day KMT were to rule China, they would also consider Tibet as part of China. </p>
              <p>However, looking at China today, the temples in China are full of activities with visitors or devotees, taoists or buddhists, churches are also full of people. Has the communists learn to recognise God or deities? or human being will never win, if they choose to stand against God. </p>

              <p>Remote Tibet is of strategic significance to China. Here are the reasons, according to an article.</p>
              <p><strong>There are strategic and economic motives for China's attachment to
              Tibet. The region serves as a buffer zone between China on one side and
              India, Nepal, and Bangladesh on the other. The Himalayan mountain range
              provides an added level of security as well as a military advantage.
              Tibet also serves as a crucial water source for China and possesses a
              significant <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1592687,00.html">mining industry</a>. And Beijing has invested billions in Tibet over the past 10 years as part of its wide-ranging <a href="http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ie-en/DisplayDocument.jsp?did=14118">economic development plan</a> for Western China.</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>see i am not sure you understand we are not talking about 1823 we are talking the near term in 1979. Chinese primary school there was actually only 1 or 2 subject that were thought in English until 1978 or 79 the subject changed to English. got that. So we did move from Mandarin Text to English text for Math. Social science. Health classes. (I am refering to the 70's)</p>

              <p>Did we ever disput that Tibet is not part of China.

              <p> </p>
              <p>So when talk about free tibet seriously its about the freedom of its people to choose its practics, and believe.</p>

              <p>well it suka suka canonize its catholics bishop outside the vatican. It select its own lama. It chop down Fu Long Khong when it felt that it become a political threats.  It continue to extend its stretch of influence and control.</p>

              <p>The Tibetians have lost their culture. That's why the violence there. The violence is by the second and third generation Tibetians, who have lost their Buddhist character. The Dalai Lama has authority only over Buddhist (believers), and not Tibetians under PRC rule. Btw, there is a Communist Party appointed Dalai Lama in Beijing, who is, without doubt, entirely blameless.</p>
              <p>The protest in Tibet is, as usual meant to be "peaceful", but as usual, only start off peacefully. The same for "peaceful" demonstrations in Myanmar. There are always "unseen hands behind the scene".</p>

              <p>Hai....</p>
              <p>I read abit once in the past, about why China didnt allow Vatican authority in the Chinese Catholic church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First and foremost,</p>
              <p>China does not persecute 'religion' per se. </p>
              <p>China is wary and nervous of 'religious authority/ hirearchy'.</p>
              <p>There is a significant difference between the 2.</p>
              <p>For instance,</p>
              <p>China disallow Vatican authority in the Catholic church there, but Catholics are free to practice and worship as usual.</p>
              <p>To understand this, we need to understand the history of China. Why the leaders are so nervous of religious authority.</p>
              <p>China has experienced numerous rebellions and uprisings from religious authority in its history.</p>
              <p>Therefore, religious authority is seen with anxiety, a potential for problems and upheavals.</p>
              <p>Similarly, Dalai Lamaism is disallowed, but that doesnt mean Buddhism is
              disallowed or that other monasteries in other parts of China/ monks cannot
              practice Buddhism as usual.</p>
              <p>We
              need to understand China does not have an interest to persecute
              'religion' from a theological point of view, to keep people as
              atheists. Religion is seen as a personal matter. This philosophical viewpoint is over
              with. There is no debate there. What they are wary of, is a religious
              structure or authority, which can subvert the state.</p>
              <p>In the most striking example is the Dalai Lamaism in Tibet. In
              this instance, a religious authority has openly challanged the state
              authority, in the form of separatism.</p>
              <p>It can be a rebellion. No joke u know..?</p>
              <p>Just see the
              current troubles in Tibet, I would say it is influenced and unresolved
              to a degree because of the existance of a non acquiesce-ing religious
              authority.</p>

              <p><strong>you don't have to be born in those years to know what happened then. RI was founded by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1823, do you think they taught mandarin then? You think the Brits wanted the locals to study the local languages</strong>?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see i am not sure you understand we are not talking about 1823 we are talking the near term in 1979. Chinese primary school there was actually only 1 or 2 subject that were thought in English until 1978 or 79 the subject changed to English. got that. So we did move from Mandarin Text to English text for Math. Social science. Health classes. (I am refering to the 70's)</p>

              <p>Of course lah, come 1979, with US as the dominant global power, english is further strengthened as the dominant language, in Singapore boh tak angmoh ce bo gong zo, sure nobody want to go chinese school.</p>
              <p>It is the same in Tibet, study chinese can get better job, do the young man there really want to study only tibetan and become monks? so don't link Olympics with cultural dilution in Tibet.</p>

              <p>Even Communist China need time for her to proceed to democracy state.But,they still have to face up the problems they currently encountered,not to sweep all the problems under the carpet or put the blames to Dhalai Lama or Western countries.</p>
              <p>The truth of the current problems China facing is,if the Communist China refuse to hold a general election and end a One-party domination of the country.The remaining state that in theory should belong to China,will one by one refuse to recognise China as a whole n want to separate from her.Xinjiang,Tibet and Taiwan,all the same.</p>
              <p>Especially Taiwan,even if Mainland China "advance" to Singapore current political state and have an general election(Which is unfair).Taiwan will also refuse to merge back to China as it is still One-party domination with 2 or 3 opposition party hanging like a dead man in the parliament.[</p>
              <p>Bottomline is,Communist China or Communist PAP in Singapore,has to proceed to Western type of democracy,whether they want it or not.</p>
