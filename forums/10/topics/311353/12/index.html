              <p>so ... you believe, and I quote from your post, that
              "<span style="color: #3366ff;">Dalai Lama is not behind this riot.
              The riot is planned by someone else.</span>"</p>
              <p>You do not believe in the official chinese version of the
              events,  that the riots were orchestrated by the "dalai lama
              clique" then ? ... not surprisingly, I don't put much stock in the
              pronouncements of that goverment either.</p>
              <p>i am not sure I agree with you that the current troubles in
              tibet has it's roots in Mao's policies, it seems a bit to easy to
              blame a man long dead for the troubles, but the problem is easily
              rectified, and I certainly don't agree with you that Buddhism in
              tibet is protected by the chinese central goverment, or else it
              will suffer the same fate as buddhism in India, India is the birth
              place of Buddhism and it is certainly flourishing there, some
              forumers just made pilgrimages there too ... I'm sure if you take
              it up at the Buddhism forum, they'll tell you the opposite is
              true,</p>
              <p>but however, the practise of Buddhism in Tibet is no longer
              free, we now see two different lamas on both sides of the fence,
              one recognized by the tibetans, another installed by the Chinese
              goverment ... is the Chinese goverment trying to play Buddha ?
              ....</p>
              <p>one thing I failed to understand before, is why go through all
              the hassle and trouble of invading and subjugating another country,
              if it's just for the sake of buffer zones against bigger enemies ?
              .... I was just arguing with a PRC classmate online yesterday night
              as I got going here as well ... and he offered me a startling
              insight, something which i never knew about before .....</p>
              <p>You know why China will never set Tibet Free now ? .....</p>
              <p>Because of oil ....</p>

              <p>Yes, I think Wen Jia Bao's statement saying the riot is planned by Dalai Lama is wrong. very clear, isn't it? We should look at everything on case by case basis. You may not like a person for doing certain thing, but if he does a right thing one day, you should agree with it. Likewise, though I agree with China's policy to not intefere in other country's internal affair, at the same time I don't agree on some of their policy. I won't go and start some riot or damage the facilities because of the disagreement.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter blaming a dead person is easy or not. I still think that the current tibet issue is caused by Mao Ze Dong, he spoilt the relationship between China government, the Dalai Lama and tibetans. Unfortunately, the new government has to deal with the problem inherited by Mao. But fortunately, the new government are more open than Mao in many areas.<br><br>It is facts that since Yuan dynasty onwards, the central government has been giving a lot of support to the buddhism in tibet. It is also facts that buddhism in India extinct about 1 thousand years after the buddha enter parinirvana. With many reasons, 2 of them are lack of support of king, and invasion from anti-buddhism foreign army. Though buddhism in India was re-established again in last century, but it already loss few hundreds years. Go and search on internet if you want to find out more.</p>
              <p>Whether Tibet has oil storage or not, it doesn't matter. What I want to say is Tibet was already part of China since long ago. simple.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: They may not hold a Tibetan passport, and some have never lived in their motherland. But gathered at a meditation centre in Geylang listening to a news podcast downloaded from website Radio Free Asia, their passion for the Tibetan cause is clear. <br><br>The calm in Singapore seems a world away from the protests and the Chinese government's crackdown, which have rocked the Himalayan region since last week. Still, Tibetans here have felt the pain and anxiety of their compatriots and this has brought them closer together. <br><br>The Tibetan community in Singapore is minute, estimated at 30 to 50 at any one time. Some of them work or study and the rest are lamas (monks) here for a few months. <br><br>To outsiders, what makes them Tibetan may be tenuous — some were born in India, some are already Singapore citizens, some have no plans to return to Tibet even if their wish for independence comes true. <br><br>But to the group, what makes them Tibetan is clear — their ancestry, Buddhist way of life and common wish to see the return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to Tibet. <br><br>"When we meet, we wish each other well and pray for dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese, and for peace and freedom in Tibet," said freelance tour agent Pri Jinpa Gyatso, 32. <br><br>Mr Jinpa has visited many of the 25 to 30 Tibetan Buddhist centres here in recent days, encouraging prayer sessions for those killed or injured in the crackdown — be they Tibetan or Chinese. <br><br>The lamas in Singapore have also been praying for the well-being of those in Tibet. While they place the Dalai Lama, who advocates non-violence, on a sacred pedestal, they empathise with the protesters back home. <br><br>"The protesters in Tibet are doing this for their future generations," said Lama Tsewang, 27, who has been in Singapore for two months. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amid reports of the killing of ethnic Chinese in Lhasa, another Tibetan, a 37-year-old professional, said that the most important issue remained that of Tibet's longstanding struggle for nationhood, or at the very least, autonomy. <br><br></span>Most Tibetans interviewed for this report declined to be identified due to job sensitivities. Mr Jinpa is the de facto "face" of the local Tibetan community. <br><br>He met a fellow Tibetan, a teacher, for the first time on Wednesday — they had talked on the phone for a few months, but finally met when both sat down with TODAY for an interview. The two are married to Singaporean women. <br><br>The teacher has taken his support online, setting up a blog titled "Truth about the Current Situation in Tibet". <br><br>News posted on bhodrangzen.blogspot.com is culled from alternative news sources such as Phayul.com. <br><br>"I have been listening to Tibetan radio and I can hear my countrymen calling in … I feel very helpless," said the teacher, 33, who grew up in India. <br><br>For many Tibetans, the Dalai Lama is dearer than their lives, said the teacher. But there is some frustration that his way has not worked. <br><br>Said the teacher: "Some of us don't understand why (when) someone slaps you, you still show your other cheek." <br><br>The Tibetans' frustrations stem from what they consider the lip service that China has paid to their human rights and freedom of worship. <br><br>For example, when the Dalai Lama spoke in 2006 about wildlife conservation and told Tibetans not to wear illegal animal furs and skins, the Chinese authorities ordered some Tibetan broadcasters to wear fur-lined traditional clothing. <br><br>By nature, Tibetans are a "very easy-going" people, and those in Singapore have integrated well into life here, said the Tibetan teacher. They don't have a particular hangout, and neither are they overly fond of Tibetan food. <br><br>"There are some Nepalese that have set up restaurants offering Tibetan dishes here, but I find Tibetan food pretty boring," he said. <br><br>The influences of globalisation aside, the desire to spread understanding of Tibetan culture is strong, and may speed up in Singapore as an indirect result of the Tibet riots. <br><br>Mr Jinpa mooted the idea of a Tibetan Buddhist Centre last year to spread Buddhism and Tibetan culture, which are inextricably linked. The centre would bring the Tibetan community and like-minded Singaporeans together, through events like the Dalai Lama's birthday celebrations. <br><br>And his plans may be realised sooner than expected - with help from an Italian venture capitalist, no less. The venture capitalist, who is based in Singapore, has expressed interest in funding a base for the Tibetan community here. <br><br><br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">TODAY</span></a><span>/so</span></p>

              should agree with it. Likewise, though I agree with China's policy
              to not intefere in other country's internal affair, at the same
              time I don't agree on some of their policy. I won't go and start
              some riot or damage the facilities because of the disagreement.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter blaming a dead person is easy or not. I still
              think that the current tibet issue is caused by Mao Ze Dong, he
              spoilt the relationship between China government, the Dalai Lama
              and tibetans. Unfortunately, the new government has to deal with
              the problem inherited by Mao. But fortunately, the new government
              are more open than Mao in many areas.<br> <br> It is facts that since Yuan dynasty onwards, the central government
              has been giving a lot of support to the buddhism in tibet. It is
              also facts that buddhism in India extinct about 1 thousand years
              after the buddha enter parinirvana. With many reasons, 2 of them
              are lack of support of king, and invasion from anti-buddhism
              foreign army. Though buddhism in India was re-established again in
              last century, but it already loss few hundreds years. Go and search
              on internet if you want to find out more.</p>
              <p>Whether Tibet has oil storage or not, it doesn't matter. What I
              want to say is Tibet was already part of China since long ago.
              simple.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Well you got to understand PRC is very much similar to SG. The media is highly controlled by the CCP and foreign media has no access to Tibet to report on the first hand situation, while reporters are also denied the rights to travel to the place. The CCP is also eager to push the blame to Dalai and has issued the classic all time favorite explanation “This is an isolated minor situation that is le by individual that harbor desire to cause unrest in the society.” You got to understand what you read and hear from China is very much filtered by the CCP and the CCP has always manage to find ways to taichi the problems away. Just like our mediacorp and PAP have always push blames on SG’s problems to the opposition, globalization and CSJ. The CCP has taken pains to paint the image that they are the victims of an evil plot by Dalai, but they have been hiding many reality from the world. Just like the Americans dun like to talk about Abu Gharib.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">A few days ago, I read from Lian he zao bao about an article regarding the Tibet issue. Just in case you think this article is written by some foreigners out to smear PRC’s reputation, the article is written by a PRC political analyst, a professor, that has extensive research on such issues. He said that the main problem of the Tibet issue is only partly caused by Dalai. No doubt PRC has made extensive upgrades of infrastructure to Tibet and built roads to Tibet, only a small popl of ppl esp. the higher echelon ppl get to enjoy these fruits of success. Like other parts of PRC, the social disparity is increasing and this is further worsen by the fact that the CCP is allowing large influx of ethnical Hans to enter Tibet, thus this causes a lot of racial unhappiness. The Hans are better off than the ethnical Tibetian in terms of economy and social status, thus this further creates unhappiness. Lastly, it is the PRC forced “sino-tisation” of Tibet that really make the problem reach the ante and cause all these riots. <span> </span><span> </span></span></p>

              <p>my point ... is simple too ... it is simply unreasonable for China to lay claim to Tibet, pure and simple .... as I have shown, ancient history is a poor excuse for current day imperialism, through out much of China's own history, she too has been subjugated and bullied by and conquered by other countries, (incidently, both the Yuan and Qing dynasties, which you pointed out as examples, were dynasties founded by foreign invaders, the mongols and the Manchus .... perhaps, then, Tibet's association with China then, could be said to be actually slaves belonging to the same foreign master then ? ...  no ?  ...</p>
              <p>we are supposed to be living in an enlightened age ... where such imperialist behaviour should already be past ... and don't go deflecting and pointing fingers at uncle sam in today's Iraq ... Traditional chinese upbringing would teach you to learn from the good, not the bad ... "Hao de bu xue, xue huai de" is not acceptable, nor should it be an excuse for one to do something similar ... if someone else goes around robbing, raping, and plundering, can you use it as an excuse to do like wise ? ... shouldn't it be something shameful ? ... (14th time i am repeating this .... everyone has chosen to ignore all this, again and again ... but you watch, a few posts later, another "tee nau" will post the same old "see ! .. uncle sam is doing it too !" or something similar ... )  .... or has such traditional chinese values been replaced by something more sinister, like blind, rabid racial and cultural chauvinism ? ....</p>

              is today united into a big family. This is the new reality. This is a

              on its own will be hard to survive. Tibet has been part of China for
              centuries and there is no reason for any imperialists to want to
              interfere and break it up. <br> <br> This is because other than their own imagination the Chinese today is
              doing everything possible to bring about economic prosperity for all of
              China.
              <br> <br>These Western Imperialists should stop trying to destabilise China
              while promoting their own harmony, unity and economic union as they
              have done with their own neighbors.
              <br> <br>If there is a rebellion by the Aborigines in US or Australia to

              <p>to be frank, tibet should belong to china. From a history perspective, tibet is only independent for a slight time when china went through internal war and british involvement. So china determine his country size is before his internal war which to a certain extent is not wrong.</p>
              <p>When china invade tibet, they also do not use force but sign a document through dialogue... (in a certain way tis is true). Compared with british invasion the casualties r much lesser...</p>
              <p>In recent time china had spent a lot of resources on tibet to modernise it. They even build a fast train to tibet at a high cost. Talking about ruling, they did not do anything bad to tibetians.</p>
              <p>Recent turn of events is also beyond one expectation, but I do not disagree with china hard stance. The situation is spiralling out of control and the people have become racial discriminating one another.</p>
              <p>The only thing I hate is china trying to lie and cover up wat happened. I think tat is immature, counter productive and spoil his own reputation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking about revolution and over throwing the government... u do it when u got a good reason to... so far china is treating tibetian better than their own people. And china is trying to improve over the years... They have a sudden jump in income and sudden improvement in standard of living. They have access to better education and better facilities and better transport links. They have some degree of autonomy over their own region as well. Now... why should they revolt ? Why should they use force on innocent chinese stall holder or innocent chinese on the street ?</p>
              <p>Lets say the native american Red indians or australian arbogines gang together and start to loot the caucasians stalls and kill their people and fight with the authorities... wat do u think the american or australian will do ? If u ask me, british is worse in determing whose countries belong to who. Is america belonging to red indian or the caucasians ? Is australia occupation legal ?</p>

              <p>ah .... so the yuans were a foreigners, and thus what they conquered during that time do not count at part of China's ? ... what about the qing's  then ? .... were they not a "foreign dynasty" too ? ... remember it was you who said that kangxi sent in two military expeditions to drive out the mongols in tibet ? where previously, tibet was an independant kingdom who got their arse invaded by the mongols...... kangxi, one of the famous Manchu Qing emperors ...... How come what the Yuan dynasty's got is not counted, but the Qing's counted ? .... double talk again ? ...</p>
              <p>and then you said ...</p>

              <p>ah  ... true of course ... which is precisely why i said, it's double standards on China's part, and yours too, first, you said that tibet was part of China because of legitimacy of historicla rule (setting aside your already contradicting stance I pointed out in the top paragraph) .... but now, you said China ruled vietnam for over thousand years but they recognizes the sovereignty of vietnam ? ..  hmmmm .... hypocrisy ? .... double standards ? ... selective intepretation ? ... confusion on your part ? ...</p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Here are some thoughts about why SG should speak up against PRC action. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Tibet is part of China.</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>1)</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'> I do believe the notion <span> </span>- because it is an internal affair therefore no one has the right to interfere. – needs to review from time to time the role of statehood. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Look at ASEAN, The non intervention and consensus policy did not bring ASEAN any closer, it didn’t help Myanmar to be part of the international community over the years. Asean fail the people of Myanmar. <strong>So we ask ourselves Why do we take the same approach of non intervention and consensus approach towards Tibet? Is it  because Tibetan are far away land? and China Web of influent are huge and extensive in Asia. <span> </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>2</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Communist Chinese were trying to consolidate its influence by cannibalizing Tibet’s social identity by systematic infusing Hans Chinese into the city. Every new generation of people will regeneration of ideas, resurgent of identity is a process especially true for Tibetian monk who held the view of purification and Reincarnation. So we might be witnessing the last Civilization of Tibet’s innocent before conforming to the modern society.  A lost to your next generation. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>3</span></p>

              <p>The Tibetan rioters went to the street, setting shops (specifically targeting shops owned by Han people) on fire, hacking people with axes and generally wrecking other havoc they are capable of. Yet, these people are portrayed as peace-loving, suppressed victims by Western media? Well, I am not surprised. Western media has been habouring an admirable amount of bias towards China for a long time, even at the cost of twisting facts. Yet, they think they have the moral high ground to accuse China of spreading propaganda. I guess they do not know that they live in glass houses themselves. </p>
              <p>Western countries colonized most parts of the world, stealing land from natives (USA, Australia...) and inflicting great atrocities in the process. Now they think they have the moral high ground to lecture us on Tibet? Let's set aside whether Tibet should belong to China for the moment. If one's argument is that invasion in itself, regardless of its consequences (good or bad), is unjustified and must be reversed, then naturally white American and Australians must get out of USA and Australia and go back to Europe. After they have retreated from those lands, we could discuss Tibet. Otherwise, please kindly back off. </p>
              <p>If one accuses me of diverting attention from the issue, then I must ask this simple question: If white Americans are living in a land they illegally stole from native Indians and Han Chinese are living in a land they illegally took from the Tibetans, why does one point fingers at the Chinese but not Americans if the wrong-doing is the same? I am not trying to justify Chinese occupation of Tibet, but singling out one country and ignoring another speaks volumes about one's neutrality, or the lack thereof. </p>
              <p>And... it is America that IS throwing its weight around the world, invading other sovereign nations and causing all sorts of friction and animosity. They self-righteously think that their ideology is superior to others and thus they aggressively export and impose their systems on other countries. Those who resist this ideological assimilation are punished one way or the other. And why is someone accusing China of chauvinism instead? </p>
