              <p>Nanking incident is Japanese killing Chinese,that is a country invading another country version.</p>
              <p>BUT,TMN n Cultural Revolution is Chinese killing Chinese,thats totally different thing.Look,if u and BadzMaro think that it is "righteous" to kill anyone if they dont like u or quarrel with u,go ahead!!!</p>
              <p>I dont give a damn about you this 2 !diots.Already,you n BadzMaro forum name already show how "bad" and "violence" you guys are.(one with a name starting "Bad",the other name "Gun",LOL)</p>
              <p>Perhaps you 2 think that it is "macho","almighty","powerful" to anyhow kill ppl with firearms.But to me,you and BadzMaro are nothing but an attention-seeker.You two want "little girls" to praise you guys saying"Oh,u ppl are so mighty,can anyhow pull out gun n slaughter ppl".Let me tell you,no ppl will admire this kind of brutality.Not even a "little girl".Who knows,some day u guys might kill your family members n try to "justified" your acts.Pathetic @ss.</p>
              <p>P.S.BadzMaro,do u want to know where those TNM protestors are now?They are living happily everafter in U.S.And pls dont quote other ppl post n reply my post,it makes me feel you lack of words.</p>

              <p>Alot of Australian media heap praise on Kevin Rudd.</p>
              <p>To be a 'true friend' who sometimes speak unpleasant truths, sure, it is a nice concept. There is nothing wrong in that. That is a good thing.</p>
              <p>But imagine someone who tries to be a true friend who speak unpleasant truths, but got his facts and ideas wrong, and doesnt speak truths anymore, but rather falsehoods.</p>
              <p>Maybe in this case he will be an irritating friend who is abit over his head.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">From your analogy, the Nanking masscare shouldn't be considered act of barbarism as compared with Tiananmen incident or the Chinese cultural revolution based on your concept on who is killing whom. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">How strange. Then shouldn't we be including the countless civil wars that were fought throught out the written histroy of China. Least we forget about Russian killing Russians, Koreans vs Koreans, Vietnamese vs Vietnamese and others. So what's so special about the 1989 TMN incident?</span></p>

              maliciously attacked the Chinese people, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
              Jiang Yu said at a regular press briefing on Tuesday. <br><br> Cafferty said in a TV show on April 9 that the <strong>Chinese products are
              "junk"</strong> and the <strong>Chinese people "basically the same bunch of goons and
              thugs they've been for the last 50 years". </strong><br><br> "Cafferty used the
              microphone in his hands to slander China and the Chinese people,
              seriously violated professional ethics of journalism and human
              conscience", said Jiang. <br><br> What he did "reflected his
              arrogance, ignorance and hostility towards the Chinese people, ignited
              indignation of Chinese home and abroad, and will be condemned by those
              who safeguard justice around the world", said Jiang. <br><br> "We strongly demand CNN and Cafferty himself take back the vileremarks and apologize to all Chinese people," Jiang said.</span></em></p>

              <p>i support the china. tibet shall never be gain independence. in fact they have already gain autonomy from the chinese communist party.</p>
              <p>do not be fool by the western media. the western powers are again trying to deploy the tactics in the late 19thcentury trying to separate / break down china rise to powers. will a independent tibet be a better place the world? what next? xinjiang( muslim dominiated region). when the muslims separistist become uncontrollable in the region, western powers will use the name of fighting terror and invade xinjiang to gain a permanent foothold in china again?</p>
              <p>when the western powers dont find WMD in iraq, what do they? the change the topic to fighting terror. make a foothold in middle east, using iraq oil as a compensation for the war, food exchange.</p>
              <p>when come to media we cannot believe what western media trying to protray china, nor can we believe 100% what CCTV is trying imply. we need to study history, what the hidden interest that media do not want us to know.</p>

              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; display: inline;">According to the research by a Canadian journalist, a conference organized by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNSt) gave the impetus to the current anti-Chinese Tibet campaign that violently forced the interruption of the Olympian Torch Relay in Paris last Monday.</div>
              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; display: inline;">[1] The</div>
              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; display: inline;">conference was the fifth "International Tibet Support Groups Conference," that was held from May 11 - 14, 2007 in Brussels. According to FNSt information this conference was supposed to do nothing other than the four preceding conferences [2] - "coordinate the work of the international Tibet groups and consolidate the links between them with the central Tibetan Government in Exile."[3] The German foundation, which is largely state financed, began the conference preparations in March 2005, and coordinated its plans with the Dalai Lama at his headquarters in the self-proclaimed Tibetan Government in Exile in Dharamsala, India. More than 300 participants from 56 countries, 36 Tibetan associations and 145 Tibet support groups were represented at the conference.</div>

              <div class="title" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; padding-top: 10px;">Roadmap</div>
              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; display: inline;">After several days of consultations the conference ended with a concerted "plan of action". The paper is entitled "Roadmap for the Tibet Movement for the Coming Years" covering four areas of interest: "political support for negotiations", "human rights", "environment and development" and "the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing." The results of the conference are directed to the Tibetan people as well as "their supporters around the world."[4] Rolf Berndt, a member of the FNSt's executive council in Brussels, declared that the Olympic Games "are an excellent opportunity" to publicly promote the cause of the "Tibet Movement".[5] The conference participants agreed to make the Olympics the single focus of attack for their activities for the next 15 months.[6] They hired a full-time organizer for their campaign, who has since been directing the worldwide Tibet actions from their Washington headquarters.</div>

              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; display: inline;">The decisions taken at the conference in Brussels, prepared by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, are particularly significant not only because of the large number of participants but also because of the influential politicians who helped in their formulation. For example the self-proclaimed Tibetan Government in Exile, which enjoys much prestige among separatists, was represented by its "Prime Minister" Samdong Rinpoche. Also attending was another eminent politician from the Indian Himachal Pradesh state, bordering on the People's Republic of China, where the town Dharamsala is located, the "seat" of the Tibetan "Government in Exile." A brisk interchange takes place between Himachan Pradesh and the Chinese autonomous region of Tibet. Paula Dobriansky, the Undersecretary of State in the US State Department and special coordinator for Tibet questions also participated. She was a member of the National Security Council already in the Reagan Administration, continued her career in the State Department during the administration of President Bush Sr. and since 2001 was again in the US foreign ministry. Ms Drobriansky is considered to be one of the members of the neo-conservative inner circle in the Bush Administration and ranks as a hard-liner capable of imposing policy.</div>

              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; display: inline;">As a Canadian journalist learned through his research, the campaign headquarters in Washington, that had been decided upon at the conference in Brussels, has been able to develop rather successful activities. Already at the beginning of August 2007, exactly one year before the opening of the Olympics, a close associate organized a high profile action at the tourist filled Great Wall to the north of Beijing. She maintains close contact to the Tibetan "Government in Exile".[7] Another close associate recently orchestrated the disturbance of the Olympic Torch Relay in Greece, seen on television around the world. The Washington headquarters is orchestrating other "protests" intended to disturb the Torch Relay. The campaign will reach its climax during the Olympic games in August. "We are determined to have non-violent direct action in the heart of Beijing, inside the Games, every day," one activist declared.[8]</div>

              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; display: inline;">The anti-Chinese Tibet campaign, initiated under the direction of a German Foreign Ministry front organization (Friedrich Naumann Foundation) and a high-ranking representative of the US State Department, is developing its full efficacy in the aftermath of the uprisings in West People's Republic of China that began only a few days before the start of the Torch Relay. Whereas the German media mainly reported on brutal attacks of the Chinese security forces, eye-witness accounts provide a different picture of what happened. The British journalist, James Miles ("The Economist"), who was in Lhasa from March 12 - 19, reports of pogrom-like attacks by Tibetan gangs on non-Tibetan members of the population of the city, among them the Muslim minority. According to Miles, the shops of Tibetan merchants were marked and left unscathed while all other shops were plundered, destroyed or set afire.[9] In one building alone five textile saleswomen were burned to death. Besides Miles, western tourists also described the attacks on non-Tibetans. One Canadian saw how a group of Tibetans beat a Chinese motorcyclist and proceeded to "mercilessly" stone him. "Eventually they got him on the ground, they were hitting him on the head with stones until he lost consciousness. I believe that young man was killed,'' reported the tourist.[10]</div>

              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; display: inline;">Whereas Miles was describing the reluctant reactions of the Chinese security forces in an interview broadcast over CNN, the German media is using the uprisings as a backdrop to represent brutal Chinese repression. Facts obviously play a subordinate role. In the meantime, television channels and daily journals have had to admit manipulations of pictures. Film sequences with Nepalese policemen beating demonstrators were sold as documentation of alleged Chinese police attacks.[11] The security forces' saving a boy from an attacking Tibetan mob was coarsely labeled a violent arrest. Even Miles' report was editorially presented in a context to focus on Chinese repression. For the purpose of comparison, german-foreign-policy.com documents excerpts of a CNN interview with the British journalist as well as the corresponding passage from a renowned German daily</div>

              <div class="para" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; display: inline;">The pogrom-like mob-violence not only created the necessary media profile for the current Tibet campaign, initiated with the help of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, it also permits an insight into the character of Tibetan separatism. The "prime minister" of the Tibetan "Exile Government," who had participated in the formulation of the plan of action at the May 2007 Tibet Conference in Brussels, had already at the end of the 1990s, expounded in the German media on his views of the future of non-Tibetans, who had immigrated to Tibet over the past 50 years. In the case of a successful secession, they will have to "return to China, or if they would like to remain, be treated as foreigners." He explained the planned measures: "they will, in any case, not be allowed to participate in the political life."[13] The prospect of discrimination against all non-Tibetan members of the population was anticipated in mid-March by mobs in their bloody attacks on Chinese and members of the Muslim minority.</div>

Less costly than war, and perfectly legal according to wonderful democracy. The entire CIA is probably putting Iran and N.Korea on <em>hold </em>to concentrate its smear campaign.

              <p>I. Same ole politics, it never varies.</p>
              <p>China has three suspects, (assuming China has the report plus intel)</p>
              <p>1. a German Foreign Ministry front organization</p>
              <p>2. the US State Department</p>
              <p>3. the self-proclaimed Tibetan Government in Exile</p>
              <p>but put the blame squarely on the Dalai Lama. The DL is a safe target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>II. The peaceful demonstrations in Tibet. The majority of the demonstrators are genuinely peaceful. It is easy to garner support, with a cause, and the promise of peaceful means only, many innocents will lend their support. They always end up being the pawn for the pogrom. Politics always use tried and tested methods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Olympics is about sports and bringing the world together, it is sad that it is being used for political agendas.</p>
              <p>Why now?</p>
              <p>You guessed it, because it is China's turn, and who cares about China. Why not at Barcelona, Atlanta, Sydney? The Tibetian delima was still alive at those games. The Olympics games is sacrocanct then, but it is it is not now.  Sad that the the very world leaders who would quickly condemn any political interference at any Olympic Games, is now silent, and some infact are riding the current contempt of the Games.</p>
              <p>The Olympics is about bringing people together.</p>

              <p>This is clearly Anti-China or Sinophobic propaganda in the name of either 'Free Tibet' or 'human right' movement. Apparently, it is strategically coordinated, well-funded, and well-organized. We have seen distortion in the western media. The real agenda is not in the interest of the Tibetans who seek secession from China because they know full well that it is impossible ... but to hold back the rise of China.</p>
              <p>I wondered if this kind of propaganda will ever continue onto the Paralympics that will follow after the Summer Games and afterwards. If this movement is for real, these so-called 'Free Tibet' mobs should continue!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This incident has taught me that we are living in a crazy world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1. Human right and democracy activists are 'anxious to see blood'.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2. Despots are 'afraid of blood'.</span></p>

              <p>I just hope that the athletes are not threatened physically. I mean imagine you're a marathon runner, running halfway and these crazy pro-Tibetan mob come lunging at you. Crazy...</p>

              <p>look at what happen in Munich 1972 olympics games?</p>
              <p>did the western powers then know that the mossad was behind the killing of suspected killers in lebanon, paris and finally norway. i bet they do, but none did anything, coz israel was a deterent force for them in the middleeast. they turn a blind eye.</p>
              <p>didnt the palestinans deserve their freedom as well? what did the western powers do until this day? why tibet now?</p>
