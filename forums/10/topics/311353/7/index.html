I am saying that looking back into history, people of different tribes merged to form bigger countries and such merging occurred for many reasons.

              <p>Your idea is not wrong but too idealistic.  At the end of the day very few countries would allow separatism forces to have their way. One example: Kashmir, India.</p>

              <p>Needless to say many Kashmiris are fed up with India's rule and are pushing for independence. Has anyone ever heard of the Kashmir Freedom Movement? Read here:</p>

              <p>Yet India the world's largest democracy refuse to let the Kashmiris have their way. Isn't democracy all about respecting peoples' wishes?</p>
              <p>You see all countries are selfish. India won't allow independence for Kashmir. Same for Russia over Chechnya and China over Tibet.</p>

              themselves to the Qing authority and became part of China in
              exchange for their military protection. And this happened way
              beyond your world began in 1950.</span></p>
              <p><span>Secondly, the Qing dynasty NEVER sent any
              military expedition to conquer Tibet, instead the military
              expedition was to protect Tibet against the Nepalese invasion. The
              western powers conquered and massacred the natives. Glad you
              recognize the west as imperialists.</span></p>
              <p><span>don’t get mixed up with the issue on lead paints
              in dolls, tit for tat foreign policy is nothing new. You still
              playing with dolls?</span></p>
              <p><span>I have seen most, if not all the articles and
              pictures on CNN and BBC. Yes civilians were killed, did they say
              how they were killed? Tell me if you see the youths going rampage
              on the streets, and you believe that the police then came to shoot
              the civilians? I am not passing judgment on who is guilty, until
              the whole issue is over. On all the people I see on the ground, I
              make the difference between the police, the civilians, and the
              rioters. There are not just police and civilians.</span></p>
              <p><span>Tell me what name calling did I do? You can call
              me whatever you like, but I laugh when you call me cultural
              chauvinistic. In what way am I prejudiced against the Tibetan
              culture? Before you ask me for a moral stand, tell me what is
              “PRC’s suppression by force on the Tibetan civilians”. I don’t shy
              away from any question.</span></p>

              <p>trying to wriggle your way out now ? ... asking me if I play with dolls when I bring up uncomfortable examples ? ...</p>
              <p>so now you're NOT saying that tibet belongs to china now ? ... surprise surprise ... so what was all that you've written about then ? .. if not to support your claim that tibet belongs to china ? .... and that your justification is that at various times in history, tibet has not been independant, but was controlled at various times by various groups of people, most recently and most often china ... cute ... so the last chinese expedition was sent to protect the tibetans from the nepalese ?... or was it really because tibet has always been an important buffer territory throught out the centuries ? ... that's why tibet has to be conquered, to hell with it's people ... your pro china stand is obvious ... and since you're not a citizen of that country, isn't cultural and racial pride the only conclusion ? ... i.e., you are a cultural chauvinist ? ....</p>
              <p>again, yet again, you choose to try to hide and find justification in history, when I already showed you, again and again, that to find justification the invasion and occupation of another country now in the past, when other countries conquered and subjugated other peoples at will, makes no sense ... I shall put out the analogy of the kindergarden kid getting caught for cheating in spelling again, since that's appropriate for your level "teacher teacher ! .. not fair ! ... other people also cheated wat ... they got away with it ... so why do you have to catch me only ? ... "... in your book of ethics and values, just because other boys in that school cheated, does it make it alright for this little boy to cheat too ? .... I remind you this is an analogy about china's occupation of tibet, go google what analogy means if you don't know the meaning, and don't try to ask if I'm still in kindergarden again, if you cannot answer that question, it just shows you up ,..  .... so you think china should have the right to play the imperialist game now, just because other countries has done so in the past ? .... again, see the last sentence in the above chapter.</p>
              <p>peoples the world over protested when the few allies invaded iraq unilaterally without a UN mandate, but when people speak out against China's occupation of tibet, it becomes china bashing ? who's practicising double standards now ? .... you people are damm cute ... don't try to pretend you didn't go around name calling too, calling me ignorant and all that doesn't do anything, it just shows that you refuse to see my arguments, ... your skewed cultural prejudice still shows through clearly ... and yes, I am labelling you a cultural chauvinist, and I have showed you above why I think you are one .... you know why I'm calling you that ? ... because you are defending the what is clearly undefendsible, unfathomably ... since you're not from the PRC ... chaps like blueray and idiotbutcherer, they are from there, they don't hide it, I can understand, since no one likes others to speak ill of their country ... what do you have to say, but a surfeit of racial pride ? ...</p>

              <p>Your idea is not wrong but too idealistic.  At the end of
              the day very few countries would allow separatism forces to have
              their way. One example: Kashmir, India.</p>
              <p>The magnitude of the violence and atrocities in India controlled
              Kashmir are much much worse than Tibet. Read here:</p>

              <p>Needless to say many Kashmiris are fed up with India's rule and
              are pushing for independence. Has anyone ever heard of the
              Kashmir Freedom Movement? Read here:</p>

              <p>Yet India the world's largest democracy refuse to let the
              Kashmiris have their way. Isn't democracy all about respecting
              peoples' wishes?</p>
              <p>You see all countries are selfish. India won't allow
              independence for Kashmir. Same for Russia over Chechnya and China
              over Tibet.</p>

              <p>so again ... to you ... it's a case of "teacher teacher, why catch me only, others are doing it too ! ... why you never catch them ... not fair ! "... when a little boy gets caught cheating right ? ... is it alright to cheat, just because others have cheated in the past, or are cheating too ? ...</p>
              <p>isn't that like the MCA chap caught on video farking another woman, but got pissed off and scream entrapment instead ? ... don't point fingers at other people doing the same thing when the focus is on you ... when you are caught for say, littering, do you think you should be able to get away with it by shouting "nah beh ! .. why catch me only ? ... why not catch other people doing the same thing ? ...

              <p>So in your opinion, what should the china police do when some of
              them riot and destroyed the facilities?<br> Imagine if one day lets say Bedok has about 100 people start doing
              the samething, what should the police do in order to be considered
              as democratic and humane and moral.</p>

              <p>your version of riot control is to start killing people issit ? ....</p>
              <p>a more appropriate analogy would be, if Singapore invades and take over johor one day, and the people there starts rioting, what should the SPF do ? ....</p>

              <p>when the justification for China's invasion of tibet is history that's several CENTURIES old ..... I don't see why we should be making any noise now about an invasion that happened 60 years ago ... after all, the chinese are still sore at the japanese for the invasion that happened even before that ... right ? ...</p>
              <p>I'm still waiting for your reply in the other thread deathbait ... don't just fob it off by saying it happened long long ago .... because the justification for the invasion is based on history even older than 60 years ...</p>
