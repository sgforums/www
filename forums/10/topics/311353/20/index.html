              <p>Even Communist China need time for her to proceed to democracy state.But,they still have to face up the problems they currently encountered,not to sweep all the problems under the carpet or put the blames to Dhalai Lama or Western countries.</p>
              <p>The truth of the current problems China facing is,if the Communist China refuse to hold a general election and end a One-party domination of the country.The remaining state that in theory should belong to China,will one by one refuse to recognise China as a whole n want to separate from her.Xinjiang,Tibet and Taiwan,all the same.</p>
              <p>Especially Taiwan,even if Mainland China "advance" to Singapore current political state and have an general election(Which is unfair).Taiwan will also refuse to merge back to China as it is still One-party domination with 2 or 3 opposition party hanging like a dead man in the parliament.[</p>
              <p>Bottomline is,Communist China or Communist PAP in Singapore,has to proceed to Western type of democracy,whether they want it or not.</p>

              <p>But they are not seriously working towards a long term solution in the political process capitalist or socialist. What we are seeing is a continuing influence of power. And trying to shift the problems to outside source.</p>

              <p>Singapore didn't take the decision to pick up English, the master of the land then was the Brit so English was there to stay. Many Chinese didn't agree so there were Chinese schools. But you are right, we now study Chinese because of China, we would have studied Indonesian if Sukarno had his way, if India development picked up then I am not sure if we would study Tamil or Hindi....</p>
              <p>The point is even the Tibetans, given a choice, they would want to study a language that would enable them to make better living, honestly I don't know if they have a problem studying both Tibetan and Chinese language. As it is, the dilution of Tibetan culture by the Chinese is much less than the influence of western culture in Chinese culture. Wait till hollywood and bollywood both enter Lakhsa, via the railroad built by China...</p>

              <p>let me get back to the original reply.</p>
              <p>as a student we did not necessary given a choice to study all Mandarin with ESL. even thought if your parent send u to chinese school because most subject were already coverted to english. and since we adopted GCE O level standard would have to apply. Therefore Irregardless of your choice in going to Chinese schooling or English speaking school you still derive the same destination English language as the main teaching language. Singapore did not develope alternative schooling system. If you look at your brethen in MY its chinese citizen actually travel to Taiwan to complete its university.  </p>
              <p>The Tibetian is asking that they given a choice and not a standard choice where you end up the same path just like sg which is not much of a choice. </p>
              <p>nobody said that Tibet will not be influence by globalization. I think the lama was the first to get influence, but it is for them to decide what life style to work out. And  right now they are asking for that choice.   </p>
              <p>Protest isn't that bad you know? Just like in Business we complaint if you did not received complaint how do you improved your service. Your customer might just walk out without you knowing it. Just like people in SG is moving out and Gov is wondering why?  The strait time was asking to interview people why people are leaving SG?  </p>

              <p>Do you not see a problems if every few decade you need to roll down your tank to your own people? Its going to happen again maybe this time will be Hong Kong. next few decade maybe Shanghai. They have to change the mayor every time they change leadership to instill loyalty.</p>
              <p>China is not like SG where its history is only 40 odds years while the first generation leadership is still holding hands to the gov. We got no history. We only got experiences.</p>
              <p>China has a vast history and the fact that they withstood time. And they will be around till end of times. So if they cannot view governing as perpetual, but power as a section in time than they ignore the history.</p>
              <p><strong>So if the China leadership felt that they are not ready with history of 5000 yrs, please let me know when will they ever be ready.</strong>  There are always enough plate to blame.</p>

              <p>1989 TNM Square incident is excessive indeed.</p>
              <p>But the political situation in the communist countries in that period was that communist regimes were collapsing in eastern europe.</p>
              <p>Republics in the Soviet Union were declaring independence.</p>
              <p>PRC was fearful that the momentum might spread and bring about the collapse of China.</p>
              <p>If that happens, more chaos and bloodshed would be in store for the people.</p>
              <p>This is not to justify anything but rather to view the situation from the PRC perspective.</p>
              <p>If USSR and PRC collapsed in the 1990s and the balance of power shifts dramatically to the western bloc, we can expect what sort of attitude USA and others might take.</p>

              <p>Yes,BUT,that doesnt give those PRC politicians Pigs an excuse to kill their own ppl.Those protestors are mostly students n workers who are unarmed.</p>
              <p>Many ppl,including Taiwanese,say Taiwan President Chen Shui Peng is a lousy politician.The Taiwanese make alot of protest gathering at him n ask him to step down.BUT,during the 8 years reign of Taiwan president,did he kill a single Taiwanese protestors who ask him to step down?He is even more mild than our PAP leaders when dealing with the protestors!!!</p>
              <p>Now,this is the difference between a "civilise" politician n a "barbaric" politicians.You can compare a democratic politicians n a dictatorial politicians,how they deal with their own ppl,especially those who protest or have different views with them.</p>

              <p>he didn't kill anyone because he was feeding off america's hand.</p>
              <p>like po ah pak said tiananmen 1989 was an over reaction that can never be fully justified save for preventing a collective nation with a 5000 year history from splitting into a few hundred pieces.</p>
              <p>so i assume you view western polictians as civilized and angelic individuals who would never risk the lives of their people? you're right. they won't. they're happy murdering the africans and the asians and the iraqis and the iranians to get at their capitalist aims while cowering behind a pathetic facade of democracy.</p>
              <p>your wonderful western world and british dog the dalai lama has been whining about tibet for about 50 years and doing little else. its amazing how they countered stalin's blockade of Berlin by airlifting supplies and not advanced a single cent towards the plight of the tibetians.</p>
              <p>may i bring to your attention that 1910, America and Britian, along with the rest of the western powers and japan were wetting themselves to get a piece of china and British/american interests were vested on none other than TIBET, which had been part of china some 700 years ago before the concept of democracy was even created by the brit wankers.</p>

              Taiwan president,did he kill a single Taiwanese protestors who ask
              him to step down?He is even more mild than our PAP leaders when

Man.. he cant even afford to use any kind of violence to shut the protestors down. Not while he is rubbing shoulders with Uncle Sam.

              <p><br><span style="color: #800000;">Well, historically, the Western powers were VERY interested in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Nope, this wasn't due to noble on promoting "democracry" or "improving human-rights". <br>And Certainly not about protecting Tibetan way of life nor promoting Buddhism, but the simple lust for territorial expansion of the British empire.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Yes the Brit Wankers are at work from 1840 until 1911 after having conquered India, they proceed to invade Tibet.  <br>Here's the interesting part:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Having invaded Tibet several times, British troops massacred 1,000 defenseless Tibetan soldiers in (1904) before reaching Lhasa. <br>The then 13th Dalai Lama had to run away to Mongolia....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">free Tibet? yeah rite...</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">I am just sharing historical fact about human "civilisation". The world is less rounder than you imagine. TMN incident is nothing compared to other grander scale of killings like 1939 Nanking or the Cultural Revolution. The difference is who is using those incidents for they own agenda.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">That goes without saying about on-going internationalisation of Tibet "issue". </span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">This is a blog entry from a Chinese American: </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">It well reflects the frustration and anger felt by most Chinese people. That China has managed to elevate millions of people out of abject poverty apparently hardened US' resolve to contain and strangle us. Judging by the way things go, they will corner us until we have no breathing space.  I suspect something ominous will happen when that time comes.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">America must re-view its foreign policy with regards to China.

              <p>Rudd rewrites the rules of engagement<br>Geremie Barme<br>April 12, 2008<br><br>On Wednesday, the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, made a speech to an audience at Peking University, China's pre-eminent tertiary institution. Given the tensions over Tibet and the Olympic torch relay, as a practised diplomat Rudd could have taken the easy path by speaking in platitudes about the strength of the bilateral relationship and any number of mutually acceptable and anodyne topics.<br><br>Instead, with finesse and skill, he chose to address the students on the broad basis for a truly sustainable relationship with the economically booming yet politically autocratic state that is China. In doing so, he rewrote the rules of engagement in a way that can only benefit Australia and our relationship with this important country.<br><br>First Rudd acknowledged where he was: at a university that, more than any other educational institution in China, has helped shaped that country's modern history, one known for its contributions to Chinese intellectual debate, political activism and cultural experimentation. He mentioned some of China's 20th-century intellectual heroes whose careers were entwined with Peking University. Some were involved in reshaping Chinese into a modern language capable of carrying urgently needed political, cultural and historical debate. One was a leading democratic thinker.<br><br>He also made three references to Lu Xun (1881-1936), China's literary hero, unyielding critic of authoritarianism and principled dissenter, noting that Lu Xun personally designed Peking University's crest. It would not have been lost on his audience that the Prime Minister's choice of intellectual exemplars acknowledged China's dominant communist ideology while pointing to the traditions of free speech and debate that have made Peking University so important.<br><br>Rudd's strategy was thus first to honour the place where he was speaking and its connection to significant, complex historical and cultural figures. He went on to speak more personally of his own educational and political trajectory, and about Australia's national interest. Appealing to his youthful audience to consider what positive role they could play in China's rise as a world power, he evoked the concept of harmony (hexie), embraced by the present Chinese leadership, before making a canny digression. This was to note that 2008 is the 110th anniversary of the Hundred Days Reform movement, during which an enlightened emperor struggled to enact a process of political reform and modernisation similar to the Meiji Restoration in Japan that had taken place not long before. Rudd didn't need to say that this movement failed and its leaders were beheaded; his audience would know that. Instead he noted that one of the leading lights of the reforms, the thinker Kang Youwei, who survived by fleeing into exile, went on to write about "the Great Harmony" (datong), "a utopian world free of political boundaries". Thus, in a manner both subtle and eminently clear to a Chinese intellectual audience, he linked the officially approved concept of harmony to the broader course of political reform, change and openness.<br><br>Rudd then spoke about China joining the rest of humanity as "a responsible global stakeholder" - a lead-in to addressing the pressing issue of Tibet. By framing his comments in such a manner, he established his right - and by extension the right of others - to disagree with both Chinese official and mainstream opinion on matters of international concern. There is a venerable Chinese expression for this position: "A true friend," Rudd went on, "is one who can be a zhengyou, that is a partner who sees beyond immediate benefit to the broader and firm basis for continuing, profound and sincere friendship."<br><br>The subsequent Chinese media discussion of Rudd's use of the powerful and meaning-laden term zhengyou - the true friend who dares to disagree - has been considerable. That is because the more common word "friendship" (youyi) has been a cornerstone of China's post-1949 diplomacy. Mao Zedong once observed, "The first and foremost question of the revolution is: who is our friend and who is our foe."<br><br>To be a friend of China, the Chinese people, the party-state or, in the reform period, even a mainland business partner, the foreigner is often expected to stomach unpalatable situations, and keep silent in the face of egregious behaviour. A friend of China might enjoy the privilege of offering the occasional word of caution in private; in the public arena he or she is expected to have the good sense and courtesy to be "objective", that is to toe the line, whatever that happens to be. The concept of "friendship" thus degenerates into little more than an effective tool for emotional blackmail and enforced complicity.<br><br>Rudd's tactic was to deftly sidestep the vice-like embrace of that model of friendship by substituting another. "A strong relationship, and a true friendship," he told the students, "are built on the ability to engage in a direct, frank and ongoing dialogue about our fundamental interests and future vision."<br><br>The distinction was not lost on the Chinese. The official newsagency Xinhua reported: "Eyes lit up when [Rudd] used this expression … it means friendship based on speaking the truth, speaking responsibly. It is evident that to be a zhengyou first thing one needs is the magnanimity of pluralism." Of course, in the land of linguistic slippage it is easy to see that while for some zhengyou means speaking out of turn, for others it may simply become another way for allowing pesky foreigners to let off steam.<br><br>Of course, there are dangers, not mentioned in the Chinese media. Perhaps the most famous zhengyou relationship of modern times was that between Mao and Liang Shuming, a Confucian thinker and agrarian reformer. Mao declared that although their politics were different, Liang was a true zhengyou. Liang advised Mao on rural policy from the 1940s into the early '50s. But, in 1953, Liang dared to venture that class struggle was having a calamitous effect on rural life. He asked Mao whether he had the "magnanimity" to accept his views. The Chairman shot back, "No, I don't have that magnanimity!" Shortly thereafter, Liang was denounced and silenced.<br><br>On the other hand, there are examples from Chinese history where a zhengyou has played a key role in bringing about good governance and prosperity.<br><br>The most famous zhengyou was Wei Zheng, a friend and critic of the Emperor Taizong of the 7th-century Tang dynasty. Wei told the ruler that "if you listen to wise counsel all is brightness; if, however, you give in to bias darkness falls". When Wei died, some years later, the emperor bitterly mourned his death. He offered this tribute: "One looks at a reflection in a mirror to see if one's dress is in order. One studies history to understand the changing fortunes of time. And one seeks wise counsel to avoid mistakes. Wei Zheng has died, and I have lost my mirror. To have a zhengyou is to be fortunate indeed." The metaphor is used by China's leaders and the media even today. One can only hope that when they look in the mirror they do not do so with eyes wide shut.<br><br>By introducing the term zhengyou with all of its liberating connotations into our dealings with China, Kevin Rudd has achieved something of considerable significance.<br><br>Geremie Barme is a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University.<br><br>http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/rudd-rewrites-the-rules-of-engagement/2008/04/11/1207856825767.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1</p>
