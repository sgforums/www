            <div class='col-md body'>NEW YORK - Suppose all of the world's wealthiest people got together and pooled their assets into one lump sum. How much money would that be? According to a report released on Wednesday, the combined wealth of the globe's richest individuals rose more than 11 per cent to a grand total of US$37.2 trillion last year.<br><br>The rise marks the first double-digit increase in seven years.<br><br>Thanks to a strong global economy, 9.5 million people held at least US$1 million in financial assets - excluding the value of their primary homes - in 2006, up from 8.7 million in 2005, according to the 11th annual World Wealth Report compiled by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co and the consulting firm Capgemini Group.<br><br>Those accumulated trillions give these individuals control of about a quarter of the world's total wealth, or nearly three times the United States' gross domestic product.<br><br>If the rich decided to combine their assets and split the money evenly among all 9.5 million of them, they'd each be left with nearly US$3,915,789. That would be enough for each person to buy about a dozen Rolls Royce luxury cars, or more than 7,000 of Apple Inc's new iPhones.<br><br>Worldwide, gross-domestic-product growth and accelerating market capitalisation - or the value of corporations' outstanding shares in the global market - fuelled the generation of wealth, the report found.<br><br>Despite last year's strong international economy, the world's wealthiest shifted their money away from 'alternative investments' - such as hedge funds, foreign currencies and commodities - in favour of high returns on real estate ventures, the study stated.<br><br>The investment strategies of millionaires may not suit those with fewer assets to spare, however, Robert McCann, president of Merrill Lynch's Global Private Client Group, said after a press conference outlining the report.<br><br>'The world is becoming more and more global,' he said. 'That's an interesting thing to think about, whether you have US$10,000 or US$10 million.' The expansion of the world's richest class was the strongest in both India and Singapore, the report found, which each boasted increases of more than 20 per cent. Solid investor cash-flow into riskier corners of both countries' emerging markets generated much of the gains, according to the report.<br><br>Driving the growth of many millionaires' fortunes was the growing class of the super-rich, individuals whose assets exceed US$30 million, the report stated. Their ranks also grew more than 11 per cent last year to 94,970, with a combined wealth of US$13.1 trillion.<br><br>Topping the list in both in the number of wealthy individuals and the sum of their accumulated assets was the United States, fuelled by gross-domestic-product growth, the report found. Japan ranked second.<br><br>Investments by the wealthy in North America dipped in favour of allocations to Europe, which enjoyed its best performance since 2000.<br><br>In the annual study's first breakdown of philanthropic giving, individuals worth US$1 million or more donated an estimated total of US$285 billion in 2006.<br><br>Charitable giving has become more important in millionaires' overall investment strategies in recent years, Ileana van der Linde, a principal in Capgemini's wealth management practice, said.<br><br>'It seems to be much more about leaving a legacy and having influence in the things that they care about,' she said.<br><br>Entrepreneurs donated an average of US$232,206, more than double the amount dedicated to philanthropy by those who inherited their riches.<br><br>If all ranks of the world's wealthiest decided to give away their combined assets, they could pay off the US federal deficit, 250 times over. Or they could write a check for nearly US$33,000 to every resident of India, though some investors there are faring well on their own.<br><br>Wealth among the world's rich is expected to hit US$51.6 trillion by 2011, growing at an annual rate of 6.8 per cent, the study stated. -- AP<br><br></div>

I agree with you that all businesses have a beginning and its never easy to make it. So for the businessmen who risked so much of their time and efforts, they should be compensated accordingly. I think in terms of competitiveness, singapore is lacking behind countires like China. We can certainly benefit from more enthusiasm to venture out, take risks and make more money.<br><br>However, you are missing some vital points. In society, there are always people of different abilities, their needs and wants are also different. Some are born generals, others maybe the officers, sergeants and even the men. We all have our roles in the society, no matter how big or insignificant, we as a whole, the best, the worst shape up the society.<br><br>You need to realise that not everyone are privileged from the start, family upbringing, opportunities and to a very large extent luck plays a big part in shaping a person's life or success.<br><br>I can't help but feel that you were alittle insensitive to the poor. The ones hoging out to make ends meet.<br><br>Its easy to say, who ask you never work hard? Or you could have studied harder mah, or dont complain, just work harder and earn more lor.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, i dont suggest the rich subsidising for the poor, in singapore's case, i think the income gap is really a problem.<br><br>I recently found out that the cleaner in macdonald's are getting below 3dollars per hour.  I think thats ridiculous!!! Its cheap labour!<br><br>What is happening in singapore???<br><br></div>
