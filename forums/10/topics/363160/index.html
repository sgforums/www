              <p><strong>The Kent Ridge Common, 7 Jun 2009, Kelvin Teo</strong><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Same old numbers game, same old story</strong></span></span><br> <br> <img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20090119/tanyongsoon.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> SINGAPORE - We have another game in numbers, and this time round, it is
              the ranking of Singapore’s civil service vis-à-vis that of other
              nations in Asia. The study was interestingly conducted by the Hong
              Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy culminating in a 12
              page report. Its verdict? Singapore’s civil service is the most
              efficient as compared with its Asian counterparts, but on the negative
              side and I quote “<span style="color: red;"><strong>during
              difficult times - or when mistakes are made that reflect badly on the
              system - there is a tendency among bureaucrats to circle the wagons in
              ways that lack transparency and make accountability difficult</strong></span>.”<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">The interesting aspect of the study was that it was conducted through a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">poll of </span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1,274 expatriates working in 12 North and South Asian nations </span>on the efficiency of bureaucrats in those countries.</span></strong> The first criticism that comes to mind is sample bias. Why is this so?
              The first reason is due to the fact that companies would usually get
              their local employees to deal directly with the bureaucrats from the
              civil service. It is a common sense approach because the locals would
              be more familiar with the civil service of their countries. Thus, <span style="color: red;"><strong>one will query if the 1274 expatriates deal with the bureaucrats directly.</strong></span> Secondly, even if these expatriates do deal with the civil service, <span style="color: red;"><strong>it
              is possible that the bureaucrats could have adopted an accommodating
              approach, especially if the government wants to attract multi-national
              corporations (MNCs) or foreign-direct investments (FDI).</strong></span> And
              since the civil service is the face of the government, obviously they
              would want to leave behind a good impression. For instance, when the
              Singapore government went into Suzhou, the latter had the support of
              the Chinese president. And the Singapore consortium was accorded
              freedom over planning and land-use, something that was unprecedented in
              China, and enjoyed a break from handing tax revenues to the provincial
              and central authorities.<br> <br> Thus, <span style="color: red;"><strong>it would have been more appropriate if
              the studies surveyed those who have dealt directly with the civil
              service which would obviously include the locals. And they should have
              solicited the views of representatives from local businesses of every
              country who have dealt with the civil service.</strong></span> Not only
              would the results be more accurate, but they would get insightful
              feedbacks from the local representatives on the nitty gritty realities
              of dealing with the civil service.<br> <br> The part which criticizes the civil service for circling around
              difficult issues with lack of transparency and accountability is an old
              story, which has been rehashed over and over again in the blogosphere. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Type
              in the words “SAF” + Cover + up + Singapore” on the Google search
              engine and one could find pages alleging cover ups by SAF, especially
              in incidents which reflect badly on the latter</strong></span></span>. And such have arisen due to the lack of disclosure regarding major incidents, which resulted in injuries or deaths. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>And
              who could ever forget the 2 NTU professors who were chided by then
              Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen for alleging in a report that 90% of the
              jobs went to foreigners?</strong></span></span> And the professors’ defense was that they got their data from the Manpower Ministry! Back then, <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>everyone
              was asking this question - why consider Singaporeans and Permanent
              Residents as a whole? What is the exact numbers of Singaporeans and
              Permanent Residents?</strong></span></span> Obviously, observers were hoping that the Manpower Ministry would disclose such exact numbers with regards to employment. <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Up till today, this question remains unanswered.<br> </strong></span></span> <br> The headlines screamed:”Most efficient civil service” because the
              report of the study reflected well on our civil service. Another feel
              good piece. But <strong><span style="color: red;">this
              12 page report by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy reads
              more like “An opinion piece by 1274 expatriates on the civil services
              of Asian countries” as opposed to an objective ranking exercise.</span></strong><br> <br> ------------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;">Latest update as <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/"><strong>Singapore News Alternative</strong></a>:<br> <br> 1.

              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Who is PERC?</strong></span><br> Singapore Democrat, 22 Sep 2008<br> <br> The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy or PERC, as it is commonly
              referred to, is held in high praise by Singapore's establishment.<br> <br> Mr Lee Kuan Yew himself placed the organisation in the same esteemed
              group with global institutions like the International Bar Association
              (IBA). That is, until IBA criticised the Judiciary, which then made it
              a Western liberal NGO out to do this island in.<br> <br> The Minister Mentor is not the only one, Ministers Mentee also cite the company whenever they get the chance.<br> <br> The Straits Times regularly carries prominent reports written by it.<br> <br> "Non-government" think-tanks like the Singapore Institute of International Affairs cannot resist citing it<br> <br> Even our Supreme Court proudly refers to it.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>So who or what is this group that is so admired by Singapore's establishment? Who runs this outfit and what does it do?</strong></span><br> <br> PERC's website tells us that it is a "consulting firm specializing in
              strategic business information and analysis for companies" doing
              business in East and Southeast Asia. It also produces a range of risk
              reports on the strengths and weaknesses of individual countries in the
              region. So far so solid.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>But when it comes to information about who runs the organisation, the website is rather diffident. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For example under "Senior Management", there is only one name -- a Robert Broadfoot </span>who is described as an economics graduate “directly responsible for managing PERC's research and consulting.”</strong></span><br> <br> Is there a governing board? If yes, who is on it? If no, i<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>s PERC a sole-proprietorship?</strong></span></span> Does anyone else run the organisation with Mr Broadfoot?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Based in Hong Kong, PERC says it “coordinates a
              team of researchers and analysts” but doesn't tell us who they are, how
              many there are, and what their areas of expertise are. Do they work
              full-time for the Consultancy or on an ad hoc project basis? If
              part-time, what are their main occupations and what companies do they
              work for?</strong></span><br> <br> The organisation also avers its "complete independence from any vested interest groups." <span style="color: red;"><strong>Several
              lines below, however, it says that it engages in "retainer work and
              specific projects" and "in-house briefings" for international business
              associations. Who these groups and associations are is not revealed.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Such information is important
              as it allows the reader a gauge of just how independent the
              organisation is and, by extension, how reliable its reports are. </strong></span></span>This
              is especially salient when the reports are cited by governments for
              political purposes. Simply asserting that the company is completely
              independent does not make it so.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>For example one of its analysts, Mr Bruce Gale, is also a senior writer with the Straits Times.</strong></span></span> Whether he continues to work for PERC is unclear as the website has no information on him.<br> <br> Given the nature of the state-media arrangement in Singapore, it is
              more than fair to ask what an employee of an organisation that is
              supposed to have "complete independence" is doing writing for a
              newspaper owned and run by a government. It is imperative that PERC
              makes clear the status of Mr Gale.<br> <br> Ironically, Mr Gale himself notes that "most political risk assessment
              remains both superficial and subjective. Typically, such analysis is
              very informal, consisting of little more than a few brief visits to the
              country..."<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Even the information about the surveys that PERC
              conducts such as the kinds of questions asked, the variables used, the
              sample characteristics, etc are not readily available.</strong></span> One
              assumes that they are contained in the reports which cost US$645 to
              subscribe annually. Analysis of the reliability and validity of such
              surveys is lacking. This is a problem. Yet, the results are held next
              to biblical truth by those who benefit from it.<br> <br> The next and obvious question is: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Who pays for PERC's services? </strong></span></span>One
              will not be surprised to find Singapore's establishment a ready
              customer. For example, the Nanyang Technological University and the
              National Institute of Education are online subscribers to the
              organisation's Monthly Risk reports.<br> <br> And what do these reports contain? The page tells us that the topics
              covered are "Politics, Economics, Business." Politics? The Singapore
              Democrats can confirm that PERC has never attempted to seek our views
              on matters political in Singapore. We're unsure if the Consultancy has
              interviewed any other opposition party or civil society group. We could
              easily find out by doing a search on its website. The only problem is
              the website doesn't have a Search button.<br> <br> Given that the organisation is so oft-quoted by the Singapore establishment, <span style="color: red;"><strong>it is time that more questions are asked of PERC which must do a better job of providing background information about itself.</strong></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A consultancy that assesses the political and economic risk of countries must surely understand the importance of transparency.</strong></span><br> <br> <br> ------------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;">Latest update as <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/"><strong>Singapore News Alternative</strong></a>:<br> <br> 1.
