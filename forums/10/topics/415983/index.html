               is a report put together by some members of the audience at Friday 
              (Political Dialogue @NUSS)’s forum who wish to remain anonymous.</em></p>
              <p>Last
               Friday we joined  a happy and well behaved crowd at a lively debate 
              organised By NUSS as guest  of the Reform party The debate titled, Fresh
               Challenges &amp; The New Political Playing Field was debated by 
              representatives from The PAP, WP, SDA, SDP and an NMP. Despite being 
              open only to NUS alumni members and invited guests the auditorium was 
              packed as we joined the 400 strong crowd in the audience.  What a great 
              night we had. Truly awesome.</p>
              <p>The speakers spoke in alphabetical 
              order starting with an NMP Mr Calvin Cheng who spoke about the changing 
              demographic brought about by young voters and this internet generation. 
              Interestingly Kenneth Jeyartenam later also spoke about this, bringing 
              up the statistics for first time voters and those under 35 this coming 
              GE.  Whereas RP believes that will bring a new aspect to this election 
              as that generation are not  easily hoodwinked  the NMP was of the 
              opinion that they aren’t interested in bread and butter issues and 
              furthermore there isn’t any new playing field.</p>
              <p>Next MP Chris De 
              Souza spoke for the PAP waxing lyrical about all the marvellous new 
              highways byways and hospitals that the PAP has built or is planning. He 
              also demonstrated with slides and statistics how Singapore has recovered
               from the economic crisis of 2008 whilst those poor lesser nations such 
              as America were still languishing.  There was no mention of lift 
              upgrading projects.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee Soon Juan spoke for the SDP,  focusing
               on their alternative economic plan for increased egalitarianism .  He 
              gave a good talk as usual, evoking all the right emotions in his 
              audience. His talk on the SDP manifesto was well received by the 
              audience and whetted our appetite to see the full version in print.</p>
              <p>Mrs
               Lina Chiam spoke for the SDA. in her first public debate. She started 
              off hesitantly but spoke well in a down to earth way that the audience 
              clearly connected with. She is to be admired for standing and not taking
               the easy life and this is in itself an indication of how robust the 
              desire for plural democracy is in Singapore.  It also bodes well for the
               democratic process within the opposition that they forwarded two Women 
              speakers. The PAP we note, has only one woman minister after 50 years in
               government.  Mrs Chiam threw light on her experience of the political 
              playing field and the challenges facing the opposition gleaned from 
              supporting her husband MP, Mr Chiam See Tong.</p>
              <p>Ms Sylvia Lim, 
               NCMP, spoke for the WP. She focused on the tilted playing field 
              manufactured by the PAP and the need for an alternate voice in 
              parliament. Amongst ourselves we felt this  the same as asking for more 
              NMPs and a rather disappointing argument for a party which is a veteran 
              of so many campaigns.  There is no denying that she spoke well and 
              smoothly, as befits her experience as the Grand Dame of the opposition.</p>
              <p>Kenneth Jeyaretnam spoke  for the Reform Party. His speech can be found at:</p>
              <p><a href="http://votingrp.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/fresh-challenges-and-the-new-political-playing-field/">http://votingrp.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/fresh-challenges-and-the-new-political-playing-field/</a> </p>
              <p>He
               started by demonstrating how dysfunctional the political system is and 
              therefore how skewed the political playing field. He went on to talk  
              about the challenges. In complete reverse to the PAP speaker he felt 
              that the playing field had changed whilst the challenges remained the 
              same although worsened. His  main thesis for a changed playing field was
               his experience that Opposition are beginning to move towards a 
              manifesto based campaign style rather than a personality based one and 
              that clear divisions can start to be seen between socialist agenda 
              parties and the RP which has a liberal free market policy. He used the 
              analogy that Singapore is often likened to a corporation but showed us 
              how run by the PAP it is the  worst type of corporation with no 
              management accountability that dilutes its shareholders just as PAP 
              increases our population. He said immigration was a hot button issue but
               wouldn’t be hot enough to burn if we had an accountable and responsive 
              government. In the Q &amp; A session Calvin Cheng wrongly referred to 
              the RP as Libertarian and Kenneth quickly corrected him, briefly 
              explaining the difference between Liberal and Libertarian and RP 
              policies which make it at odds with a libertarian stance.</p>
              <p>The Q&amp;A session kicked off with;</p>
              <p> “<strong>Would
                the PAP would consider reforming the political system so as to 
              encourage more seats to be contested and for more Opposition MPs to be 
              elected to Parliament?”</strong></p>
              <p>Chris de Souza answered first and
               proceeded to speak for so long that we thought the Q&amp;A would be 
              over before anyone else got to speak! Finally someone stood up and 
              actually asked the moderator to get him to sit down!  Despite speaking 
              for so long he added nothing new.  He pointed out how kind the PAP had 
              been to allow alternative “voices” into Parliament in the form of NCMP 
              scheme even though these were all candidates who were technically 
              losers. (Mr de Souza, one of the MPs in the Bukit Timah-Holland GRC got 
              into Parliament last GE through a walkover and therefore didn’t lose a 
              single vote.)   Sylvia Lim said that she had spoken in Parliament about 
              how the PAP had introduced further antidemocratic “safeguards” whose aim
               was to make life difficult for an Opposition government should one come
               to power. These included an ostensibly “elected” president (but only 
              candidates vetted by a government committee would be allowed to run).  
              Kenneth  pointed out that the system had been engineered to distort the 
              will of the electorate as elaborated in his speech.</p>
              <p><strong>Minimum Wage Policy</strong></p>
              <p>There
               were quite a few questioners asking about the minimum wage policy. 
              Chris de Souza tried to make some issue over whether minimum wage would 
              apply to Singaporeans uniquely or both Singaporeans and foreign workers.
               He repeated the old arguments that it would create unemployment.</p>
              <p>KJ
               spoke up for RP’s Minimum wage policy proposal saying it was necessary 
              to stop the wages for low-skilled workers being driven down to the 
              lowest levels in Asia. In response to the PAP’s argument about 
              unemployment he said that the RP wanted to build a high-wage 
              high-productivity economy, one like Switzerland rather than just pay 
              lip-service to this as SM Goh did some years back when he talked about 
              Singaporeans attaining a Swiss standard of living. If we lost those low 
              wage, low value-added jobs that were largely done by foreigners to 
              neighbouring countries he added, then so be it! As an interesting side 
              note for historians: Dr Chee said that the SDP had been the first party 
              to propose a Minmum Wage policy but Kenneth informed us that  in the 
              1980’s he used to write the economic policy for  his father and 
              remembered being asked to write an article for the Hammer on  Minimum 
              Wage. People often criticised JBJ for  being too focussed on Human 
              rights and not on bread and butter issues and so it is fascinating to 
              see that he had a handle on minimum wage policy even back then.</p>
              <p><strong>Opposition Unity</strong></p>
              <p>Other
               questions touched on why the Opposition could not unite to fight the 
              next GE. KJ said that these continual calls for Opposition unity were 
              misplaced as one could not expect parties with very different ideologies
               to unite. In his opinion the political playing field was changing and 
              it was becoming increasingly manifesto based.  Sylvia also agreed that 
              it was difficult to ask parties with different agendas to Unite. KJ felt
               that calls for unity were designed to make the electorate think that 
              the parties were all the same and therefore interchangeable. This would 
              allow PAP to tar them all with the same brush and obscure the Reform 
              Party’s radically different message of manifesto and policy-based 
              politics.</p>
              <p>A young woman in the audience said that her Social 
              Science textbook failed to contain any information about Opposition 
              parties.  This caused a lot of merriment in the audience. She asked 
              where she could get information on them and KJ pointed her to RP’s 
              strong and growing online presence and listed our website, the VotingRp 
              blog, our FB pages and our Twitter account as places she could go to for
               information.</p>
              <p>At one point Chris de Souza tried to bring out that 
              old chestnut again, that only the PAP had the competence and  the policy
               experience to govern. Kenneth shot back immediately with, “that is what
               the Civil Service is for.”  He added that RP possessed no inferiority 
              complex about the quality of our first slate of candidates and the 
              intellectual foundations of our policies and manifesto which were 
              superior to the PAP’s.</p>
              <p><strong>Freak election result</strong></p>
              <p>Towards
               the end Dr. Wong Wee Nam asked what would happen in the event of a hung
               Parliament.  Kenneth replied that he saw no reason to think that the 
              Opposition parties would be unable to cooperate and form a government 
              and pointed out the UK precedent where the Conservatives and Lib-Dem 
              Parties, despite being sworn enemies before the election, had united to 
              form a coalition government. Also the Malaysian Opposition parties had 
              shown they could work together effectively despite vastly different 
              ideologies.</p>
              <p>The debate couldn’t have ended better for the Reform Party as Chris de Souza jumped in at that point. </p>
              <p><strong>Christopher de Souza:” It would be a sad day for Singapore if a freak result happens.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Kenneth Jeyaretnam: “How could it be a freak result if it is the will of the people?”</strong></p>
              <p>This was met with a round of wild clapping and cheering and on that note the Q&amp;A ended.</p>
              <p> .</p>
