              <p><strong><span> Chiam’s Still standing </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>He’s survived a stroke, party infighting to set his eyes on the ‘Holy Grail’: A GRC win <br><br>  Weekend • February 28, 2009<br><br> Loh Chee Kong
              <br><br>cheekong@mediacorp.com.sg
              <br><br><br><br> IF POLITICS could be likened to a game of chess, this grand old man of
              Opposition politics readily concedes that he is still a novice at
              disguising his next moves.
              <br><br>Which is why Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong, 73, is making
              extra efforts to conceal the details of what he hopes would be a
              fitting finale to his eventful political career — even as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he declared
              that he already has a team in place to contest for a Group
              Representation Constituency (GRC) in the next General Election, due by
              February 2012. </strong></span><br><br>During a 90-minute chat over coffee at the Botanic Gardens
              with Weekend Xtra recently, Mr Chiam gave precious little information
              away, albeit with constant reminders from his wife Lina.
              <br><br>Said Mr Chiam: “I’ve learnt my lesson in the 1979 by-election.
              I was afraid of a three-cornered fight so I made the announcement that
              I was going to contest in Potong Pasir. And you know who they put
              there? Howe Yoon Chong (the late former minister), the strongest
              candidate they had.” <br><br>“I already have a team. We have one doctor, one accountant,
              two lawyers,” he continued before Mrs Chiam interjected: “We cannot
              reveal everything.” <br><br>Still, Mr Chiam did reveal that the team would be mostly made
              up of candidates who had fought elections before. His aim, he said, is
              to give residents in the GRC he is eyeing “a chance to vote”. <br><br>His comments have narrowed down the potential list to five
              GRCs, based on the current electoral boundaries: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Holland-Bukit Timah,
              West Coast, Jurong, Hong Kah and Bishan-Toa Payoh. </strong></span><br><br>These are the five-member GRCs which were uncontested in the 2006 elections.
              <br><br>In past elections, the Opposition parties’ limited resources
              saw them contest in geographical clusters, not least to maximise their
              logistics during the daily hustings. <br><br>With Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC right next to his Potong Pasir
              single-seat ward, could Mr Chiam be setting his sights on the
              constituency currently helmed by two heavyweight ministers in the form
              of Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and Education Minister Ng Eng
              Hen? <br><br>Mr Chiam shot back: “If you were me, where would you stand?” 
              <br><br>While he does not expect elections to be held this year amid
              the economic downturn, Mr Chiam said<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> he plans to air the issues of Mas
              Selamat’s escape, ministerial salaries, the investment losses incurred
              by town councils and Temasek Holdings, and the plight of the less
              privileged should the polls be called anytime soon. </strong></span><br><br>The passage of time and ailing health have obviously blunted
              the aggressiveness that served him so well over the years. But the
              dormant fighting spirit was easily stirred. <br><br>Asked whether he was forsaking his Potong Pasir residents for
              the pursuit of personal glory, Mr Chiam stressed: “I’m not being
              selfish ... in fact I’m making a big sacrifice. But I have to do that
              for the sake of the Opposition in Singapore. I should get out of my
              comfort zone.” <br><br>When asked if he should have done it much earlier, Mr Chiam —
              the Singapore People’s Party secretary-general who chairs the Singapore
              Democratic Alliance — said he was “not as well-established as now”. <br><br>In attempting to strike a psychological blow to the People’s
              Action Party (PAP) by targeting what has become the Holy Grail for the
              Opposition, Mr Chiam feels he has “nothing to lose”. <br><br>He added:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> “Every fibre in my body tells me I must stand in a GRC in the next round ... maybe it’s my political instincts.” </strong></span><br><br>And he is “quietly confident” of coming up tops in this high-stakes gamble — even if he is just banking on his reputation. 
              <br><br>Having already sounded out the ground sentiments in that
              particular GRC, Mr Chiam is convinced the affection shown to him by
              Potong Pasir residents extends to other parts of Singapore. “My friend
              has a theory: Singapore is a small island ... what people think in one
              area, it’s most likely that people in other areas think so too.” <br><br>Alluding to how fresh PAP candidates “ride on the coat-tails
              of the ministers”, his wife said: “I believe you need an icon to win a
              GRC ... hopefully the Opposition can ride on the coat-tails of my
              husband.” <br><br>Mrs Chiam added: “A lot of people have come up to my husband,
              even when we are on a cruise or overseas. They tell him they are
              jealous of Potong Pasir residents for having the chance to vote.” <br><br> <br><br>HEALTH MATTERS
              <br><br>With Mr Chiam’s health under the spotlight, his wife spoke out
              against those who doubt whether her husband could still perform his MP
              duties in Potong Pasir — let alone cope with the demands of running a
              GRC should he win one.
              <br><br>Pointing out that Mr Chiam has done “very well” to get back on
              his feet since he suffered a stroke last year, she said: “As a wife, I
              feel you should give the man a chance ... it takes time to recover from
              a stroke.” <br><br>Mr Chiam added: “Nobody has the right to ask me to step down.
              Only the residents have the right. If they tell me so, I will step
              down.” <br><br>Fellow Opposition member, National Solidarity Party president
              Sebastian Teo, felt Mr Chiam is the best judge of his own health. Said
              Mr Teo: “If his condition is getting worse, it goes without saying that
              he should have more time for himself. But from what I hear, he seems to
              be getting better.” <br><br>Former PAP MP Wang Kai Yuen pointed out that a Member of Parliament’s duty “is to the electorate”. 
              <br><br>“It is up to the constituents to decide whether he is suitable to remain in Parliament,” said Dr Wang.
              <br><br>Staying in Parliament is what Mr Chiam has done for 25
              uninterrupted years. The secret to his political longevity? Adapting
              his brand of politics to what people want, or “riding the tide” in his
              own words. <br><br>Mr Chiam concurred with Weekend Xtra’s perception that he has
              evolved from a national politician with a grand vision of a “two-party”
              system when he first broke onto the political scene in 1976; to a
              hands-on politician focusing on municipal issues; and most recently, an
              “underdog” politician seen as a symbol of the Opposition. <br><br>He said: “It’s not me who has changed, it’s the constituents
              who have. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One thing I’ve learnt from my time as a politician is that
              what people want is a very powerful force. It’s like fashion .... it’s
              very difficult to change a trend.” </strong></span></span></p>

              <p>by Yaw Shin Leong</p>
              <p>I refer to the article ‘Chiam’s Still Standing’ (TODAY, 28th Feb 2009)<br><br>Uncle
                  Chiam’s decision to reveal his cards at this stage is not a surprise to
                  me. After all he was the master tactician who engineered the 1991
                  By-Election effect, which was effective enough, to see 4 members of the
                  opposition camp entered Parliament, the largest ever, since the
                  historical walkout by 13 Barisan Socialists’ MPs.<br><br>As the
                  Chairman of WP’s Central Area Committee, who was tasked by WP’s
                  leadership at the end of GE2006 to oversee cultivation of alternative
                  grassroots mechanisms in Ang Mo Kio GRC, Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC &amp; Yio
                  Chu Kang SMC. (Especially in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, which has never been
                  contested since the inception of GRC politics.) Naturally I read Uncle
                  Chiam’s revelation with mixed-feelings.<br><br>Personally, Uncle Chiam
                  is unquestionably my hero. He is someone whom I respect deeply. From
                  May 1999 to April 2000, when I was an active member of Potong Pasir
                  grassroots, Uncle Chiam was a fatherly figure to me, who mentored and
                  imparted in me political values, ideals and principles. Few months
                  back, both Uncle Chiam &amp; his wife even took time off to grace my
                  traditional wedding banquet celebrations. <br><br>Organizationally,
                  I’m slightly disappointed. This is because quiet grassroots cultivation
                  efforts have been put in by dedicated members of WP Central Area
                  Committee over the past 20 months. Refer to some photos of our activism
                  <a href="http://www.wp.sg/cac/photos.htm">here</a>. Recently, we even convened a WP Central Area Committee GE Task Force to plan for the possibility of snap elections. <br><br>Strategically,
                  this is certainly a deliberately calculated move by SPP/ SDA. There are
                  obvious strategic advantages in signaling their intentions early.
                  Political watchers could easily point out the increased level of
                  political activities over the last 20 months by several opposition
                  parties within Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC. As such this revelation by SPP/
                  SDA will certainly result in opposition parties re-thinking about our
                  strategic deployments.<br><br>Politically, I can understand where Uncle
                  Chiam is coming from. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I will do whatever within my ability to ensure
                  that a three-Corner fight with SPP/ SDA is avoided in Bishan-Toa Payoh
                  GRC.</strong></span> However in politics, there must a form of give-&amp;-take. Between
                  the SPP/ SDA &amp; WP leadership level, we must commence informal
                  negotiations soon. <br><br>Perhaps a gentlemanly switch between SPP/
                  SDA’s last contested Pasir Ris - Ponggol GRC and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC
                  would be ideal? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps…</p>
