Once in, you will be scrutinised, slimed and attacked from all angles by the ruling party.<br><br>Just look at the way Manpower minister Ng Eng Hen openly lambasted Sylvia Chang and for what? Wild claims of inexperience? Failing to retract the WP manifesto based on PAP-claims that it is dangerously incorrect?<br><br>Is he saying he is vastly experienced in politics? If his outburst is a measurement of his ability, it merely reflects his INEXPERIENCE by 'bullying' a fellow political adversary (and incidently a woman), showing his deepseated insecurity and the party's unwillingness to let the PEOPLE decide.<br><br>To such an extent is his (and the PAP's) arrogance that they presume to dictate how other parties should present their manifesto.<br><br>The reserved and measured response from the WP should be applauded, indicatinig their resolve NOT to get into a labelling match with the Ruling party, one which may lead to the cowardly DEFAMATION suits of the past.<br><br>An incident such as the above serves to highlight the psychological impact a possibly average-only opposition party could inflict on the fears and insecurity of the Ruling Party.<br><br>Imagine if a generation of scholars DEFECTED to opposition parties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. I think in the long-run, Singapore ideally needs an opposition strong enough to balance the political scene. An apathetic Singapore will screw us in the long run.<br><br>However, I don't think the ruling party feels that way. Its most senior leaders, with the exception of Rajaratnam because I have read his quote, don't believe in an active vibrant democracy in Singapore. An autocratic state looking after obedient population working for $$$ best suits an Asian state with Asian values.<br><br>Many of the core leadership, as we all know, are not really chosen by the people. They are chosen by the Old Guard and of course there will be continuity of policy. I think unless there is a change of leadership or reform within the PAP, I don't think Opposition will gain much ground in Singapore. My only hope is that PAP leaders will one day be enlightened enough to forsee the flaws of lack of political participation and opposition.</div>

Do you feel Singapore need strong opposition parties?</div></blockquote>Uh... I don't know what you guys think of this. But this idea has been cropping up in my head.<br><br>I have observed the political development of many SE and E Asian states. They are all remarkably similar in a way that the ruling party that won the state independence from the colonial rulers often stay in power for very very long. Look at Arroyo, Megawati, Suharto, Chiang Kai Shek and Gandhi families. They eventually fell under political opposition, but not after staying in power for decades.<br><br>Indonesia and Taiwan used to be almost one-party states, very much like Singapore now. But as time passed and the older generation of founding fathers passed on, democracy gradually flourished as politicians scrambled to fill in the political vacuum left behind by the titans.</div>

The top guns in PAP are very rich people.</div>
