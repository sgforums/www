              <p>You are right, i have the same thought.</p>
              <p>The ruling party will not do anything without the motive to benefit themselves.   </p>
              <p>At least, you posted sensible thread which is not repetitive.   Take a look at the residential running dog called knnbpcb16, he is running dog of PAP&gt;</p>

              <p>Yup...i get headaches by all his posts and threads until i cant be bothered to read them.</p>
              <p>To be honest, i will be saddened the day i have to vote against PAP. Before anybody starts their 'im a running dog for PAP' remark, let me explain....</p>
              <p>i have not seen enough of the opposition to vote them in anyway. All i see in their websites (eg SDP) is mostly (not entirely) a articles condemning or stating the obvious about PAP's failures. We need solutions!</p>
              <p>I need a government that works for the people; regardless of race, language or religion; regardless of status or wealth. A Government that is on the ground to understand the poeple's concerns and problems. I dont want to see them only MP sessions or near elections. I want to see them on a random basis to 'inspect' the ground where they serve. I need a government that put locals before foreigners.</p>
              <p>I need a Government that is neither PAP nor SDP nor WP etc. I need a Government that is all that is good in all of them.</p>

              <p>True though seriously, it is sad if we have to vote out the present Government for the sake of voting them out when in fact, the reality is, the opposition has also not provided us with enough evidences that they can run the country better.</p>
              <p>As i said, im disappointed with the present condition we are in and PAP is definitely at fault for some of the situation we are in. But can the opposition do better? That we can be sure they can provide a better future? Like i said, all they talk about is what we all talk about and already know; pointing out PAP's mistakes. I do not need them to state the obvious. I need them to provide the solutions.</p>
              <p>I believe that if the opposition can detail to us their solutions, many will switch over. Even GRCs will not be able to stop an ever-growing opposition support.</p>

                                <p>True though seriously, it is sad if we have to vote out the
                                present Government for the sake of voting them out when in fact,
                                the reality is, the opposition has also not provided us with enough
                                evidences that they can run the country better.</p>
                                <p>As i said, im disappointed with the present condition we are in
                                and PAP is definitely at fault for some of the situation we are in.
                                But can the opposition do better? That we can be sure they can
                                provide a better future? Like i said, all they talk about is what
                                we all talk about and already know; pointing out PAP's mistakes. I
                                do not need them to state the obvious. I need them to provide the
                                solutions.</p>
                                <p>I believe that if the opposition can detail to us their
                                solutions, many will switch over. Even GRCs will not be able to
                                stop an ever-growing opposition support.</p>

              Unless the opposition can garner a large percentage of votes with their solutions to put themselves into government, you might find that their solutions will become PAP ministers' award-winning solutions one day. Then you again lament that oppositions don't offer solutions when in fact they may already have.
              
              <p>If you don't give oppositions a chance, how can you know whether they will succeed or fail?
                     
              </p><p>Do you want to continue voting for the present PAP candidates bearing in mind that they had already become out of touch with the people and the mistakes they had made in recent years? Do you have the confidence in them to improve the lives of the people and to bring the country to greater heights in years to come ?
              
              </p><p>Well, let's see what tricks the PAP will come up for the elections this time.</p>
