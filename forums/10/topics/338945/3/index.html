              <p>The point is, all of you had been asking the wrong question.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Ask not why TKL want 100,000 signatures</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ask yourself why you want to sign the petition! </span>(There is a difference). TKL might want this 100,000 signatures to boost his courage before facing the darkside. While the reason for common people like us to sign the petition for him vary from one person to another.</p>
              <p>But want to I am sure is, when 100,000 people signed for him. It make a very STRONG statement to PAP. Here is what PAP will fear:</p>
              <p>1. We are the one that bring you (PAP) up to that position</p>
              <p>2. So now, we are bringing TKL up to show you that we PEOPLE do have the power to bring you down anytime if you don't watch out!</p>
              <p>I choose to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sign the petition</span> myself, because I am sick of sitting here typing into my keyboard and wish for thing to happen. I have enough and here is my chance to voice it out as a PEOPLE of the country. Well? I take it before it is gone.</p>
              <p>It is okay both of you don't wish to or hesitate to sign. But remember this, you are the same as the 66% voter that gave up their chance to make a statement but choose not to. Therefore, please don't complain HDB issue, TC , Terrorist etc. Like M&amp;M said, you mandated them to do this.</p>

              <p>Do you know that OTC is very much loyal to PAP until the end? Go and read his interview with the Malaysia Journlist, you did find out on that. In actual fact, the whole conversation is like OTC know something but did not want to disclose.</p>
              <p>Of course his contribution to the people is undeniable. However, not in MRT like <a href="../../../users/238378">mlmersrlosers</a> said. His most impressive contribution is the revision of Labour Law that better the coverage of worker and some other health &amp; Safety regulations.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, MRT was proposed by the M&amp;M after several of his visit to the Europe and especially England where he was impressed by their TUBE system and want to do something similar in Singapore. Just like M&amp;M went to China and saw the great wall, he came back and instructed the building of Tang City at Tmn Jurong which had been left rotten for years.</p>
              <p>I believed "stripping naked" in front of PAP had always been the way of Dr. CSJ, which is noble I would say to create politic awareness of Singapore Political Oppression.

              <p>Do you know that OTC is very much loyal to PAP until the end? Go and read his interview with the Malaysia Journlist, you did find out on that. In actual fact, the whole conversation is like OTC know something but did not want to disclose.</p>
              <p>Of course his contribution to the people is undeniable. However, not in MRT like <a rel="nofollow" href="/users/238378">mlmersrlosers</a> said. His most impressive contribution is the revision of Labour Law that better the coverage of worker and some other health &amp; Safety regulations.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, MRT was proposed by the M&amp;M after several of his visit to the Europe and especially England where he was impressed by their TUBE system and want to do something similar in Singapore. Just like M&amp;M went to China and saw the great wall, he came back and instructed the building of Tang City at Tmn Jurong which had been left rotten for years.</p>

              <p>LKY is great in building Singapore, a wise man should knows when to stop - Obsession Kills</p>
              <p>CSJ is great in destroying himself and was apparently "strip naked" by the lees. At least he is gutsy enough to throw in all</p>
              <p>If TKL hasn't the gut to share his intentions, do you think he has the gut to go against the powerful?</p>

              <p>LOL, seyKai</p>
              <p>You really think so? Old man die, PAP split? Tell me, why they want to split when each of them hold such high disgusting pay and doing nothing? Do you have any idea why after LHL up the seat, all old PAP guards are gone retire? M&amp;M say country need to change new blood!</p>
              <p>You think you have think further? LKY think more far than you seyKai. If all of you still remember what M&amp;M said before, if Singapore is in CHAOS, he will jump out from his coffin and set everything right (and you better take it by face value)!</p>
              <p>Of course, he don't mean it literally! What he meant was that all possible way for PAP to defect had been tackled and allo leaks had been sealed! Unless you want to wait for LHL to pass away for Singapore to change, then you just carry on waiting. PAP will never defect even after LKY pass away. You know whay?</p>
              <p>Because PAP guards are so deep into the shit pit that even if they defected, <span style="color: #ff0000;">people like you will think that he is just another TKL!</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">and no one will believe him! </span></p>
