              <p>Just some thoughts:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TKL looks like a decent guy, passionate to help the people. However, I also feel he has an axe to grind with PAP. 30 years with NTUC and after he left, criticised them. That wouldn't be happening if it was an amicable parting of ways, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps he also feels that the PAP is not listening enough to the voice of the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, the PAP are watching him.....waiting for his first stumble. His crowds are dwindling at Hong Lim by the saturdays. Last evening was only 200. People are losing faith if nothing happens. He has also engaged lawyers to help look thru the banks' sale prospectus and seeking the advice of a Queen's Counsel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If HK finally compensates the investors, Singapore will do the same. Banks, MPs and MAS are just sitting by first. If TKL does well, they will laud him and jump on the bandwagon of popular support. If TKL's efforts are in vain and investors lose faith, then the PAP will vilify him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mark these words.</p>

              <p>So you think that there is a conspiracy? It's highly unlikely in my opinion.</p>
              <p>1) Helping the mis-sold investors when MAS is just observing how HK is doing.</p>
              <p>2) 100,000 signatures trying to get some citizens involve/aware about politics in Singapore to gather support for him.</p>
              <p>3) Local media published a biased comment from Mr Chua that directly attacks Mr Tan's character. How can they even allow that?</p>
              <p>Are you sure nobody wants to be president? They were either not eligible by the government's standards or not approved by the government community which is appointed by the PAP.</p>

              <p>Why are you so sensitive of "we"? Afraid of being tracked down by "you know who"?</p>
              <p>OTC cant doesnt mean TKL cant also. Where is this sense of justice in Singaporeans? Are we cowards? What are we afraid of?</p>
              <p>That presidential seat is just a "make up" or not. I hope this time it's different, that seat must be utilized by someone who knows how to.</p>
              <p>By the way, "we" belong to the same group of eligible voters. Who you vote for is your choice. If you are pressured in voting someone or a party you dont like, something is very wrong here.</p>

              <p>Just some thoughts:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TKL looks like a decent guy, passionate to help the people.
              However, I also feel he has an axe to grind with PAP. 30 years with
              NTUC and after he left, criticised them. That wouldn't be happening
              if it was an amicable parting of ways, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps he also feels that the PAP is not listening enough to
              the voice of the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, the PAP are watching him.....waiting for his first
              stumble. His crowds are dwindling at Hong Lim by the saturdays.
              Last evening was only 200. People are losing faith if nothing
              happens. He has also engaged lawyers to help look thru the banks'
              sale prospectus and seeking the advice of a Queen's Counsel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If HK finally compensates the investors, Singapore will do the
              same. Banks, MPs and MAS are just sitting by first. If TKL does
              well, they will laud him and jump on the bandwagon of popular
              support. If TKL's efforts are in vain and investors lose faith,
              then the PAP will vilify him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mark these words.</p>

              <p>Actually TKL is nt really charismatic in my opinion. He may be a diligent politician but whether he can really garner support is a big Qn Mark. Look at his petition of 100,000 signatures, there are nt even a thousand after these few days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of us, incl. me would love to see make some noise in parliament or ask for keys to the treasury keke. Can he? Let's wait n see.</p>
