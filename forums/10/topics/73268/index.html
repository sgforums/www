Looking at the Taiwan general elections and it's outcome has actually made me more appriciative of Singapore's stable political climate. Like many people, I usually also lamenat about not enough opposition in singapore politics, and how there's just no real competition for PAP. But on the other hand, I would have hated voting if it was choosing between KMT and MCT. If the rilvary and competition is so intense that political parties had to resort to mud slinging and marketing gicmicks. When if you consider them properly, it's only a matter of choosing between the bad and the worse. At least PAP is efficient and uncorrupted (relatively). At least we know that even with zero opposition (which as far as I'm concerned, is already the case, nevermind the norminal 2 seats), PAP has been behaving itself and is still getting the job done.</div>
