              <p>Many had choosed to express their anger against the govt here. It is an outlet to voice their frustrations, and nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong is when it turns to slander. More so when political opportunists take such disenchantment to sow discord and strife amongst us citizens, using us all as tools for their despicable political ambitions.</p>
              <p>If you noticed, these slimy opportunists offers one no real solutions to help, but to stoke up the flames of discontent by adding the volitile fuel of falsehoods and half truths to burn the dismay faced by many in these current rise in inflationary pressures faced by many, not a problem created by our govt, but by events beyond our control.</p>
              <p>Rather than to go into a senseless debate with them, for they will never admit to the truth or comprehend logic, they will only insult  and show their further stupidity, helping no one. Thus this post, from a citizen to another, to share ideas on how to cope with the current times.</p>
              <p>First of all, we must understand our problems, face up to facts and only then can we confront it to seek solutions. There is no free lunch in this world. Our society, while will never abandon the weak, neither will we help those who do not wish to help themselves but to sit around all day to moan and bitch.</p>
              <p>The only way to fight inflation is to get better jobs or rise in salaries. Fighting with bosses will only ensure capital investments leave our shores, or forcing the govt for handouts will only bankrupt our next generation. Each year we get to welcome est.more than 50,000 new baby citizens, and we must ensure they have a future and are protected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education</p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>It is only through a good education that you may be able to get a better job. You will have to ensure that what you study is relevant to the industries that needs workers. Eg;-Financial Wealth management is the current hot job, CGI is another.</p>
              <p>For those who already left for work,  do go back for nite studies. There is no choice if one seeks more money. The govt will offer grants to those who wants to help themselves. As long as you qualify for a job and have the personality to match it, you will be hired. Even if you can't find a job here, your certificate will help you overseas, as a wealth manager in New York or air con mechanic in Australia.</p>
              <p>Grocery</p>
              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>The govt had done their best to scout for the cheapest sources, and to cut down on the  middlemen by buying direct from such sources. While our 3.5million population cannot fight against the international corporate shopkeepers who get better bulk discounts for billions of people such as Walmart, attempts had been made on inter-govt talks for better rates. Establishment of business ties with Russia, Vietnam, and Libya are such attempts.</p>
              <p>As long as you buy what you need, and buy house brands, you will never starve in Singapore. Furthermore, if one is truly desperate and in need of food, CDC agencies will assist to issue food vouchers. If you do know of some family who is starving, please let them know our society will help them. They only need to approach our CDC centres and show that they are incapable of helping themselves, such as handicapped, or out of job, and help will be offered.</p>
              <p>With all these help offered, it is hoped that the food bought is not wasted, and children must be taught not to waste their food.</p>
              <p>Employment</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>In these times, attitudes are very important. While it is not necessary to beg or grovel before the bosses, there is also no need to take on a confrontational role with them. Without them, we will all have no jobs.</p>
              <p>Reason and logic will move minds. Even if it doesnt, so long as we are proffesional in our duties and our work output is relevant and helps him in his profitability, there is no reason to get fired.</p>
              <p>If one is retrenched, under our laws, he is protected and entitled to retrenchment benefits. With such monies, it would be wise to upgrade oneself mentally for other jobs that are avaliable in the market.</p>
              <p>While the pay may be low in some firms, but if one shows his capability, he will be paid more in time. We are living in an era where capability is rewarded.</p>
              <p>Entreprenuership</p>
              <p>-------------------</p>
              <p>After spending years on the job, and learning from it, one may consider taking the entreprenuership approach. In our country, there are no barriers to entry, saved your own desire and mental strength. Our govt offers grants to startup in critical and relevant industries, thus you will not stand alone. The only requirement is that you must have a sound plan as well as a capable team to help build up your company.</p>
              <p>Recreation</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>Recreation costs had gone up. Thus there is a need to seek cheaper alternatives. All work and no play is not what our society wants. The beach, gardens and parks are still free.</p>
              <p>Cinema tickets are cheaper during the workdays. Furthermore, there are cheap DVDs for rental as well.</p>
              <p>Pubs are fun, but so can the neighbourhood coffee stalls as well. And it is much cheaper. $15 a mug of beer in pub vs $5.50 for a bottle in the heartlands.</p>
              <p>Homes</p>
              <p>---------</p>
              <p>Prices of home had gone up. in 1970s, the first SIT flats costs only around $15,000 for a 3 room flat. But in those days, salaries were only around $800 a month and a cup of coffee costs only 30cts.</p>
              <p>The world had changed, and costs of materials, which are largely imported, had gone up as well. And it will continue to spiral even for the next few generations to come.</p>
              <p>Thus the rise in prices. But still, a HDB 3rm flat is much more cheaper than a similar sized 99 yr leased condo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Times are hard, as it had been for our previous generations. While we have a better standard of living than some other nations, we can improve it for ourselves and the next generations, not by fighting one another over senseless issues, but critical ones that will elevate our lives further, as what our govt had been focussing on, and sadly, that which the opposition parties had been disconnected from.</p>
              <p>If you have further ideas or solution that can help our fellow citizens, you are welcome to contribute to this thread. But if your intention is to whine and bitch, please open up your own thread.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahaha - your Great Mentor Shepherd will laugh at your juvenile bravado in running away from your previous threads after being stumped by straight forward rebuttals by yours truly - in which you simply have no answers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now you are opening a new thread in the same style of a Gazelle to indoctrinate the unsuspecting with your own version of what the "Truth" should be.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a "deerHunter" has the ingenuity to re-interprete "Truth" in the different ways seen through a "cross-haired" hunting scope.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the constant viewing of the exploded view through a cross-haired scope caused your eyes to be crossed so badly that even your brains have been re-arranged ?</span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahahaha...are you criticising your Great Mentor Shepherd - and refused to learn from his efforts when he attempted to combat those in authority, who were so keen to suppress alternative views, and are afraid of the open minds, the challenges from those with different philosophies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not aware that your Great Mentor Shepherd had protested the loud mono-sycophantic sound that intend to drown out all other voices and replaced it with a monolithic idiot-logy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the 'deerHunter' ta</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ken lessons from the wrong master, or has he drawn the wrong conclusion from his efforts at plagiarising the wrong section of the great works of the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can we expect a deerHunter's narrow vision of the World when seen only through the cross-haired scope of his wimpy pop-gun ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do we need to be reminded that there is "no free lunch" when a useless deerHunter can only be weakened from his inability to even shoot straight to get his meal - will depend on the efforts of others in putting the meal on his table ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are Singaporeans incapable of being generous even to those seen to be useless in our midst - such as the juvenile 'deerHunter' with a wimpy gun?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, we have also helped those who sit around and accusing Singaporeans moaning constantly, yet these are the ones who certainly know how to help themselves with some expensive crutch that cost Singaporeans millions of dollars - simply to keep themselves from being corrupted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do Singaporeans need to pay someone from being corrupted, when it is claimed that our Reserves cannot pay half that amount to those who need to be supported ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The twisted logic of the argument has no moral foundation, and yet we will have ever willing carpet-beggars unthinkingly promote this false concept and expect it to be firmly set by constant repetition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet, the difficulties encountered by Singaporeans are so real that the repeated efforts will not sit well with any Singaporean even for the next 150 years of Singapore's History.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do we need a 'deerHunter' to plagiarise the words and be a MP3 player for the repeated broadcasting of propaganda from the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You brilliantly begin with a statement that - "<em>The only way to fight inflation is to get better jobs or rise in salary</em>" - but yet will expect Singaporeans to be work meekly as Third World cheap laborers for the foreign bosses - for fear of investments leaving our shores.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should we not expect the Government to return OUR money that you call "handouts" - when they are prepared to put Billions in the pockets of foreigners who will accept our money in return for empty shells of over-priced Companies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can the 50,000 new babies have any future, when we leave them to the money grabbing policies of the Great Mentor Shepherd - who believe that more Foreign Talents are needed to compete with the 50,000 new born babies ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain that there is enough jobs in the Financial Sector to go around ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What about those who are not inclined towards the Financial Sector - should they follow your cross-eyed vision to become another useless 'deerHunter' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely we know by now that the years of Singapore style education has left your brains unchallenged, with only the capacity in straight-line thinking - that do not move beyond even the horizontal or vertical plane. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you even know what trajectory to take with your screwed cross-haired vision in shooting a wimpy 'deerHunter' pop-gun ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, the Government has done a great job in cutting out the small time middle-men and replaced it with their own favored middle-man - <em>the NTUC FairPrice</em> - which has not been so fair in their pricing on general consumer products sold to Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How else could NTUC explain for the millions that they have accumulated if their revenues are from simple collection of union fees ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did NTUC accumulate so much funds to build a multi-million dollar Glass Tower at the hottest property spot at the corner linking the old Financial District to the new Marine Financial Hub ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are retrenchment benefits available to short term contract workers ?</span></p>

In our country, there are no barriers to entry, saved your own desire and mental strength. Our govt offers grants to startup in critical and relevant industries, thus you will not stand alone. The only requirement is that you must have a sound plan as well as a capable team to help build up your company.</p>

              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>Recreation costs had gone up. Thus there is a need to seek cheaper alternatives. All work and no play is not what our society wants. The beach, gardens and parks are still free.</p>
              <p>Cinema tickets are cheaper during the workdays. Furthermore, there are cheap DVDs for rental as well.</p>
              <p>Pubs are fun, but so can the neighbourhood coffee stalls as well. And it is much cheaper. $15 a mug of beer in pub vs $5.50 for a bottle in the heartlands.</p>

              <p>---------</p>
              <p>Prices of home had gone up. in 1970s, the first SIT flats costs only around $15,000 for a 3 room flat. But in those days, salaries were only around $800 a month and a cup of coffee costs only 30cts.</p>
              <p>The world had changed, and costs of materials, which are largely imported, had gone up as well. And it will continue to spiral even for the next few generations to come.</p>
              <p>Thus the rise in prices. But still, a HDB 3rm flat is much more cheaper than a similar sized 99 yr leased condo.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Were we not supposed to accumulate our wealth through industrialisation, and create a strong Singapore Dollar so as to import everything that we need at a much cheaper rate than we can produce for ourselves ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The generation during the Colonial Days had experienced harder times but lived in an environment in which the Colonial Government did not interfere with the market mechanism, and left a largely '<em>laissez faire</em>' environment in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was in that environment in which we have community leaders willing to stand up and help their respective communities, as well as reach out towards the other communities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Those were the community leaders that rejected the politics of a young upstart and brash English-educated lawyer, who believe himself to be smarter than everyone, especially when he could not even communicate in his own dialect, let alone in Mandarin to those in his own community. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Those were the community leaders that rejected the idea of a merger, and had supported the Barisan Sosialis in large numbers, and resulted in the harsh ways of slamming down these supposedly negative influence that obstructed merger; and led to a Referendum that was designed to wilffuly push Singapore into merger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this the same in Singapore today, when community leadership is seldom voluntary in nature, and require cajoling or even enticing with social benefits and status ?</span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahaha - your Great Mentor Shepherd will laugh at your juvenile bravado in running away from your previous threads after being stumped by straight forward rebuttals by yours truly - in which you simply have no answers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now you are opening a new thread in the same style of a Gazelle to indoctrinate the unsuspecting with your own version of what the "Truth" should be.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a "deerHunter" has the ingenuity to re-interprete "Truth" in the different ways seen through a "cross-haired" hunting scope.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the constant viewing of the exploded view through a cross-haired scope caused your eyes to be crossed so badly that even your brains have been re-arranged ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahahaha...are you criticising your Great Mentor Shepherd - and refused to learn from his efforts when he attempted to combat those in authority, who were so keen to suppress alternative views, and are afraid of the open minds, the challenges from those with different philosophies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not aware that your Great Mentor Shepherd had protested the loud mono-sycophantic sound that intend to drown out all other voices and replaced it with a monolithic idiot-logy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the 'deerHunter' ta</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ken lessons from the wrong master, or has he drawn the wrong conclusion from his efforts at plagiarising the wrong section of the great works of the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can we expect a deerHunter's narrow vision of the World when seen only through the cross-haired scope of his wimpy pop-gun ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do we need to be reminded that there is "no free lunch" when a useless deerHunter can only be weakened from his inability to even shoot straight to get his meal - will depend on the efforts of others in putting the meal on his table ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are Singaporeans incapable of being generous even to those seen to be useless in our midst - such as the juvenile 'deerHunter' with a wimpy gun?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, we have also helped those who sit around and accusing Singaporeans moaning constantly, yet these are the ones who certainly know how to help themselves with some expensive crutch that cost Singaporeans millions of dollars - simply to keep themselves from being corrupted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do Singaporeans need to pay someone from being corrupted, when it is claimed that our Reserves cannot pay half that amount to those who need to be supported ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The twisted logic of the argument has no moral foundation, and yet we will have ever willing carpet-beggars unthinkingly promote this false concept and expect it to be firmly set by constant repetition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet, the difficulties encountered by Singaporeans are so real that the repeated efforts will not sit well with any Singaporean even for the next 150 years of Singapore's History.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do we need a 'deerHunter' to plagiarise the words and be a MP3 player for the repeated broadcasting of propaganda from the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You brilliantly begin with a statement that - "<em>The only way to fight inflation is to get better jobs or rise in salary</em>" - but yet will expect Singaporeans to be work meekly as Third World cheap laborers for the foreign bosses - for fear of investments leaving our shores.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should we not expect the Government to return OUR money that you call "handouts" - when they are prepared to put Billions in the pockets of foreigners who will accept our money in return for empty shells of over-priced Companies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can the 50,000 new babies have any future, when we leave them to the money grabbing policies of the Great Mentor Shepherd - who believe that more Foreign Talents are needed to compete with the 50,000 new born babies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you expecting all 4.5 million Singaporeans to study Financial Wealth Mgt ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain that there is enough jobs in the Financial Sector to go around ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What about those who are not inclined towards the Financial Sector - should they follow your cross-eyed vision to become another useless 'deerHunter' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely we know by now that the years of Singapore style education has left your brains unchallenged, with only the capacity in straight-line thinking - that do not move beyond even the horizontal or vertical plane.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you even know what trajectory to take with your screwed cross-haired vision in shooting a wimpy 'deerHunter' pop-gun ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who are you working for in the Great Mentor office - polishing his shoes, or picking the crumbs that fall off his table on to the carpet ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">USA taking in Financial Managers - when their banking system are in disarray, and downsizing is the order of the day ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you slipped into Australia as an illegal immigrant recently and are boasting of your success, or is this just pure fantasy to an unchallenged juvenile mind ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, the Government has done a great job in cutting out the small time middle-men and replaced it with their own favored middle-man - <em>the NTUC FairPrice</em> - which has not been so fair in their pricing on general consumer products sold to Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How else could NTUC explain for the millions that they have accumulated if their revenues are from simple collection of union fees ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did NTUC accumulate so much funds to build a multi-million dollar Glass Tower at the hottest property spot at the corner linking the old Financial District to the new Marine Financial Hub ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is the Glass Tower for the benefit of the thousands of NTUC members, or for the comfort and vanity of the NTUC leadership who are all members of the MIW Team ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So Singaporeans do not need to beg or grovel, neither should we be confrontational - and what should we expect to get from ''reason and logic'' to move minds that are screwed like that of a 'deerHunter' with a narrow vision blurred by the cross-hair permanently etched in both eyes ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are Singaporeans entitled to retrenchment benefits ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not a fact that following the 2004 economic downturn - the NTUC has so cleverly pushed Singaporeans to accept the new Working Arrangements of <strong>"Short Term Renewal Contracts"</strong> - to protects bosses from going bankrupt during hard times, so that the boss can "hire and fire" according to the prevailing economic situation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are retrenchment benefits available to short term contract workers ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not a fact that the Singapore Government stand to benefit the most, as it is the largest single employer of Singaporeans throught the number of GLCs in their portfolio ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you now protecting the interest of the Great Mentor Shepherd being the Chairman of Singapore Inc ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How much food is left on your table without you having to pay a cent - in your current job as a mouthpiece extension for the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you read the other thread in which a particpant in this Speakers' Corner has highlighted his <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/321870">“nightmares dealing with a bureaucratic ACRA”. </a>?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If not, it is well and good that you do some research and understand from the many failed start-ups - when the entrepreneurs with limited funds are forced into "marriages of convenience" with bigger public or private enterprises, only to see them attempting to swallow the entire enterprise by boardroom manouvrers especially when new capital need to be raised.</span></p>

              <p>My views are my own as a private citizen sharing with another and they are not a precise reflection of the govt's policies. The govt would be in a better position to explain to you all, during our meet-the-people sessions as well as in the media when they have the opportunity to do so.</p>
              <p>I will not be so naive as to believe that ALL will agree to everything, but i do believe majority will share a similar view that we do have a capable govt in charge and are doing whatever they can to seek solutions to solve the issues we face daily. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We aren't a large nation with a big say or the ability to change strong held perceptions by larger nations. Many decisions are determined by others of which our country have no control.  </span></p>
              <p>We are just a tiny red speck on the map, according to our big brother or bully as some view them. We have to go with the flow and do our best to help our fellow citizens who may be slower than the rest, while fighting for our own sovereignity to be heard to have a chance to change perceptions and get benefits for our countrymen.</p>

              <p>Yes. I agree fully with you and understand your problem. And what would your solution be? My view is that we will have to start somewhere and get that job, or save that job. There are only limited positions at the top and companies will only want the best. Thus you would have to be the best. No matter what, we must grab opportunity and must not afford to be choosy, not in these present times.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">With the influx of FT, the salary of local have been going down. Even if you have sufficient capability, cost will always be a major deciding factor.</span></p>
              <p>I agree, worse still if you have a family to support and the FT is single, and it would be difficult for you to survive even if both draws the same salary. The trick thus is to learn from the FT and then make yourself indispensible to your boss. As long as you can show you are more capable than the FT, he will not want to lose you. Afterall, FTs are only hired because they have a skillset we dont have.</p>
              <p>But if they are hired because they are cheaper, as in the case of IT proffessionals or FW, then either you have to accept a lower pay and work your way up to be indispensible, or with your skills, seek overseas assignments to earn better salaries. Your capability is a passport to the world, ensured by our govt's emphasis on education.</p>

              <p>Of course it would be cheaper. But for the young, it is no fun. Perhaps you may consider inviting some friends over instead to watch a ballgame or movie, get a 6 pack and some chips, and you will have an atmosphere like a pub. As long as we live within our means, we should have no problems facing a tougher world.</p>
              <p>Our previous generation been there and done that, so can we. Tough times don't last, only tough people do. And you, my fellow citizen, are sons and daughters of tough ancestors.</p>

              <p>Yup. If you have 10 cents, you will still be able to buy one sweet. With $1 you can buy 10 cents. Similarly, if we earn little, then we buy HDB. If we worked hard and get paid more, then buy a condo.</p>

              <p>Aiyah, dunno how he compare one la... Condo can use facilities for free, although u hv to pay a monthly maintenance, which isn't that much higher than paying for season parking (if also own a car at the same time) at HDB carparks (Parking is free in your own condo)</p>
              <p>Also, condos do have the opportunity to be sold en bloc for a very large profit. Never will you see this for HDB.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you stop pretending or did you simply made a slip in exposing your real position as nothing more then a Government man ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you not been more then naive - even to the point of being exposed for a fool - to believe that you can continue to push the views of the government in your not so subtle ways ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you justify the wages paid to a government of a small nation that is 10x more then that paid to the government of a nation that is 100 times bigger then ourselves - when you are justifying that the events in the World is beyond the capability of a government of our small nation to influence ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If all the decisions are determined by others, why should we pay our government ministers that cost the citizens more money then it is worth ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even Hong Kong being the closest resemblance to our size and work ethics do not pay as much to their government, who are similarly subjected to the decisions by larger nations that affect the global issues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What political idiot-logy are your attempting to push ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How have you so brilliantly tangle the issues in fighting for our own sovereignty by standing up to the neighboring big brother-bully, and going with the tide to help our weaker ones to change perceptions after being heard by the bullies, and get some benefits from them ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, your brains must have been re-arranged from staring too long through the cross-haired scope of your silly 'deerHunter' wimpy gun.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your views was for everyone to start with Financial Management - would that include all your grandpa and grandma, your old uncles, and aunties - all the retired old folks included ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Would that include the very young in play-school to begin their foundation with training in recognition of financial numbers and symbols ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So with everyone going financial, and the companies only needing the very best, what alternative jobs do you recommend for the other 99% with high qualifications in Financial Management ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you suggesting that Singaporeans "go-with-the-flow" according to your brilliant predictions as to where the next flow will go ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was that not the problems in the 1970s, when there were simply far too many A-levels going for medical school, with insufficient numbers going for engineering ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then came the 1980s, a sudden realisation that there were not enough computer science and electrical engineers to meet with the demands of R&amp;D in the electronic sectors.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It happened again as 1999 came to an end, and the 21 Century began - when it was realised that the future was in Bio-technology, and to groom anyone - to be of sufficient proficiency that will be of some value to the industry - will take at least 10 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does the government know what the next wave will be in the future - in another 10 years ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will those who are groomed for Bio-tech now suddenly find themselves to be redundant ten years into the future ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What a load of crap are you pushing with your idea that if FT are hired because they are cheaper - as in the case of IT professionals or FW ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since when are IT professionals and FW  supposed to come cheap ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If they are cheap, and we are supposed to accept a lower pay and work our way up - how far lower in wages are you recommending we should go below the cheap wages of these FT ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will anyone compete with the 'deerHunter' to become 'INDISPENSABLE' to the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>

              <p><strong>It is only through a good education that you may be able to get
                                      a better job. You will have to ensure that what you study is
                                      relevant to the industries that needs workers. Eg;-Financial Wealth
                                      management is the current hot job, CGI is another.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>For those who already left for work,  do go back for nite
                                      studies. There is no choice if one seeks more money. The govt will
                                      offer grants to those who wants to help themselves. As long as you
                                      qualify for a job and have the personality to match it, you will be
                                      hired. Even if you can't find a job here, your certificate will
                                      help you overseas, as a wealth manager in New York or air con
                                      mechanic in Australia.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>The govt had done their best to scout for the cheapest sources,
                                      and to cut down on the  middlemen by buying direct from such
                                      sources. While our 3.5million population cannot fight against the
                                      international corporate shopkeepers who get better bulk discounts
                                      for billions of people such as Walmart, attempts had been made on
                                      inter-govt talks for better rates. Establishment of business ties
                                      with Russia, Vietnam, and Libya are such attempts.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>As long as you buy what you need, and buy house brands, you will
                                      never starve in Singapore. Furthermore, if one is truly
                                      desperate and in need of food, CDC agencies will assist to

                                      starving, please let them know our society will help them.
                                      They only need to approach our CDC centres and show that they are
                                      incapable of helping themselves, such as handicapped, or out of

                                      we are proffesional in our duties and our work output is relevant
                                      and helps him in his profitability, there is no reason to get
                                      fired.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If one is retrenched, under our laws, he is protected and
                                      entitled to retrenchment benefits. With such monies, it would be
                                      wise to upgrade oneself mentally for other jobs that are
                                      avaliable in the market.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>While the pay may be low in some firms, but if one shows his
                                      capability, he will be paid more in time. We are living in an era
                                      where capability is rewarded.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">For this we should think what's the reason for all the retrenchment and WHY FTs are getting our job .. Cos they are have a salary of one man but doing three man job? After everything FTs just pat pat their backside and go back to their homeland. </span></p>
              <p><strong>Entreprenuership</strong></p>
              <p><strong>-------------------</strong></p>
              <p><strong>After spending years on the job, and learning from it, one may

              <p><strong>--------------</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Recreation costs had gone up. Thus there is a need to seek
                                      cheaper alternatives. All work and no play is not what our society
                                      wants. The beach, gardens and parks are still free.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cinema tickets are cheaper during the workdays. Furthermore,

              <p><strong>Homes</strong></p>
              <p><strong>---------</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Prices of home had gone up. in 1970s, the first SIT flats costs
                                      only around $15,000 for a 3 room flat. But in those days, salaries
                                      were only around $800 a month and a cup of coffee costs only
                                      30cts.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The world had changed, and costs of materials, which are largely
                                      imported, had gone up as well. And it will continue to spiral even
                                      for the next few generations to come.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thus the rise in prices. But still, a HDB 3rm flat is much more
                                      cheaper than a similar sized 99 yr leased condo.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Condo are expensive cos of the extra security etc etc .. So no point comparing. </span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Many had choosed to express their anger against the govt here.
                      It is an outlet to voice their frustrations, and nothing wrong with
                      it. The only thing wrong is when it turns to slander. More so when
                      political opportunists take such disenchantment to sow discord and
                      strife amongst us citizens, using us all as tools for their
                      despicable political ambitions.</p>
              <p>If you noticed, these slimy opportunists offers one no real
                      solutions to help, but to stoke up the flames of discontent by
                      adding the volitile fuel of falsehoods and half truths to burn the
                      dismay faced by many in these current rise in inflationary
                      pressures faced by many, not a problem created by our govt,
                      but by events beyond our control.</p>
              <p>Rather than to go into a senseless debate with them, for they
                      will never admit to the truth or comprehend logic, they will only
                      insult  and show their further stupidity, helping no one. Thus
                      this post, from a citizen to another, to share ideas on how to cope
                      with the current times.</p>
              <p>First of all, we must understand our problems, face up to facts
                      and only then can we confront it to seek solutions. There is no
                      free lunch in this world. Our society, while will never abandon the
                      weak, neither will we help those who do not wish to help themselves
                      but to sit around all day to moan and bitch.</p>
              <p>The only way to fight inflation is to get better jobs or rise in
                      salaries. Fighting with bosses will only ensure capital investments
                      leave our shores, or forcing the govt for handouts will only
                      bankrupt our next generation. Each year we get to welcome est.more
                      than 50,000 new baby citizens, and we must ensure they have a
                      future and are protected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education</p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>It is only through a good education that you may be able to get
                      a better job. You will have to ensure that what you study is
                      relevant to the industries that needs workers. Eg;-Financial Wealth
                      management is the current hot job, CGI is another.</p>
              <p>For those who already left for work,  do go back for nite
                      studies. There is no choice if one seeks more money. The govt will
                      offer grants to those who wants to help themselves. As long as you
                      qualify for a job and have the personality to match it, you will be
                      hired. Even if you can't find a job here, your certificate will
                      help you overseas, as a wealth manager in New York or air con
                      mechanic in Australia.</p>
              <p>Grocery</p>
              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>The govt had done their best to scout for the cheapest sources,
                      and to cut down on the  middlemen by buying direct from such
                      sources. While our 3.5million population cannot fight against the
                      international corporate shopkeepers who get better bulk discounts
                      for billions of people such as Walmart, attempts had been made on
                      inter-govt talks for better rates. Establishment of business ties
                      with Russia, Vietnam, and Libya are such attempts.</p>
              <p>As long as you buy what you need, and buy house brands, you will
                      never starve in Singapore. Furthermore, if one is truly
                      desperate and in need of food, CDC agencies will assist to
                      issue food vouchers. If you do know of some family who is
                      starving, please let them know our society will help them.
                      They only need to approach our CDC centres and show that they are
                      incapable of helping themselves, such as handicapped, or out of
                      job, and help will be offered.</p>
              <p>With all these help offered, it is hoped that the food bought is
                      not wasted, and children must be taught not to waste their
                      food.</p>
              <p>Employment</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>In these times, attitudes are very important. While it is not
                      necessary to beg or grovel before the bosses, there is also no need
                      to take on a confrontational role with them. Without them, we will
                      all have no jobs.</p>
              <p>Reason and logic will move minds. Even if it doesnt, so long as
                      we are proffesional in our duties and our work output is relevant
                      and helps him in his profitability, there is no reason to get
                      fired.</p>

                      entitled to retrenchment benefits. With such monies, it would be
                      wise to upgrade oneself mentally for other jobs that are

                      will elevate our lives further, as what our govt had been focussing

              <p>Dear Hunter,</p>
              <p>I think on balance your posts so far did not help very much to lessen or defuse the anger of citizens against wrongful policies of the government.</p>
              <p>Many
                  of the forumers have already replied your various ranting against them
                  with better logic and substance. You have not taken up their good gestures. They
                  patiently explained to you why and where government has been wrong in many of its policies without being personal. You have also read my views too why I regarded the leaders' continuing defamation suits against
                  oppositions as wrong and counter-productive in the larger context of building an inclusive and caring society.</p>
              <p>So please try
                  to think over more prudently and providentially all these posts of substance and stopping insinuating (a word used by you against forumers) against fellow citizens with loyalty to the nation who are giving their one cent's worth to help in nation building. These are our valuable assets so stop calling them names or insinuating against them.</p>
              <p>Your holier-than-thou attitude regarding all the policies of the government as posted here as right is something to be deployed. Your slamming of forumers with all kinds of name calling will not help at all now or in the future to win more goodwill
                  for MM Lee or PM Lee. Such arrogance will only stoke more ill-feeling toward them
                  unknowingly or unwittingly. We all know it is your job to come here even if you are pretending to be unconnected to government to
                  appease any citizens incensed by many wrongful happenings from NKF
                  problems to non-stop increases in costs of living to Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>If you want to do so by arrogance you will stoke up more ill-feeling and very few people will care to listen to you.</p>
              <p>So
                  please stop being so childish or slanderous or arrogance. It is
                  counter-productive effort. You are wasting your time to try to out-wit
                  or out-write or out-reason for finally the truths will prevail.</p>
              <p>Think
                  again and stop all the accusations and slandering. More more humble.
                  Admit mistakes where mistakes are due. Do not be so paranoid. No body
                  here is interesting in defaming or slandering anyone and they are loyal
                  to Singapore and good citizens unless of course you want to push them
                  up to liangshan.</p>

                                sweet. With $1 you can buy 10 cents. Similarly, if we earn little,
                                then we buy HDB. If we worked hard and get paid more, then buy a
                                condo.</p>

              The MIW will "work" even harder to milk peasants more by charging even higher for homes and cars. Maybe the MIW really know how to "work" smart.
              
              
              They will then blame you for expecting too much when the first place is you want to earn more to obtain homes and cars.

              <p><br>Twisted logic ?</p>
              <p>For one who will twist reason on its head to make poor justification for the factual events - and make excuses to hide the excesses and create an utopic fantasy - surely it needs a good twist of the logic to set reality back on course ?</p>
              <p>Juveniles will always remain as a juvenile - when stumped by logic and simple common sense, all that a juvenile can do is to snap back in sharp retort.</p>
              <p>Try a lollipop if your 'deerHunter' pop-gun fail to make the impact you try so hard to make with each useless thread that you start..</p>
