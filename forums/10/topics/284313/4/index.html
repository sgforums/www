To earn the most profits to ensure your shareholders are happy with the company performance. Profits come FIRST and foremost. There are companies that advocate ethics and values. But the championing of such ethics and values also come back to the same reason (to ensure the integrity of the company, which impacts profitability of the company because that affects how much customers will trust this company)<br><br>This runs against the requirements of a public transport (ie to make transport costs affordable to the general public).<br><br>Another reason, is that in a monopolistic environment (which is almost literally what public transport is in Singapore), because of the lack of competition, companies tend to use the easiest way out (ie to increase prices since its the most no-brainer to maximize profits and customers can't do much about it). The idea of competition in Singapore for public transport (esp buses) is almost non-existent, since buses from different companies ply different routes.<br></div>
