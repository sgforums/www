Maybe say, a limit of 2 cars per household. Families who decide not to own cars, can transfer/sell their entitlement (10 years maybe?). At least the cash flows within the populace and not back to line the pockets of the government.<br><br>As far as government rationale goes, the COE was to limit car buying in the first place, and not to cover some cost. Why did they implement COE and then removed the need for 30% down-payment? Trying to limit car growth and yet making buying cars more accessible at the same time?</div></blockquote>i like this idea. make it one car per household better still.<br><br>family who do not wish to add to singapore's traffic problem can sell their entitlement to those who wants/needs it. 10 years probably too long, 5 years seems right.

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol. ERP seems to be getting ineffective over the years. Roads like AMK Ave 6 at the junction of AMK Ave 3 are still jammed.<br><br>Initially, when ERP is introduced some years back, it seems to be an effective measure and other countries are learning from Singapore about public transportation policy. Now, it seems that ERP has become a one-stop solution to transport woes. Any transport problems, just increase ERP.<br><br>In my opinion, I feel that due to the higher standard of living and the booming economy, many Singaporeans can afford to buy cars. The vehicle population in Singapore has increased rather significantly from 799373 in year 2006 to 832996 in the period of Aug 2007 thanks to the statistics from Singapore Department of Statistics.<br>From 2005 754992 to 2006 799973 to 2007 832996, the increase seems to be getting bigger. Hence, jams can be seen everywhere.<br><br>In regards to about the standards of public transport, I have posted a comment and observation under 147 bunching problem at Singapore Buses Forum.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=284124" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=284124</a><br><br>In summary, with the unforeseen traffic conditions such as traffic jams, bus bunching are going to get worse. So, if nothing is being done, expect a decline in bus service standards in terms of waiting times.<br><br>Bus bunching means that buses tend to cluster in groups as they travel along the bus route.<br><br>With perfect traffic conditions, in my opinion, bus bunching tend to occur due to the fact of having traffic lights which hamper the smooth travel of vehicles. However, with traffic jams occurring at certain parts of the route, buses will be clustered along the location where traffic jams occur.<br><br>This means that freq of buses will be more irregular. 28 mins, 2 mins, 4 mins, 4 mins in IRIS will be more of a common sight.<br><br>In my opinion, finding another solution into combating the common traffic jams seen at the roads is linked to bus service standards. What we want is the somooth freq of buses.<br><br>Just a thought.</div>

But I still think the roads can be designed much much more efficient. Too many traffic lights also. I pitty people who buy expensive cars. can only drive upto a maximum speed of 90 km/h. Why do people buy super expensive sports cars in sg when their super turbo cars can only be allowed to run at 90km/h and that is on highways only? I guess image and showing off is very important to humans.</div>

Thus, this leads me to assume that the MAJORITY are ok with the COE, ERP, traffic jams and parking.<br><br>Minority not happy so?<br><br>MAJORITY decides.
