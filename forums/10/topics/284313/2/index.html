But we are frustrated when we pay the ERP (fees), we don't see any ease of traffic flow on the CTE," complained a resident.<br><br>The answer? It may be frustrating, however there is no one magic solution but a range of measures adjusted over time as the situation changes.<br><br>Mr Lim explained: "As a first step, we will do what we call traffic engineering solutions. <strong>So if you look at the Central Expressway, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have widened it through the years and only recently we did it again</span></strong>.<br><br>"What's the problem here? Let's say we widen the road. When we first widened the road, the traffic might improve. When it improves, what happens? People who previously didn't drive on that road, the Central Expressway, will now drive on it.<br><br>"So, some say, 'build more roads'. Yes, build more roads, that will help. Some say, 'better public transport'. Yes, better public transport will also help. But at the end of the day, you also still need this traffic management, which involves not just the ERP, but as you know in our system, we also have COE."<br><br>But it wasn't just about the ERP. A whole range of transport issues came up during the dialogue session.<br><br>There were suggestions ranging from having premium bus services to 24-hour senior citizen concession passes.<br><br>There was also a suggestion to have the Public Transport Council (PTC) review public transport fares only every four years, just before the elections.<br><br>But, Mr Lim said: "If we freeze the whole thing for four years - no fare increase - the pressure will say, 'why not extend another four years?' The experience of other countries is that the minute you allow the fare increase to be politicised, that over time, the service of your bus standards goes down. If they can't get these returns to renew the bus fleet, the bus fleet will start to shrink and as the bus fleet starts to shrink because they don't replace it, there will be more and more overcrowding. So the situation gets worse and people will complain." - CNA/ir </blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Was the CTE ever widened since it was opened for use in the mid-1980s, and widened again recently - as stated by Raymond Lim, or was he attempting to bluff his way out of a tight spot ?<br><br>The only widening works that were ever carried out was at the PIE-exit slip road into the CTE along Jalan Toa Payoh; and the CTE-Braddell Road intersection.<br><br>The entire stretch of the CTE remained as narrow as it was since its opening, as the CTE is sandwiched by residential estates on both sides of the CTE.<br><br>How did Raymond Lim dreamed that the CTE could still be widened ?

Did he think that the vehicle will automatically shift down to 3rd or 2nd to handle the curve at a more manageable speed ?<br><br>In a manual transmission car, an experienced driver will manually shift to a lower 3rd gear when taking on a bend - but an auto-transmission car will not do so and will need the manual input of the driver.<br><br>Unfortunately, this fact is not in the minds of new drivers, who should be sent to a higher level of learning that include such defensive driving skills so as to make Singapore roads safer.<br><br>Many accidents that have happened along road bends are a result of misjudgement that is due to simple ignorance of basic car handling.<br><br>Road sense and presence of mind is essential not only with road users, but also with road designers.<br><br>At times, I wonder if the road designers are drivers at all.<br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>The ISLANDWIDE ERP is obviously ineffective and yet this minister of ours is still implementing and approving the increase. I am sure he has the statistics to see what happens when ERP are increased but yet when a poorly made decision is made, it cannot be reverted. For all we drivers know, the recent ERP rates increase does nothing effective but confuses.<br><br>From here, we can see a drawback of having highly paid ministers and running it like a private company<br>1) They are afraid to admit to mistake<br>2) Some will continue with the mistake to hide the facade<br>3) They will continue to boast the success to other countries<br>4) They are only interested in getting more profits so that their already big pay pockets are even fatter.<br><br>Going back to the ERP system, it is obviously nothing more than just an extremely effective money collecting system. Worst the cashless process makes it difficult for many drivers to feel the actual cost.<br><br>I remember when ERP was first implemented for the CDB. It was indeed very effective as one of the bottlenecks in CDB was the payment collection. We also can easily identify that CDB is a costly place and avoided driving there as best we can.<br><br>Come the islandwide ERP, what has first worked clearly began to fail. Everywhere we drive now is ERP and complicates the cost involved. Instead of 1 ERP, we now pass through multiple ERP. Drivers are already preoccupied with driving safety, road to take and to add further and now ERP wants us to calculate the cost of driving! Most of us are not mathematician here you know and wouldn't want spend so much energy to such complex computation!<br><br>For goodness sake, minister please wake up to reality. THE ERP is FAILING !!! The statistics are there, the drivers tell u and it is also not difficult to realise that the ERP has grown into an overly sophisticated solution which many drivers cannot feel !!!<br><br>After driving for some many years, I still don't know the ERP rates for the different timing and I can least remember where are the ERP gantries because there are so many!!!<br><br>To send a clearer signal, I think we all drivers should tell u to wake up the transport minister to wake up your F*CKING idea!<br></div>
