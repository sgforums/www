            <div class='col-md body'>At the forum with Minister Raymond Lim televised today over Channel 5, it is obvious that the Minister was unable to answer to the irate Thomson residents' query : "We don't mind to pay the ERP but what we are frustrated is despite paying the ERP the traffic situation does not improve."<br><br>Minister was unable to satisfy the residents in his reply: "If we do not have ERP, traffic will get worse. That is why we have other measures including COEs and better bus services. Just like the bus service if we abolish the fee increases bus fleet may go down and eventually service will go down."<br><br>It is so sad that the ERP has been proposed as the ultimate solution to the traffic congestion problem but now the residents have to bear higher and higher costs and unlike being presented as the final solution it has not solve the traffic problem at all despite all the fees being paid.<br><br>The residents in Thomson are right in saying that if we cannot solve the problem now with ERP we might as well let it go back to square one and abolish ERP instead of paying all the monies and causing costs of living to go up and yet traffic situation is getting worse.</div>

That is why we have other measures including COEs and better bus services. Just like the bus service if we abolish the fee increases bus fleet may go down and eventually service will go down."<br><br>It is so sad that the ERP has been proposed as the ultimate solution to the traffic congestion problem but now the residents have to bear higher and higher costs and unlike being presented as the final solution it has not solve the traffic problem at all despite all the fees being paid.<br><br>The residents in Thomson are right in saying that if we cannot solve the problem now with ERP we might as well let it go back to square one and abolish ERP instead of paying all the monies and causing costs of living to go up and yet traffic situation is getting worse.</div></blockquote>The problem with ERP is that the govt isn't truly honest in trying to 'solve' it.<br><br>Someone once said unpopular decisions need to be made by a mature leader. Such a decision is needed...now. If they want to make ERP successful, they can up the ERP price to an exhorbitant cost...say SGD20/- and implement it with a month's notice.<br><br>Complimentary to that, they can set staggered rates at different times of the day with different prices.<br><br>Other suggestions that compliment ERP is the use of directional flow changes depending on traffic trends, an enforced car pool lane system and odd-even car restrictions on alternate days.<br><br>Of course the public will bawk at these proposals, but hey, no one said the solution would be easy.<br><br>H.ell, it's better than letting them suck our coffers with incremental ERP hikes and still create the facade that they seem 'intent' on improving the problem?</div>

The emphasis was laid on road usage as it was said to be the final and ultimate solution to road congestion.<br><br>After the above-stated COE and ERP the middle class citizens were being fleeced by the hundreds of thousands in the work cycle of 30-40 years just to feed ministers' million-dollar salaries.<br><br>Where is the final solution to road congestion. For all you know there may have to be another REP (repeated error pricing) or RIP(road interlocution pricing) in order to finally put to rest the road congestion problem but citizens will have to wait for another decade to hear excuses why four solutions are not enough to solve problem with new excuses such as road congestion requires some other total or holistic final solution.</div>
