Am speaking up as a Concerned Citizen.<br>Have been closely monitoring Government spending over the past 20 years.<br><br>1.2 Singapore can be compared to a floating ice-berg:<br>The smaller 10% visible part (above water) is what most S'poreans<br>see --- a clean/green city; apparent clock-work efficiency; etc,etc.<br><br>But the larger 90% not-visible part (below water) have been kept<br>mostly from public view by our PAP-controlled Press/TV media.<br><br>1.3 In this write-up:<br>$ = Singapore Dollars; US$ = US Dollars<br>m = million; B = Billion<br>we/us = Singaporeans; they = highly-paid politicians/bureaucrats<br><br>When looking at each mindboggling number:<br>(i) We should ask ourselves --- WHOSE Money? The People's Hard-Earned<br>Monies, Of Course!<br>(ii) While their mindset is --- WHY Worry? It's the People's Money.<br><br>1.4 Read on and then judge for yourself whether:<br><br>SG = Singapore Government, or SG = Screwed-up Government<br><br>2 Uniquely Singapore --- A Money-Sucking Government<br><br>2.1 Many of Singapore's national/social problems (eg insufficient job<br>creation; rich-poor income gap; rising suicide/divorce rates; procreation<br>problem; younger/educated/disillusioned S'poreans emigrating; etc) can be<br>traced back to these two fundamental causes:<br><br>(i) For COMPANIES/BUSINESSES (creating jobs for the people), the HIGH COST<br>of doing business here<br>(ii) For our PEOPLE, the HIGH COST of living<br><br>WHO SAYS S'poreans must "pay through their noses" for good Government, a<br>roof over their heads, a decent education for their children and a decent<br>quality of life?<br><br>And WHO SAYS S'poreans must tolerate (suffer in silence) our high cost of<br>living in order to enjoy a high standard of living?<br>[ Australia has a high standard of living, but its cost of living is nowhere<br>as ridiculous as Singapore! ]<br><br>2.2 The various/numerous taxes and dues S'poreans have to "Pay And Pay"<br>include:<br>income tax; property tax; ad-valorem stamp duty on property purchases;<br>GST, COE, ERP, maid levy;<br>transport fares and varsity fees going up and up; etc, etc.<br><br>[ From the Internet --- With apologies to Sir Winston Churchill, never in<br>the history of Mankind has so Many Singaporeans been Milked for so much<br>Monies over so Many years by the PAP Government! ]<br><br>Million-Dollar Question --- To run a tiny red dot island, WHY do the PAP<br>Government have "to milk so much monies from the people" ???<br><br>Final Correct Answer:<br>(i) to pay for the humongous remunerations/perks of our Ceremonial<br>Presidency, Bloated Cabinet and Bulging Bloated Bureaucracy. [details at<br>para 4]<br><br>(ii) to provide an abundant/cheap source of funds for GIC, Temasek Hldgs<br>and other Government-linked business entities. [details at para 6]<br><br>(iii) to pay for GIANT ELECTION CARROTS to seduce the people for their<br>votes --- as in "pork-barrel politics" (using taxpayer's monies for<br>political advantage) and "election gerrymandering" (fiddling with electoral<br>boundaries for political advantage). [details at para 8]<br><br>2.3 Difference between "A Good Government" and "A Dud Government":<br><br>(i) A Good Government (i.e Competent and Caring) is one that will do its<br>utmost to SERVE THE PEOPLE through keeping the COST OF LIVING at sensible<br>levels by providing basic social services --- such as housing, education,<br>transport, healthcare, security --- at lowest-possible and cost-efficient<br>prices/charges.<br><br>(ii) A Dud Government (which will do Singapore in)* is one that will<br>think of many ingenious ways to "milk as much of the people's hard-earned<br>monies as possible"<br><br>--- such as "do HDB flatbuyers in" through pricing supposedly low-cost<br>public housing at a cleverly-disguised profit using the clever semantics of<br>"market subsidy". [ see para 5.1 ]<br><br>[ *Origin of this PAP-coined phrase:<br>At every Singapore General Election, there will be scare-mongering<br>politicians warning voters ( with silly/childish threats like "poisonous<br>time bombs" which grossly insult the people's intelligence) that if they<br>vote for the Opposition, they will be voting in "a Dud Government that will<br>do Singapore in". ]<br><br>2.4 SIMPLE LOGIC (which our highly-paid Politicians/Bureaucrats fail to<br>understand):<br><br>If it does not cost so much to run this tiny red-dot island, the<br>Government can then collect less taxes/dues from the People.<br><br>The People will then have more money in their pockets to, say:<br>(i) start/expand their own businesses [ promoting entrepreneurship ]<br>(ii) have more children [ solving our Procreation Problem ]<br>(iii) go on more vacation holidays [ to counter work/school stress ]<br><br>3 A High Stress Country<br><br>3.1 Soul-searching Questions ---<br><br>(i) To what extent has our High Cost of Living and our Elitist/Competitive<br>Education System contributed to a High Stress Country?<br><br>(ii) Have we achieve economic progress at great social costs?<br><br>3.2 Notice how our highly-paid Public Officials like to talk a lot about<br>money/materialistic matters (e.g. the economy, property market, asset<br>enhancement, HDB upgrading,etc) but hardly talk about the following<br>disturbing social issues ( "shameful matters" to be conveniently swept under<br>the carpet?):<br><br>(i) Rising suicide rate among young S'poreans<br><br>More S'poreans (age 15 - 35 years) die committing suicide than from traffic<br>accidents. [ On average, one suicide very day! ]<br>Worrying trend --- suicide rates for youths on the rise (while declining for<br>the elderly).<br><br>Young S'poreans (under 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> seeing govt psychiatrists doubled from 1126 cases<br>(1990) to 2491 cases (2000) [ half were of primary school age i.e. under<br>13 ].<br>In 2001, 14,000 children were seen by IMH psychiatrists (of which 2233 were<br>new cases).<br><br>From 1997 - 2001, 20 primary students (under 13 years old) have committed<br>suicide jumping off high-rise flats.<br><br>(ii) Rising divorce rate amongst young S'poreans<br><br>In 2003, marriages fell 5% while divorce cases doubled over the last 10<br>years to 6,561 (i.e. 18 divorces every day! )<br><br>Particularly worrying is the rising trend of young couples divorcing within<br>the first five years of marriage.<br><br>(iii) Anecdotal evidence of more young S'poreans migrating.<br>(Previously, it was mainly the older folks who migrate following their<br>retirement.)<br><br>4 High Cost of Government<br><br>[ From Internet postings:<br>--- Paying peanuts may attract mediocre monkeys, but it does not logically<br>follow that handing out goldbars will attract competent chimpanzees !!!<br><br>--- Singapore is a supposedly First-World country, with a supposedly Open<br>Government run by supposedly World-Class million-dollar ministers and<br>supposedly First-Class half-a-million dollar senior bureaucrats.]<br><br>4.1 The Presidency (a largely ceremonial position)<br><br>[ Good Question --- Is it an Elected President (i.e. truly elected by the<br>people) or a Nominated President (i.e. nominated/endorsed by the ruling<br>party)? ]<br><br>Parliament-approved FY2006 Annual Expenses for The Istana:<br>$2,507,200 --- President's salary [approx $200,000 per month]<br>$2,733,200 --- Salaries of Personal Staff<br>$1,108,500 --- Expenses of Household<br>$ 92,800 --- Special Services<br>$6,562,300 --- Total Expenses[ $547,000 per month ( almost one peanut! )]<br><br>4.2 A Bloated Cabinet:<br><br>Note (i): How strange --- President's salary published but not salaries of<br>Cabinet Ministers??? (as if S'poreans who are actually paying for their<br>salaries have no right to know !!!).<br><br>[ "We are OPEN AND TRANSPARENT...WE CANNOT HIDE what goes on in<br>ngapore" --- MHA Minister Wong Kan Seng (ST 18 May 2003) ]<br><br>[ "DPM Lee promises a more open Singapore"; "I don't make promises I can't<br>keep: DPM Lee" (ST 7 Jan 2004) ]<br><br>[ TODAY 2 Mar 2006 --- ....the Ministry of Finance "does not intend to<br>disclose the salaries" of individual cabinet ministers, added Prime Minister<br>Lee Hsien Loong* (*who is also Minister for Finance!).<br>Not even salary bracket ranges as required for Senior Executives of<br>Public-Listed Companies ??? ]<br><br>Note (ii): The "indicative salaries" below are mostly Basic Salary<br>i.e. Total Annual Salary Package will be much higher if other perks [eg<br>entertainment/transport allowance, CPF, Pension, mid-year bonus, year-end<br>bonus, performance bonus,etc,etc] are added on.<br><br>19 Ministers comprising Top 5 (MM, SM, PM, 2 DPM) plus 14 Ministers:<br><br>-- Top 5 Ministers @ basic salary comparable to President i.e around $2.5m<br>per year (about $200,000 per month)<br>-- 14 Ministers @ basic salary around $1.5m per year (about $100,000 per<br>month)<br><br>[ These are not just humongous, but obscenely-humongous salaries by both<br>international and local standards.<br><br>&gt; How could the Prime Minister of tiny red dot Singapore be earning some<br>&gt; double that of the American President?<br>If US President George Bush screw up and presses the wrong buttons, the<br>whole world (incl tiny red dot S'pore!) can go up in nuclear smoke!<br>Even the Australian and Canadian Prime Ministers have joked about our<br>"world-infamous" ministerial salaries!<br>&gt; The $100,000 that a Singapore Minister is paid in ONE MONTH is what a<br>&gt; typical experienced middle-age Singapore manager will earn in an ENTIRE<br>&gt; YEAR!<br>&gt; Nearly half-a-million (some 400,000) S'poreans even earn less than $1,500<br>&gt; per month.<br><br>8 Ministers of State (Junior Ministers):<br>-- Salary range around $1m to $1.5m per year.<br><br>5 Parliamentary Secretaries &amp; 1 Political Secretary:<br>-- Yatiman Yusof, Mohamed Maidin, Hawazi Daipi, Maliki Osman, Koo Tsai Kee.<br>Political Secretary Tang Guan Seng has been around for umpteen years!<br>-- Salary around $1m per year. Hardly any Ah Kow, Ahmad or Ali know what<br>the heck they actually do !!!<br><br>82 PAP Members of Parliament:<br>-- Likewise, what do this whole bunch "actually" do to "justify" their<br>MP Allowance of $11,900 per month (on top of their regular day job)???<br>[ SM Goh recently defended the $11,900 per month as "fair". Luckily (for<br>him), he didn't say the amount is "peanuts" !!! ]<br><br>-- They only show their faces mostly near a General Election.<br>-- They hardly bother to attend our infrequent Parliament sittings<br>(convenient lame excuse --- business commitments). But when either MM Lee<br>or PM Lee speak in Parliament, they were "somehow" able to attend! Some<br>were even caught napping on televised Parliament sessions!<br>-- At most, they hold weekly Meet-the-People sessions on resident's<br>problems dealing with bird-brained civil servants.<br>[Note: if our highly-paid civil servants have been doing a proper job, such<br>sessions would be unnecessay!].<br>At say, three hours per weekly session, these MPs are being paid close to<br>$1,000 per hour!<br>-- They also get to hold Directorships in many companies (mostly<br>govt-linked companies), collecting easy "side income" from numerous<br>director's fees.<br><br>5 PAP Community Development Council (CDC) Mayors<br>-- "Created to oversee" 14 PAP Town Councils.<br>-- Salaries of these "Mayors" are at Junior Minister level ($1m - $1.5m per<br>year).<br>-- WHY the need for such PAP Mayors when each Town Council are already<br>headed by a full-time Management Team?<br><br>4.3 A Bulging Bloated Bureaucracy:<br><br>&gt; For a tiny red dot island, Singapore's supposedly First-Class Civil<br>&gt; Service has --- 9 Organs of State*, 15 Ministries and 67 Statutory<br>&gt; Boards !!!<br>[ *Attorney-General, Auditor-General, Judiciary,etc]<br><br>&gt; Managed by 18 Permanent Secretaries** and 29 Deputy Secretaries.<br>[ **Highest-ranking (and highest-paid) Civil Servant, with Salary range =<br>$0.5m to $1m per year ]<br><br>&gt; There are already 15 Ministries --- WHY then so MANY stat boards?<br><br>You see --- every time there is a new function, they like to "automatically"<br>create a new stat board! (the more the merrier --- to "spread out" the<br>workload. Not Bad -- do less work but still get high pay !!! Why Worry?<br>The People Are Paying! )<br><br>WHO CARES if such a Bloated Civil Service will lead to "co-ordination<br>problems" (left hand don't know what right hand is doing during a REAL<br>EMERGENCY of Terrorism or Disease Epidemic) as well as "merry-go-round"<br>frustrations for citizens/businessmen?<br><br>Recent stat boards created --- WDA, ACRA, CCS, IPOS.<br>Hold on, more soon to come --- such as Casino Regulatory Authority.<br><br>Each new stat board created results in the creation of an overseeing Board<br>(with about 10-12 Board Members [mostly senior civil servants,who are paid a<br>fee]) and positions of CEO, Deputy CEOs, etc,etc.<br><br>Example --- at one time, managerial staff at the CPF Board (whose work can<br>be largely computerised) comprise 1 CEO, 2 Deputy CEOs, 5 Divisional<br>Directors, 30 Deputy Directors, 59 Assistant Directors and 59 Managers.<br>Any private sector company with these many layers of "management fat" would<br>have "collapsed or gone bankrupt" donkey years ago !!!<br><br>More Shocking Revelations:<br><br>(i) The whole Civil Service has a ridiculous number of 216 Public Affairs<br>Managers (dealing with replies to the public).<br>[ Within the Home Affairs ministry (right under the nose of DPM Wong Kan<br>Seng), there are 27 Public Affairs Managers!]<br><br>Since most S'poreans are still "fearful of speaking up publicly", these<br>Public Affairs Managers are mostly "twiddling their thumbs" (nothing much<br>to do).<br>Their Salary Cost to taxpayers = $15m EVERY YEAR !!! (based on average<br>$5000 monthly salary and 2 months bonus)<br><br>(ii) 2003 HDB Overly-Generous $220m Retrenchment Payout Fiasco:<br><br>Under Minister-IN-CHARGE Mah Bow Tan, the HDB had grew unchecked into a<br>8,000 staff organisation with a $500m annual wage bill (or $55,000 per<br>person --- pointing to many over-paid "fat cats" !!! )<br><br>In July 2003, it then went overboard with its stupid and overly-generous<br>$220 million retrenchment payout to let go 2,630 staff (or $84,000 per<br>person !!! ) --- pointing to an inexperienced/panicky/botched-up handling<br>of its first major retrenchment exercise.<br>Human Resource practitioners in the private sector were rightly shocked at<br>the humongous payout ( without a 25-year cap, which is standard private<br>sector practice! ).<br><br>5 High Cost of Homes/ Cars/ Education<br><br>5.1 (a) Singapore's private home prices are "obscenely-high" while HDB<br>flat prices are "sky-high".<br>For most S'poreans, a home is the most expensive purchase they will make in<br>their lifetimes.<br>Some 90% of our population live in HDB flats --- representing the<br>less-well-off who cannot afford private property.<br><br>(b) Despite our high home prices, few buyers "feel the pinch"<br>immediately because up to 90% of the cost can be financed by long-term debt<br>(over 20 -30 years).<br>Thus, many do not give a second thought to the fact if they borrow, say,<br>$100,000 under a 20-year home loan, they could ultimately cough up some<br>$200,000 in total capital and interest repayments.<br><br>(c) SIMPLE LOGIC --- if a young couple in Singapore have to "sink so much<br>monies" into their "brick and cement" HDB flat, how much monies will<br>there be left to raise a family and sent the children to school/university<br>(not to mention providing for their own healthcare/retirement needs in their<br>old age) ???<br><br>(d) Since 2002, many HDB flatbuyers have become "suspicious" on how HDB<br>new flats are actually priced.<br><br>They asked how a 5-room HDB new flat is priced at $200,000 when its<br>construction cost is only about $50,000 (as revealed from actual contracts<br>of HDB Building Contractors).<br>Adding on another,say, $70,000 for Land Cost &amp; Other Related Costs, the<br>Total Breakeven Cost per flat is only about $120,000! (which HDB should set<br>as the selling price, as HDB flats are supposed to be low-cost public<br>housing).<br><br>But the HDB chose this very ingenious "market subsidy" approach --- "by<br>pricing NEW flats just below the market price of comparable RESALE flats".<br>So, HDB will look at the prevailing market price (say,$260,000) of a RESALE<br>5-rm flat --- and then "pluck from the air" a lower figure of, say,<br>$200,000 as the selling price of a NEW 5-rm flat (NEVER MIND even if its<br>actual Total Breakeven Cost is only $120,000).<br><br>The HDB can then go around boasting that the new flat buyer is getting a<br>"market subsidy" of $60,000 --- when there is actually no "true cash<br>subsidy", and the HDB is really making a very handsome profit of $80,000<br>PER NEW FLAT SOLD!<br><br>Several people (incl this writer) have written to newspaper forums on this<br>important issue affecting some 90% of our population.<br>Following which, there were many angry reactions on various Internet<br>websites over the PAP Government's recalcitrant "lack of transparency" on<br>the HDB Flat Pricing issue.<br><br>[ Further detailed arguments are found in this writer's "Be Open on HDB<br>Flat Pricing --- Open Letter to PM Lee" at:<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/2242 ]<br><br>5.2 High Cost of Car Ownership<br><br>For S'poreans in marketing/service type jobs or those living in the East and<br>working in Jurong area, a car is often a necessity and not a luxury.<br><br>At one time, a medium-sized car (Toyota Corolla) cost a whopping $110,000<br>(import cost from Japan was only $15,000).<br>And at another time, COE prices nearly hit $100,000 !!!<br><br>After paying the lumpsum COE upfront, the motorist next have to pay<br>recurring ERP charges !!!<br>Revenue for Govt from COE payments = $200m every month (on average)<br>Revenue from ERP = $??? per month.<br>Revenue from Parking/Traffic Offence fines = $??? per month.<br><br>5.3 Increasing Cost of Education<br><br>(a) Why such costly/posh educational institutions (sinking so much monies<br>into brick and cement???):<br><br>--- $435m SMU new City Campus in Bras Basah area.<br><br>--- $322m Republic Polytechnic new Woodlands Campus (latest amongst 5<br>Polytechnics).<br>Designed by a famous Japanese architect (expensive Foreign Talent!

[As it turned out, the 2005 figure of 14,210 was even 50% higher! ].<br><br>The build-up to our 2005 Dengue Epidemic actually started around end-2004.<br>But it was only around September 2005 [i.e. nine months later!] that the<br>laid-back NEA officials started "pressing panic buttons" ! (when our<br>hospitals were already clogged up with dengue patients).<br><br>12 Conclusion --- Factors affecting Singapore's long-term future<br><br>12.1 This is what will actually "do Singapore in" (sooner or later):<br><br>The AAA ( Arrogant/ Autocratic/ Authoritarian) style of political<br>governance --- which Singaporeans have tolerated for 40 years --- as<br>manifested in this well-known political mindset:<br><br>"We know all. We know best. We are always right. Who are you to question<br>us or tell us what to do?"<br><br>12.2 All the above various Fiasco after Fiasco point to:<br><br>(i) a pathetic lack of LEADERSHIP (at the political level)<br>(ii) a deplorable lack of MANAGERIAL COMPETENCE (at the bureaucratic<br>level)<br><br>12.3 The ROOT CAUSES behind all these fiascos lie in the following:<br><br>(a) control/manipulation of Press/TV media (people only hear "feel-good"<br>news and not "the good,the bad and the ugly" aspects of a society) =<br>yes-man journalists<br><br>(b) mollycoddling/pampering civil servants (through condoning their<br>shortcomings/mistakes in serving the people) = yes-man civil servants<br><br>(c) using the law as a political weapon through defamation suits to silence<br>differing/dissenting views (i.e. Fear Factor,Singapore Edition) = yes-man<br>citizens<br><br>Simple mathematical equation:<br>yes-man journalists + yes-man civil servants + yes-man citizens<br>= perfect recipe for fiascos/cock-ups/screw-ups/cover-ups (involving PUBLIC<br>FUNDS as well as possible HUMAN LIVES )<br>= SINGAPORE going "down the drain"<br><br>12.4 What Singaporeans have learned from the NKF Disgraceful<br>Debacle-cum-Shameful Scandal:<br><br>(a) From the Internet: "What the NKF saga has proved is that people who<br>win defamation lawsuits may not be innocent and those who lose may not be<br>guilty."<br><br>(b) Most quoteworthy Internet posting by a young/educated Singaporean:<br><br>"People with INTEGRITY counter accusations with the TRUTH, not<br>lawsuits!"<br><br>(c) What many Singaporeans think about defamation legal threats:<br><br>--- a most unbecoming/unprofessional as well as distasteful/disgraceful<br>habit (especially coming from Public Officials).<br><br>--- a cunningly-clever way to strike fear and prevent charity-donors [or<br>taxpayer-citizens] from asking rightful questions and seeking rightful<br>answers on how their donated monies [or public funds] are being spent.<br><br>(d) [ "Obviously the checks and balances didn't work." --- PM Lee's first<br>comments on the NKF Scandal (CNA 15 Jul 05) ]<br><br>Immediate Postings on the Internet:<br><br>Wearing his hat as Finance Minister, PM Lee had constantly preached on the<br>importance of Good CORPORATE Governance and the need for "checks and<br>balances"; "transparency and accountability"; "level playing field" (under<br>Competition Act) and encouraging "whistle-blowers" (to expose corporate<br>fraud/wrong-doing).<br><br>BUT wearing his hat as PRIME MINISTER, WHEN is PM Lee going to DO SOMETHING<br>about the long-overdue/much-needed similar "checks and balances", etc,etc,<br>to promote Good POLITICAL Governance ???<br><br>WHY the double standards between Corporate and Political Governance?<br><br>[ ".....we can always do BETTER if we try HARDER. We ALWAYS MUST try<br>HARDER.
