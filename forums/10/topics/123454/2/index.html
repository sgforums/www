            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Singapore government has always been very miserly in spending on people's medical, education, housing, utilities, transportation by recovering every cent through a system of creative accounting.<br><br>It will keep pointing out to the people the need to avoid welfarism. It acquires lands at nominal costs paid for by taxpaers yet sell flats built on such acquired lands at market prices to the citizens. Indirect taxes through double-charge on lands through HDB and triple-charge on vehicle through LTA impose great burdens on people and businesses alike. Yet, it would continue to resort to all kinds of corporatisation schemes to recover more costs. </blockquote>About HDB, I just wanna point out tat singapore is not the country with the highest housing costs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Singapore is also the country with the lowest income tax in the world. How should they recover money from the low income tax ? If there is no HDB and all buildings r made by private sectors, the price will be more expensive and nobody will complain.<br><br><blockquote>However through years of denying spending on essential services which people need for living, big surpluses are accumulated into billions by both fiscal budgeting and off-budget surpluses by various statutory boards.<br><br>So monies are available for spending. If the departments don't spend the surpluses or budget allocations, it will be presumed that the allocations are not needed so every department will try to spend any allocations or surpluses. </blockquote>tat may be true but I guess even in private sectors tis problem can be seen as well<br><br><blockquote>The main reason for over-spending on posh and extravagant projects like HDB HUB, Treasury Building, Esplanade (The Durian), SIR, etc may then be psychological for the reasons as stated aforesaid. </blockquote>If u ask me, wat is your definition of posh and extravagant ? I have nothing against them for having new buildings which r practically made and not purposely made expensive (except for the durian). Do u suggest tat all gov buildings must never be new and they have to keep staying at the same old place... for maybe forever ?<br><br>About the durian, it is suppose to be for the masses and not for any particular gov group. It is expensive, I got to agree but then it is sort of like welfare for the people.<br><br><blockquote>The latest posh community clubs and air-conditioned bus interchanges and many more unreported projects are just continuing unclear thinking by the cabinet on the entire budgetary process, allocations of funds, and lack of guidances to ministries on fiscal policies and implementation. </blockquote>I am just puzzled... aren't some of the commnity centres really old ? Aren't some of the bus interchange old (20 to 30 years) as well ? It is spending money to make life in singapore better. U want the facilities we use be forever old ? Why build new school ? Let the students have old ones for the next 100 years. Why spend on bus interchange ? Let them look like they r from third world country for another 50 years. Why spend on community centres ? Let them go old with age and look like haunted mansions. Why upgrade hawker centres ? Just let them continue to new old, unclean and uncomfortable. I have nothing against new buildings. I don't see it as a good thing from the gov, not a bad thing.<br><br><blockquote>Economists' traditional theories on 'spending for the sake of spending to stimulate economic activities are questionable. Billions were spent on big projects during last two recessions in this manner (for the sake of spending) without apparent effect to revive the economy. </blockquote>If they were not spent, it may become worse. i believe the construction business will be hit harder than now. So it is better to keep them in the reserves ?<br><br><blockquote>If government to begin with does not stinge so much on providing essential basic services to lower costs of living of citizens, there will be less problems or issues raised on posh projects. One will be surprised if hungry and poor citizens can stand any talks about HDB or Treasury Hubs when stomachs are hungry or if there is no more jobs. Please provide more able leadership in this regard and put a cap on unwarranted spending like on the 7 wonders (going on to 9 or more)</blockquote>there will always be people with hungry stomach in any society. So we shall never build new buildings ? I see private companies like UOB spending more money on their commercial buildings.<br><br><blockquote>Totally agreed. I would rather the the $$$ be channel into reduction in medical cost than building a air conditioned bus interchange.</blockquote>actually just a question. How much is enough ? They really do spend money on lowering price of medical care in singapore. So should we put all the money into medical and never use a cent to build new facilities ?<br><br></div>

However it is definitelyly one of the few countries having high housing costs.<br><br>It  frustrates me when people like to compare pricing with the highest in the world. It sadder me as our humble servant feels there is more room for our PUBLIC HOUSING to increase.<br><br>As what the cinema operator, Mr Tan from GV, has said  "If you look across the board  at cities, ticket prices here are still among the cheapest in the world."<br><br>In the first place, why would our government make our income tax the lowest? Who would benefit from being collecting the world's lowest  income tax? One who earns a million a month, or one who earns a thousand a month?<br><br>True they need to recover the money from the low income tax, and where do they get it from? The GST. Just imagine, every Singaporean eats 10 Kg of rice/month, or each household spent (10Kg x 4 x $2 = $80) (4 members in a household and $2 per kg of rice). A 5% GST would be $4. It is insignificant for someone earning by the millions, however it would constitute 0.4% of his monthly salary. Worse one can't survive solely on rice alone, he needs fish, chicken, eggs, electricity, water, and more. So for each month, a poor person would contribute 5% of his salary to GST, whilst a rich person need contribute less than 1% of his salary for the same amount of basic stuffs.<br><br>So who benefits the most?<br><br>HDB is one of the legacy left by the old guards (CPF is another), I am indeed grateful that all of us have a roof over their heads. Unfortunately HDB apartments are no longer affordable.<br><br>Singapore is a small country,unlike many countries. In other countries, if one feels that housing is expensive, one may probably choose to relocate somewhere. In Singapore, where can one go to?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I am gonna use slightly politer wordings to u even if u don't. Using all these verbal abuses is stating to make me look bad<br><br>First, for the sake of all mankind, please edit back your previous posts so tat it can be easier to read instead of everybody having to scroll the bar to see wat u want to say.<br><br><blockquote>Since when did Roberteh or Goodu tok abr poorly maintain gahment bldgÂ…robert tok abt functionalÂ…u r putting words into pple mouthÂ…u fuxking faggotÂ…</blockquote>Functional ? Wat is your definition of functional ? Old and badly maintained buildings is also functional. Old and dirty looking hawker centre is also functional. Old and small schools r also functional. So how low should one go in order for it to be not "functional" ? When it is on the brink of collapse or permanent electricity cut ?<br><br><blockquote>Why r old pple collecting cansÂ…why..stupidÂ…u r fuxking..moronic..tey need $$$ to surviveÂ…iamgoondu is suggesting tat more $$$ can be given out to these ppleÂ…n in yr casino forumÂ…u said tat hopefull gahment will reduce taxÂ…u also own casinoÂ…wat rubbishÂ…if these old pple r in dire stateÂ…n r not given enugÂ…will u get a share of casinoÂ…u dumb assÂ…u cÂ…everytime..something spew frm yr  fuxking mouthÂ…u hve to be whipped</blockquote>Have I ever say tat they were not there for the money ? Have I ever say they didn't do it for the money ? I am saying tat money had really been given to the poor and elderly. But no matter how much money u have set for them, there will always be poor and elderly people around in any society. U look at US, u can still see people who r homeless and sleeps on streets. So just because there will always be poor people the gov have to spend all their money on charity ? U say tat we give mroe to these people, I may agree. But if u say tat just because there r poor people, then we should't have any new upgrade of facilities, then I don't agree<br><br><blockquote>A miserably $200 n tey have to topped up $50 to get gahment sharesÂ…why this one size fits all approachÂ…Singapore is a small place to governÂ…u pple sits inside yr air-conditioned room, with yr rosy tinted glasses n plasma TV..n u think tat the whole fuxking world revolved around uÂ…</blockquote>I thinkit is dumb to ask people to put in $50 as well. But then wat has it got to do with tis topic ? Out of point !<br><br><blockquote>Tat is why is say u r a wasted civil servant. Singapore is too comfortableÂ…u fuxking civil servant r also too comfortableÂ…tats why I ask u where hve u beenÂ…hve u done any real business in developing countriesÂ…or just your study trips r holiday tripsÂ…with souvenior to hang on yr one-sided ding dong<br>We r losing our competitivenessÂ….mainland Chinese managers r getting RMB8,000 Â– RMB10,000 salary in bigger cities n in smaller cities, its even lesser..standing day n night to serve customersÂ…so air-con bus depot is a luxuryÂ…<br>aircon the whole bus depotÂ…how much electricity its going to consumeÂ…oil prices are escalatingÂ…maintenance etcÂ…n then the PTC will tell u tat they need to increase fares due to operational costÂ…waddafuxkÂ…PTC consist of SBS, TIBS management ppleÂ…u know in 2002..till a big hoohahÂ…then tey were removedÂ…</blockquote>First, I have to say I am not a civil servant. But I guess no matter how many times I say it, u will keep insisting it to be true since in your small miserable brain u believe tat those who speak out for the gov must be civil servants. Since u insist I am a civil servant, fine, then i will insist u r a porn VCD seller. U think selling porn VCDs around is a big hoo haa and somethign to be proud of meh ? Com'on man, u r insecure and just wanna boast to the peopel aroudn about your VCD sellign escapade. U r really becoming the old person I used to hate who keep droning ontheir past achievement as though it is a big deal.<br><br>If u say tat aircon interchange is luxury, then aircon buses is also a luxury. In fact aircon libraries, aircon shopping centre, aircon food court, aircon offices, aircon taxi, aircon gyms r all luxures. Then I guess singaproean can die in the hot sun and lower our productivity, making us worse off then before.<br><br><blockquote>We r toking abt choicesÂ…let consumer hve a choice..to take air-con bus or notÂ…do we really hve a choiceÂ…u fuxking moron</blockquote>Do consmer really have a choice to take aircon buses ? I wish to take express bus 502, does it have an non aircon version ? Com'on, face it. Aircon bus interchange is popular among the toa payoh resident. Tat is why they r planning for more aircon bus interchanges. It is like aircon buses. Initially everyone says it is a waste of money. Now everybody prefer to pay a little extra to sit on aircon buses instead.<br><br><blockquote>SBS has obscene profits in 2003 due to the 2002 bus fare increase..the Mobile TV was also factored to pass on cost to consumers, ezlink system also cok up, cost pass on to consumersÂ…wat abt efficiencyÂ…u c buses bunching together, safetyÂ…bus with handicap accessibility, cleaner buses, charity..etc</blockquote>I agree tat SBS had made obscene profit all these while. So ? Tis isn't a thread about askign them nto to raise prices isn't it ? It is a thread about whether should the gov spend money on things for the masses like bus interchaneg and new hawker centres and things like a new building for HDB hub. Have I ever say tat they never earn any money ? And wat r u trying to say for your later part ?<br><br><blockquote>Spending on building air-con bus depot to stimulate economyÂ…u fuxking idiotÂ…where do u learn yr economicsÂ…:</blockquote>i have said before, gov should spend more money to boost the economy. They build an aircon depot, they will employ a local company, which will buy materials for the construction. Tis will make the construction company richer and the companies tat had good purchased richer which will more liekly spend the money on other retails, boosting their sales and this money will carry on propaganting further. So gov spending money really do have an effect on the economy. So now I have explained the economic terms for u, u got any roblems with it ?<br><br><blockquote>Iamgoondu is saying tat $ can be put into better useÂ…rather than a fancy air-con bus depotÂ…roberteh highlighted tat upgrading yesÂ…but shld be functionalÂ….why do u always want to put words into pple mouthÂ…tats why I tok abt yr motherÂ….ahÂ…now u r flipping like a idiotic dog..againÂ…down boy, down boyÂ…<br>R r still living in yr dreamsÂ…Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, china, India, China economy r on trackÂ…we r running behindÂ…n u want all places to be air-conÂ…<br>Roberteh highlighted tat gahment is running on 15% GDPÂ…wow..tats high..tats why gahmnet has so much $$$ to spendÂ…but how much r given back to help the poorÂ…<br>Commo...u r given two eyes, two legs, two ears, two hands and u hve only one-ball view....pathetic...man</blockquote>and I have replied saying tat an aircon interchange is not fanciful. It is in fact practical to a certain extend. Frankly I am happy tat gov is spending money on the masses like us. Why r u nt happy with it ? They r lanning to build a new stadium as well, u r gonna complain and says we should give all the money to the aged ? Then singapore will forever be a poor place to live in since all our facilities and amenities r old, ugly and not in tune with the times. u probably never read my posts.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>It's true that Singapore is not the country with the highest housing costs. However it is definitelyly one of the few countries having high housing costs.<br><br>It frustrates me when people like to compare pricing with the highest in the world. It sadder me as our humble servant feels there is more room for our PUBLIC HOUSING to increase. </blockquote>Actually singapore housings cost is lower according to expatriates report. I also want public housing to reduce their prices too, but then tis trend of having high housing costs in develop countries is pretty difficult to change<br><br><blockquote>In the first place, why would our government make our income tax the lowest? Who would benefit from being collecting the world's lowest income tax? One who earns a million a month, or one who earns a thousand a month? </blockquote>I agree with u. However we r a nation tat need to attract rich people to come over to invest and live. As such a mean is to lower income tax.<br><br><blockquote>True they need to recover the money from the low income tax, and where do they get it from? The GST. Just imagine, every Singaporean eats 10 Kg of rice/month, or each household spent (10Kg x 4 x $2 = $80) (4 members in a household and $2 per kg of rice). A 5% GST would be $4. It is insignificant for someone earning by the millions, however it would constitute 0.4% of his monthly salary. Worse one can't survive solely on rice alone, he needs fish, chicken, eggs, electricity, water, and more. So for each month, a poor person would contribute 5% of his salary to GST, whilst a rich person need contribute less than 1% of his salary for the same amount of basic stuffs. </blockquote>Lets just say tat generally speaking, a richer person will spend more money than a poorer one. So they more they spend, the more tax they will give.<br><br><blockquote>Sir, have you been to HDB Hub in Toa Payoh? Have you visited to their Gym? Have you been to their jackpot room? Have you been to the little golf course (or park)? Have you ever slumber yourself in those cushy sofas and glue your eyes into those plasma TVs?<br><br>Why is there a need to relocate to Toa Payoh? Isn't the building in Bukit Merah just as new and big?<br><br>Sir, I believe fewer will grumble if they had retroffited the building in Bukit Merah and started a Gym, and jackpot room, a golf course, and put up sofas and plamas TV. Even though for 10 years the companies I have worked with never have a Gym.<br><br>And to let you know, my company allocates 3 Gym Pass (1 day each) for a staff strength of 800 each month. </blockquote>don't need to call me sir... I have been to the HDb hub and frankly... it is not really as posh as some describe. On whether is bukit merah good enough, well there r complaints tat it was overcrowded with a very low ceiling and it indeed look a bit old frot he outside... the new HDB hub is also built in 1995 when the economy is booming in singapore then.<br><br><blockquote>HDB is one of the legacy left by the old guards (CPF is another), I am indeed grateful that all of us have a roof over their heads. Unfortunately HDB apartments are no longer affordable. </blockquote>I wish for the pricing of hdb to be reduce as well. In fact  am also deeply angered by the fact tat the housing is getting smaller and smaller for the high price given as well. However I guess tat is the problem of limited land in singapore followed by the fact tat developed cities always have these problems of small and expensive housings<br><br><blockquote>Singapore is a small country,unlike many countries. In other countries, if one feels that housing is expensive, one may probably choose to relocate somewhere. In Singapore, where can one go to? And to own one HDB flat, one probably has to bond himself voluntarily for 30 years to be a slave of our system. </blockquote>However most jobs r found in the cities, which can get to be bigger than singapore. It is not really practical to ask people to travel 4 hours a day to and fro to save on the housings. In fact houses not in the city area but close to it is almost as expensive as well. However after u manage to have a house, the value of the house is still relatively there. For some people in other cities, the most they can do is rent and they will never have the chance to ge back the money<br><br><blockquote>Why are you comparing yourself with a private company? UOB is making monies and I see little wrong for them to spend on new commercial building. Is HDB making monies? </blockquote>I don't think it is fair to ask all civil servants to work in old lousy environment when their counter part r working in fabulous new beautiful buildings. Civil servants r working for the career, they r not working as a public service to the people.<br><br><blockquote>Do you still think that I am selffish? </blockquote>I am not sayign u r selfish, but your idea tat an aircon interchange is unnecessary because u do not use it is a bit.. selfish. I am tryingto tell u there r people who use it and we should not forget their welfare as well<br><br><blockquote>I hope you would see my point, for bus interchanges, LTA spent the monies and bus companies foot the monthly maintenances. And who would ultimately pay for these maintenances? Would one stay more than 30 minutes in a bus interchange? Why bother to have air conditioning system in a bus interchange? I would rather LTA spend the monies in engaging more securities, at least more Singaporeans are at work. </blockquote>Why need to have aircon buses ? the people only need to stay there for 30 minutes too as well isn't it ? Why bother ? because if u r a user of the interchange, u will enjoy this welfare to the people since u can sweat less, u can feel the comfort when travelling to your destination. As said before, u say it is unecessary, but some people felt tat it is a great imporvement. We have to cater to the welfare of all parties isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>? cents fare adjustments probably have lesser impacts for you and I and for all of us in this forums, for we have accessed to the internet. I advise you not to forget about the silent majority. Perhaps you should read up the Chinese Evening Dailies (LianHeWanBao and ShinMin Dailies) if you have not, and you would probably know there are still many not as fortunate as all of us. </blockquote>It has an impact on me as well. I take public transport too. I also wish the fares to be cheaper as well. There r a lot of unfortunate peopel around, I agree. Bt I pay tax not only to help these people, but also expect to see an improvement in my surroundings as well. I want to use a new stadium. I want to enoy watching musical at a posh esplanade. I want to use an aircon bus interchange as well. We can't just spend <strong>all</strong> our money on charity solely.</div>

Maybe we can propose we use back 2nd hand no name brand of buses and do not employ any cleaners to clean the bus. Propose we use lesser buses so there will be lesser frequency between trips. Propose the bus drivers not to wear uniform but any clothes they desire when driving. Propose we remove all the seats from buses and MRT so there will be more space for more standing people.
