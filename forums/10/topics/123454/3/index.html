U r detached frm the reality, our IT engineers for eg. salary r depressed by these Indian engineers..n most of these, I say, most of these huhÂ…donÂ’t put words in my mouthÂ…cannot deliverÂ….the best of these Indian IT engineers would not be in Singapore, itÂ’s the 3-rated tat hve nowhere to go..tat wants to come to SingaporeÂ….the same goes for these Mainland Chinese engineers..tey r in the same category as these IndiansÂ…. </blockquote>I said before, tis is not a thread about foreign talents. If u attack about indian IT engineers or china ones, frankly they r performing well in their fields. They r not 3rd rated engineers tat have nowhere to go, they r some of the top scholars in their country, tat is why they r chosen to come here. U probably don;t knwo much about them and quick to say tat they r lousy. If they r tat bad, then they won't even be employed be private companies even if they come here. I don't think u had made a frank assessment of their capabilities.<br><br><blockquote>If our own software engineers r not given the chance to program, to do coding, very quickly, tey will lose their skillsetsÂ…..wad will happen to tem..taxidrivers..hawkers..etc.. </blockquote>when u make programming, u r facing competition from the whole world. If we follow anti-competition system, the whole company will be at a disadvantage and may fold. In tat case singaporean become taxidrivers and hawkers, but the one buying from them become lesser<br><br><blockquote>Hey, these Plasma n LCD TVs was purchased a few yrs agoÂ…I think 3 Â– 5 yrs backÂ…was Singapore economy good at tat point in timeÂ…u shld knowÂ…<br>Those Fujitsu 42Â’Â’ or 43Â” Plasma in HDB Toa Payoh was purchased I think, 4 -5 yrs backÂ…wad was the price thenÂ…$15 Â– 18K per Plasma Ok..todays price ranges frm 7k Â– 9k.<br>R u aware tat some school require their students to use tablet pcsÂ…how much is tablet pc costÂ…3 Â– 4kÂ…how can the average family afford tablet PCsÂ… </blockquote>First, i don't think they r bought 3-5 years ago. They r probably bought 1-2 years ago. It is not 15-20 K. u can buy the whole thetre system with 15-20k. Tablet Pc ? Wat has tat got to do with LCD ?<br><br><blockquote>Ya, then donÂ’t call it subsidize housingÂ….HDB public housing policy was not wrong in the beginningÂ…its was a lofty aspiration under LKY tat Singaporeans hve a decent roof over their headÂ….i hve tremendous respect 4 LKYÂ….even though some of his policy..like graduate mum policyÂ…hve a lump in my throatÂ….LKY heart is for SingaporeÂ…along the wayÂ…it was treated as a cash cow..to milk SingaporeansÂ…anyway its another topicÂ…sorri I driftedÂ…<br>HeyÂ…did u rememberÂ…some private condoÂ…prices was lower than some EC condoÂ…just like gahment hospital was more expensive than private hospital..until Khaw Boon Wah became Health Minister n he did a good job exposing the price discrepancyÂ…</blockquote>Generally, Gov hospital is still cheaper than private ones for the same treatment. Generally, public housing of the same room size on the same location is cheaper compared to private housing. In a way the price is reduced. If u compared the housing os singapore to other countries, it is really cheaper despite our small land size<br><br><blockquote>Tats their job manÂ…u cuckooÂ…tey r paid to improveÂ…but to always pass on cost to consumersÂ…isnÂ’t it tad Singaporeans become suckersÂ…I understand tat for MRt card, there is a depositÂ…n there is a timelimitÂ…I think 2 years ago, it was reported tat these unclaimed deposits, due to the timelimit, was in millions of $$$...hey, these monies belong to Singaporeans n not MRTÂ…r tey accountableÂ…or it just add up to the profits of MRTÂ…commoÂ…HK MTR r even cheaper than SingaporeÂ…the same goes for Shanghai MRTÂ…whyÂ…tell me whyÂ…because it is public transport..n these opearators were smart to tap into rentals to help subsidise the fares to remain affordableÂ…do tey n can tey put their own MRT, SBS pple into their PTC..no possible..as there r regulationsÂ…Both HK, Shanghai have LCDs, how come tey can maintain their Â“affordableÂ” rates..u tell meÂ…or yr understudy trips did not include HK n Shanghai</blockquote>Most technological improving need to spend money. U don't expect the people who develop new technologies to eat grass. If improvements r needed, than we expect to pay a price for it. If u feel tat it is their job to improve, then we have to pay for these improvements. U think ezlink cards drop from the sky ? If u ask me, r HK public transport cheaper than singapore ? I have checked the pricing for both and find tat for the same kind fo transport, it is about the same. For HK, the price is HK$ 4 to 12.50  ($0.80 to 2.50 singapore). For aircon buses, it is approximately HK$12, which is $2.40. If u ask me, they r about the same.<br><br></div>
