Tis actually just confirm the suspicion tat singaporean girl, in a sense, really become a bit too choosy. Is singaporean guy tat useless ? I mean, can we really blame a person if he do not succeed fiancially ? There r always people losing out in the rat race and does tat make him being despised and look down upon ? I thought personality compatibility is the more important than choosing fiancial compatibility... Tat really means tat singaporean blue collar or poorer male really can't find a singaporean wife... IMO, a normal male will prefer to choose a singaporean wife than a foreign one. Why choose a person who had difficulty in learning your culture and language who is also a potential embarrassment (finding a foreign wife meant u can't find a local one) to yourself ? Maybe they r really right in saying tat they can't find a singaporean girl willing to be his wife because they r too choosy. They rather remains single then marrying a "prince riding a white horse".<br><br>I also find it a surprise tat a lot of girls here put all the blame of a failed relationship on the men solely... IMO a failed relationship may means both party is at fault and not just one sided... And even if it really is the fault of one party, it shouldn't be used to knock down the whole perception of male in general. Another surprise I have is some girls actually do not intend to get married and list down reasons why marriage is out. IMO, marriage meant a totally diffeent thing from wat she described. Marriage has nothing to do with "servitude and slavery". If there is true love to each other, they will "volunteer" to help out others and also can "demand help" when he/she needs it as well. I don't know man... children r better raised from your own, the thought of staying in an old folks home remind me of a hospice and pets can't even talk... unless u just want a listener who cannot comunicate back... I find more compelling reasons to get married than not. </div></blockquote>Some of your points are valid and I agree with you.

Maybe that is why women accept these changes more easily than the guys. I mean, housework is now split between the spouses and women get to work. However traditional values such as men contributing to the household expenditure still sticks.</div>

Built in mentality. Along the way, women realised that can catch biggest dinosaur, and big cave doesn't mean he can treat you well, so add more requisites into it. More sophisticated the society, more a woman needs to look into for a long term relationship that CAN give her a stable family (with or without kids)<br><br>overseas, Sg men compared to their local men, looks richer have more things<br>so women more willing to marry you loh<br><br>but in Sg.. if you cannot compare to other local men, then Sg women try to find better catch elsewhere lor. But if Sg women like AngMo, then they SPG. then what, those foreign brides also SPG also what (Singaporean Party Girl).<br><br>so double standards that women in other countries can 'marry up' and not be 'materialistic' simply cos their idea of 'materialistic' is something achieveable.<br><br>Anyway all these requisites, I think all add up to 100 percent.

YEAHHHHH!!!!<br>Compared with girls abroad (WHO TEND TO BE MORE WILD!!!!), Singapore Girls are very decent, sticky and "Pure". Girls in western countries etc have the cool factor in them, that makes them go for guys who are cool, divorce rates abroad are way more than the % in Singapore. Though personally, i love ABCs (Aussie born or American born chinese), i find it too hard to keep a relationship with them. They tend to be so cool about things, so cool that they would leave ya as coolly too.  Maybe i don't talk their "language" or something, i don't know...<br>But never would i find an abroad girl being sticky.<br>Of course, wild girls are always more interesting, and probably, they have the energy and adventured life that makes them so cool. SG girls can be kinda boring at times, but living in SG is kinda boring many times anyway.<br>Even if the new generations are getting more hippie and wild, it still never really outbeats what's abroad. Somehow, this country is still covered with much conservatism. So that makes them hard to sleep with, to be frank!!!!<br>But when it comes to asking the question, are SG girls more materialistic, OH YEAH!!! Are abroad girls materialistic too, OH YEAH!!!! Girls everywhere are kinda materialistic after all, or maybe culture is made that way. But when they find their right one, " too hell with money!!!"<br>And oh yeah, SG girls worry more about things, but SG guys worry too. We worry more than people abroad!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i like mistyblue and odysseus' replies.<br><br>personally, i feel that sg men are asking too much of their female counterparts. the cost of living in sg is getting pretty high. both parents need to work to support the children. (most families anyway). so men want their wives to help in the family income. and on top of that they want wives to cook, wash, iron, bring in the papers, make coffee, massage, have sex, look after the kids, mop the floor, make the bed, stay young and sexy etc etc etc etc for them??!!!!!<br><br>i don't think so.<br><br>if sg men want a housewife, a gal who will gladly give you children, look after your kids, pamper you when u get home from work, then make sure you're the only one who's bringing the bread home. that way, your wife doesn't have to juggle YOU with her WORK and KIDS.<br><br>honestly, before you men point fingers, do some soul searching.<br><br>you think we women really WANT to be successful in our careers?? we are only fighting for our survival. we NEED to be able to feed ourseleves in case men are not up to it. we can't rely on marriage as 100% as before, so we need to have a career to fall back on. who doesn't want to be fed by another person, don't have to go and work and face all those #$&amp;@^$ collegues and bosses??<br><br>amidst all the "love is about being able to connect at the emotional level" romance, it's about time to get down to business. the lovey dovey i'll-love-you-forever doesn't fill stomachs. you want a wife, you need to be able to feed her.<br><br>and for GOD's sake, sg women aren't all that successful in their careers like we all think. only 20% of the top managerial positions in singapore are occupied by women. guys are still at the top, no matter what we all think or want. so guys... make your own mark. don't blame women when you can't get them ok?</div>
