            <div class='col-md body'>First off I would like to indicate that this is my own personal viewpoint as a guy and is definetely not representative of all the guys out there.<br><br>I think being a guy in Singapore is tough in terms of getting a girl. Really. You have to go through NS and after that you still have to slog to earn money to pay for your own studies if your family is not rich. Lets just face the fact that guys from well off families have it easier.<br><br>There have a recent bout of girls and guys bashing going around and I think seriously it not about whos at fault.  Its just about <strong>personal expectations and the realities of the ever increasing cost of living in Singapore.</strong><br><br>For me I've always been interested in ladies 3 or 4 years older than me. I'm 25 now. Reason: From my experience, they are more mature and really are more supportive and understanding. The problem is ladies have a tendency to look for guys older than themselves because they feel that older guys are more financially stable and better able to take care of them. I won't call this materialistic actually, just realistic and theres nothing wrong with that. Even ladies your age tend to go for older guys<br><br>So the typical "custom" among us local guys is to go for younger girls since the rate of success is better. Thing is younger girls might  not be very mature in their thinking and there are some that are "materialistic". They tend to judge people by their cover. Don't tell me it makes no different because I underwent an "image change" and I know the difference it makes.<br><br>The really sad thing here is most guys pretend to some extent to get a girl. Whats the point? In other words, most guys have to wear a mask to get a girl. Why. A few examples. Like to watch anime, play games = not mature. If mature = not finacially stable etc. Not everyone can accept people for what they are.<br><br>Coupled with the rising cost of living (more expensive here than in New York) ,the competiveness in such a small piece of land and the governments "love" of foreign talent first, its no surprise everyone wants the best.<br><br>Its a personal choice. But for me, I hope to finish my studies and after gaining some years of experience, maybe go someplace else where the cost of living is lower and where I can be "myself" and still be accepted for not going right when everyone is going left <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for female who think man blue-collar are going for foriegn girls. I think they are wrong. More and more man earning $2500 to $3500 are going oversea to marry foriegn woman ! And if they is not call white-collar. I believe... most of the Singaporean are blue-collar low-wages man. Unable to marry local woman ! Only foriegn woman suit them best !<br><br>That is the problem of Singaporean girls . Look higher and higher ! $10,000 dollars , $20,000 dollars. Then finally ! OUR PM $100,000++ dollars per month.<br>How many people in their 25 to 34 can earn that kind of salary ? Even they can earn. Why can't they choose a woman in oversea who is more simple !<br><br>Let say finally the man make it to the top of the cream. How old he is already ? 35 or 40 ? Then find a woman in their 20++ or 30++ ? 30++ already old. 20++ isn't it too young ? So.......... right every man should do that ! Then go and suffer. Why not go aboard and settle when they reach 29 years old ? Simple as that ! The foriegn woman who want to marry got a young man. And she is just 21 years old. 29 years old, 21 years old Even meet father-in-law also happy ! Better than 50 years old, 21 years old right ?<br><br></div>

Maybe they wanted some more time to see if the boyfriend is a suitable partner for life? There could be many other reasons why a good Singaporean girl would not want to marry in her early 20s, and those reasons can't be all bad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway. You still can work hard on your jobs. Working hard in your study after marriage. As long two-years don't have any kids. It's perfectly allright. I believe that is so for a woman who is 24 years old. Should be married. Or else, when woman grow older and older like 26,27,28. Plently of man tired of waiting, beauty also lost with time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Why not find a woman just sitting at his side ? Or the next table ? She also the same beauty. Same age, Young, etc ? Why not ? Why stick to the same boat when you can find another one that set your goals !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Give you example like DRGG say.<br><br>I am 40++ and single. Should I be worry ?<br><br>Basicly,  I say to such people is that ! SINCE YOU ARE SO OLD ! YOU ARE ALREADY TOO OLD. IT'S BETTER FOR YOU TO REMAIN SINGLE FOR LIFE !<br><br>1. If you have kids, Let say 42, By the time you are 62, no jobs already. You are a burden to the family.<br><br>2. Haven't see grandchildren. You died already. And even got, you also cannot take care of grandchildren as you are 73++. Old and shaky !<br><br>3. If you marry at 30. Have kids. But the time grandchildren. You still at 57.<br>Still able to take care children and strong. No illness. By the time 73, your grandchildren in their teens. No problem. You died also never mind.<br><br>4. Don't go vietnam and rape 18 years old woman. The father-in-law see you also sad. My child going to marry such a old man ! Maybe same age as me ! My daughter got rape and sold away ! I rather he find a young man, Wonder you will died in next 10 years or not !<br><br>By the way, Since when I am speaking to the above 35 years old man ? I am telling you. Youth is limited. Time is short. If Singapore woman don't want to settle down. Find others !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like mistyblue's reply.<br><br>let me share with you some of my personal experence (I'm not trying to say all gals are like dat):<br><br>I have dated numerous gals, some serious, some just testing water. Most have been sg gals, although there has been indo and malaysian gals. I am sg chinese, all the gals i date are chinese by race.<br><br>I once dated a certain law student, she is one of the black sheep mentioned in the preceeding posts. I am not very well to do, not very poor either. Every date, I must drive my merc to pick her up. If i'm not driving that day, she will cancel the appointment. She even declared that her man must have a car, preferbly of the merc, bmw variety and have a powerful job, not just a middle level job, but a high flying job.<br><br>During the time we were together, she demanded the impossible of me (Why can't you read my mind! Obviously you dun love me!), put me thru test after test.<br><br>I felt she was conceited and materialistic and we quarrelled everyday. Why was I with her? I dun know... All these despite her being of a lower status than me.<br><br>We broke up because my dad was selling his merc.<br><br>I dated a gal from indo, she is rich, successful, pretty, everything sg gals think they are. For the short time we were together, she treated me with respect, love, concern, and gentleness.<br><br>I knew I was of a lower status than the indo gal, but yet she never once made me feel that way. (Let's just say my dad has a few bank accounts, her dad has a few banks)<br><br>Of course 1 gal doesn't represent the whole country, but like i said, these are my personal experiences that I will never forget.<br><br>Of course I have met many nice sg gals along the way, but none of them will ever take me for who I am like the indo gal. Most local gals will accept me but include conditions like the ability to lead certain lifestyle and of course if I get paid above a certain amt.<br><br>I'm still looking for that special sg gal, but frankly, its taking too long.<br><br>I am currently dating a sg gal, and does she see a future with me? "Only if I can get my degree, save up enough to buy that condo, and of course give her no less that 1.5K to spend per month.<br><br>Why am i still with her? I dunno.<br><br>But I am still looking for a gal that can answer the question with, "Yes, because I love you".</div>

Working hard in your study after marriage. As long two-years don't have any kids. It's perfectly allright. I believe that is so for a woman who is 24 years old. Should be married. Or else, when woman grow older and older like 26,27,28. Plently of man tired of waiting, beauty also lost with time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Why not find a woman just sitting at his side ? Or the next table ? She also the same beauty. Same age, Young, etc ? Why not ? Why stick to the same boat when you can find another one that set your goals !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Give you example like DRGG say.<br><br>I am 40++ and single. Should I be worry ?<br><br>Basicly,  I say to such people is that ! SINCE YOU ARE SO OLD ! YOU ARE ALREADY TOO OLD. IT'S BETTER FOR YOU TO REMAIN SINGLE FOR LIFE !<br><br>1. If you have kids, Let say 42, By the time you are 62, no jobs already. You are a burden to the family.<br><br>2. Haven't see grandchildren. You died already. And even got, you also cannot take care of grandchildren as you are 73++. Old and shaky !<br><br>3. If you marry at 30. Have kids. But the time grandchildren. You still at 57.<br>Still able to take care children and strong. No illness. By the time 73, your grandchildren in their teens. No problem. You died also never mind.<br><br>4. Don't go vietnam and rape 18 years old woman. The father-in-law see you also sad. My child going to marry such a old man ! Maybe same age as me ! My daughter got rape and sold away ! I rather he find a young man, Wonder you will died in next 10 years or not !<br><br>By the way, Since when I am speaking to the above 35 years old man ? I am telling you. Youth is limited. Time is short. If Singapore woman don't want to settle down.

Singapore woman expect you to high flyers not middle-income. Get a foriegn girl as your wife ! That is the best in the world !<br><br>If in the future some Singaporean ask you why ? Just tell them it's faith. And leave them on the shelf high high up ! Alone ! Collect dust as they rot.<br><br>You know already right. What is happening. This is what is happening around Singapore all the time. So.......... nice Singapore gals have a price to pay. If they look good. They know. They want a rich man and use their beauty when it last. That is the way of Singapore woman. Once you get it. You eyes open and you go into the higher level of understanding. They want money and nothing else from you. So........ most of the pretty Singapore gals think that way too. And in great numbers.<br><br>Woman with beauty look for cash man. Just ask them the simple question.<br><br>" YOU THINK your CB make of gold ? I can get rich by having sex with you huh ? "<br><br>"Your same face. I can get it at anyway nowdays in KTV. So what. "<br><br>Just that you never go into it. Or else........ you mind will go into the higher level of understanding of woman. Understand who is good and who is not good. Find a simple woman as your wife. Willing to earn and build a family with you. Don't find beautiful woman who want instant suger daddy. If they want........ let  them be !
