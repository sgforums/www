            <div class='col-md body'>Current man &amp; women grown up in a peaceful &amp; econimic high growth period. Almost everything in their up growing life seems easy &amp; expected. So upon deciding partners, sure expect higher then what they experiance now.<br><br>Would stress that many are selecting base on them-self out wards. Not wanting to see want that person is in the first place. Weather been rich or poor does not gurantee happiness. It's the attude towards the relationship &amp; how to "see" &amp; handle it in a caring &amp; sensible way (Loving Way).<br><br>Just too many forgot how to "love". Love is not measure by money or material. Too bad current trends mixed love up with other things.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Hint: A rich or capable guy is always in demand. No matter he is married with 1, 2 or 3 wives... he is still in demand by "other" women. So women out there think twice. Want to marry a rich guy &amp; start worrying of "Other" women? Or marry a "Lovable Normal Guy".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Hint: Women's demand changes from time to time just like stocks market. Sometimes is low .... May goes lower (Fat hope) ... but most people (99.99%) wants their stocks to go higher. Either you need to have a abilities to buy stocks (High) or get a "Low Low Demand Women" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I am a bit surprised tat so many girls felt singaporean men r useless... Tis actually just confirm the suspicion tat singaporean girl, in a sense, really become a bit too choosy. Is singaporean guy tat useless ? I mean, can we really blame a person if he do not succeed fiancially ? There r always people losing out in the rat race and does tat make him being despised and look down upon ? I thought personality compatibility is the more important than choosing fiancial compatibility... Tat really means tat singaporean blue collar or poorer male really can't find a singaporean wife... IMO, a normal male will prefer to choose a singaporean wife than a foreign one. Why choose a person who had difficulty in learning your culture and language who is also a potential embarrassment (finding a foreign wife meant u can't find a local one) to yourself ? Maybe they r really right in saying tat they can't find a singaporean girl willing to be his wife because they r too choosy. They rather remains single then marrying a "prince riding a white horse".<br><br>I also find it a surprise tat a lot of girls here put all the blame of a failed relationship on the men solely... IMO a failed relationship may means both party is at fault and not just one sided... And even if it really is the fault of one party, it shouldn't be used to knock down the whole perception of male in general. Another surprise I have is some girls actually do not intend to get married and list down reasons why marriage is out. IMO, marriage meant a totally diffeent thing from wat she described. Marriage has nothing to do with "servitude and slavery". If there is true love to each other, they will "volunteer" to help out others and also can "demand help" when he/she needs it as well. I don't know man... children r better raised from your own, the thought of staying in an old folks home remind me of a hospice and pets can't even talk... unless u just want a listener who cannot comunicate back... I find more compelling reasons to get married than not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>From my past experience, I found Singapore women too self-centred - when in<br>the relationship, it's very much about the passive (and unspoken) expectation of the lady on the guy to take the initiative to do the chasing, sacrifice, giving, etc, etc to please and amuse them. The relationship continues fine until one day the girl kicks up a fuss when the guy can't meet her expectations and she becomes unreasonable. That's when the guy throws in the towel and move on.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
