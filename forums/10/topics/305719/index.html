              <p><span class="postbody"> Perhaps ex-minister Dr. Tony Tan, Deputy Chairman of GIC will have a big headache how to disclose figures as there are too much losses. 
                                                      <br> <br> The normal accounting practice is to value the stocks and shares at
                                                      yearly interval at current market values recognizing those counters
                                                      hopelessly lost as losses e.g. Micropolis (-S$600 mil) Shin Corp (-$1.5
                                                      bil) and Global Crossing (-$1.0 bil).
                                                      <br> <br>These counters actually cannot be treated as long-term investments
                                                      or paper losses because of too many years in the red against normal
                                                      accounting principles.
                                                      <br> <br>Most likely Micropolis or Shin Corp will be treated as long-term
                                                      investment and remain closeted as paper losses to avoid queries.
                                                      <br> <br>One way out perhaps is for them to wait to sell certain counters
                                                      for gains in order to eventually cover up or offset the heavy losses in
                                                      counters like Micropolis or Shin Corp or wait longer to find some
                                                      talents to turn around such companies.
                                                      <br> <br>In other words, he will have to use creative accounting called codes of
                                                      practice to delay realizing losses from Micropolis or Shin Corp or
                                                      Global Crossing as the board can then give some excuses like long-term investments to delay counting such losses until some other counters make monies to cover up
                                                      or liquidate such irretrievable losses.<br></span></p>

              <p>I am aware of the difference between these two entities. The principle of accounting should still be applied in recognizing losses which are beyond redemption or irretrievable whether the losses are incurred by GIC or Temasek. Both entitles are managing taxpayers' monies as trustees. As trustees they are bound by laws and regulations under Company Act etc to avoid investing trust monies in such a over-hasty and emotional manner as seen in Micropolis or Shin Corp.</p>
              <p>Records do not speak well of their judgment in both entities whether they are done by Temasek or GIC.</p>
              <p>Both entities have an tendency to invest people's trust monies in over-risky investments full of worms which they know nothing or next to nothing about.</p>
              <p>Now in the latest acquisitions of UBS or Citibank again they are being emotional or headstrong going in to acquire loss-making companies at the beginning of a down cycle or financial crisis.</p>
              <p>As trustees they are not acting with prudence or wisdom or strategy as it has been proven now again after Micropolis and Shin Corp they do not understand much about worms or downside risk.</p>

              <p>robert, Temasek is the one that invest in Shin Corp not GIC. Whatever tony tan were saying in the DAVOS meeting is concerning GIC not Temasek.</p>

              <p>And it is a known fact the GIC is a more conservative investor as compared to Temasek.</p>

              <p>from an investor point of view, the timing for this purchase is timely, given that the cost  is lower and that GIC is at the advantage and that they have done their homework carefully.</p>

              <p>Seven Eleven,</p>
              <p>On what basis do you consider buying a stock at the beginning of a crisis good buy based on good timing?</p>
              <p>Based on what good experiences or track records of the past would you say that Temasek CEO or its investment team were capable of buying into good strategic stock with good judgment and good timing?</p>
              <p>Without showing citizens they have this uncanny ability to gaze the crystal ball would you not be merely saying that Temasek is merely buying such stocks like Citibank or UBS based on gut feel or emotionalism or being headstrong ?</p>
              <p>If Temasek claims it has such uncanny ability to gaze into the crystal ball for good timing why was it not capable of seeing that the disk drive industry was being phased out at the time it purchased Micropolis or that Thaksin and his family were being investigated for corruption over transfer of monies without paying taxes from Shin Corp.</p>
              <p>So what is due diligence after all and what is the "so called good-timing".</p>
              <p>Was not such a tendency to go buy on impulse yet another example of emotionalism or being headstrong?</p>

                                      diligence and decision making process in the acquisitions of
                                      UBS or Citibank. </span></span></span></span></p>
              <p>If someone causes big losses of trust monies or public funds due to carelessness in investment or making of investment decisions without complying with certain codes of practice is he immune from prosecution?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can such a person simply claim due diligence and hopes to be spared the jail sentence for a crime? If he is simply pleading mitigation, we can understand and would like to know whether he has been following a certain codes of practice in doing so before excusing him of liability or criminality.</p>
              <p>Without such standard of transparency or accountability how couldTemasek or GIC be taking charge of people's assets with professionalism as stated in its annual reports or prospectus to overseas clients or its own citizens as presented by Temasek's Executive Director Mr. Israel?</p>
              <p>If Temasek or GIC is to invest people's hard-earned monies by billions surely it has to have greater calibre than pleading honest mistakes or diligence for the lost billions in Micropolis or Shin Corp.</p>
              <p>Dr. Tony Tan by announcing GIC's intention to put up a code of practice obviously has relented on its past defiance in refusing to disclose relevant investment processes and decision making codes of practices based on some flimsy excuses like classified information or avoidance of rogue currency manipulators' predations.</p>
              <p>So it is clear that the so-called due diligence exercised in such cases like Micropolis or Shin Corp as mentioned in the foregoing is as good as crystal ball gazings, gut feel or emotionalism.</p>
              <p>There is a common saying "bluff me once shame on you, bluff me twice shame on me" Citizens must be wondering among themselves why up to now they are still having so much wool pulled over their eyes and could do nothing to stop such repeated wrongful investment practices at the highest level claimed to be our talents.</p>
              <p><span><span><span><span>Now whether UBS or Citibank buys are eventually good buy or bad buy few people can tell or agree. What is certain is that buying stocks at the beginning of major financial crisis is certainly not being strategic or prudent or wise or exercise of due diligence. </span></span></span></span></p>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>What <span><span><span><span>Temasek or GIC should realize nevertheless is they should take great care in investing public monies of which they are trustees. </span></span></span></span></div>

              <p>An typical economic cycle last for about 10 to 12 years. If I am investing during the down cycle, I would expect to hold the share for at least 5 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Warren Buffet part his stake in petrolchina somewhere in Nov07, subprime crisis surface somewhere in Jul07. Reason why WB sold his stake in PC is because of the high risk in Shanghai Stock exchange. If Warren buffet is short term opportunist investor like what you said, I am sure he would have exit his entire equity portfolio before the global market meltdown in Nov07 isnt it? Why didnt he do that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want to give credit to WB, howcome you dont praise Temasek for reducing their stake in Bank of China and ICB before the major meltdown in stock market? </p>

              <p>AFAIK, both GIC and Temasek have not run into -ve rate of return situation in the overall portfolio. As long as they are delivering the goods, I dont see why you should be so concern. Unless of course you are confident that you can do better.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets me put you a challenge. Why dont you mark in your diary and we revisit this discussion in 3 years time and then we see what is Temasek and GIC rate of return from their UBS, ML, Citibank investment?</p>

              <p>You should not just mark on your diary these two counters UBS, Citibank, you should have marked on the same diary Micropolis, Shin Corp, Tecomsel, Global Crossing, so that those who are in charge claiming to have talents will always see for themselves that they have not been making good return in the past hitherto as compared with Warren Buffet or Harvard University.</p>
              <p>So they should not be making all those claims of success. As for the future we shall only wait and see but for now we could see that they have acted without much insight or prudence in rushing into stocks even for long term in the beginning of major financial crisis.</p>

              <p>Not flaming you but seriously, the only reason why I would vote for the opposition would be that I'm pissed with the PAP and would want to give a promising opposition party a chance. I wouldn't call that a smart or wise choice because the opposition will be a question mark as well.</p>
              <p>Today if i take up your offer and think: "whether do you want your

              <p>If Temasek claims it has such uncanny ability to gaze into the crystal ball for good timing why was it not capable of seeing that the disk drive industry was being phased out at the time it purchased Micropolis or that Thaksin and his family were being investigated for corruption over transfer of monies without paying taxes from Shin Corp.</p>

                  This reporter has not read news.Tony Tan said GIC IS NOT white knight to save any company and US or France financial market.
                  He just looks at Singapore's interest.Go where there is profits.</p>
              <p> pl tell him if there is any good buy.</p>
              <p><strong> GIC smelled some wrong in the market globally and sold a lot of asset in 2 Q and 3 Q in 2007.</strong>Thats why he has cash to buy 
                    ''"We will look at any deal that is shown to us. We have a duty to do so. We would still have the capacity if we find it worthwhile to invest," The Business Times quoted Tony Tan, GIC's deputy chairman and executive director, as saying.''</p>
