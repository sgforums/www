              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>At first, when i saw cna ticket tape about sg PERC ranking, i felt so good it ranked 1st but asia pac only.</p>
              <p>Then i searched more on what is PERC about and how it comes up with this index on corruption. I was interested  to find out how can someone know exactly and clearly how much corruption exist.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/connectasia/stories/200904/s2541551.htm">http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/connectasia/stories/200904/s2541551.htm</a></p>
              <p>From the above, i learnt that , quote, "The survey ranked countries according to levels of perceived corruption as seen by expat businessmen."</p>
              <p>wow, i am amazed that it a Survey and its a PERCEPTION by Expats.</p>
              <p>I felt disappointed in this ranking as it indicates to me that there is no way to find out how corrupt a country really is. Its not Absolute. Its a perception.</p>
              <p>Perception by Wiki : "...</p>
              <p>Perception is one of the oldest fields in psychology. The oldest quantitative law in psychology is the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Weber-Fechner law" href="/wiki/Weber-Fechner_law"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Weber-Fechner law</span></a>, which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of physical stimuli and their perceptual effects. The study of perception gave rise to the <a title="Gestalt psychology" href="/wiki/Gestalt_psychology"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Gestalt</span></a> school of psychology, with its emphasis on <a title="Holism" href="/wiki/Holism"><span style="color: #002bb8;">holistic</span></a> approach.</p>
              <p>What one perceives is a result of interplays between past experiences, including one’s culture, and the interpretation of the perceived. If the percept does not have support in any of these perceptual bases it is unlikely to rise above perceptual threshold.</p>
              <p>" </p>
              <p>I worry about using perception as people can be Biased like it or not.</p>
              <p>By the way, here is PERC homepage:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.asiarisk.com/index.html">http://www.asiarisk.com/index.html</a></p>
              <p>I noted from the website that they provide services as in "As part of our services, PERC produces a range of <a href="/forums/10/topics/percrpts.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">risk reports </span></span></a>on the countries of Asia, paying special attention to critical socio-political variables like corruption, intellectual property rights risks, labor quality, and other systemic strengths and weakness of individual Asian countries. "</p>
              <p>Overall, i feel great listening to the news but anti-climaxed just a bit when i learnt what it is based on. So, overall, i still felt really good but short of a high.</p>
              <p>I wonder how much does the ordinary singaporeans understand what PERC is all about? They just see the news say number 1 this and that. i hope they understand and hope the links provide some additional useful info for them.</p>

              <p>erm, i wonder does population size affect corruption?</p>
              <p>i mean, china has over 1 billion people. where does corruption come from?</p>
              <p>Humans.</p>
              <p>Corruption does not come from animals or stones , cars , trees or fish or table or your mobile phone. It comes from people.</p>
              <p>If 1 person commits numerous corruption, is that counted as 1 corruption or multiple corruption?</p>
              <p>Can corruption be known if the case is kept secret? why would people want to tell the world about corruption?</p>

              <p>Corruption in Singapore is largely driven underground - out of public sight.</p>
              <p>Those found to be corrupted are asked to resign quietly from public office - and if one is stupid to defy such "soft persuasion" - the full force of the judicial process will be applied to remove one from office.</p>

              <p>While his surviving family members could not be held responsible for his acts - it was amazing that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/news/222007122015.htm">excess stocks were acquired by Temasek Holdings – and overnight making Temasek the largest shareholder in the bank (*4).  </a></p>
              <p>Then there was the public donations that resulted in the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital to be built in Sembawang Constituency, and the Khoo Teck Puat Building being built next to the Medical Alumni building at the Singapore General Hospital grounds.</p>

              Well Sir you're right I didn't meant o demean the Singaporeans but my contempt and disgust are directed towards the absolutely corrupt Harry Lee and his leegime. I bet this certain Harry believes every man on 'his' island owes him their livelihood. This is a sickening attitude. I look forward when Singaporeans could look past beyond Harry Lee &amp; his familee leegime and still doing well or even better.

              Well legalized corruption is a corruption far worse than the usual corruption. 
              <br><br>
              This failure to engage the society into politics could be the Achilles' heels of Singapore in the immediate future. Right now the political elites are all groomed by the dear leader and are expected to conform to his demands and wishes failing which a resignation would surely follow. The sole ruling political party has failed to engage the public to enter the arena of politics by such methods and hence depriving Singapore of the much needed critical think tank and relying instead on the dear leader capability to steer Singapore for as long as he could(may he live forever). One man cannot be right forever and when the whole state nation is relying on one man they are also guaranteeing their immediate future failure. Of course this doesn't mean that the dear leader is not without fault until now. All kinds of failures, perceived or real are certainly to be washed up and hushed up by the tightly controlled media on the state island.
              
              <br><br>
              Singaporeans must feel that they belong to the state island by having a passion to enter the arena of politics intact with their genuine idealism and good intentions. The presence of Harry lee who wishes to control the island forever and ever until the sky collapses on him(and it will) certainly has cost the island much. Men couldn't achieve great things and becoming great themselves when he is bounded by fear to politically conform to Harry Lee and his leegime all the time because fear makes the smallest cell of all.

              <p>Unfortunate, it is happening everywhere in the world that ppl in power abusing it for their own gain. It is really up to their conscience to live up to their reputation. In PRC, the communist try to fight corruption by public education but the general citizen dont believe it because they face it in every day life and they have to give bribes even to get their water or electricity. Bribery becomes a part of their life and in the culture. It cannot be resolved by education because of the pressure in the society and it get no where without giving bribe.</p>
              <p>Singapore is not without corruption but a heavy price is paid if one get caught. Even when dealing with Singaporean working overseas, they live a very honest life despite in a place that are polluted with corruption. </p>
