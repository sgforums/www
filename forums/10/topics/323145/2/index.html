              Tale of Two Cities:<span> </span> Factor Accumulation and
              Technical Change in Hong Kong and Singapore.” - MIT economist Alwyn

              <p>1) "both capital and (human capital adjusted) labour input have
              grown considerably faster in Singapore. While technical change has
              contributed substantially to economic growth in Hong Kong, its
              contribution to growth in Singapore is next to nil"</p>
              <p>2) "Singapore's growth was largely the result of brute-force
              capital accumlation and that total factor productivity has actually
              fallen sharply"</p>
              <p>3) "even with impalusibly high depreciation rates, Singapore's
              TFP growth still looked poor"</p>
              <p>4) "other economist also suggested that Singapore's government
              had driven savings and investments to unnecessarily high
              levels."</p>
              <p>5) "Singapore became richer by thrusting its hands ever deeper
              into its citizen's pockets - through taxes, forced savings and
              subsidies to multinationals - and throwing money at the
              problem"</p>

              <p>You know, I think I kinda agree to that.</p>
              <p>And to TS, yes, I do agree the Mr Lee <span style="color: #ff0000;">was</span> a very good leader. In fact, one might even say that he's the best. But what's past is past now. He may be a good leader a few decades ago. But is he still?</p>
              <p>As a precautionary measure, I'd say yes. He still is.</p>
              <p>On another note, please refrain from using phrases like: third world country. In case you haven't noticed, developed countries with civilised citizens call the undeveloped countries <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">developing countries</span></span>.</p>

              <p>The title of this thread is so arrogrant it's almost amusing, ie. it sounds pretty much like a six year old going around a school yard saying his dad is the richest or what have you not.</p>
              <p>But then again given TS blames our first generation Singaporeans for simply being alive that's why we're only 25th on the Human development index, I am not too surprised... </p>

              <p>What I am worried is that.....if democracy is implemented fully.....we dont know what kind of animal will come out from it.</p>
              <p>PAP and LKY are indeed autocratic, but Singapore is lucky, they have been benevolent autocrats who had delivered results and led wisely.</p>
              <p>I understand autocracy has its excesses, and moreover, there is no guarentee that the next leaders will be good. There is a systemic danger in autocracy itself.</p>
              <p>However.....PAP has been able to maintain a sterile condition and in a sense keep a lid on undercurrents in Singapore society. I am not sure what will happen if this lid is taken off and democracy is implemented.</p>
              <p>That can be quite worrying.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a young nation, very young, just about 2 generations.</p>
              <p>It is actually quite precarious....</p>
              <p>Look at the societies around us, in nearby countries. I will say afew examples and you can see why I am worried.</p>
              <p>Full democracy means letting off the full forces of society's undercurrents.</p>
              <p>In Malaysia, they have a race-based politics, and they have not been able to come out from it. It is quite nasty and unhealthy, impacting economics, education, and other fields.</p>
              <p>In Indonesia, after they implemented democracy, there is a surge of sectarian-religious based politics, for instance political Islam. Islamic parties seeking to implement Sharia and other agendas.</p>
              <p>Im not saying Malaysia and Indonesia have full functioning democracies, their system also have flaws, but I am giving you examples of how these undercurrents in society surface itself and reflect itself, and I am not sure what kind of undercurrents will surface in Singapore once PAP monopoly and ideological stranglehold is taken off.</p>
              <p>Do you see what I mean?</p>
              <p>PAP monopoly and ideological stranglehold is the basis for Singapore's long stability and tranquility, enabling Singapore to concentrate on development in all fields, while not needing to tinker or bother with political-ideological struggles.</p>
              <p>That is why PAP monopoly and sanitized political environment is not entirely to Singapore's detriment, it is in fact proven to be Singapore's benefit.</p>
              <p>Let's say after LKY is gone and younger generation want to implement more reforms, more democracy....I am telling you honestly I am not sure it is better for Singapore.</p>
              <p>There has been great progress in societal integration....HDB mixed-race quota.....NS enrollment....etc.....but are you so sure Singapore people are so united..? And its  intstitution and society so strong? Remember Singapore is 2 generations old.</p>
              <p>I am just afraid undercurrents will be released and then Singapore will waste its energy and its intellectual capital debating itself and fighting itself.</p>
              <p>We dont know what kind of animal will come out.</p>

              <p>Uncle Meat Pao,</p>
              <p>You don't seem to have very much faith in the younger generations.</p>
              <p>Just a slight reminder. Singapore is also our home, our country.</p>
              <p><strong>We also do not want to see it go to ruin.</strong></p>
              <p>Our forefathers worked hard to build up this little island, now we want to make it even betta.</p>
              <p>We can understand why our fathers/grandfathers went along with the tripartite arrangements.They have seen with their own eyes what happens when riot or mass protests occurs, people die, lives in disarray.</p>
              <p>But does that arrangement also include a "fine print" that says the future generations of Singaporeans to give up their rights to speak out against the ruling party ? That we should all keep quiet when we see the dirty hands that was dealt to commoners , or else be prepared to face the wrath of our own security and judiciary system?</p>
              <p>If there is no sparks..there be no fire.</p>
              <p>Just because we do not agree with some of the policies, does not means we no longer love our country.</p>
              <p>It is because we care..that's why we feel so strongly about it.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wtih Singaporeans supposedly being the best educated amongst all the neighboring countries, with legislations passed to maintain Law and Order, and with 50 odd years of constant moulding of inter-ethnic tolerance and respect - can Singaporeans turned into a mob overnight - or spiral into chaos - when Full Democracy is adopted ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It clearly shows a lack of confidence in our own institutions, and one should why are we still doubting our own standards of political attitudes and behavior to govern ourselves, our political conduct towards each other, our political ability to think for ourselves ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have we not been an independent nation since the ignominous year in 1965 ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">After 50 odd years of rule by the PAP, why will LKY "insist on returning from the grave" if anything should go wrong ? </span></span></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has LKY no confidence in his past and present works that he will leave behind ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this not a wake-up call for Singaporeans to question what we have achieved for our future after 50 odds years of monopolistic rule by only one Political Party ?</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely it speaks volume of the political instability of the Singapore Political Institutions that LKY has created and will be leaving behind when he runs out of time ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do the Swiss, or the Israelis, or the Hongkongers worry of their respective political future - in the same manner as LKY and those in the Ruling Political Party ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In these countries, political institutions are strengthened with each successive gorvernment, that perpetuate the security and development of the nation and its peoples. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately for Singapore - ruled by the sole Political Party that Singaporeans have known since the 1950s - we see the wilful weakining of all the institutions needed for the proper administration of Law and Order - as it allowed the Law Makers to be above the Law, with the Administators of the Law to be subjugate to the Law Makers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The pillars of every public institutions are no longer independent to stand on its own strength, and all are designed to lean on the central structure, which when weakened will result in the public institutions similarly weakened.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The entire system has been purposefully designed to be controlled from the Center, and when the Center should weaken or collapse, it allow the deposed Center to continue manipulating the strings that it will continue to hold in control of the various institutions that support the Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If doubts permeate in the minds of cynics - who believe that Singaporeans cannot conduct ourselves in real independence - it clearly shows that 50 years of politial independence is a sham, as Singaporeans have been forced to be dependent on only one poltical party - for our collective political, security, and economic security.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Singapore's independence similar to that of the Swiss, or Israelis, or Hongkongers -  as independent Citizens enjoying their democratic political rights ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Or is our present independence a sham - as Singaporeans were again re-colonised and subjugated by the politics of an Autocratic Party that is worst then the British Colonialist, and the imperialism of Malay politicians ?</span></p>

              <p>Hmm.. Not really..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st scenerio - All of us give up our own private transport and go public transport .. Thou by then public transport maybe more effective .. Fares increase .. LPPL .. Money still go to goverment. Don't tell mi diesel increase bus fare won't increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd scenerio - All decide to buy our own private transport .. Diesel and petrol prices continue to raise ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So either way we are on the losing end.</p>
