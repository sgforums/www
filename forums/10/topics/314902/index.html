              <p>IT is something that can be transmitted over countries within extremely short periods of time. We are living in the Information Age, mind you. If they don't set up shop here, they can easily set up a small admin base here and the programming department elsewhere, then communicate purely by email or ftp, etc. Even teleconferencing is very cheap now with the extremely wide usage of broadband.</p>

              indeed, eagle's profile is very clear.
              he is white.
                                                                                      
              but at times, he tries to appear black. like black sunday. he failed to penetrate into the minds of the learned and wise and worldly. frogs in well are not spared, however.
                                                                                      
              he has not been to india indeed.
              he thinks india is now still the old india. or is he countering for the sake of doing his rewarding job?
                                                                                      
              in short, USA has protection for its citizen salaries.
              i see that europe also the same.
              For example, its common knowledge that an European IT staff working in Europe is paid so much that it covers their tax, living expenses and still have ample to enjoy.
                                                                                      
              
              if indeed the pore is not doing the same, and let the lowest and best deal win the job, i think while the cost of living will certainly go up from current very high level, the wages will depend on the influx of foreign IT staff. For example, from india, indonesia and filipines. As we know, due to their much poorer economy, their currency is not as strong.
              The good ones went to USA and Australia etc. The in between ones or lower calibre goes to certain asian cities. lowering the salary in the market and also due to the large numbers of influx.
              
              so they naturally will come here given the ease of entry.
                                                                                      
              based on my numerous years of observation and experience, its common to see 90:10 ratio of foreign:local IT departments.
                                                                                      
              while some race used to complain that companies here are biased to hiring mostly chinese, now, should the same kind of concern apply for current 9:1 ratio problem?
              
              According to eagle , he uses the excuse that if you doon allow them, the companies go abroad and all die. I disagree. Europe. take a look at Europe. Their IT staff are majority Europeans. All paid highly. Why ? according to eagle's biased logic of whitism, all european countries should have sacked all their expensive european IT staff and replaced by cheap FTs like poreans or indians. euro is king. so eagle, what is your mudder of all reasons and excuse to counter my statement?
              
              The european union is strong and protects its members. Look at european standard, so high. Their high pay gives high standard. 
              
              Why european companies dont close shop and migrate to the pore? u watching too much knn or did you diy too much?

              <p>Also, kindly point out which large IT company in EU or America does not have companies and businesses in other countries. They are still using foreign talent, not in their own country, but in other countries.</p>
              <p>My question again, if you still do not understand, is if we offer the same protection as what you said EU and America do, do you think IT companies already employing a lot of foreign staff will not shift to other countries like what these EU or American companies do? And in so doing, would the number of jobs in Singapore be reduced?</p>
              <p>Do you think seriously think such companies (if there are as many as you said) will not move their operations elsewhere, while retaining a base here?</p>

              <p>You are misunderstanding me I guess. I'm not saying I support it or whatsoever; I'm merely listing down the facts. Singapore's economy is just too dependent on MNCs and foreigners that any protection measures just for Singaporean citizens alone will likely have a very great effect on the economy. Anyway, if I have a choice, and I will certainly work towards this choice, I will most likely not be working for any employers after that 5-10 years. Why stay so bothered in a place with so many FWs, and as you said, complain against them and shouting DOWN WITH PAP? Plain stupid to stay in this kind of environment perpetually isn't it? I won't want to be like most Singaporeans here who only complain and do nothing to improve their own situation.</p>

              <p>hi forummers,</p>
              <p>yesterdays' news reported x number of jobs created.</p>
              <p>Again , I do not see figures about jobs created for poreans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there can be a difference between creating jobs and creating jobs for poreans.</p>
              <p>by creating jobs itself, it can technically mean:</p>
              <p>1. jobs for anyone.</p>
              <p>2. jobs for wp holders.</p>
              <p>3. jobs for sp holders.</p>
              <p>4. jobs for ep holders.</p>
              <p>5. jobs for PRs.</p>
              <p>6. jobs for citizens.</p>
              <p>so many categories all lumped into 1?</p>
              <p>is anyone able to clarify on this?</p>
              <p>well, from what i have been seeing, if its jobs created includes jobs of the 9:1, then, 9:1 IT jobs went to non citizens is it for this case?</p>
              <p>IT is no rocket science. its just a 1 week course away for those interested. they can learn it in 1 week as beginner.</p>
              <p>the problem is locals even having degrees, may not work in IT due to:</p>
              <p>1. job ads never hire fresh people. there is oversupply from abroad. always min 2 years experience.</p>
              <p>2. its common to find IT managers who are FTs. Their whole department majorly are FTs. They hire their own kinds too. Its common practice.</p>
              <p>I dare to say eagle is living in false believe insisting that IT depts in pore are not majorly foreigners and this includes PRs. I let the facts speak for themselves. This kid is so active here I wonder how can a student know anything about real working life? I wonder does he wear white undersweres.</p>

                                          an oversupply? lowering the cost ? why europe do not lower their

              <p>Tell
                                  me why don't they expand within their own countries? Any reason? There
                                  are still quite a number of jobless people in the EU you know? They can
                                  always not expand overseas, but within the EU and employ more people.
                                  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But why not?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And don't need to work in IT. Already in engineering, you will see a lot of FWs. It is plain stupid to work in IT if I'm not trained in it. In addition, supposed you work in IT, and you are so unhappy with it, it would make perfect sense to switch.</p>
              <p>Let me just post you another question. Other than complaining, what have you done or what are you planning to do when you are so unhappy with the fact that there are many many FWs in your workplace? Just wait and hope something happens? Or just wait every 5 years for a election to cast your vote to an opposition who hasn't spoken strongly against foreign workers?</p>
              <p>I know you are unhappy. Many people are unhappy. But are you really willing to just stop at being unhappy and wait for something to happen?</p>

              <p><br>thus the question,</p>
              <p>does poreans understand how many locals get the jobs created when it is reported? it is almost always reported in such a way that only the total number of jobs created in the pore is reported without the information as to how many locals benefited from it.</p>
              <p>I would be keen to see an official report on how many IT jobs created go to locals for the last 5 years.</p>
              <p>you may be shocked.</p>
              <p>due to the influx and oversupply and agents making use of the policy, there is no hiring of inexperienced IT staff who are locals.</p>
              <p>IT is one of the easiest to break into basically , low barrier to entry - simple 1 week course qualifies a IT savvy person with interest in it to learn some programming.</p>
              <p>The influx leads to no need to hire fresh ones.</p>
              <p>when this is the case, locals who want to do IT will not have a easy time. This vicious cycle results in more and more influx.</p>
              <p>90:10.</p>
              <p>why was it said by some that at one time, the  worse results ones are posted to study IT? 'dumping' ground?</p>
              <p>locals may become extinct in time for IT industry if this trend continues.</p>
              <p>IT can generate many jobs. But with many using the policy to their advantage, has led to many jobs cr4eated but occupied by foreigners. who are the ones really benefitting at locals expense.</p>

              <p>Now that's a very childish reply.</p>
              <p>Didn't you see my reply, stating that you replied your own question?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>when I have replied you the same question in another thread at 2.55pm. Is there any reason for this?</p>
              <p>You were asking how EU IT companies survive with high salaries there, and you answered it yourself that they expand overseas.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>you did not reply to why european companies do not move
                                          out  of europe when their IT salary is so high. they
                                          Expand overseas. but they do not migrate.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>My reply back to you is a question of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why did they expand overseas, and not within their own countries? </span></strong>Are you speechless for it? Or are you just incapable of higher order replies? If their countries require them to employ more citizens, then the solution is simple; they simply move more operations elsewhere.</p>
              <p>And I presume I don't need to nitpick at each and every sentence that you wrongly state what I think and has said.</p>
