            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SURGICAL CLIPS IN THE SPOTLIGHT: Each surgeon has own preference, but...<br>Skill and safety count, say doctors  </strong><br>Clips that slipped and cost kidney donor Narinder Kaur her life are just one of the procedures that surgeons use to tie blood vessels<br>By Ng Wan Ching<br><br>March 06, 2007<br><br>METAL clips, staples, Hem-o-lok clips, special ties. These are all part of an arsenal of devices used by surgeons to close blood vessels during surgery.<br><br>Some of the devices surgeons use to close up blood vessels during surgery. -- CHOO CHWEE HUA<br>As surgical methods have advanced, so has the need for such devices.<br><br>Minimally invasive procedures such as laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery, is becoming more common.<br><br>The death of a kidney donor came after such surgery in 2005.<br><br>Compared with open surgery, these procedures are more delicate and call for more surgical skill.<br><br>MANIPULATION THROUGH INCISIONS<br><br>Instead of operating directly on an organ, surgeons have to manipulate instruments through small incisions to get to the organ.<br><br>One of the challenges with using laparoscopy is for surgeons to safely tie up or ligate blood vessels.<br><br>This would not be an issue with open surgery as surgeons would have space to tie up the blood vessels with sutures.<br><br>The Hem-o-lok clips, which are made of plastic, came in for particular scrutiny recently, when it was revealed that they had slipped after being used to close the left renal artery and vein of Madam Narindar Kaur.<br><br>She had undergone hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery at National University Hospital to remove her left kidney which she donated to her husband, Mr Surender Singh. (See report at top of facing page.)<br><br>The slippage resulted in sudden, internal bleeding in her abdomen. The 33-year-old woman died a few hours after the operation.<br><br>State Coroner Tan Boon Heng recorded a verdict of misadventure last Monday.<br><br>Surgeons The New Paper spoke to, say that slippage, through very rare, can happen.<br><br>And what each surgeon uses to tie up blood vessels is up to his own experience and personal preference.<br><br>If a surgeon feels that a certain device cannot do the job, he will choose another.<br><br>Take Associate Professor Eu Kong Weng, senior consultant and head of Singapore General Hospital's colorectal surgery department.<br><br>He uses laparoscopic methods for more than 80 per cent of his elective procedures. 'Sometimes we use clips, sometimes staples,' he said.<br><br>'Sometimes a clip can slip and bleeding occurs. If this occurs during the surgery itself, another clip can be easily re-applied.<br><br>BLEEDING<br><br>'Delayed slippage of clips is rare, though not unheard of. This can, of course, result in bleeding. Close post-operative monitoring and care is crucial to catch such an occurrence.'<br><br>Patients can then be brought back to the operating room to have the vessels ligated (tied up) again.<br><br>He prefers to use staples as he can apply three rows of staples in one shot.<br><br>'With the Hem-o-lok, which is made of plastic, you can clip only once. Then you have to remove the applicator, reload it with another clip, put it back into the patient's body and clip again. It's not so convenient,' he said.<br><br>SPEED<br><br>Another reason he chooses staples is speed.<br><br>'Staples are fast. Every minute counts in surgery. For example, you can use a special suture tie to close up the vessel, but that would take a few minutes, compared to seconds for the staple,' he said.<br><br>Dr T Ravintharan, a general surgeon in private practice, said he would usually put in two or three clips to close off one blood vessel.<br><br>'It depends on how comfortable I feel. Safety comes first,' he said.<br><br>About 95 per cent of his work involves laparoscopic surgery and he has been doing it since 1990. Currently he is the chairman of the Minimal Access Surgery Centre at Mount Elizabeth Hospital.<br><br>He usually uses large Hem-o-lok clips for larger blood vessels.<br><br>Metal clips and smaller Hem-o-lok clips are better for smaller vessels, he said.<br><br>'Clips generally can be applied in confined places,' he said.<br><br>Sometimes, he also adds sutures for safety.<br><br>COST<br><br>'But sutures require far more skill in application,' he said.<br><br>Cost may be a consideration too.<br><br>Sutures cost about $100. Staplers cost more than $360.<br><br>'If several staples are needed, it will sometimes drive up the cost. Staplers are better if there are lots of tissues and several vessels within to be tied off. But staplers require more space and therefore cannot be used in tight spaces,' he said.<br><br>Hem-o-lok is cheaper. It costs $42 per instrument and comes with six plastic clips.<br><br>WARNING<br><br>During the hearing last Monday, It was revealed that the manufacturer for Hem-o-lok clips, US firm Teleflex Medical, issued a warning last year about their use on living kidney donors.<br><br>Since then, National University Hospital - where Madam Kaur and Mr Singh had their operations - has reinforced the clips with the use of sutures or metal clips.<br><br></div>
