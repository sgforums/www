The government is planning to increase the salary of contract doctors to Rs.19,000 and specialised doctors to Rs.20,000, he added." (Exerpt from http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1913342,000600030009.htm)<br><br>Rs.20,000 for specialised doctors is only S$695.670 a month....<br><br>That figure is probably right. Here's an entry in the national newspaper from a reader's letter:<br><br>"Looks like Shashi Tharoor has not done his homework. He knows the salary of a doctor in the U.S. but is he aware of the salary in India? In an expensive city like Bangalore , the average monthly salary of a specialist is Rs 15,000-25,000. Even prestigious hospitals do not offer more than Rs. 50,000 a month, even after six years of experience in the U.S. (which by the way is a draw-back). First, let there be better living conditions, and remuneration for doctors. Then people can ask why doctors still go abroad?<br><br>Ish Kaur,Bangalore " (http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/12/17/stories/2006121700210600.htm)<br><br>A specialist in Bangalore earns only S$700 and a private hospital specialist with experience working in the US comes at just over double the amount; much less than what we pay our junior doctors.<br><br>Indian doctors are paid less than S$800 in Bangalore. I have never said that we pay them the same amount in Singapore. However, with the low salaries Indian doctors command in their country, we can employ many of them at lower prices than what we pay our own doctors. That will increase the number of doctors in public service at low cost.<br></div>
