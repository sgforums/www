So there were commonality of values at least the sharing of blood line. It is important to note that while christians cannot accept the religious practices of others and vice versa nevertheless they do have certain basic human needs and aspirations such as the need to educate their children to have better hygiene and housing etc and learn to live along side. They could buy time and let God eventually take care of the religious followings in the outside world.<br><br>For the jihad extremist they might have at one time or other staunchly subscribed to the need to spread their religions by revolutionary means, they should have learned by now that in this modern world that it will be much more difficult or impractical for them to do so without learning to live with one another.<br><br>To resolve religious conflicts of this kind which had been well neigh impossible and beyond efforts of politicians as witnessed for centuries, there is obviously a need to change mindset and change past practices and re-learn how to win over others of different beliefs in different ways such as through practising common values, tolerance and mutual respect without resorting to violence in this world.<br><br>This people-to-people cooperative caring and sharing is a enduring method to bring about lasting peace in the long run.</strong></div>
