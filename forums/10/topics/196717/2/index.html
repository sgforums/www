Platoon and Company Live Firing Assaults were conducted in the grounds of SAFTI, with overhead live motar and GPMG support fire being placed at designated sites - to provide realism and condition the NSF enlistees to an actual war scenario - as they charge up the cursed hills of SAFTI.<br><br>Those were realistic training with zero deaths, and were a result of careful and meticulous planning from dedicated commanders - who took their job seriously, and not in some <strong>RAMBO Gung-ho</strong> fashion.<br><br><strong>Accidents resulting in deaths are largely due to inattentiveness of those at the helm, much like automobile accidents the result of inattentiveness of those in control of the steering, accelerator and brakes.</strong><br><br>Are the present young commanders less mature than the generations before them ?<br><br>Why is there a sudden surge of training accidents and deaths - if the <strong>frequency and tempo</strong> remained the same all through the years ?<br><br>Can the training frequency and tempo be the same with smaller intakes of NSF enlistees due to a shrinking population ?<br><br>Such accidents are most likely the result of training being executed <strong>without too much imagination and serious concern for accidents to happen</strong>; and more likely with the attitude of those in command probably believing themselves to be some kind of experienced War Veteran with the charisma of Rambo from Movieland.</span><br><br></div>

Or when a 3-tonner slipped and toppled over the side of a hill.<br><br>Death did occur when a nervous trainee dropped a hand grenade inside his own foxhole, or sprung the spring and held on to the grenade, and in the process killed himself and his accompanying commander through critical injury.<br><br>Such deaths have become less an occurrence, with lessons learnt and new safety precautions taken.<br><br>However, such deaths did not occur at such high frequency of several deaths within a year - as is happening now, and with a higher rate seemingly occurring with the Commandos.<br><br>Rambo - the swaggering gung-ho figure - was not yet a movie in the 1960s, to give any commanders that idiotic idea of being a heroic war veteran.<br></span><br><br></div>
