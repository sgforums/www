This should be something that is absolutely preventable with the current stringent standards of training methodology and medical examinations that Ministry of Defence currently upheld.<br><br>We have undoubtedly reached the red alert status and should be accorded the highest level of attention from the Singapore Government.  How many more Singaporeans must die before they set up an independent inquiry team outside of SAF to look into the underlying causes of training fatalities? We are talking about human lives here! What we need last is media blackout by SAF at the end of each investigation.<br><br>Ministry of Defence is accountable for the well being of every person under its charge.<br><br>Comments please.<br><br></div></blockquote>all the more we should stage a coup and aid the terrorists to bomb singapore,targeting key members of the Government.<br>If all this fails...a mutiny of the army will at least wake MINDEF up<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for the issue of blaming the govt for SAF fatalities, i think it's unfair to lump the sole blame and lay it on their doorstep.<br><br>As with the dunking incident, the procedures and SAF doctrines were there.

So really, it is the individuals on the ground who shoudl deservedly be punished for such gung-ho acts that contravene the safety directives.<br><br>As with Lt Lin who drowned, it was the trainers who failed to be observant, an almost carbon copy of the drowning incident involving the specialist going for SOF selection. Despite the numerous pairs of eyes deployed on the training site, not one noticed that the trainee had gone under and it was in fact the conducting officer, after perfoming a headcount, who realised one person was missing.<br><br>Were the necessary precautions taken during the training? Definitely. What was the real cause?<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>HUMAN FACTOR.</strong></span><br><br>The fact is, anyone can flood the training doctrine with a myriad of directives to follow.
