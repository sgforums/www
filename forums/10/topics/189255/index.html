These are just electioneering slogans, slogans to distract the attention of the people. But I'm confident, we're confident that Jalan Besar voters can see through this smoke, and get to the hard facts and truth of (all this) to see who can deliver and who cannot."<br><br>His running mate Environment and Water Resources Minister Dr Yaacob Ibrahim also explained the rationale for the water conservation tax which will stay on for now - despite calls by the opposition to abolish this.<br><br>He said, "At the end of the day, we want to diversify our water resources. And therefore we have our four national taps. Desalination will remain high in comparison to imported water. But if we remove the WCT (water conservation tax), people will use more water and we will have to incur higher costs to build more desalination plans. So it will remain because we want Singaporeans to understand that water is precious."</blockquote>I smell the beginnings of new policies aimed at controlling the fallout from the online community.<br><br>If the Not-WP think they can control the Internet, they must be nuts.</div>

I sense PAP realise that the upgrading carrots can only do so much and that engaging the young is going to feature higher on their agenda. The turnout at opposition rallies will give them sufficient pause to think things through. The mighty GRC (Aljunied) contest is too hot for PAP and I think they will start thinking more than being Singapore Inc and more than just being swiss watch precise and "cold". Mind you, basic needs upgrading remains relevant but the people wants more and the outpour has been heard.<br><br>Just this morning, I heard on the radio that SM Goh saying the impact felt throughout PAP after loosing Hougang and Potong Pasir in the last election and they changed to being to serve the people with humility.

I sense PAP realise that the upgrading carrots can only do so much and that engaging the young is going to feature higher on their agenda. The turnout at opposition rallies will give them sufficient pause to think things through. The mighty GRC (Aljunied) contest is too hot for PAP and I think they will start thinking more than being Singapore Inc and more than just being swiss watch precise and "cold". Mind you, basic needs upgrading remains relevant but the people wants more and the outpour has been heard.<br><br>Just this morning, I heard on the radio that SM Goh saying the impact felt throughout PAP after loosing Hougang and Potong Pasir in the last election and they changed to being to serve the people with humility.

I am glad.<br></div></blockquote>I hope for our sakes that you are right on that point. Because the not-WP have tried in the past to meddle with the web (remember Sintercom?).<br><br>As for humility, the only person who thought of it this election, but backtracked when pressured by the powers that be, was GCT. There was nothing humble in the way they ran their campaign this time around. Except for the fact that they were forced to eat humble pie two days before the election.</div>
