              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malaysian ruling party punishes member over race row</span></span></strong><br><em>Posted: 11 September 2008 0051 hrs</em></p>
              <p> <br> </p>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: <strong>A member of Malaysia's ruling party was on Wednesday suspended for three years for "stoking racial tensions" with incendiary comments about ethnic Chinese that shook the governing coalition.</strong></p>
              <p>Ahmad Ismail, a division chief of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) which leads the Barisan Nasional coalition, had called Chinese "squatters" and warned of repercussions if they tried to seek political power.</p>
              <p>The furore has highlighted rifts between majority Muslim Malays and the ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities, and raised fears of a split in the coalition of race-based parties which has ruled for half a century.</p>
              <p>"The supreme council has found that Ahmad Ismail's statement and actions have caused much anger and protest from the BN component parties," Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said after a meeting of the policy-making body.</p>
              <p><strong>"We have decided that he will be suspended from the party for three years," he told a press conference.</strong></p>
              <p>Abdullah said that racially-charged comments threatened the future of Malaysia, which has seen bloody racial riots in the past and is determined to maintain ethnic harmony.</p>
              <p>"The racial situation in our country looks like it is showing signs of strain and increasing tensions among races," he said.</p>
              <p>"We for so long have been able to control the situation so that nothing untoward happens, but we can't allow a situation like this to continue... which could affect our peace and stability."</p>
              <p>Despite the punishment, Ahmad remained defiant, saying: "I will not retract, I made no mistake, I will not apologise."</p>
              <p>"I will be staying with UMNO, which is my party... Make no mistake, I will make a comeback," said the member from northern Penang state, who is one of 191 division chiefs representing the party's grassroots.</p>
              <p>Koh Tsu Koon, acting president of the Chinese-based Gerakan which bore the brunt of his outburst, was lukewarm in his response and said police must now take action over allegations of threats made by Ahmad.</p>
              <p><strong>"UMNO's decision to suspend Ahmad Ismail is a step in the right direction. We hope this will serve as deterrent against similar irresponsible and insensitive actions," he said.</strong></p>
              <p>The row has erupted as opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim - whose Keadilan party is the first pan-racial party in Malaysian political history - attempts to woo the support of enough coalition lawmakers to topple the government.</p>
              <p>In March elections the opposition dramatically increased the number of seats it holds, and the race row was seen as jeopardising support for the government among its Chinese-based member parties.</p>
              <p>"The patience of the Malays and Muslims has a limit. Do not push us to the wall, as when we turn back we will be forced to push the Chinese in the interests of our own survival," Ahmad said in a press conference on Monday.</p>
              <p>"The Chinese should not try to be like the Jews in America - it is not enough they control the economy, now they want political control," he said.</p>
              <p>Abdullah, who has faced calls to quit since the elections debacle, was presented with a further headache on Wednesday as a top minister said he should consider handing over power to his deputy earlier than mid-2010 as planned.</p>
              <p>"I'm being very frank and open because I have no qualms about saying what I think is correct: 2010 is too long," said Trade Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who is a potential challenger. - AFP/de</p>

              <p>Well, my job that is required of me is obedience and keeping my mouth shut. Sorting out the bullshit from the real shit. I am good at what i do, i do what i need to do to get it done, sometimes with any means necessary. And i am good at covering my own ass. Its a feeding frenzy out there. I compromised my own ethics not just for myself, but for the company. Sometimes when you question thier orders , u put urself in a position where ur loyalty is suspect. And when your loyalty is suspect , you will be sidelined. You cant secure your position if u are sidelined. And if u have no position , u have no posse.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately i was exposed and trapped in this working environnent. I cant be bothered explaining, but my decisions sometimes are greatly influenced by my family members.I can tell u i left the company and join a petroleum company only to realise that the company has influence in the petroleum company and i was conveniently put as T.M for a division where our company had timber , palm oil , land development and petroleum interests.  Luckily i have good mentors. I absorb the good advices and consider those ... less ethical advices in the back of my head. I know they have great influences , and it will be extremely disadvantageous of me if i were to have a fall out with them.</p>
              <p>Many ministers really champion for the people but unfortunately the financial groups 'cai tuan' do not often back politicians that wont champian the financial groups interests first. So often times u are trapped in between helping the people having no funds , or going low , acquiring funds and help the people. One of the problems witht that is u create ur own cronies.</p>
              <p>Its just a matter of time before all these things will get xposed. But many common people will never understand, as always.. in a damned if u do.. damned if u dont situation.</p>
              <p>I have to deal face to face with these people for almost 5 yrs. I have exposed alot of bullshit and sucked in a lot of bs thrown at me like a man.

              <p>Well, my job that is required of me is obedience and keeping my mouth shut. Sorting out the bullshit from the real shit. I am good at what i do, i do what i need to do to get it done, sometimes with any means necessary. And i am good at covering my own ass. Its a feeding frenzy out there. I compromised my own ethics not just for myself, but for the company. Sometimes when you question thier orders , u put urself in a position where ur loyalty is suspect. And when your loyalty is suspect , you will be sidelined. You cant secure your position if u are sidelined. And if u have no position , u have no posse.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately i was exposed and trapped in this working environnent. I cant be bothered explaining, but my decisions sometimes are greatly influenced by my family members.I can tell u i left the company and join a petroleum company only to realise that the company has influence in the petroleum company and i was conveniently put as T.M for a division where our company had timber , palm oil , land development and petroleum interests.  Luckily i have good mentors. I absorb the good advices and consider those ... less ethical advices in the back of my head. I know they have great influences , and it will be extremely disadvantageous of me if i were to have a fall out with them.</p>
              <p>Many ministers really champion for the people but unfortunately the financial groups 'cai tuan' do not often back politicians that wont champian the financial groups interests first. So often times u are trapped in between helping the people having no funds , or going low , acquiring funds and help the people. One of the problems witht that is u create ur own cronies.</p>

              <p><br>wha!! uncle, said you a few words only, u talk so much liao..Cool man, anyway, tell, me, in this world, who is not corrupted, corruption is not merely in terms of money, things like favoritism, nepotism, etc etc are also a form of corruption. So, we may be corrupted or corrupting others in our life without knowing.</p>

              <p>U be cool, take life as it is, but if you take alcholol and drugs to drown yr sorrow, then you are a loser, and i dun like loser Uncle.</p>
              <p>Alcholol should only be use for happy times, not for saddness. And of course drugs is to be consume only when you are sick, not while you are healthy.</p>

              I believe that Ahmad has been used to stoke racial tension and paint Anwar's party as controlled by the Chinese. This will put fear in the general Malay public to stick with UMNO.
              
              The use of fear and creating enemies to garner support has always been used in Malaysian politics, both by UMNO and the other parties. So everyone relax, sit back and watch what happens next.
