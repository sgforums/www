Maybe that's your sole purpose in this forum for apart from goading the thoughts of others, you have not contributed anything 'concrete' yourself.<br><br>There are many 'concrete actions' the unwashed like ourselves can do to make a difference. Either we write to the press and express our views, or join an opposition with the right values and actively participate in politics. These are just 2 options open. Just because people express strong views but 'appear' to do nothing doesn't imply that they are mere 'talkers' and 'analysers'.<br><br>Sadly your concept of migration being a form of action is flawed.

If Singapore was in disaster like war and etc next time will we have unity to stand up aganist the enemy. The chances is very slim and maybe even now also if it happen now.
