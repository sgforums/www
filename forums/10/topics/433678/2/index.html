              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>PAP Youth Minister MG Chan Chun Sing’s infamous outburst at Singapore netizens as belonging to the ‘lunatic fringe’ has been used by PAP supporters to hurl insults at netizens who disagree with them.</p>
              <p>During a ‘dialogue’ session with young Singaporeans conducted by the Young PAP last Saturday, MG Chan reportedly asked the audience to raise their hands if they are ‘proud’ of the discussions on the internet before lashing out at netizens critical of the PAP:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">‎’No point complaining that cyberspace is dominated by the lunatic fringe and we leave it as such.’</span></strong></p>
              <p>Almost immediately, the term ‘lunatic fringe’ was picked up by a zealous PAP supporter Rachel Teoh who called a fellow Singaporean ‘DOG’ on MG Chan’s Facebook.</p>
              <p>We reproduced the discussion below:</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="border-width: 0px;" title="rachelteoh01" src="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rachelteoh01.jpg" alt="" width="386" height="426"></p>
              <p>As we can see from the above, Mr Cheah merely rebuke Ms Teoh and did not make any personal attacks at her. Instead of countering Mr Cheah’s argument, Ms Teoh went into a frenzy and called him names:</p>
              <p>We shall leave readers to decide for themselves who belong to the ‘lunatic fringe’ in this instance. Since MG Chan allowed Ms Teoh’s rude comments to remain on his Facebook wall, does he endorse them as well?</p>
              <p>PAP supporters are well known to resort to character assassination to smear Singaporeans who do not agree with them. Last year, YPAP leader and new citizen from India Sinha Shekhar called PAP critics ‘DOGS’ while another YPAP leader Jack Lin Xinli described Singaporeans as ‘third class citizens.’</p>
              <p>Just a few days ago, a PAP supporter from Indonesia Mendy Liana lambasted TR on the YPAP Facebook:</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="border-width: 0px;" title="mendy02" src="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mendy02.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="58"></p>
              <p>The Temasek Review Emeritus called on Ms Teoh to apologize to Mr Cheah for her unwarrented derogatory remarks and on MG Chan to clarify what he meant exactly by ‘lunatic fringe’.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, netizens should refrain from engaging MG Chan and his horde of PAP gangsters and relegate them to being the real ‘lunatic fringe’ of Singapore’s blogosphere</p>

              <p>i will have no questions to ask if ALL ministers’ pay is going to be halved by 50% and spend it on social welfare. Government’s money come from the people, of course we have the right to ask what the government is doing. I will not ask any questions if i get paid from the government $15k a month but doing nothing.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>Contrary to what was reported by the Sunday Times which sought to portray PAP Youth minister MG (NS) Chan Chun Sing as an ‘caring’ leader who can ‘connect’ with the youth, a participant at the dialogue with Mr Chan held last Saturday described his attitude towards the participants as ‘arrogant’ and ‘condescending’.</p>
              <p>In an open letter to Mr Chan, 23 year old Alex Tan Zhi Xiang who contested in the recent election in Ang Mo Kio GRC asked if Mr Chan understood the meaning of a dialogue:</p>
              <p><strong>“May I ask if you know the meaning of a Dialogue? Is it either that you didn’t bother to check up the agenda of the session or you innocently do not know the meaning of a dialogue? For even your fellow comrades Abner Koh and Teo Ser Luck agree (after speaking to them), this one-way talking down session you conducted is certainly not one.”</strong></p>
              <p>Alex felt he was listening to a lecture instead of be given an opportunity to interact with Mr Chan:</p>
              <p><strong>“Your presumptuous arrogance says you know it all and though your fanciful analogies make good laughing entertainment, they are disconnected and incomparable to whatever point you put across….That was not a Dialogue I attended yesterday, it was a Lecture. We were there to listen, not interact. If you feel like giving a speech or a lecture, please conduct one at the Speakers’ Corner.” </strong></p>
              <p>He added that Mr Chan should not attend a dialogue if he thinks it is a waste of time:</p>
              <p><strong>“You are not a consultant and we are not consulting you. Rather, you hold this dialogue because you are consulting us, the people, not the other way round. A dialogue is an exchange between 2 party of different interests. If you think a dialogue is a waste of time, don’t attend one.”</strong></p>
              <p>During the ‘dialogue’, Mr Chan also insinuated that netizens who criticize the PAP belong to the ‘lunatic fringe’ which sparked a massive outcry in cyberspace with many netizens lambasting him for his insensitive remarks.</p>
              <p>Many are of the view that being in the army for his entire career, Mr Chan may not have what it takes to understand the concerns, worries and aspirations of young Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Some also took issue with the fact that he became a MP without a contest and was only appointed a minister by the PAP regime.</p>
              <p>With his latest ‘public performance’ to engage young Singaporeans becoming an embarassing flop which took even some PAP supporters by surprise, Mr Chan is well on course to become the second most unpopular politician in Singapore after PAP newbie MP Tin Pei Ling who still has an ongoing police investigation hanging over her head, which the ’super-efficient’ Singapore Police Force is still taking their own sweet time ‘investigating’.</p>
              <p>Read rest of Alex’s letter <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/07/03/an-open-letter-to-mg-chan-chun-sing/"><span style="color: #6d7e7e;">here </span></a></p>

              <p>Without arrogance, it is impossible to be hand picked to join PAP.   hahahahah   <a title="Permanent Link to Dialogue participant: MG (NS) Chan was arrogant and condescending" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/07/04/dialogue-participant-mg-chan-was-arrogant-and-condescending/"><span style="color: #778888;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></a></p>
