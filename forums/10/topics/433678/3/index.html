              </div>
              <div>
              <p>Contrary to what was reported by the Sunday Times which sought
                  to portray PAP Youth minister MG (NS) Chan Chun Sing as an ‘caring’
                  leader who can ‘connect’ with the youth, a participant at the
                  dialogue with Mr Chan held last Saturday described his
                  attitude towards the participants as ‘arrogant’ and
                  ‘condescending’.</p>
              <p>In an open letter to Mr Chan, 23 year old Alex Tan Zhi
                  Xiang who contested in the recent election in Ang Mo Kio GRC asked
                  if Mr Chan understood the meaning of a dialogue:</p>
              <p><strong>“May I ask if you know the meaning of a Dialogue? Is it
                  either that you didn’t bother to check up the agenda of the session
                  or you innocently do not know the meaning of a dialogue? For even
                  your fellow comrades Abner Koh and Teo Ser Luck agree (after
                  speaking to them), this one-way talking down session you conducted
                  is certainly not one.”</strong></p>
              <p>Alex felt he was listening to a lecture instead of be given an
                  opportunity to interact with Mr Chan:</p>
              <p><strong>“Your presumptuous arrogance says you know it all and
                  though your fanciful analogies make good laughing entertainment,
                  they are disconnected and incomparable to whatever point you put
                  across….That was not a Dialogue I attended yesterday, it was a
                  Lecture. We were there to listen, not interact. If you feel like
                  giving a speech or a lecture, please conduct one at the Speakers’
                  Corner.”</strong></p>
              <p>He added that Mr Chan should not attend a dialogue if he
                  thinks it is a waste of time:</p>
              <p><strong>“You are not a consultant and we are not consulting you.
                  Rather, you hold this dialogue because you are consulting us, the
                  people, not the other way round. A dialogue is an exchange between
                  2 party of different interests. If you think a dialogue is a waste
                  of time, don’t attend one.”</strong></p>
              <p>During the ‘dialogue’, Mr Chan also insinuated that
                  netizens who criticize the PAP belong to the ‘lunatic fringe’ which
                  sparked a massive outcry in cyberspace with many netizens
                  lambasting him for his insensitive remarks.</p>
              <p>Many are of the view that being in the army for his entire
                  career, Mr Chan may not have what it takes to understand
                  the concerns, worries and aspirations of young Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Some also took issue with the fact that he became a MP without a
                  contest and was only appointed a minister by the PAP regime.</p>
              <p>With his latest ‘public performance’ to engage young
                  Singaporeans becoming an embarassing flop which took even some PAP
                  supporters by surprise, Mr Chan is well on course to become
                  the second most unpopular politician in Singapore after PAP newbie
                  MP Tin Pei Ling who still has an ongoing police investigation
                  hanging over her head, which the ’super-efficient’ Singapore Police
                  Force is still taking their own sweet time ‘investigating’.</p>
              <p>Read rest of Alex’s letter <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/07/03/an-open-letter-to-mg-chan-chun-sing/"><span style="color: #6d7e7e;">here</span></a></p>

              <p>Without arrogance, it is impossible to be hand picked to join
                  PAP.   hahahahah   <a title="Permanent Link to Dialogue participant: MG (NS) Chan was arrogant and condescending" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/07/04/dialogue-participant-mg-chan-was-arrogant-and-condescending/"><span style="color: #778888;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></a></p>

              <p>He has chosen a political path as his career he jolly well learns humility and serve the public well.    Politicians who opt politics as career with a heart to provide sincere service to the public has no room for arrogance.</p>

              <p>what they mean is they want the answers laid before them.......like in an exam....the multiple choice questions and the short answer sections.</p>
              <p>obviously they want easy life solving yer daily problems using MCQ answers than them thinkin n doin it all by themselves.u must be undepaying all of them....i suggest u pay each minister $10mil/year instead of $900,000/year.mebbe they will jump up n werk and fill up essay question equivalent problems!</p>

              <p>and to think some poor souls work in a  factory in spore earn $500mil for company fixing production line and advanced manufacturing  dont even get to take home $2k/month  or much worse  or less than $20k/year take home pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and this general wants mcq questions laid out before him.....i bet all his war games come with multiple choice questions too.if thats so...best he go back into hi9s army base and do mcq in his own room n own time.</p>
