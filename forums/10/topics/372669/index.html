              <p><strong>GIC has been busy going hunting for potential scholars in Malaysia.
              Several Malaysian bloggers recounted their experiences at the GIC
              Scholarship Interview conducted in Malacca and KL.</strong></p>
              <p>http://weiwenconcerto.blogspot.com/2009/08/gic-scholarship-interview-round-1.html</p>
              <p><strong>Wednesday, August 19, 2009<br> GIC Scholarship Interview, Round 1<br> Date: 19th August 2009 (Wednesday)<br> Time: 9am till 4pm plus<br> Venue: Sunway Resort, Bandar Sunway</strong><br> <br> Yes, another scholarship interview. Another chance and another
              opportunity to gain financial support for my education. It feels like
              March repeating itself.<br> <br> GIC was quite similar to SC's interview, except this time, there's no quotas or whatsover. If you're good, you're in.<br> <br> Fun facts about GIC:<br> -Did you know that GIC only invest GLOBALLY?!? And they have branches
              in New York, San Francisco (USA), London (UK), Seoul (korea), Tokyo
              (Japan), Shanghai, Beijing (China) and other places that I've forgotten.<br> <br> -GIC stands for Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pt. Ltd. (Finally! I know what it stands for)<br> <br> -Founding chairman is Lee Kuan Yew<br> <br> -Requires scholars to train during summer breaks<br> <br> -Has only one client, which is singapore government. It's a buy-side company.<br> <br> -It's manages the government's fund, but it's a private company.<br> <br> <strong>7.30am plus</strong><br> Was running late today, so had to 'fei che' to make sure my sis's not
              late. Went to Shyu Fei's place to pick her up, and I've discovered a
              FANTASTIC parking spot that doesn't require the daily RM4!!! Just park
              near Shyu Fei's neighborhood!!! There were a couple of students who did
              that, and I've just bought my pas bulanan!!! Damn.<br> <br> Anyway, saw Eng Wee on the way, then off we go! To Sunway Resort. Tried
              to show off my navigation skill by using the different route to Sunway,
              instead of the usual U-turn way, went pass Monash and Sunway Uni. My
              passengers were awed by the really big campus.<br> <br> "Sunway so big, Taylors so small. And yet, we're paying so much more!" lol.. Quote, wee wee.<br> <br> <strong>9.00am</strong><br> Reached the room quite early. Sunway Resort has really friendly
              services, and all of them smile and lend a hand!!! So, as a satisfied
              consumer, I compliment and praise Sunway for their wonderful
              performance in their job. =)<br> <br> No one was there. Bumped into someone I've met in the US Application
              Workshop, Ken Ji and Kwang Hui. They were in the "Su Ann's group" and
              most of the applicants were from HELP Uni. Only like 5 from Taylors.<br> <br> <strong>9.15am</strong><br> It started with a presentation by the GIC HR department. Ms Ka Yee
              explained the first part on the company's history and how it's formed
              and what it does. Then, Ms Lily explained on the GIC scholarship and
              the conditions. Repayment period is 6 years, for US/UK and less than 6
              years for Germany/Japan. Don't offer the top salary, but very
              competitive paychecks.<br> <br> During Q&amp;A session, I've asked how did GIC manage to weather the economic crisis. Trying to be singka and all... lol<br> <br> "Er, actually, the Q&amp;A is about the scholarship." Opps...<br> "Anyway, just to answer your question, our prospects on our long term
              investment is looking really good." Something like that. Mr. Tan, the
              HR department head answered it.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Then one parent said, "Just now
              the lady say about the scholarships given out, I would like to know
              what's the quota or any limit to the no. of scholars a year?"<br> <br> "Ok, first, my name is Ms Lily, (lol... it sounds similar to lady
              anyway) and no, we don't have specific quota. It depends on the pool of
              talent we have."<br> <br> "Don't you have like a budget?" asked another parent.<br> <br> "Well, it's actually a form of investment. We're investing Sing dollar
              250k to 350k in each scholars, we make sure we evaluate well to ensure
              that our investment has good returns, (also meaning make GIC more
              prosperous by gathering the creme De la creme)"<br> <br> "I wanna know, how flexible is GIC in terms of the repayment period?" an applicant asked.<br> <br> "Wao, haven't even get the scholarship already ask bout this. But, it's
              a fair question, as this scholarship is a form of contract. Legally, we
              couldn't say anything, but we'll be a little disappointed. In fact, we
              have a scholar who's in his 30's and currently in a senior position and
              doing really really well. He really has shown a great example for
              everyone, and I hope future scholars would remain and grow with us in a
              long term."<br> </strong></span><br> "I'm sorry, but what I mean is do we have to immediately work right after graduation?"<br> <br> "Oh yes, of course."<br> <br> <strong>10.15am</strong><br> FOOD!!! They had like tiramisu, sandwich, and loads of really top notch
              tea-break food. Mingled around with the other applicants.<br> <br> <strong>10.30am</strong><br> So, now the tests and interview begin. We were divided into like a few groups. There were 3 tests to be done.<br> <br> 1) Numerical test<br> No calculator was allowed!!! YES!!! It was really like back to basics
              for mathematics, have to do multiplication through the primary way.
              Forgotten how to like times 1.6 with 2000, and so many zeros, need to
              write so many zero's.<br> <br> It wasn't easy. 33 Questions in 30 minutes. And most of the questions
              were like related to what potential investor should know. Related to
              profits, returns and banyak banyak benda la.<br> <br> 2) Verbal test<br> This english verbal test is way easier compared to the Sime Darby's
              one. The text are like easier to understand, and at least it's not all
              about scientific terms. So, based on the passage, we were given
              sentences, and we have to identify whether it's true, false or can't
              tell (cause info in passage not enough)<br> <br> 3) Abstract test<br> This part of the test was quite fun, it's sorta like an IQ test, where
              we match the patterns with the group it belongs. It's not very hard,
              but not easy either. It's manageable la~<br> <br> <strong>12pm</strong><br> LUNCH AT SUN AND SURF CAFE!!!! Absolutely wonderful!!!<br> <br> As a regular (does 2 times count as a regular) of the cafe, they have
              the ultimate RAW OYSTERS! Delicious. Had like sashimi, oysters,
              sushi,marshmallow with chocolate fondue and ice cream on self-made ais
              kacang. Our lunch partner was like, "Wao, you really know how to feast."<br> <br> <img class="inlineimg" title="Stick Out Tongue" src="http://www.sammyboy.com/images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""> Both me and Shyu Fei were like hogs, but Eng Wee had no appetite
              initially, he mostly went for the desert!!! Looks like gender had
              switched between me and man man. I become a man when I eat, really, see
              me at Madam Joyce, my veggies and meat cover my tiny portion of rice.<br> <br> <strong>3pm plus</strong><br> Both Eng Wee and Shyu Fei went in first for the interview before me.
              Then, when it was my turn, she was like, "Wao, you really have waited
              for a really long time. I already saw you sitting down waiting since
              just now. Well, at least you had a good chat with other applicants."<br> <br> "*laughs the tinkling laugh, dunno whether it turned out right* It's ok, managed to have a good chat with Janice (HELP girl)."<br> <br> Enter this really big room, with one round table in the middle.<br> <br> "So, why thumbelina? On your e mail address?"<br> <br> "(Was a little taken aback) Haha.. Cause thumbelina is like a really
              small person in the cartoon, so since I'm a relatively small sized too,
              that's why I've picked thumbelina."<br> <br> "Oh. Why not like the Wendy's pixie from peter pan? (LOL. I've just realised it's tinker bell, not wendy pixie)"<br> <br> "Er. Cause it also rhymes with my name, you know, THUM, thumbelina...?"<br> <br> "Oh ok. You have quite an interesting background. It's quite rare for
              teenagers to like making money at such a young age. So why is it so for
              your case?"<br> <br> "Er..??? I love money generally? (Really didn't know what to say)
              First, it was The Apprentice that instigated the spark in me to work in
              a corporate world. Then, I've joined clubs like Young Enterprise
              Program, which helps me further understanding bout how a company runs.
              bla bla bla..."<br> <br> Then, she asked about sports, what schools I plan to go and why should I be chosen for the scholarship.<br> <br> "So, can I ask what are your plans after graduation?"<br> <br> "Haha.. Er, currently my plan is after graduation, I plan to work for a
              few years. And if I've gained enough experience on managing a company,
              I plan to set up my own company and retire young and rich." Omigosh,
              that was like my form 4 dream. Dunno what else to say.<br> <br> "Haha, that's not a bad dream. In fact, it's quite a good dream." Alright. =D<br> <br> So, after like conversing and Q&amp;A session, oh, I asked whether GIC
              has ever considered venturing into the Islamic banking sector.<br> <br> "Yes, we've considered, but we don't venture, because we do not lend
              money out. We only manage it. And the Islamic sector is a retail
              business, and we're not into that." Ohhh....<br> <br> Then, we shook hands and bid farewell. Well let us know the result in like 2 weeks.<br> <br> All in all, it was another good experience obtained. Hopefully this
              time, the multiple rejections from other scholarships leads up and
              benefits me in getting this one.<br> <br> Sadhu sadhu sadhu... (Yes, I'm a Buddhist, FYI) =)</p>

              <p><strong>GIC Scholarship Interview 2009</strong><br> <br> <strong>March 4, 2009 · <br> </strong><br> Venue: Holiday Inn, Malacca<br> Date: 4th March 2009<br> <br> It has been long since I blogged in detail about my interview
              experience i.e Jardine and Oxford interview. Today, I am very glad to
              share about my adventure in Malacca.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Basic Essentials</strong></span><br> GIC stands for Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pt Ltd.
              Historically, GIC was set up to manage Singapore’s national reserve
              right after its separation from Malaysia in the 60s. GIC started with a
              mere SGD 2 billion in the 60s, and now it is managing in excess of
              SGD100 billion, in only 28 years of existence.<br> To put it short: <span style="color: red;"><strong>GIC has money, and loads of it; this is what makes the GIC Scholarship so prestigious.</strong></span> I am not going to elaborate about GIC further because all these can be obtained through their corporate website at <a href="http://www.gic.com.sg/"> www.gic.com.sg </a> .<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Interview Experience </strong></span><br> <strong><br> 0900 hours </strong>Short Talk about GIC<br> The interview started with a short talk about GIC and its history in fund management. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Surprisingly, the one who made GIC what it is today is a MALAYSIAN. Malaysians rock!</strong></span><br> After the short talk by Mr Chan, the Group’s Recruitment Director I believe, there was a short Q &amp;A session with the floor.<br> <strong><br> Tea Break 1000 hours</strong><br> Then, we stopped for a short tea break at 1015 hours. This was when we
              get to mingle around with the other GIC hopefuls. I was surprised at
              how small the world is.<br> I met Jason, who is from the same church as Jonathan Mah Koon Chung
              besides knowing Aaron Baskaran Nair in Catholic High School, and Kien
              Keong, who is a friend of Jorrel Too. (Jonathan Mah, Aaron Nair, and
              Jorrel Too are my IB coursemates.)<br> Then I met Au Yong who lives in BK5 which is 5 minutes away from my house. It was just amazing and we clicked really quickly.<br> Met Mitchell (a guy by the way) who is doing IB in Penang Uplands
              International and was shortlisted for Sri KDU IB Scholarship. It was
              fun meeting a fellow IBian.<br> I also met a couple of applicants who is completing/has finished their
              A-levels. Hats off to Jean Yip, the only girl I knew in the whole GIC
              episode, because I was really shy and busy talking with the other guys.<br> <strong><br> One-on-One Interview 1015 hours</strong><br> I was called in for interview with Mr Chan. The interview was rather
              informal, but I tried to be as formal as possible. I was asked the
              generic question i.e tell us about yourself.<br> I felt that that was a good chance for me to sell myself. So I talked
              about myself, my family, my activities in school, and my interest in
              finance. To those of you who didn’t know I am very much interested in
              finnce, now you know. I am Chinese. $$$<br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Then,
              the interview headed towards my political views. I spoke at length of
              the local political scene (not sure that was the best thing to say; I
              thought talking about world politics would be better) and how
              frustrated Malaysians like me are with our local politicians.</strong></span><br> Next, he asked me about my economic viewpoint. I didn’t take economics
              and therefore, I thought that I responded to this question rather
              weakly. Anyhow, I spoke about Obama’s stimulus plan and how the
              recession could have been avoided if credit card laws were tightened. I
              also did mentioned that I believe that the recession crisis will
              recover somehow.<br> After that, I was given the chance to ask about GIC. I asked some personal questions, but I can say that <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>GIC also offers language classes to all their employees i.e Japanese, German during their careers.</strong></span><br> Interview: Pass.<br> <strong><br> Writing, Verbal, Numerical, and Abstract Test </strong><br> Okay, so now it comes to the not-so-fun part. All applicants must take
              these tests so that GIC is able to measure the aptitude skills of all
              applicants. For someone who hates test, I think I did rather badly.<br> The writing was rather random and quick. We were given a prompt about
              “It is a mistake to look too far ahead.” I just blurted out whatever I
              had in mind, but I guess it should be okay. You have 5 minutes to
              respond in less than 100 words.<br> Next, I took the Abstract test. It was abstract literally. Generally,
              it is a test to see whether you can spot differences and similarities
              in different patterns. Some of my answers were abstract and I didn’t
              know what I was doing. Anyhow, you have 30 minutes to complete 115
              questions. Tough, you bet.<br> Following was the Verbal Test. It is something like SAT Critical
              Reading, but on a milder note. I think I did okay on this, but I can’t
              finish the last 4 questions. So, I kinda just took 4 wild guesses. You
              have 30 minutes.<br> Then, we stopped for lunch. *Relieved.*<br> <strong><br> Lunch 1215 hours</strong><br> During lunch, the most dominant topic is our conversation was about our
              tests and interview. Apparently, some went for interview first while
              some did the these first. Some also had their interview sandwiched
              between the tests. I am glad that everyone found the tests to be hard.
              =)<br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>One
              of the things that Mr Chan look for in a GIC scholar is that the
              scholar must be HUMAN. Yeah, you read that right, YOU MUST BE A HUMAN.
              Being human generally means you can relate with people and have a
              balanced perspective on life. He is not looking for Olympiad Gold
              Medallists, but for people with a balanced study and play portfolio.</strong></span> I think I can offer my extra-curricular portfolio to them, but I am not
              so sure about my academic prowess. IB 42 points don’t say a single
              thing about intelligence, but only persistence!<br> Back to the lunch,
              I had a 5-star buffet. Although all the food I had was so bad for my
              blood pressure and cholestrol, I decided that the food was
              irresistable. I didn’t behave like a glutton which I did on many
              buffets in the past, so I took lamb chop, sweet and sour chicken,
              pasta, salad, chocolate cake, blueberry cake, melons, and water in a
              balanced proportion.<br> <strong><br> Numerical Test Continued 1315 hours</strong><br> Back to taking test. I am a person who can’t think when I have a full
              stomach. Anyhow, Lord Jesus, grant me wisdom and strength! Right, so
              the test was basically a maths test.<br> There weren’t any calculus, vector, or trigonometric questions. In
              fact, the questions were so easy that you would find them hard! They
              were simple questions in layman terms, but you would need some time to
              dissect what they want. I think I did quite badly in this test. The
              thing was, there were 16 answer options for each question. I was
              required to answer 33 questions in 30 minutes! Go figure how can you
              get that done.<br> <br> <br> I thought I was disadvantaged because I left my maths for three months
              already, and my brain now is not fit to crunch on numbers like it used
              to be. Well, commit it to the Lord and hopefully that His favour will
              be on me. =)<br> <br> So, there you go, GIC Scholarship Interview 2009!

              <p><strong>GIC Scholarship Interview</strong><br> <br> <a href="http://ourcoffeestops.com/category/coffeesnoops/">CoffeeSnoops</a> — By <a href="http://ourcoffeestops.com/author/tjinz/">Christopher</a> on	March 8, 2008 at  12:08 AM    <br> <br> A day after my first round of interview in <span style="color: red;"><strong>Malacca</strong></span>,
              I got a call from a private number. The caller on the other side of the
              phone informed me that I have been shortlisted for the final round of
              the interviews! <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The person on the
              phone asked me whether I was excited to be shortlisted. I replied with
              a “Yes”. Again, the question was repeated as I did not produce a
              convincing “Yes”.</strong></span> Might be because I sound as though I am half asleep on the phone.<br> <br> <br> <img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b350/zeropictures/blogpicture3/GIC5.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em><strong>Bird’s eye view of Singapore</strong></em><br> <br> The final interview was held on a Thursday and Friday at their
              headquarters in Singapore. That means that I had to skip two days of
              college! Imagine the work pileup! Prepared my certificates and
              documents before hand. Time flew and soon it was time for me to fly to
              Singapore! <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>All
              expenses paid by GIC! My gratitude! My mom accompanied me to Singapore.
              We were placed at the Amara Hotel by our hosts. It was comfortable and
              the bathroom was just amazing! </strong></span><br> <br> <br> <img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b350/zeropictures/blogpicture3/GIC1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em><strong>My fellow friends</strong></em><br> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Mr. Chang was kind enough to have
              a workshop for all of us on the first day. He taught us proper
              techniques on how to present our achievements and thoughts.</strong></span> Definitely a good speaker, drawing our attention for the whole 2 hours
              or so. It was an interactive session and I certainly learned a lot. Of
              course, photography is in my blood – didn’t miss the opportunity to
              take some pictures after the workshop. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>We returned to Amara Hotel in the evening for a buffet dinner sponsored by GIC! Great food, great ambiance and great bill!</strong></span> After the scrumptious dinner, we went back to our own rooms at 9.00 PM
              – to prepare ourselves mentally for the onslaught the next day.<br> <br> <br> <img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b350/zeropictures/blogpicture3/GIC2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em><strong>Lunch time</strong></em><br> <br> <br> Rise and shine! D-day is today! Woke up 7 AM in the morning and
              prepared myself. We met at the hotel lobby after breakfast before
              making our way to GIC. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>First
              for the day was a short tour around the Heritage Centre where we
              learned more about the obstacles and challenges faced by GIC in the
              past and present.</strong></span> The first round of interviews
              started right after the tour and ended just in time for lunch. We were
              treated to a Japanese lunch at their office cafeteria.<br> <br> <br> <img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b350/zeropictures/blogpicture3/GIC3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em><strong>Eight of us</strong></em><br> <br> <br> The second interview was much more challenging. Instead of one
              interviewer, there were two. Nothing much to add, just that I did my
              best that day! I was quite satisfied with my performance although I
              missed out on some minor details. The interviews ended at 5.00 PM or
              so. We took a group picture with our hosts before parting our ways,
              returning to Malaysia.<br> <br> <br> <img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b350/zeropictures/blogpicture3/GIC4.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em><strong>Thank you GIC</strong></em><br> <br> <br> The experience acquired from this trip definitely benefited me greatly.
              I would personally like to thank GIC for being such a great host and
              teacher as well. Thank you! I hope that we will cross each other’s
              paths once again in the future! Cheers!</p>

              <p>Would it be a surprise to anybody that all the young Malaysian candidates are ethnic Chinese - most of whom are left out of the loop by the ethnic politics in Malaysia ?</p>
              <p>GIC is throwing a life-line to these young and eager candidates, whom GIC believe will be more grateful then young Singaporeans - who will resent the bonds that are imposed with the scholarships and are more likely to break the bond.</p>
              <p>Somehow, GIC feel that they get better mileage from these young Malaysian Chinese who will fit into the Singapore Life as future Citizens - as Malaysian Chinese are no different from Singaporean Chinese.</p>
              <p>Seriously, amongst all the foreigners to be given the opportunity to be a Citizen of Singapore, I would prefer to have a Malaysian than anyone from Australia, China, Europe, India, New Zealand, Taiwan, UK or USA.</p>
