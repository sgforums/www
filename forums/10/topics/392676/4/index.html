              <p><br>Huh?? Uncle, u took the wrong medicine ar???</p>
              <p>Before anything begin, PAP already got 80% voters, then slowly some move away and it will end up with 70% or below, they already got 1/2 million of voters in NTUC as members, 3/4 million in RC, CC and Youth PAP in their favor, another 3/4 million Civil servants including arm forcesÂ in their favor. Then you come to local business the rich, most towkay and towkay family making rich here will vote for them too, that will be another 1/2 million, so, total 1.5 millions is already in their favor.</p>

              English and a equally poor service standards to match it. It made
              my getting checking in an extremely unhappy experience save the
              fact that a local whom I presumed worked many years there who
              helped me out in the check in process. Kudoes to him!.</p>

              will presume that all Singaporeans have degenerated to that level
