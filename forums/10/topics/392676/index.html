              <h1>Wong Kan Seng urged Singaporeans to be realistic and more tolerant of foreign workers</h1>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>After opening the floodgates and allow Singapore to be swarmed by foreigners without any proper screening or planning, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng is now urging “Singaporeans to be realistic and more tolerant of foreign workers.”</p>
              <p>During his speech on the Budget, Mr Wong said:</p>
              <p><em>“Singaporeans need to be realistic and fair-minded. While we want foreign workers to do the less pleasant jobs and contribute to our economy, we cannot also expect them to stay away, during their off days, from public places and shopping malls where we frequent, or not to take public transport to work.”</em></p>
              <p>The foreign talent and immigration issues have become hot topics of late with many Singaporeans voicing their unhappiness and anger against the ruling party for its misguided policies.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore needs foreign workers to take up jobs shunned by locals, the onus is on the government to beef up the infrastructure to ensure that it is adequate to accommodate the increase in population.</p>
              <p>Due to poor planning and lack of foresight, too many foreigners are allowed into Singapore within too short a period of time, leading to overcrowding at public spaces and transport.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong claimed that foreigners contribute to Singapore’s economic growth “which have raised the quality of life for all Singaporeans.”</p>
              <p>According to a UBS report released last year, Singapore has the lowest domestic purchasing power and wages among the Asian Tigers and have a standard of living comparable to Russia. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/08/25/an-analysis-of-the-ubs-study-singapore-has-the-lowest-wages-and-domestic-spending-purchasing-power-among-the-asian-tigers-part-1/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>It is ranked by the Economist Unit as the 53th best place to live in the world below the likes of Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia and Canada.</p>
              <p><em>“Economic growth has also enabled us to accumulate reserves in good times, which we have been able to rely on to sustain and support Singaporeans during lean and tough times,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s two sovereign wealth funds Temasek Holdings and GIC was reported to have lost billions of dollars of reserves in failed overseas investments, the exact amount loss remains a mystery to this very day.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong ended his speech by reminding Singaporeans that “the integration of foreigners and new immigrants is an ongoing journey and takes a long time.”</p>
              <p><em>“It cannot be rushed. It needs the directive and active involvement of both Singaporeans and new immigrants,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Since this is so, why then did the PAP accept so many foreigners at the same time which makes it even more difficult to integrate them now as they tend to congregate within their own communities?</p>
              <p>Mr Wong should be more realistic and not expect Singaporeans who are one of the most tolerant people in the world to make unnecessary sacrifices anymore to pay for the juvenile mistakes made by the PAP.</p>

              <p>I am living away from Singapore for the past 4 years. I find it
                  very strange that govern or ministers in this country would not
                  admit to their mistake, not making any correction and instead blame
                  the ppl and ask them to live with the mistake.<strong> Even in 
                  communist state PRC , this type of attitude will turn into riot.

              <p><em>“Singaporeans need to be realistic and fair-minded. While we
              want foreign workers to do the less pleasant jobs and contribute to
              our economy, we cannot also expect them to stay away, during their
              off days, from public places and shopping malls where we frequent,
              or not to take public transport to work.”</em></p>

              <p>Actually, no. No one in my circle believe PAP will lose the election.Singaporean overseas are very interested with development at home. Living away from home often make our heart fondle and whenever we gather, we talk endlessly abt things at home. We enjoy the 'Singlish' together. </p>
              <p>I dont think we are pro or against PAP but when the issues of foreign FT are raised and liberal migrant policy that the govern promote, it make everyone angry in the the group.</p>

              <p><br>It is ok if they have the capability to take on exective or CEO job. At least, to me, they must have something to reach time and we will not be jealous abt them being in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The story is diff if we have tech, mech, sales, clerks ..mid level job that are filled by foreigner where surely Singaporean is more productive, educated and most of them, the right working attitude to take these jobs.</p>
