            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is that because the PAP has in power for so long, they believe they have the absolute right to use the country's reserves- which is after all taxpayers money- in any way they like legally or not.<br><br>The country's foreign reserves still belongs to the people and as if you have ruled the country for so long, you must remember that you must earn the right to use them.<br><br>This means you need a fully free election and democracy. Not the current system we are having now. Can you believe how much money Ho Ching, the chairwoman of Temasek Holdings, is throwing at foreign companies (which has been underperforming for years)?<br><br></div>

I am happy even LowTK is selfless and is prepared to make way for potential leaders to come forward to realise the projected reshuffling.

I foresee that when such a plan is forwarded people will come forward to serve.<br><br>Without initiating major changes to all the past policies designed to entrench the past leaders, nothing can be done to help solve the diverse problems faced by the many unemployed and suffering majority.</div>
