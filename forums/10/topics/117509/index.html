Follow precedents set in Marine Parade MUP if it is to your benefit. If not, ask the questions based on basic principles governing community project. Residents should not be made responsible or liable for any extra costs under any circumstances for such a project. Sorry I do not have information how Marine Parade resolved the delays with the contractor or whether residents were made to pay for extra costs.<br><br>Resdients have the right to ask for facts and figures and if short-changed they should discuss with the politicians to have better understanding of the nature of community projects to protect residents' interests.<br><br>Second approach is based on normal project and contract management practices. Contractors have to be made responsible for delays or works not fulfilled under the normal standard contract.<br><br>In this case, claims should be submitted on residents' behalf for delays after the contractual completion date (original date not Dec 05) and pay the amount of liquidated damages for delays and other normal compensations for non-completions and poor workmanship etc.<br><br>Town council and HDB/agents should know that based on Public Sector form of contract (Turnkey) for alterations and additions, contractor is liable and should work towards protecting residents' interests and not hold back information. They should give information when asked for by residents through the MP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

This new facility was not part of the masterplan, that is residents had casted their votes with no knowledge of this facility.<br><br>They are not binded to provide us with such facility.<br><br>That's of course a piece of good news for all residents in the precinct.<br><br>Could that be interpreted as a form of compensation (to residents)?<br><br>Perhaps residents in Marine Parade are provided with some additional facilities (not in the upgrading package) in compensation for the delays.....<br><br>Of course I won't rule out the fact that they are sincere in providing such facility for the benefits of all residents, and there is no linkage between providing such facility and delays compensation.

They were inconvenienced right? If the MPs in the GRC were doing their jobs they have no excuse and should not even blame the problem on vandalism.<br><br>The fact that the MPs are now talking about vandalism show that they do not understand people need help. People can understand vandalism but government do not hesitate to act when people are at fault. When they are slow or not admitting problems there is no one to hold them liable. People must grow up and understand that they must stand for their right to demand MPs take some proactive actions to overcome delays in completing lifts.<br><br>Go and ask for the schedule of completion of lifts and what penalty contractor has to pay and if not the project manager should answer. Then MPs in the area will know that people know their rights and will act accordingly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It will be interesting to tell the press that the damage is caused by delays not vandalism and call in a social psychologist to present such an case.<br><br>I agree that the MP has lost power to represent real interests or problems of the people nowaday and will toe the establishment line because of too much to lose in siding with residents.<br><br>The press is always wary about negative reporting to the government so you need to have a topic of interest. Residents can arrange a meeting to present the happening to the MP to ask for an independent management audit if there is a further delay or problem. If the MP does not listen petition to the PM.
