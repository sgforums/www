            <div class='col-md body'>How would sound like successful society without need and poverty with prospering corporations and business, where one could get rich also by normal work? I thought about ideal society, and realized where it could be done first: In Saudi-Arabia. Basics is oil, (In Saudi-Arabia about 80% of worlds oil reserves), so that system can be made running. Saudi-Arabia was able to offer each of its citizens "citizenÂ’s salary" even at 1990Â´s, that was back then around 330 euro per citizen. Now oil prices have gone five or six times higher from that, so why not pursue for more?<br><br>What if government would pay for corporations and business-makers all products and services bought by citizens (in certain limits of reason perhaps in the beginning, maybe favoring domestic companies)? So every citizen would get basic living standards (basic commodities like food, clothes, medicine, education health care, etc..) completely free of charge, and car and apartment with certain limits from which more expensive part they should pay with money coming from their own work/business/investments/savings (for example apartments 1/citizen, car each 10 years, and if you want to buy more or more expensive going beyond limits agreed, then you need to make your own money for it or sell old ones in exchange).<br><br>This kind of explosive increase in spending (when nobody would need to think in shops what they can afford, just what they want and need) would get companies, employment and economics to prosper, and so on as people would not need to use even their smallest incomes into basic living, they would have change to invest by them selves (into foreign countries/domestically) or to found (even small bazaar) business that they could larger with even more investments and risks, as there would not be risk from total collapse of living standards even in case of bankruptcy (that would be unlikely due to higher domestic spending). There would neither be any "traps" preventing from taking jobs with lower salary, as all one could earn would be only plus (when staying only on social security could achieve only certain level of living without hope for better, but almost all people are so greed that they always want more). This way working would come REAL way to wealth and even for getting rich if salary is invested right. Founding business would be easy as government would pay expenses in the beginning.<br><br>Of course this system could be risked by some efforts to take use of this system, like that (foreign) companies would try to sell too expensively with rip-off prices increasing inflation (to regulate prices government could found own government businesses into all areas of economics, with 50% of shares distributed evenly to all citizens, and took government payment-guarantee from companies trying to exploit system, then ordinary people should favor state-companies getting some money back instead of government losing it, and they too through government/government-companies shares loosing, and favor other their favorite companies so that those selling with too high prices would be forced to lower their prices and not to lose governments payment-guarantee, when customers would have to pay from their favorite commodities/services from their own money, salary), until this system would expand even further to other countries (first to other oil-countries like Iraq and Libya). From these countries wealth and investments would spread by through totally welcomed workers from other countries (with their families), who would be given from (at least for quite regular) working same benefits, when they again could invest their money further (into own countries for example), increasing wealth there too.<br><br>Soon situation could be that state and people would have got so rich even only from their investments in shares and owning in foreign companies/lands, that state would make so much profit they would not have to stop system even when oil runs out, and so positive circle of investments and increased spending would go on. This system would work in political multiparty-system, where people would monitor state actions in putting recommended reasonable prices and policies in running people-owned business (if state would try to make prices too low, income from shares for people would suffer, and their other own/favorite privately owned businesses might end).</div>
