            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Clinton, Obama Clash in Personal Terms<br><br>By JIM KUHNHENN Â– 2 hours ago<br><br>MANCHESTER, N.H. Â— Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton clashed Sunday in the slushy New Hampshire homestretch, deriding each others' claims to be the true candidate of change. Clinton told Democratic voters they should elect "a doer, not a talker." Obama countered that his critics are stuck in the politics of the past.<br><br>At a raucous rally in a high school gymnasium in Nashua, Clinton skewered Obama for several votes he has cast in the Senate, such as his vote in favor of the Patriot Act and for energy legislation she described as "Dick Cheney's energy bill." She never mentioned Obama's name but left no doubt about whom she was discussing.<br><br>"You campaign in poetry, you govern in prose," Clinton said.<br><br>Obama, speaking at a packed Manchester theater, took issue with Clinton's criticism of him during Saturday's Democratic presidential debate.<br><br>"One of my opponents said we can't just, you know, offer the American people false hopes about what we can get done," he said.<br><br>"The real gamble in this election is to do the same things, with the same folks, playing the same games over and over and over again and somehow expect a different result," he said. "That is a gamble we cannot afford, that is a risk we cannot take. Not this time. Not now. It is time to turn the page."</blockquote>I love American politics... they leave no stones unturned.</div>
