There are a lot of pro-Mormon propaganda sites and they all say the same thing - family unity, they are Christian, the Book of Mormon is true and on and on. These other sites still do not say what they really believe. What Mormons actually believe is not normally taught by the Mormon missionaries or shown on the TV commercials. Mormon doctrine is quite fluid.</blockquote><blockquote>1 - God was once a man who lived on another planet<br>This is the most important teaching of Mormonism.<br><br>....We believe that God was once a mortal man on another planet who progressed by living in obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel he had on his world, then he died. He became a resurrected man and evolved to become a god.<br><br>....He is still married now (some early leaders say he is a polygamist) and created this world. We worship only the one true god, which is really one god among millions or billions or more. We believe that we will follow in God's footsteps by becoming perfect and we too will become Gods and Goddesses creating spirit children and peopling other worlds. The Mormon TV commercials showing family togetherness is the foundation for life in the next world - as a family - as gods.<br><br>Reference: Journal of Discourses Vol. 6 Page 4, 1844.

            <div class='col-md body'>Correct me if I'm wrong here. Winning a poll or a caucus is not equivalent to winning the primary. Winning the primary is not equivalent to winning the presidential race.<br><br>Nobody won Nevada yet. Only New Hampshire and Florida have voted, South Carolina is now voting. New Hampshire is undergoing a recount due to rumors of vote rigging. South Carolina uses electronic voting which broke down and caused problems, maybe irreparably compromising the results.<br><br>All states should have completed voting by April 2008. It's expensive to campaign so candidates who don't think they have a chance will drop out of the race to avoid wasting money and the last one standing takes presidency even if the remining of the states haven't voted yet.<br><br>With that out of the way, I see Obama as the mediator. The people love him because he listens to them. However given that he has to mediate between the people and the private interest groups, I'm not sure he will be able to deliver on the changes his entire support is founded on. He also commented that he'd keep on the current advisors to the white house and that doesn't bode well for "change".<br><br>Ron Paul spells disaster in the sense that sometimes things are so bad you have to knock the whole thing down and start building it up again. That's the kind of change he portends.<br><br>I see Hillary as the elite's postergirl. She won't win unless the elite form the majority or can influence the majority's vote. No change here becuase the elites continue running things as usual.<br><br>Mitt Romney is the theist's poster boy. Same thing, he won't win unless the theists form the majority or can influence the majority's vote. Big changes here, there will be a push towards a theist state and all the disruption that portends.<br><br>Huckabee and Rudy are politicians. Both have no compassion for the people but are otherwise very capable.<br><br>Mc Cain seems like a solid man with influence. But his mentality seems too alien to properly connect him to the people in terms of votes.<br><br>I haven't formed an impression of the rest of the candidates yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think clinton will secure the nomination, her support is mainly the party institution while obama draws his from the grassroots....also, with blacks not forming enough numbers across the other states, obama can only look to secure wins in another handful of states....<br><br>new york and the neighbouring states should be easily for clinton and so for obama to convince his party to nominate him, he needs california...with edwards increasingly lagging behind, more whites would vote for clinton....so realistically, clinton and blowjob bill will contest against mccain and lose, simply because hillary isn't that likeable....</div>

Billary is always at the lower income and seniors. establishment support will diminish once they see the majority votes goes to who?<br><br>i would not throw out Obama, it takes 2 wins to confirm candidates. The interesting thing with Nevada is that Obama gets the same number of delgates out from Nevada so i won't say it is a total lost for him.<br><br>In recent negative attack from Bill Clinton.<br><br>There are already complaints about the character of ex president within democrats and women questioning  why is a first woman running for President depended upon her husband.

              <p>It all well and good to debate on Obama's candidacy.</p>
              <p>BUT.... the funny thing about US elections is that the minorities interests always, always  trumps the majorities wishes. And when i say minority i dont mean blacks, hispanics, women and what not. Corporations decide elections. They fund campaigns, they help in outreach ..etc</p>
              <p>Mark my words, republicans back in office.</p>

              <p>My advice is balance the information you are getting from main stream media with information from the internet.</p>
