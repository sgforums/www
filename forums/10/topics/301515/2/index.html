            <div class='col-md body'>think many over-state the red-states factor in terms of Obama's electability. It is true that Obama will find winning any of the southern states tough, especially if he faces a christian conservative like huckabee or for that matter any white republican candidate. However, one can still lose the South and win the elections, remember Gore. Gore lost all the southern states, even his home state of Tennese, yet lost the election because of the Florida debacle (Yes, Florida is in the South, but it doesn't possess the characteristics of a Southern Bible-belt state, save the Florida pan-handle). Florida has a huge Hispanic population and for many of them immigration is a make or break issue in deciding the candidate they would vote for. Many of the GOP candidates have taken a tough stance on the issue of illegal immigration, alienating the Hispanic vote. Hence, if a Obama nomination results in wins in traditional democratic strongholds and strong showings in 'middle states' like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Florida, Mr Obama can still be electable.<br><br>However, will he be a uniter as he portrays himself out to be or a dividing figure when he is President? Although he will be the first black President, and a true examplification of the triumph of the civil rights movement, his policies are left-leaning ('universal healthcare', 'amnesty for illegal aliens') and will be held in disdain by conservatives. Hence even if his personality personates change, his policies are still steeped in the great partisan divide between liberals and conservatives, which would only cast a deep shadow upon his article of change - his race. I love the man, but I think what America needs now is a candidate who does not appeal to his party base, but someone who can compromise and allow people to sense and see the commonality they share irregardless of their partisan differences. Unfortunately, with the current system of having to seek the nomination from one's party faithful, I think it is difficult for such a goal to come into fruitation.</div>
