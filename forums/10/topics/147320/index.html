            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans are suffering from high costs of living, low wages and loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>Since 1980s, despite all the economic restructuring the government has failed to upgrade Singapore's economic competitiveness. Now it is lagging behind the Asian tigers in technologies and the whole economy is haning in the balance. When there is a world economic recovery then Singapore economy will manage to stay above water. While other tiger Asian economies are self-resilient Singapore economy is totally at the mercy of foreign companies which are still in the process of pulling out their operations to China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam etc. This has been the main reason why the economy is facing so many problems. Only the government is too proud not to see this loss of economic competitiveness. Good people and talents are migrating fearing for their future.<br><br>Now with the world economic recovering in 2005, our economy is beginning to recover. However this recovery does not mean all the problems facing the economy have disappeared. Our underlying economic problems are being grossed over or covered up as the domestic sector of the economy is still in bad shape. Just look at all the business indicators : dropping COE prices, property slump and highest business failures and bankruptcies and retrenchments to understand the real problems. The GDP minus the GLCs and foreign companies' contributions are probably in the minuses.<br><br>In view of the past mistakes in neglecting promotion of its own economic resilience and technological development, the only solution is now moral no more talents or leadership as claimes by our leaders.<br><br>If the new leaders really want to save the situation, they should lead by morality and not just on their presumptuous leadership or talents. They should acknowledge past mistakes and presumptuousness and admit there is now a serious losss of economic competitiveness of Singapore and do something big,<br><br>The minsters for example should consider volunteering to lower their high pays to a more realistic level or donate their excesses to an eedowment fund to relieve the prolonged unemployed hopefully without MM Lee interfering. This gesture will definitely depoliticise the issue of ministers' pay and bridge the divide between the government and people. This is a challenging way to re-claim the government's morel authority over the next generation of Singaporeans.<br><br>Will this move help save Singapore?<br><br></div>

These yesmen are mostly paid obscenely high wages besides receiving multiple directors fees, share options and fat company bonuses!  The common people have been totally pushed by the wayside.<br><br>This the real face of PAP today!<br><br>All those pictures you see of ministers holding babies and visiting old folks homes were just pure Hollywood pictures directed by spineless newspaper editors.</div>
