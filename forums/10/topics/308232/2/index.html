              <p>Seems like you have grossly misunderstood the phrase of information is power. Ease of availibility of information merely means ease of obtaining the power. Either that or you have a warped understanding of the term information.</p>
              <p>Certain other information I will need will be doing some market surveys, of which the questions I'm crafting at the moment. Do you think such information is as widely available? I can get survey answers easily from the net (ease of availibilty), yet the analysis of the data that I want to do, how could others know what I want without much deeper analysis on their part? The power would be the analysis I have done by myself.</p>
              <p>Of course, others can repeat too. But if you don't do it, you don't get the information, and thus, you don't have the power. The question will be, will they do the same thing or want to do the same thing to obtain that information? It is just like the theory of gravity; everyone have the piece of information that things will fall, but no one bothers to make use of that information to write out a theory before Newton came along. Similar concept, I would say.</p>
              <p>Every single information, be it useful a not, I will still take and keep. An understanding that the particular information is not useful is still "power" to me. It is just like doing reconnaisance in the army; no news is also news.</p>

              <p>Seems like you have grossly misunderstood the phrase of
              information is power. Ease of availibility of information merely
              means ease of obtaining the power. Either that or you have a warped
              understanding of the term information.</p>
              <p>Certain other information I will need will be doing some market
              surveys, of which the questions I'm crafting at the moment. Do you
              think such information is as widely available? I can get survey
              answers easily from the net (ease of availibilty), yet the analysis
              of the data that I want to do, how could others know what I want
              without much deeper analysis on their part? The power would be the
              analysis I have done by myself.</p>
              <p>Of course, others can repeat too. But if you don't do it, you
              don't get the information, and thus, you don't have the power. The
              question will be, will they do the same thing or want to do the
              same thing to obtain that information? It is just like the theory
              of gravity; everyone have the piece of information that things will
              fall, but no one bothers to make use of that information to write
              out a theory before Newton came along. Similar concept, I would
              say.</p>
              <p>Every single information, be it useful a not, I will still take
              and keep. An understanding that the particular information is not
              useful is still "power" to me. It is just like doing reconnaisance
              in the army; no news is also news.</p>

              <p>When I ask TS about where he shift his business, you argue that it is a PERSONAL question and claim that by telling me he will be exposing his BUSINESS "STRATEGY".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I asked you, supposed if he said Vietnam, what sort of business strategy will you have gathered from just the name of a country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I then tell you that we no longer live in the age where "information is power" because information (like the one I am asking the TS) are easily available in the internet.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You then talk about gathering and copying business model to help your start up business and I ask you, if you can copy those information so freely, what makes you think that others wont be able to do the same if they are interested in your business. and will that make you more powerful than others?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now you are shifting this discussion to talk about technological innovations, which eventually will lead you to talk about IP protection and copyright laws etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont you think that is too far off from a simple question like asking where is he shifting his business to?</p>

              <p><strong>OCBC's Q4 net profit down 16% to $428m<br>Posted: 21 February 2008 1545 hrs</strong></p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) said Thursday its fourth quarter net profit fell 16 percent from a year ago in the absence of one-time gains and higher expenses offsetting strong revenues.</p>
              <p>Net profit was S$428 million compared with S$510 million a year ago when it was bloated by divestment gains. Revenue totalled S$1.08 billion, up 19 percent from the same period last year, the bank said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Net interest income - difference between the interest earned and interest paid on deposits and other liabilities - climbed 25 percent from the year before and 9.0 percent from the previous three months as loans expanded.</p>
              <p>Non-interest income, including earnings from fees and commissions, was up 12 percent from the same quarter last year.</p>

              <p>Their products come from Israel, but do they come from a importer in Singapore or do they import it themselves. You might as well say that Kose products sold in Venus or Sasa are products that come from Japan. Yet did these shops sourced it from Japan? That is the main question, what is the source, or rather, supplier. There is no way they will tell you on  It is just like for the product of SKII, both counters, HDB shops, Sasa etc, all got from only 1 importer. None imported such products specially from overseas. Importer information is pasted on the products, and such information can only be found when you take the products from them. Again, shops like Onlineshopping.com.sg sell products like clinique. Where do they get them from?</p>
              <p>Again, my outside research also tells me that Clarins product comes from KNKK Enterprises. Yet when I tried searching on the net, there's no company information in which I can get their contact information or telephone number.</p>
              <p>I have emailed HSA yesterday, and they have told me before that it is necessary to do so. Yet Spa Treasures do not do it. Why? Is Spa Treasures doing an illegal thing by not notifying HSA about the products they are bringing in? Or are they merely taking the products from a local supplier such that there is no necessity to notify? If so, who is the supplier? These are information not easily released. Yet it is these information that are required so that you can start a competing business. The information required is not as simple and easily available as those you made out or searched. Each information that is digged out requires even more information for it to be well used, and these are extra information you can hardly get from the net. The concept to earning from retail is simple: you buy things cheaper and you sell them more expensive. The information required is, where are you going to get the things cheaper. These are all required things before even embarking on marketting. You can't market your products when you don't have products!</p>
              <p>Again, using Spa Treasures as an example, do you have any idea how much their original products are? And how much they could possibly earn from each sale or purchase? Are you very sure that you can get them off the net just like this? This is again important information which will help one plan the viablity of such a business. Of course, I have already sourced such information, and of course, not by google or any search engine at all.</p>
              <p>Then again, even if you do find the contact of the supplier, how would you know if they will definitely supply to you to retail? This is just like for Usante at Vivocity, their products came from a trading company (supplier) which is owned by them. Do you think their supplier will supply you products for retail such that you compete with them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, the telecoms part is just an example. The circumstances I have stated applies for any other businesses for that matters. Are you that silly to think only in terms of one market?</p>
              <p>Lastly, I didn't say I do not need to learn more things about business. However, I'm taking the first step towards learning and doing it just near to graduation. I'm still in the process of doing major data collection. So did you ever try?</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) said Thursday its fourth quarter net profit fell 16 percent from a year ago in the absence of one-time gains and higher expenses offsetting strong revenues.</p>
              <p>Net profit was S$428 million compared with S$510 million a year ago when it was bloated by divestment gains. Revenue totalled S$1.08 billion, up 19 percent from the same period last year, the bank said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Net interest income - difference between the interest earned and interest paid on deposits and other liabilities - climbed 25 percent from the year before and 9.0 percent from the previous three months as loans expanded.</p>
              <p>Non-interest income, including earnings from fees and commissions, was up 12 percent from the same quarter last year.</p>
              <p>Expenses during the quarter jumped 42 percent to S$485 million as the bank raised salaries and gave out incentives.</p>
              <p>For the full year, net profit rose 3.0 percent to S$2.07 billion on revenue of S$4.12 billion, up an annual 29 percent, on higher income from interest and fees.</p>

              <p>Expenses for the financial year rose 26 percent to S$1.68 billion, about 41 percent of which was associated with overseas business expansion in China and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>For the full year, OCBC said it made allowances of S$226 million for investments in collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) with some exposure to risky US mortgages.</p>
