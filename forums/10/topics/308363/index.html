              <p>Why are there so many China PRC working in coffeshop, cakeshop, massage shop?Now i also saw some hairdresser make up of China PRC.TaoPayo central got one foodstall, almost 100% China PRC workers.It's located inside the TPY central.Guys, don't believe can go and check it out.It's just inside the TPY central.And, all are from China.</p>
              <p>I think the truth is already out, the government is going to give all the jobs to foriegners and China PRC will gain the advantage over Singaporeans.Once they work here for long, PR will be given.Then follow by Red IC.Then slowly, all their relatives will be coming over.If they not happy here, just return back to China.I think they wont be so stupid to stay here for good.</p>
              <p>Well, as for my place here, the number of China PRC are getting higher.It's now time to ask ourselves, what should we do now?Vote out the government or fight the government?If we can't vote them out, we must fight ourselves out.</p>
              <p>To the PAP government, don't blame me for saying this.Since you don't really care about us,you rather care for the China PRC, why should i still vote for you?Why should i still support your party?I will fight against you.How i going to go against you?This will be for you PAP to find out!!!</p>

              <p>what the goverment seems to fail to understand is that we cannot play the foreign talents game like other countries do .... we are a Nation, so we cannot become a city of transients like hong kong ... and we are a young, tiny, artificial nation with a nascent national identity, with no "heartland" to speak of .... other much bigger western countries may have gleaming mega cities, their new yorks, their melbournes, their vancouvers which are able to absorb waves after waves of immigrants, but they have their "heartlands" where the national identity, the national psyche, is still forged ... the US has their middle america ... the canadian has their prairie provinces, the aussies has their "bush"... the outbacks ... we have only the HDB estates ..... my point is that our identity is so fragile that it can easily be destroyed in a generation or two .... our capacity to absorb immigrants is much much lower than those western countries listed above .... we thus cannot afford to play the talents game the way they play it ..... this unrestricted, unbridled influx of immigrants is eroding the roots of our society ...</p>
              <p>Oh well, don't mind me ... I'm just a young man who went to uni via the poly route ... a non-elite in other words ... and there's the most disheartening thing of all ... if I leave, would I even be counted as a numerical loss for the nation ? Since I am not among the "top 1000 talents" who leave yearly ? ...</p>
              <p>I have met my share of Singaporean Scholars overseas ... quitters all ... doctors, researchers, investment bankers, elites ... but what really troubled me the most was running into heartland uncles and aunties overseas, for the elites of any society have always been mobile, they will always be moving to greener pastures regardless .... but when you run into an uncle formerly from bedok selling mee pok tah in BC, then I think something has gone seriously wrong with our society .... </p>

              What will happen to the 5.5 million population after the Qing ministers are booted??

              Anyway, overcrowdedness is something that will leave a long impact after the current government is gone.
