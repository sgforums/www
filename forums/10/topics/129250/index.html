            <div class='col-md body'>What is the world coming to by 2010?<br><br>If the answer is "I don't know" then all of us will be in trouble. We will need good personal or government planning to progress competitively in new areas of jobs or economic growth in future.<br><br>Existing government approaches : leadership, emphasising on a few people at the helm doing things quietly on ad hoc, basis.<br><br>There is no serious planning. Even if there are, there is no involvement or interactions of such plans with citizens or businesses.<br><br>Today, open and accountable researches and planning institutes are planning out new areas of growths and challenges but in our case, we keep talking.<br><br>So we will lag behind due to lack of knowledge or practical knowledge in which areas of growths or potential new growth areas to get industries to upgrade and advance to.<br><br>Citizens themselves should be prepared to make their own progress instead of just listening to government or leaders to avoid disappointments due to random and uncertain past approaches. We also cannot take full advantages of business hubs we know of and the businesses are creating.<br><br>An Economic Master Plan will provide for awareness to prepare ourselves, the students, investors to plan relevant adjustments and shifts to new areas of growths. We can use it to understand how the universities conduct researches, new teaching methods, prepare students to go into new advanced technological areas and get them to work for those industries and companies charting new growths. The good students will then be prepared in advance to serve finally as CEOs/COOs of the new or charted industries such as the following:-<br><br>(1) Petro-chemical industries will churn out new products<br>(2) Micro-electronics will continue to miniaturize equipment and gadgets.<br>(3) Bio-medical cures, medical transplants, and automated laboratories<br>(4) New IT and telecommunication softwares and hardwares<br>(5) Office administration fully computerized<br>(6) Management of businesses e-based, automated and processable.<br>(7) Works processes fully integrated by IT/interfaces.<br>(Cool Home automation by TV, slim and lighter computers, robotic and gadgets<br>(9) Work/home interfaces e.g. hand-phones/laptops create mobile works.<br><br>The list is not exhaustive. I am waiting to improve it further. What are your views?

At present we had only AFPD in Tampines, and that's was the one and only flat panel display plant we had in Singapore.<br><br>And there is another report in Business Times, <a href="http://business-times.asia1.com.sg/sub/bizit/story/0,4574,153639,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://business-times.asia1.com.sg/sub/bizit/story/0,4574,153639,00.html</a>, it claims Singapore is well suited to support regional fabs, and to act as a wafer fab hub for the Asia Pacific region.<br><br>My ex-employer (not Chartered) has to resort to China to look for experienced engineers, and Chartered itself too go to China to look for engineers. Perhaps I am a pessimist,  I do not think that would happen, worst we are fast losing our competitive edge against the Chinese fabs.<br><br>My ex-employer had ever claimed that it will take China 20 years for the Chinese to set up fabs of similar scale and stability, my Chinese colleagues would only giggle at his comments.<br><br>We even have contract Chinese engineers (2 to be exact recruited in China) went (secretly) back to China. They are not attracted by the high salary here. On the other hand, they feel that their standard of living in Shanghai were not as bad. Despite earning 3000RMB monthly in China, they are enjoying a fairly comfortable lifestyle.<br><br>Have you ever wondered why Chartered still bleeding? Whilst TSMC and UMC still profitting? TSMC and UMC are leaders in the foundry industry, Chartered is just a follower!<br><br>We need to be leaders in leading industry and not as follower in a leading industry.<br><br></div>

Are those papers allow us to stay more competitive? Knowledge is indeed power, a critical, analytical and the ability to pass judgement and to think to me are far more important.<br><br>Do we have critical, analytical, judgemental mindset, that enable us to compete?<br><br>If my friend possesses an analytical mindset, he might think twice before forking out $35k for an electronics degree.

            <div class='col-md body'>erm.. i am not in the IT or engineering field. Economics and international business is my research area. A master plan for economic success is pretty difficult to formulate up. Most developed economies that succeed adopt minimalistic intervention, with government giving a free reign to market forces (invisible hand theory). The success of many European and American firms is the management structure. many companies are run by professional CEOs where ownership and management are seperated. remuneration is tied to the performance of the company. Such CEOs understand the value drivers of the company and how to bring out the core competencies and other latent resources to make sure that all departments create value.<br><br>American firms are much more profitable (take not profitable does not = more profits) and CEOs understand the use of resources. If Singapore comapnies can adopt such a practice, it might increase the motivation and profitability of the companies. This is one idea that popped into mind .. i will post up other suggestions when i can think of them</div>

Even India is able to come up with simple niche area and do well.<br><br>We went through the last two recessions in despairs without solutions how to catch up in creating new technology start-ups and new jobs. The elites were in denial state pushing the blame on external forces and not knowing that they have many ways to build on our strengths and niches as Korea, Finland the smaller countries have been doing.<br><br>Now, the talk is to create new images new names, posh downtowns and facade of clean and garden city or world-class Orchard Road etc. I am afraid this is not true entrepreneurship.<br><br>The leaders should have created some new value-adding industries to give us more jobs and more reputable international products like Samsung, Hitachi etc.<br><br>Our leaders are therefore mostly generalists with little exposures to practical entrepreneurship and competitiveness.<br><br>So many opportunities to develop value-adding industries were missed. Now we are chasing after these advanced technologies already well established in newly developed countries.<br><br>Practical entrepreneurs are needed in large number to create technology start-ups and without concentrating their energy on this and giving more support to the local entrepreneurs, we will not be able to make it.</div>

Bottom up approach, rather than top down:<br><br>I feel the ans to this is yes and no.<br>becos afterall the local who are in biotech research are few and<br>by far inexperienced compared to the world.<br><br>Also the way how research can be more sucessful<br>with real world application, it is often those that are<br>lead by reknown researchers as their experiences<br>will guide the rest in the right direction.<br>Otherwise, those locals researchers will be spending much<br>time/$$ 'finding needles in the sea'.<br>Thou i do not know abt biotech, this applies to Engineering Tech<br>research too. (which at least i know abit)<br><br>yes, there will always be a few "geniuses" among the locals<br>researchers wo much experiences.<br>but these are by far too few???<br>im sure the garment had better look out for these people,<br>else it will be like wat u said.<br><br>&gt;3. Create a research, not business culture<br>did u mistype this??<br>cos subsequently, u seemed to say not to emhapsis<br>publication persue culture.<br><br>Cos in my understanding, normally research is abt publications.<br>only when it is done with the right direction for biz gains,<br>this emhapsis of publications will get less.<br><br>So by saying 'create a research culture'<br>it meant to say 'create more publications'?!?!<br>u got me blur.<br>pardon my lack of understanding of biotech.<br><br></div>
