(Pls note,unless one is a BT subscriber, he cannot access the link between 6.00 am and 6.00 pm.)<br><br>If anyone who knows how to copy the illustrated map shown in the link, please copy and paste it in this thread.<br><br>http://business-times.asia1.com.sg/sub/news/story/0,4574,137231,00.html?<br><br>Published November 29, 2004<br><br>S'pore in the running for 2 big petrochem plants<br>Shell to decide on next step by year-end; ExxonMobil in talks on possible 2nd plant<br>By RONNIE LIM<br><br>(SINGAPORE) Singapore may yet secure two new petrochemical crackers worth at least US$1 billion each, not counting multi-million dollar investments in downstream chemical plants.<br><br>Shell has said it will decide within a month on the next step towards its planned one million tonne ethylene cracker on Pulau Bukom. And ExxonMobil has started exploratory talks with the authorities for a possible second cracker that could be on a site next to its integrated refinery/petrochemical complex on Jurong Island.<br><br>If confirmed, the two new crackers - so called because they break down heavier hydrocarbons into lighter products with higher commercial value - would bring the total number here to five. These would boost capacity for ethylene, a major petrochemical that has wide industrial uses ranging from plastics and synthetic fibres to solvents and paints.<br><br>ExxonMobil already operates an 800,000 tonne ethylene plant at the Chawan sector of Jurong Island, while Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore - a 50:50 joint venture between Shell Chemicals and a Japanese consortium led by Sumitomo Chemicals - operates two others with a combined capacity of 1.4 million tonnes of ethylene.<br><br>'We will make a decision to move on to the definition phase before the end of this year,' Shell Chemicals executive vice-president Tan Ek Kia told BT recently.<br><br>A feasibility study has already been completed, and the 'definition phase' involves more detailed design work, including a more accurate assessment of cost, he said.<br><br>While Mr Tan did not say so, this is strong indication that Shell is determined to move on with the project, regardless of whether long-time partner Sumitomo joins in.<br><br>Sumitomo, which previously was keen on the project, is studying instead whether to participate in a US$4.3 billion complex at Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Aramco officials have told BT they expect to complete this study by the second quarter of next year.<br><br>Mr Tan said Shell's decision on a cracker here won't depend on what rivals like ExxonMobil will do.<br><br>Earlier this month, ExxonMobil chairman and chief executive Lee Raymond confirmed industry buzz that Singapore is 'under consideration' as a potential site for expansion to meet strong regional petrochemicals demand, especially from China and India. This is the same reason Shell wants to build another cracker here.<br><br>BT understands that as part of groundwork for a possible second cracker, ExxonMobil has had preliminary discussions with the Economic Development Board as well as with Jurong Town Corporation about a site on Jurong Island.<br><br>The company's strategy, as Mr Raymond earlier told BT, is to extract the most value-added from each barrel, through better integration of its oil refineries and petrochemical plants.<br><br>With this in mind, ExxonMobil is understood to be eyeing a site 'just across the road' from its integrated Chawan complex. This is at Pesek sector, where the company already has an oil tank farm.<br><br>Similarly, Shell plans to build its cracker next to its Bukom refinery, to draw on feedstocks there and better integrate operations for cost competitiveness.<br><br>Asked to comment, an ExxonMobil spokesman said: 'We can't talk about our forward business plans at this stage.'<br><br>Still, 2005 may be the likely decision year for Shell and ExxonMobil for their Singapore projects, BT understands.<br><br>By next year, Shell will know whether Sumitomo will join it for a new cracker here, or if not, maybe in downstream plants associated with the complex. 2005 will also be when Shell Chemicals' US$4.3 billion petrochemicals venture in Nanhai, China - its immediate focus - starts up.</div>
