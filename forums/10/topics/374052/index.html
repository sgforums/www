              <p>By Stuart Biggs</p>
              <p>Aug. 31 (Bloomberg) -- <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Yukio+Hatoyama&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yukio Hatoyama</span></span></a>, who ended 50 years of single-party rule with vows to arrest Japan’s decay and tame its bureaucracy, is an unlikely champion of change: His family and political roots run deep in the party he defeated.</p>
              <p>Hatoyama’s Democratic Party of Japan almost tripled its seats in yesterday’s election, public broadcaster NHK projected, winning a lower-house majority for the first time. The Liberal Democratic Party, out of power for just 10 months since 1955, lost almost two-thirds of its seats.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">We want to change the bureaucrat-led politics</span>” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that has existed in Japan for 140 years</span>, Hatoyama told reporters today. “I’m grateful for the courage the Japanese people have shown.”</span></strong></p>
              <p>Hatoyama, who holds a Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.dpj.or.jp/english/about_us/yukio_hatoyama.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">engineering</span></span></a> from Stanford University near Palo Alto, California, pledges to end the government’s reliance on an unelected bureaucracy, which he says hasn’t worked in the public interest. Pre-election polls showed support for his plans to unify the fragmented pension system and increase the number of doctors.</p>
              <p><strong>The </strong><a href="http://www.dpj.or.jp/english/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>DPJ</strong></span></span></a><strong> is a mix of former LDP</strong> <strong>lawmakers, ex-socialists</strong>, one-time bureaucrats and trade unionists. It is a “broad church” whose competing constituents have made policy priorities difficult to identify, according to <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Jonathan+Allum&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jonathan Allum</span></span></a>, a strategist with KBC Financial Products in London.</p>
              <p>No French Revolution</p>
              <p>“This isn’t the French Revolution, these are not wide-eyed radicals,” Allum said in an interview. “The leaders of the DPJ have been around for a number of years and for a number of parties. These are pretty mainstream people.”</p>
              <p>Japan already has the world’s most rapidly aging society and the largest public debt, projected to reach almost 200 percent of gross domestic product next year. Unemployment rose to an all-time high of 5.7 percent in July, household spending fell 2 percent and consumer prices dropped a record 2.2 percent.</p>
              <p>“<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I want a regime change</span></strong>,” Minetaka Omura, a 24-year-old electrician, said yesterday after voting for the DPJ in Tokyo. “<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The economy is bad, and I want the DPJ to stop spending tax money for public works and shift it to welfare</span></strong>.”</p>
              <p>Voters have given Hatoyama a mandate to switch priorities from aiding the companies that built Japan’s $4.9 trillion economy to helping families cope in a society where almost a quarter of the population will be over 65 by 2014. To encourage people to have children, the DPJ says it will increase child support and lower education costs, paying for this by slashing outlays on roads, bridges and public works.</p>
              <p>People, Not Concrete</p>
              <p>“The whole idea of people rather than concrete, and, ‘Let’s be nicer to the Japanese population,’ could be immensely positive in the long term,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Philip+Whittome&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Philip Whittome</span></span></a>, who manages Japanese stocks at Investec Asset Management in London. “The election might lead to some changes in how Japan is run in ways that are underappreciated by the foreign investment community.”</p>
              <p><strong>Not only is Hatoyama, 62, a former LDP lawmaker; his grandfather founded the party and served as its first prime minister, his father was foreign minister and his younger brother served in the last administration.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hatoyama left the LDP in 1993</span></strong> to form a party in a coalition that briefly took power. In 1998 he helped found the DPJ. He became the party’s candidate for prime minister less than four months ago when <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ichiro+Ozawa&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ichiro Ozawa</span></span></a>, a fellow ex-<a href="http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/english/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">LDP</span></span></a> lawmaker, was forced to resign as DPJ leader over a campaign finance scandal.</p>
              <p>At Otsuka station in Tokyo, about 1,500 supporters turned out on Aug. 25, shouting “Prime Minister Hatoyama” and cheering as he told jokes about leaving the party his grandfather founded.</p>
              <p>Restoring Ties</p>
              <p>He laid out his opposition to red tape in a 1997 book “We Reject Bureaucrats’ Leadership,” co-written with DPJ vice president, <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Naoto+Kan&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Naoto Kan</span></span></a>. His speeches and essays also contain references to promoting “fraternity,” referring to the need to restore communities in Japan and improve ties within Asia.</p>
              <p>The DPJ says its promises, which also include eliminating highway tolls, will cost 16.8 trillion yen ($179 billion) in 2013. The party has pledged not to raise the 5 percent consumption tax and instead will stay within the existing budget by cutting spending on public works, reducing the number of bureaucrats and tapping the special accounts they manage.</p>
              <p>Hatoyama “will bear the heavy responsibility of managing the economy,” the Yomiuri, Japan’s largest daily newspaper, said in an editorial.</p>
              <p>The <a href="/apps/quote?ticker=NKY%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nikkei-225 Stock Average</span></span></a> remains at a quarter of its 1989 peak and the LDP’s effort to spend its way out of Japan’s ‘Lost Decade’ in the 1990s inflated debt.</p>
              <p>The LDP’s support plummeted, accelerated by the loss of hundreds of thousands of public pension records at a time when the public was becoming increasingly concerned about welfare and health care. There have been more deaths than births in Japan’s population of 127 million in three out of the last four years.</p>
              <p>Into the Ministries</p>
              <p>To break up a system that allowed bureaucrats, corporations and politicians to share power, the DPJ pledges to send 100 lawmakers into government ministries. It also will ban retiring civil servants from joining construction companies and other industries they regulated, a practice known as “Descending from Heaven.”</p>
              <p>“It may be difficult for the DPJ,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Hiroyuki+Kishi&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hiroyuki Kishi</span></span></a>, a former trade ministry civil servant and professor of economic policy at Tokyo’s Keio University. “When you confront bureaucrats, knowledge and information determine the battle.”</p>

              <p>Please lah, Hatoyama is a stanford-educated elite fella who comes from an extremely wealthy industrialist family. HIs family includes former prime ministers and other high-ranking politicians who have also pretty much used nepotistic connections to get their way up.</p>
              <p>Aso, who Japan has just gotten rid off is ALSO a stanford-educated elite fella who comes from an extremely wealthy industrialist family. HIs family includes former prime ministers and other high-ranking politicians who have also pretty much used nepotistic connections to get their way up.</p>
              <p>So basically it's one family-business taken over by another. The DPJ had taken over power once before, but power was quickly restored to the LDP simply because the people realized that the DPJ were making grand promises which were impractical and they couldn't keep. </p>
              <p>Hatoyama has also made promises to the electorate for great changes, which are unlikely to ever see the light of day. </p>
              <p>And the latest bit of news from the Hatoyamas themselves? </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 13px;">"The Hatoyamas have a son, Kiichiro, 33, who is an engineering expert currently studying in Moscow. ‘‘I think he has potential as a politician,’’ she said."</span></p>

              <p>If only Singapore got AV models like the jap, free porns and a homogenous population, then we can talk about opposition adopting jap model of success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We cannot base on the asumption of Jap political model and place it in here,..there is a lot of differences in both behaviorial and mindset of the citizen btw singapore and jap.

              <p>Interesting ..... and you should continue with your thoughts..</p>
              <p>Although one can claim that politicians are politicians in their ways, one cannot possibly paint all with a broad stroke of the brush.</p>
              <p>The new government formed by DPJ may consist of politicians from the LDP, but these are ex-LDP politicians who tried and failed to bring changes to the old style of politics that LDP insist to follow for the last 50 over years.</p>
              <p>They left the LDP to form their respective political parties to bring about changes that they think will have solved Japans present problems.</p>
              <p>The new designated PM Yukio Hatoyama had indicated that the first thing he will change is to neutralise the all powerful Japanese Civil Service who makes all the policy decisions for the Elected Government to approve, and will resist all attempts by the Elected Government to amend such policies.</p>
              <p>PM Yukio Hatogama intend to take back the authority of policy making from the unelected Civil Servants who are not answerable to the Japanese Citizens, and have been stubbornly resisting change.</p>
              <p>One can even say that the present problems in Japan is largely due to the unelected Civil Servants of the Japanese Bureaucracy.</p>
              <p>Essentially - "<em>Voters have given Hatoyama a mandate to switch priorities from aiding the companies that built Japan’s $4.9 trillion economy <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">to helping families</span></span> cope in a society where almost a quarter of the population will be over 65 by 2014. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">To encourage people to have children</span></span>, the DPJ says it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">increase child support and lower education costs</span></span>, paying for this by slashing outlays on roads, bridges and public works</em>."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a global economy that is interdependent, if every country is to wait for the larger economies to correct their problems, and wait for the filter down effect to reach the smaller ones, who should the larger economies wait for - when they are similarly dependent on the larger global economy itself to be ship shape too ?</p>
              <p>Should it not be the concerted effort of every single country to resolve their economic problems that would have different characteristics from the other economies and will require different solutions ?</p>
              <p>It is disingenious for the Singapore PAP Ministers - paid more then a million dollars in wages - to claim that Singapore need to depend on the recovery of the US economy before we see any economic progress.</p>
              <p>Two previous Economic Recovery Committees in 1987 and 1997 had recommended a list of actions prepared by their respective Sub-Committees but unfortunately not all of the recommendations were adopted in 1987, and 1997.</p>
              <p>The refusal to make the recommended changes in 1987 and 1997 - has caused Singapore to be stuck in a repeated cycles of boom and bust every 5 to 10 years, and this problem is further accentuated with an aging population and a shrinking birth rate. This is further compounded by an influx of foreigners taking up citizenship to resolve the aging and shrinking population, but have resulted in a lowering in the quality of life, besides creating an inequality of income and opportunities.</p>

                                      tedious push and pulls of politics as seen in the way it is

                                      States - are these in any way comparable to the sophisticatedly

                                      Israel and even India, where democracy have seen them weather to

              <p>That is precisely what is happening, today's representative democracy represents big businesses and usually not what the majority wants.

              <p>The Israelis Government constantly rages war against the Palestinians ?</p>
              <p>The majority of the Arab states have not signed any peace agreement with Israel since the creation of the State of Israel, and with fundings to the Palestinians from Iran - that has vowed to exterminate the existence of Israel and all Jews - can the Palestinians make any headway to establish their own independent state ?</p>
              <p>The longer that the Palestinians hold out against a peace deal - as Egypt and Jordan has concluded, they are giving the Israelis the strategic space in time and diplomacy to actually usurp the land which the Palestinians are claiming to be robbed.</p>
              <p>Whatever the weakness of the Jefferson model in the politics of the US Democratic System - it is still better than the manipulated monopollisation of the entire three branches of Governance - as seen in countries such as Myanmar, Pakistan under Musharaf, Indonesia under Suharto, Zimbabwe under Mugabe, and Singapore under the PAP.</p>
              <p>The Jefferson model of democracy allowed the Citizens to rule supreme, and the maturity and sophistication of the US citizens has not allowed the kind of manipulation that is evident in the monopolistic domination of ONE over everyone.</p>
              <p>How should you want us to understand your meaning of "<em>Direct Democracy</em>" ?</p>

              <p><br>It is fine if you are using the meaning of "Direct Democracy" as given in Wikipedia, as I thought that you have some other exotic versions as there are many creative thinkers who has their own bogey versions too.</p>
              <p>If you were to narrow your appreciation of Democracy to the US experience of the the politicians being too cosy with the big corporations, and use it to demean the concept of democracy in its pristine form that has been practised in Switzerland, Sweden, India, Finland, South Korea, and now in Japan.</p>

              <p>As matters stand, this Government is no longer accountable to Singaporeans, and find the citizens to be no better than dumb, and animals to be trained, and why should the Elite Talents be held to ransom by the electorate ?</p>
              <p>This is the position of MM LKY in his elitist position that require him to scheme for the last 15 years as to how to preserve his position, which explains even the extreme measure of giving the senior citizens 2 votes as he believe that the Senior Citizens are on his side.</p>

              <p>I reiterate that I am not in anyway opposed to the ideals of Jeffersonian Democracy and the American Revolution. They were afterall ideals for a better life. And it did give people hope for a change against monarchism and feudalism. However can one not see what has changed then and what is going on around the world right now? Isn't it a dictatorship by the elites? Just like in Japan and USA, countries that practice representative politics are just dominated by mainly two parties, both on the right in reality. I feel that in order to acheive an egalitarian society, citizens should be in no way held ransom to their elected government. If citizens participate in direct democracy, hold discussions and referendums, than such government is a voice for all, not just for the tiny few elites.</p>
              <p>To Atobe, yes I may be narrow as I have my own limitations so do enlighten me.</p>
