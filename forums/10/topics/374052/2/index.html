              <p>i just couldn't understand why people are like to refer our politic to the like of the west or other asian countries, each has it own unique way of governing and their culture. Whatever models of democratic on country practices, as long as it get voted or revoted, it show that people like it. If peoples think that thai politic is suppose to be those engaging type with protesting here and there, so be it, if the japs and koreans thinks that they need to change a ruling party base on corruption and inefficiency/ineffective, so be it. If Singapore pples think that we are ok with PAP for 50 years, so be it. And if the taiwanese need to go into fight inorder to get the parliament moving, so it be, it is their culture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When we argue over political matter, the most important is to have a neutral mindset, if one is argue with the hatre and revengefulness toward the ruling party, the scope of the argue is no more valid. At the end of the day, it seem like all other political situation is good and Singapore is bad, that is absurd. Total nonsensical. And to further seek enlightenment from him is a total joke of the year.</p>

              <p>Objective mindset you mean, what can you achieve with neutrality? I seek enlightenment from anyone including you, everyone has his/her own mind so everyone should have the right to speak. If one is poor and can barely survive on his/her existing current wage, who should one look to? Towards the government and the existing ruling party or sulk and blame oneself for not being an elite? And since the poor are barely living on life's scraps who are you to tell them they cannot be angry. If there is no constructive argument, there is no political progress. When there is no political progress, social conditions will remain as it is or get even worse, compounding on the existing social problems.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If i may add, what is poor in Singapore comparing to most countries, is it a major problem or that every singaporeans will say there are poor just because the cost of living is high to them?? I give you 10k per month, and you spend lavishly and still can claim you are poor, I give you 2k per month, and you spend without much thinking, and in the end, you claim you are poor. The mentality of POOR is one own desire to be, rich is alway a word people said about other, but nobody will say they are rich. So, in the end, you seem to think that there are many poor peoples, but actually most are able and living in moderate or above moderate condition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To what i observed, the poor in Singapore are not just poor in monetary term, but poor in financial planing and poor in working and most important, poor in mentality, the so called LAZY, u cannot help a person who keep asking you to fish for him, he needs to fish for himself, we can just provide the rod and the bait. There are many relief and funds at CDC, NTUC, CC and all religious centres such as Mendaki, Senda or govern initiative such as WDA, SPUR, e2i, etc etc for peoples to seek training and help. But even with that, most poors are still staying put, heckcare attitude and dun even bother to know what and where is the helping hands. If you keep saying that you are poor, poor, poor, ask yourself, what are you going to do, wait for the durian to drop infront of you ar...move your ass and start working a plan out to get out of the poor stage ya. Money dun just come from the sky hor.</p>

              <p>Why display such a negative elitist attitude? I don't like to use nasty language here but moving my ass, start working a plan, get out of the poor stage? Where does the value of money comes from then? Isn't it through people's hard labour, the ones who actually do the WORK. So if I'm poor and I've a partially disabled son with dyslexia you mean my son deserves to lead a poor life because he is intellectually incapable? And after I'm gone, what will become of him?</p>

If you have dyslexia or you son is intellectually incapable, sad it might be, but if you think back, with such problems, are you better off in Singapore or any countries, i bet that if you are in thai or malaysia or worst cambodia or even HK, so to speak, u will be draggin on the street.</p>

Can he even buy a descent house with all his low paid wages by himself? It's plain simple naiveness to suggest the economic good times Singapore enjoy can last even after I'm gone. I am lucky enough for him to have the means to survive in this barbaric world, but what about families in the same predicament as me?</p>
