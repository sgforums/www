            <div class='col-md body'>London Heathrow Airport Â– Terminal 3<br><br>It was about 0532 local time. I was totally unamused. Unlike in Singapore, there were no luggage trolleys at the gate, or indeed anywhere to be seen. This is not the way to run an airport. FOR SHAME ON YOU BAA. The route from the gate was extremely long to passport control and there was a further walk. Altogether we spend 17 minutes getting from the excellence of the Megatop to the dreary and cramped area of the baggage hall with very few baggage trolleys available. Imagine hauling two 7 Â– 10kg bags in both hands for 17 minutes walking through a cold airport after a 13 hour flight. ItÂ’s not a nice experience. IÂ’ll say it again, FOR SHAME BAA. There in the baggage halls they had stuck the two flights coming from Hong Kong Â– Virgin Atlantic AirwaysÂ’ and the cityÂ’s de facto flag carrierÂ’s flights baggage next to each other and the SQ322Â’s was next to the latterÂ’s belt. Poor organisation I say.<br>Whilst waiting the thirty minutes it would take to get the luggage, I made an effort to pass time by whispering to the people who were waiting at the belt next to SQ322Â’s, Â“You should have flown Singapore Airlines.Â” I got weird looks from about ten people but I got my message across. It should be noted that the Star Alliance Gold, First Class and Raffles Class bags came off first.<br><br>We then proceeded through customs with out fresh food from Vietnam and fake plastic flowers with ease and were not stopped. So much for being scared of having our bags searched and we were picked up at the airport.<br><br>Hoorah! We now end the primary part of my trip report.<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>KrisWorld:<br><br>KrisWorld: The Biggest Show In The Sky and itÂ’s only on Singapore Airlines. The system itself is easy to use as long as you know how to actually use it. When the system begins, you do get an instructional video, however, it lacked depth when coming to games and interactive services. In addition, a help button on the KrisWorld start screen that replays the instructional video would be a big advantage. I remember flying on the SQ317 and instead of playing games by using the control horizontally; a lot were trying to use it vertically.<br><br>Only with WISEMAN is it really a gem. WISEMAN pushes the boundaries of in-flight entertainment to the highest possible level at the moment. Without it, KrisWorld without the WISEMAN add-on, it is poor!<br><br>The quality of pictures is superb and sound Â– well I donÂ’t notice if sound quality is poor anyway unless itÂ’s very noticeable. Once a passenger travels with WISEMAN and then without, they will be most disappointed.<br><br>The choices on board were had the Â‘cater for allÂ’ attitude in mind and I think that worked really. There was a lot to choose from and the blockbuster movies definitely rated up there.<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>Singapore Airlines are really the number one airline. In Economy Class, one receives sumptuous meals, fantastic in-flight entertainment, superb in-flight service Â– that really Â“other airlines talk aboutÂ” Â– and on Jubilee aircraft Â– comfortable seats.<br><br>Unfortunately, the airline is not 100% perfect. This issue needs to be seriously addressed. First, letÂ’s start with the cons of the trip:<br><br>Singapore Airlines Pte Limited was not perfect on my flights<br><br>The seats on Megatop 747s need to be revamped. It is unacceptable to have differing seats to those on the new Jubilee ERs.<br><br>The toilets on the Megatop 747s need to be revamped. It is unacceptable to have different toilet configurations and styles to those on the new Jubilee ERs.<br><br>Aviance staff at London Heathrow need to be issued with neutral-appearance pens or pens with Singapore Airlines insignia when checking-in Singapore Airlines passengers at least. I recommend such pens being used to check in any passenger<br><br>Singapore Airlines should take care of passengersÂ’ wishes on the ground. Specifically, if a booking is not to be amended by the airline itself or a third-party, the passenger should have that right and that right be enforced.<br><br>The safety video is out of date, cheesy and the part where they show the emergency exits and positions is unprofessional. This must be replaced.<br><br>The amenity kit in Economy Class is unimpressive. The plastic wallet is shabby compared to the airline experience and the style of amenities has not changed. This shows lack of adaptability and if one does not adapt, one will be assimilated. The toothpaste needs to be improved to normal high-quality retail outlet standard. The colour of these amenities should match the colour of Economy Class Â– the advertised purple. The socks are of poor quality and need to be redesigned. In addition, there is no eye mask (though it is a bit understandable as youÂ’re in the dark when sleep time comes around). In essence, the whole thing needs to be replaced.<br><br>Singapore Airlines have a habit of pouring portions of beverage into those little plastic cups and smaller wine glasses. This is unacceptable and can convey a sense of over-dependence on Singapore Girls and/or stinginess. This needs to be rectified Â– specifically in the case of cans where the sharing of cans seems unprofessional and again, depicts stinginess and the passengers will be thirsty.<br><br>The sanitary napkins / towels have not changed as have not the covers that contain them. The sanitary napkin has developed since the 1990s at least and Singapore Airlines must provide higher quality amenities of this sort to female and intrigued passengers. Such a simple design simply does not cut it in this area<br><br>Duty-free shopping must be conducted more slowly and with more grace and charm. Calling out, Â“duty-free anyone, duty free?Â” is unacceptable. This must not happen.<br><br>Flight stewardess DPK failed to say, Â“Thank youÂ”, to every passenger when collecting hot towels on board SQ317 on 14 December 2002.<br><br>The supervisor at Tan Son Nhat International Airport representing Singapore Airlines did not smile back at me. He was racist towards his own people and is a scar on the Singapore Airlines Group. He is to be Â“releasedÂ” from the airline and given a negative reference. We do not have time or money to waste on such people. I am not impressed at his lack of courtesy.<br><br>Though Tan Son Nhat International Airport Ground Services staff do not wear Singapore Airlines uniform, they represent the airline at check-in. These staff are to be retrained if Singapore Airlines continues to use them. They are cold and do not smile. They do not portray the ethos of the airline. They anger me.<br><br>Flight stewardess LSL did not smile when delivering me by beverage of Coca Cola on flight SQ/SQF/VN173 on 13 January 2003.<br><br>It is not acceptable for passengers who do not know of all Singapore Airlines products and services and are not knowledgeable in this area of intelligence to have to ask to see the second bottle of red wine. If there is a choice, it should be openly-made available. Hiding the other bottle and hoping people do not notice is not the way.<br><br>Singapore Airlines in general need to improve upon the quality of bread at all airports. Bread should be soft on arrival on the passengerÂ’s tray and not easily-broken, hard or crumbly.<br><br>Singapore AirlinesÂ’ KrisWorld system is confusing to operate for people that skipped the instruction video of how to use the system. A button on the KrisWorld start screen should allow passengers to re-visit the video<br><br>Singapore AirlinesÂ’ KrisWorld systemÂ’s instructional video should be in parts and contain parts to all of KrisWorld and WISEMAN. These include, how to select video and audio, how to navigate to games, how to view FlightPath, how to navigate to multiplayer games and more recently, how to use the in-seat SMS / e-mail features.<br><br>Singapore AirlinesÂ’ comment forms distributable on board the aircraft need to be enhanced appearance-wise. These are currently bland and do not exude a feeling of warmth that should come with any compliment or complaint received.<br><br>Oooh so many. Now the positive aspects!:<br><br>Sales Executive RL in London was very understanding and went out of his way to satisfy the customer. This must be noted and praise given officially by the company.<br><br>T from Aviance at London Heathrow was very kind and friendly. She also smiled when conversing with us. This must be noted and these details passed on to Aviance. Please remind her of the need for neutrality or pro-SIA pens when checking in SIA passengers<br><br>Flight stewardess DPK on SQ317 on 14 December 2002 was impressive and performed her duties very well taking care to smile and make eye contact with passengers. She was warm.<br><br>Flight stewardess GÂ’O on SQ317 on 14 December 2002 seemed to be doing well and had a medium-large smile when serving passengers. This was impressive.<br><br>The lunch served on SQ317 on 14 December 2002 was fantastic. The portions were generous and I was impressed by the quality. The bread was dry.<br><br>Singapore AirlinesÂ’ regular snack service is very convenient and the range of snacks is good.<br><br>Regularly water and orange juice rounds are welcome<br><br>The seat comfort on board Singapore AirlinesÂ’ MEGATOP 747 is relatively comfortable. The ergonomic headrests are very convenient and seat cushioning provides some long-term comfort during the flight. However, the seat pitch needs to be improved.<br><br>Fight stewardess DPK on SQ317 on 14 December 2002 promptly reset my KrisWorld system after it crashed. She had to finish serving breakfast first before she could attempt this though.<br><br>The seats on the Jubilee ER aircraft are very comfortable and the one inch increase in seat pitch to 33Â” does make a difference. Singapore Airlines must integrate this seat onto all of the fleet when times are less hard.<br><br>The 6.5Â” screen is much better than on the MEGATOP 747s. However, certain competitors have installed 9Â” screens and Singapore Airlines must adapt and use this new larger size screen. A smaller screen is unacceptable<br><br>Flight steward OKÂ’s diction of English on SQ174 on 15 December 2002 was astounding and he was very concerning and professional. He also helped many people in the cabin stow hand luggage.<br><br>Leading stewardess S?K on SQ173 on 13 January 2003 was extremely helpful and warm. She delivered baby food and her height assisted her in helping passengers to stow overhead luggage. She also bought baby food to a passenger promptly and kindly.<br><br>Compliments must go to flight steward TBL on SQ173 on 13 January 2003 who showed great skill and compassion when dealing with my fatherÂ’s fuel-smell query. In addition, his after-response is the sort of things Singapore Airlines is made of. Kudos to him<br><br>In my opinion, Singapore Airport Terminal Services Catering in Singapore has brushed off itÂ’s negative image and the food provided on all my flights (London, Singapore and Ho Chi Minh City) were excellent and portions where liberal. However, the plastic utensils need strengthening. The food was stunning on all flights for an Economy Class meal.<br><br>Flight stewardess HHC on SQ322 on 13 January 2003 stands out among my interactions with flight crew. She was very endearing and her delivery of service was extremely virtuous. She remembered her training and though was a little shocked when I threw the blanket on the floor, she did indeed drape it over me. In addition, she conversed with me very well and was in no way robotic as some users here generalise Singapore Girls. Kudos to her.<br><br>Flight stewardess SC on SQ322 on 13 January 2003 was very professional and kept cool under pressure as in interrogated her about the disappearance of the second red wine bottle under Singapore AirlinesÂ’ silly Â“ask if you want itÂ” mentality. She also was very warm-hearted and impeccable service delivery was attained.<br><br>KrisWorld with the WISEMAN add-on is a godsend. By allowing the passenger to pause, fast-forward, rewind, stop and play audio and visual choices Â– Singapore Airlines has brought in-flight entertainment to a level above every other airline and has allowed control for the passenger. In addition, innovations like multiplayer gaming, in-flight SMS and e-mail and the Nintendo Gateway games are a very positive influence on the passengerÂ’s entertainment and the Airline should continue to work and enhance in-flight entertainment along with Matsu#!!!a Avionics Corporation. Singapore Airlines must hasten the installation of WISEMAN on all the fleet.<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>Sanitary napkin absorbency test:<br><br>Tested were the Singapore AirlinesÂ’ sanitary napkin and the Kotex brand sanitary napkin provided by Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>The Singapore AirlinesÂ’ sanitary napkin absorbed 0.25 pints / 118.25ml of water. The Kotex brand Vietnam Airlines sanitary napkin absorbed 0.3125 pints / 147.81ml of water. Hence, the Singapore Airlines sanitary napkin has failed against its competitor. It should also be noted the inflexibility and lack of wings on the former napkin compared to the latter.<br><br>So here after a total of 36 pages in Microsoft Word, editing time of 2001 minutes, 302 paragraphs and 15890 words, you have come to the conclusion of my trip report!<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>The bottom line Â– Singapore Airlines is definitely a great way to fly with service even other airlines talk about. Take the opportunity to fly the worldÂ’s greatest airline and experience what I have.<br><br>This trip report is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Cheong Choong Kong who has since retired from Singapore Airlines Group after 29 years of dedicated service. Singapore Airlines fans and employees alike will always remember what he has done to get the Airline where it is today. Thank you Dr. Cheong and God Speed.</div>
