Are they arrogant? Does he still pull the strings in the Government led by his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong?<br><br>This reporter was one of the 10 Singaporeans - all below the age of 30 - who quizzed Mr Lee on questions often whispered but rarely asked of him.<br><br>We vented our frustrations on issues like fairness and unfairness - like why Opposition wards were not entitled to upgrading funds and how the GRC system made it so difficult for the Opposition to win.<br><br>Mr Lee, on the other hand, gave us a tutorial on the reality of politics and the meaning of governance.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"There is no level playing field of any government helping opposition to win votes,"</span> he said.<br><br>His point was simple. He was not against Singapore having an opposition.<br><br>In fact, opposition could never really be eliminated. "But the Opposition we have now is not up to the mark."<br><br>But with a system that favours the ruling party, could Singapore get rid of a rogue PAP government if the party turned bad down the road?<br><br>"Once the PAP goes soft, it will be displaced," said Mr Lee. Then, a group of capable people with a proven track record could form a strong opposition and make their mark.<br><br>But the ruling party had no intention of letting matters drift to a point where people reached that level of unhappiness. As for GRCs, they were the only way to ensure the representation of minorities and women.<br><br>Again, the meaning of politics resonated through the dialogue.<br><br>While we spoke about civil liberties, elections and opposition, MM Lee made it a point to stress that politics went beyond just these.<br><br>He said: "You assume the politics is about elections and election contests. I do not see it that way."<br><br>He cited a definition of politics found in an American dictionary, which describes politics as the "art or science of governance of a country".<br><br>"Translated into real terms it means how my life is affected by the Government. Do I have a job? Do I have a home? ... Is there a future for my children? If you do not have any of these things, you are going to find agitation," said Mr Lee.<br><br>He explained how in the 50s and 60s, Singapore was in a state of agitation every day, with strikes, riots, homelessness, and unemployment.<br><br>"Today, over 40 years, we have transformed it assiduously because we attended to the politics of life. That's what it's about.<br><br>"What is the future? If you can have another political party to look after you the way PAP has, I say, my job is done, finished. I can go home and sit back and read the books I want to read," said Mr Lee.<br><br>At the end of the dialogue, he explained to us why he wanted to speak to us.<br><br>"Why am I talking to you? Because I think it is necessary for people like you and your generation to understand this is not a business of just voting or not voting.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"Politics has got to do with your life, your job, your home, your Medicare, our children's future,"</span> said Mr Lee. /ra TODAY  </span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Was it not supposed to be a <strong>"NO HOLDS BARRED DISCUSSION"</strong> ?<br><br>Did MM LKY's reply : "If I AM ARROGANT WOULD I BE TALKING TO YOUR ? " - give any answer to the question asked ?<br><br>Was this reply by itself the culmination of the arrogrance displayed towards the amateurish questions that were sheepishly, half-heartedly and caustiously made out by the young reporters ?<br><br>Watching this interview repeated over Channel News Asia from overseas was simply too embarrassing.<br><br>It was like having the retired Heavy Weight Champion Muhammad Ali - coming out of retirement to give a demonstration fight with some light weight enthusiast still learning the ropes of how to -<br><br><strong> "Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee". </strong></span><br><br><strong>"There is no level playing field of any government helping opposition to win votes," </strong><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">No DEMOCRATIC Country will allow its Government to legislate new laws that make ineffective the Constitutions that give political rights to the Citizens.<br><br>The level playing field is guaranteed in the Constitution and it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the Citizens are given access to that playing field.</span><br><br><strong>"Politics has got to do with your life, your job, your home, your Medicare, our children's future," </strong><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Is Politics merely about jobs, home, Medicare or more about OUR FUTURE and that of OUR Children ?<br><br>What FUTURE is there when everyone is a SLAVE TO A SYSTEM DOMINATED BY THE POWER OF ONE, and one's FUTURE is dependant on the generosity from this POWER OF ONE ? </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that whole programme of interviewing the group on Channel News Asia is utter rubbish. the journalist made their views known and it was aggressive. whatz so rude about that exactly? were they expected to kiss LKY's feet or something? ive seen interview of politicians on channels in London and the US. the questioning LKY received was very gentle. it was no big deal. Lots of other issues were not raised with LKY. A foreign journalist would have given LKY a hard time on the chair.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> the singaporean journalist questioning was nothing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The 10 journalists in the recent dialogue session with MM Lee were interviewed with Diana Ser tonight (20.4.2006) over CNA.<br><br>They have clarified the following views about that dialogue:<br><br>(1) What they want is choice.<br>(2) The older leaders always fear riots but there could be improvements without riots.<br>(3) The older leaders should not keep making comparison with countries with chaos. Why not compare with smaller countries in Europe which practise democracy and yet achieve progress without chaos.<br>(4) If leaders cannot change and cannot think out of the older mindset, who knows what will happen to the party 10 years down.<br><br>It is good to know there are young people today who understand the need to have choice or change for improvements to the autocratic one-man-knows-all system.<br><br>The reality of today's politics sadly is that our older leaders are dominating politics with the same older unchanging mindset based on paranoid that the country will be in chaos if they allow any choices or change of mindset.<br><br>Up to now even as PM Lee is trying to espouse openness and inclusiveness there is no sign there is any real change to MM Lee's past policies as expressed in that young people forum.<br><br>What then should the journalists or people do to create choice or cause change? Is there likelihood of change 12 years after GCT or say 5 years after LHL?<br><br>I think what the journalists have produced are not substantial to convince MM Lee to change. If they want to change they must stand for election and swing 10-20 percents of the votes from PAP then MM Lee will change. For now and many years ahead he would just stick to his old mindset and wait.<br><br>To MM Lee's way of thinking, it is too risky to change and there will be chaos unless he through PAP continues to hold powers for sometime and let people approve of all his past policies. Let us consider the following facts to see for yourself whether MM Lee will change?<br><br>(1) There is no such thing as fairness or government being fair to opposition.<br>(2) If necessary he will be unfair by amending the constitution on freedom of expression or the one-man-one-vote system to hold on to power.<br>(3) It is not his job to serve anyone not loyal to PAP and will not grant HDB estate upgrading fund to the opposition's wards even if its means going against rule of law and discriminating against citizens who pay the same tax<br>(4) He will not acknowledge there is high cost of living or dropping wages as he could always make comparison with worse countries to answer to such problems. Even if GLC or HDB are overcharging on land or fixed asset costs and when in Aug 2006 the bus operators' application for fare increases come up for review after posting it due to election, he might just give it approval for another round of fare increases even if the bus operators continue to make good profits.<br>(5) His judgments on all the major policies have been correct and infallible unless there are people who could stand election in GRC and deny him of votes.<br>(6) Despite the wrongs found in NKF, the government will not admit any mistakes were caused or condoned by the ministers or his government and when he simply denied it with some reluctant actions against Durai, there is nothing the citizens can do to pin him down for mistakes.<br>(7) Temasek will not be run with the kind of accountability and transparency as recommended by ex-president Ong Teng Cheong or anyone as he prefers to run it the way he chooses.<br></div>
