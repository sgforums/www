            <div class='col-md body'>Remember the 'Penis panic' in the 60s where Singaporean men suffered a mass hysteria about their shrinking ding dong called koro? Perhaps, this fear still persist today but has over the years evolved from the nether regions to the mouth - dumbstruck. So, those who speak their minds freely are struck down as being rude and the prescriptive remedy is to remain dumb and dumber in the eyes of the patriarch. You see, fear permeates all corners of this tiny red dot. As fear is contagious, instead of getting cured, it just passes on. From pigs to politiks to charities. I wonder if this severe mental illness that afflicts a significant number of the population is due to some magnetic interferences (e.g. fengshui) or electrical charges (e.g. lightning bolts that sends freak static charges to the air). What next? cabinful of mrt passengers suffering IBS (irritable bowel symptom) outbreaks during rush hour? Then there will be really be farty outbreaks.

            <div class='col-md body'>this is where the root problem arise when politicians would rather prefer their citizens not to care or have a say in politics. Would the first emperor of china wanted the peasants to question his 'wisdom'. Political apathy and the lack of awareness here is a grave concern. It is precisely this mindset the ruling party wants this generation, the next and 4ever generations to have.<br><br>So, when one sings the anthems, wave their flags, profess their pride in being Singaporeans, vouch their loyalty to the country, but in the end, are left out of the process to provide input (or on the pretext of encouraging input but nothing gets done) in the policies making and building of the future nation, is it 'much more to that'?<br><br>One can say, leave it up to the government to do these things. Aren't we lazy? For consumers, if you employed a domestic helper, you could say, leave it up to him/her to do the housecleaning. But do you also keep track of whether she does a good job or slacking away, track their progress, see if she pinches your stuff, or if you are paying her too much, even get someone else to check on her? You would also want to have other domestic maids from competitive agencies to see if they can tell you if you got a good deal. When you throw everything to someone else to do and they get paid millions, you don't just leave it at that. Are you so trusting of everything someone says and what they sell to you?  It may work in the 50s or 60s when the majority of the population were under educated, so they left it to those 'who knows the law' to do it. But today, do you have an excuse? would you still do that?<br><br>In addition to the changing economy and globalization, it is precisely why certain outdated policies that have been enforced without questions have perpetuated so much of the livelihood problems with regards to paying bills, taking care of the families, having a stable job.<br><br>Like you said about who is right, who is wrong, who is to say? One cannot just be fatalistic and willingly burden them. As a process, politics can have a great change effect to make your lives better.  These are not only your problems, it is everyone's problem. You have a say only if you want to! That is why, decades of over reliance and leaving all the decisions up to 'the government' to tell you what is right and wrong, is bad for you and the next generation. Being involved in your country's politics is not an entirely romantic or idealistic pursuit because everyone out there have got the same bread and butter issues to worry about day in and out. It is when you realize the signs and symptoms to one's current problems, and they are not entirely unique to yourself, that is when you have to ask yourself why are these happening this way (e.g. cost of living, medical bills, taxes, corruption in charity, transparency issues, building of a casino, not selected for upgrading programmes etc)?<br><br>From this, you trace them to the root of their problems and think of the avenues where you can effect change, not internalize them.  And you don't have to join the incumbent or the oppositions just to question these issues. If politics are meant for one or few people at the top, that is where you will always have the elites and if you allow that to happen, you cannot complain about why some get richer and others are poor, why the inequality of such systmes and the gap that grows between classes of citizens? You are the one to be blamed as you have allowed yourself to be dominated.<br><br>All you do is cast your vote. Think of it this way, if you cast your vote just for the materialistic concerns of some payouts today, in the long term, you may have more of these to worry about if there are no checks and balances to query who sets the mandate to say increase transport charges, medical bills, taxes, etc. Even if it is for our self serving concerns, the interesting thing about what many will do with the progress package payout is to pay bills. But if bills were the main concern, why not look at finding policies and solutions that can make live better. If your tap is running dry because of a broken hose, a pail of water won't help. Fix the hose.<br><br>If you vote for the status quo, you have no say. If you vote for the oppositions, at least you will then get someone who may represent these converns and present an alternative voice or challenge bills passed that may not be to your interest. E.g. it is not important if it was JBJ, CSJ or Slipperman unknowns, they can be renewed if they cannot at that point serve your interest but they represent a voice and are your agents of change. That is the more critical point. Or should you be more worried about silly PR issues or he does not speak good english and other superficialities like his or her personality, dressing sense etc from tabliods or state controlled media? Otherwise, what have you got?  If election day is another public holiday with walkovers and just thinking of where to spend the holidays, then, you have just added more problems to yours and your future generation's current and future problems of 'Paying bills, taking care of families, having a stable job become the more important factors' etc. You do not want your future generations to blame the current of their nonchalences.<br>A casual chat with a foreign professor some time ago dwelled on local politics, I said something to the effect like 'there is nothing much one can be do, everything is set. He asked if that is 'what being a Singaporean is all about?' Perhaps he was referring to those transitional immigrants whose only motive is to go into a country, make tonnes of gold and leave the country when its done. And maybe also shake off the dust from the soles of their shoes when leaving this place.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nanren4ever:</div><div class="quote_body">Youngsters want freedom of speech, they are idealists, and they see the world around them full of such cases.
