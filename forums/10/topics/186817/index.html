            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, you gotta consider the position of MM vs the youths. The MM is a man of accomplishment and have a track record of serving humanity. The youths are not all that so obviously, when they speak they lack weight and easily come across as being rude. Of course they could do better, by doing simple things like, "Sir, I thank you for having the courage to have this discussion with us and putting yourself in the firing line *smiles* and it's a great pleasure to be speaking to you. So... my question is... " I guess a little courtesy will help abit. Speaking with VIP needs to be tactful.
