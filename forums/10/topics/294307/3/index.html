Debate poured forth on press freedom, as well as on the role of investigative journalism.<br><br>In this case, the then director of the Monetary Authority of SingaporeÂ’s (MAS) economics department, Tharman Shamugaratnam, was charged with compromising the secrecy of a piece of information Â– specifically, the official flash estimates of SingaporeÂ’s economic growth in the second quarter of 1992. This information was communicated to Bhaskaran, an economist from a broking firm, who had then told it to, among others, the Business Times senior correspondent Kenneth James.<br><br>From James, the flash estimate was e-mailed to several Business Times colleagues, including the Business Times editor, Patrick Daniel. An article in the Business Times then communicated this figure before it was officially released. Daniel was charged with communicating the information to "unauthorised persons, namely, the readers of the Business Times".<br><br>What followed was an inquiry by the Internal Security Department.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tharman appointment: The next shot? Dubai, too Last chance for Bush?<br>P N BALJI<br>CHRISTIE LOH<br>ROSNAH AHMAD </strong><br><br>IF AT all there was a surprise element in Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam's appointment as Finance Minister, it was the timing.<br>.<br>The big question: Why the urgency to make the change now when it would have been neater to tie this announcement with the Cabinet reshuffle, which the Prime Minister's Office statement said will happen after the Budget debate sometime in February/March?<br>.<br>Don't be surprised if some major initiative, which demands the PM's personal attention, is underway. A political decision might have been reached that solutions to the cost of living pressures cannot wait a parliamentary debate early next year. Interim measures to ease some of the pain might be needed sooner than later.<br>.<br>But it is the impending Cabinet reshuffle that should occupy a lot of the political watchers' attention. And one key appointment that will be scrutinised will be that of a Deputy Prime Minister, for it will signal who the next PM could be. It has been three years since Mr Lee Hsien Loong became PM and one missing link in the succession planning chain is a younger deputy.<br>.<br>And if that DPM is a non-Chinese, imagine what that would do to add to Singapore's stature as a multi-racial country!<br>.<br>IN AN increasingly wary world, every investment firm with stated commercial imperatives but some kind of government link wants to gain the markets' respect.<br>.<br>For Temasek Holdings, its attempt at being transparent and getting foreign talent have often been held up as an advantage over its peers. That lead, however, just narrowed on Thursday.<br>.<br>Dubai International Capital, a three-year-old fund owned by the emirate's ruling family, has roped in three CEO-types from big-name foreign firms (Sony, BMW and GlaxoSmithKline) to join the advisory board of its US$2-billion ($2.9-billion) global strategic equities fund. DIC said the appointments reflect its "global ambitions".<br>.<br>Temasek, with a bigger portfolio of US$100 billion, has similar aspirations and an "international panel". The question to ask is: How will Temasek win the tussle for the creme de la creme?<br>.<br>IT'S easy to dismiss the significance of the Annapolis peace summit this week.<br>.<br>After all, the two key participants, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, are as weak as they come.<br>.<br>The two leaders, with a little prodding from their American host, have agreed to hold regular talks from Dec 12 with the aim of concluding a peace treaty by the end of next year.<br>.<br>Given that both sides are miles apart on "core issues", such as Jerusalem's future, the idea that an agreement is possible within 12 months seems a bit far-fetched.<br>.<br>Still, there's someone who can make a difference: Lame duck President George W Bush. If he is prepared to allow the US to be heavily involved in the talks as an impartial arbiter, a peace accord may just be possible.<br>.<br>For the US President, brokering a Israeli-Palestinian deal may well be his only chance of leaving behind a decent legacy. And that alone may be enough of a reason for Mr Bush to want to adopt a hands-on approach.<br></div>
