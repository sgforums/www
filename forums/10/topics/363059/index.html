              <p> </p>
              <p>Historical background on the USA oligarchy's influence and control over the federal government:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was a fairly workable system, since the three forces were
              approximately equal, the advantage, if any, resting with the party
              machine. This advantage became so great in the period 1865-1880 that
              the forces of finance, commerce, and industry were forced to contribute
              ever-increasing largesse to the political machines in order to obtain
              the services from government which they regarded as their due, services
              such as higher tariffs, land grants to railroads, better postal
              services, and mining or timber concessions.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The fact that these forces
              of finance and business were themselves growing in wealth and power
              made them increasingly restive under the need to make constantly larger
              contributions to party political machines.</strong> </span></p>
              <p>Moreover, these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>economic
              tycoons increasingly felt it to be unseemly that they should be unable
              to issue orders but instead have to negotiate as equals in order to
              obtain services or favors from party bosses.</strong></span></p>
              <p>By the late 1870's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>business leaders determined to make an end to
              this situation <span style="color: #ff0000;">by cutting with one blow the taproot of the system of
              party machines</span>, namely, the patronage system. </strong></span></p>
              <p>This system, which they
              called by the derogatory term "spoils system," was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">objectionable to big
              business not so much because it led to dishonesty or inefficiency but
              because it made the party machines independent of business control</span></span> by
              giving them a source of income (campaign contributions from government
              employees) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>which was independent of business control. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If this source
              could be cut off or even sensibly reduced, politicians would be much
              more dependent upon business contributions for campaign expenses. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>At a
              time when the growth of a mass press and of the use of chartered trains
              for political candidates were greatly increasing the expense of
              campaigning for office, any reduction in campaign contributions from
              officeholders would inevitably make politicians more subservient to
              business.</p>
              <p>It was with this aim in view that civil service reform began
              in the Federal government with the Pendleton Bill of 1883. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>As a result,
              the government was controlled with varying degrees of completeness by
              the forces of investment banking and heavy industry from 1884 to1933...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>At least in the USA, some of those in the Oligarchs of Wealthy had some social conscience and contributed the bulk of their time and wealth towards those less fortunate within their society and towards selected communities in the World at large.</p>
              <p>Warren Buffett contributed the bulk of his wealth to the Gates Foundation that is managed by Bill Gates and his wife, and in turn they agreed to establish a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.solarnavigator.net/sponsorship/bill_melinda_gates_warren_buffett.htm">‘Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett formed a US$60 Billion Philanthropic Foundation’  </a>to fight global poverty and diseases.</p>
