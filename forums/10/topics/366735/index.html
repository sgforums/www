              resolution Friday<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> equating the roles of Nazi Germany and the Soviet

              <p>Only eight delegates in the
              385-member assembly voted against the resolution, with more than half
              of those present voting in favor. The assembly does not take precise
              vote counts, and delegates vote by raising cards.</p>
              <p>The resolution,
              essentially a non-binding political statement, calls for making Aug. 23
              a day of remembrance for victims of Stalinism and Nazism. That is the
              day in 1939 that Germany and the Soviet Union signed a pact carving up
              Eastern Europe between them. World War II started slightly over a week
              later when Germany invaded Poland.</p>
              <p>Russia's delegates were vehemently opposed to the resolution and immediately left the hall once it passed.</p>
              <p>"Those
              who place Nazism and Stalinism on the same level forget that it is the
              Stalin-era Soviet Union that made the biggest sacrifices and the
              biggest contribution to liberating Europe from fascism," Russian
              lawmaker Alexander Kozlovsky, who participated, was earlier quoted as
              saying by the Russian newspaper Kommersant.</p>
              <p>Lithuanian lawmaker
              Vilija Aleknaite Abramikiene backed the resolution. "We did not seek to
              insult anyone. We were driven by an obligation not to forget our
              history and a sense of justice for those who perished during the second
              world war and after, including the Russian people," she told The
              Associated Press.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Russia has accused many Western countries of
              trying to rewrite history and understating the sacrifices made by the

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Under President Dmitry

              <p>At the
              same time Russia is not shy about raising alternative viewpoints about
              World War II. A research paper blaming Poland for starting the war
              appeared last month on Russia's Defense Ministry's Web site, triggering
              a sharp diplomatic response from Poland. The paper was soon removed
              from the site.</p>
              <p>Friday's resolution from the OSCE, which combines
              56 nations, comes amid preparations among Russia and Western countries
              to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II later this

              <p>As much as the Soviets did make great contributions to the Allied war effort, they also have skeletons in their closet.</p>
              <p>Among other killings, they murdered over 20, 000 poles in the Katyn Forest Massacre. The incident was covered up all the way till 1990. By then, even the Soviets found their propaganda would not be swallowed by the Poles and the world. I reiterate that Stalin, using the Politburo as his rubber stamper, perpetrating many, many other heinous crimes throughout WWII alone. Katyn was just one of the more prominent examples.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER.</p>
              <p>Having said that, the Western Allies are not exactly angels either. True, many Westerners have strongly condemned "strategic" bombing, the A-bombs, ill-treatment of (Japanese) POWs etc. Yet their governments have yet to acknowledge the full horror of their own sins. WWII for them is very much one big triumphalist fanfare. They do deserve much credit for fighting off the Axis and for conducting themselves much more humanely than their enemies. Yet they cannot be blind to their own misdeeds.</p>
              <p>Also, if put across poorly, this is unfair to the common Soviet soldier/citizen. Nobody who's gone through the Eastern Front's shit wants to learn that others consider him/her no better than Nazis. It would be better to direct this criticism specifically at Stalin's regime, not at the people who had no say in his cruel policies.</p>
              <p>While criticism of others' misdeeds is valid, one should also examine oneself.</p>
              <p>Thus, the Soviet Union's victims should be acknowledged as well as the Nazis'. Even so, the criticism should be directed with more sensitivity. Moreover, the Western Allies have their own soul-searching to do. The West's reduced credibility won't make their argument less valid. But fewer people will be willing to listen to them, because the ad hominem attack is only too effective.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>...We have mentioned that the economic discussions between Britain and Germany, which were publicly broken off on March 28th, were <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>secretly reopened </strong></span></span>five days later. We do not know what became of these, but, about July 20th, Helmuth Wohlthat, Reich commissioner for the Four-Year Plan, who was in London at an international whaling conference, was<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> approached with an amazing proposition by R. S. Hudson, secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>...It was almost impossible to keep negotiations such as these, or rather proposed negotiations, secret. There can be no doubt that rumors about them reached the Russians in July 1939 and, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by strengthening their ancient suspicions of Britain, made them decide to avoid any agreement with Britain and to take instead the nonaggression pact offered by Hitler. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The outburst of public rage at Russia for doing this by Britain and America now seems singularly<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> inappropriate in view of the fact that the British government was trying to do the same thing at the same time</strong></span></span> and the fact that France had signed what Russia regarded as a nonaggression pact with Germany on December 6, 1938. Indeed, Sir Nevile Henderson, who undoubtedly was more extreme than some of his associates, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>went so far as to condone an alliance between Britain and Germany, on August 28, 1939. Obviously, such an alliance could be aimed only at Russia.</strong></span></span> The relevant portion of his report to Lord Halifax reads...</p>

              Britain and Germany, which were publicly broken off on March 28th,
              were <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>secretly
              reopened</strong></span></span> five days later. We do not know
              what became of these, but, about July 20th, Helmuth Wohlthat, Reich
              commissioner for the Four-Year Plan, who was in London at an
              international whaling conference, was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>approached with an amazing
              proposition by R. S. Hudson, secretary to the Department of
              Overseas Trade...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>...It was almost impossible to keep negotiations such as these,
              or rather proposed negotiations, secret. There can be no doubt that
              rumors about them reached the Russians in July 1939 and,
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by strengthening their
              ancient suspicions of Britain, made them decide to avoid any
              agreement with Britain and to take instead the nonaggression pact
              offered by Hitler.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The outburst of public rage at Russia for doing this by Britain
              and America now seems singularly <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>inappropriate in view of the
              fact that the British government was trying to do the same thing at
              the same time</strong></span></span> and the fact that France had
              signed what Russia regarded as a nonaggression pact with Germany on
              December 6, 1938. Indeed, Sir Nevile Henderson, who undoubtedly was
              more extreme than some of his associates, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>went so far as to condone an
              alliance between Britain and Germany, on August 28, 1939.
              Obviously, such an alliance could be aimed only at
              Russia.</strong></span></span> The relevant portion of his report
              to Lord Halifax reads...</p>

The conference lasted from 12:30 P. M. on September 28th to 2:30 A. M. when the agreement of the four Powers was handed to the Czech minister in Berlin, who had been waiting outside the door for over ten hours. The agreement reached Prague only eighteen hours before the German occupation was to begin...</p>
              <p>Beneš resigned as president of Czechoslovakia under the threat of a German ultimatum on October 5th and was replaced by Emil Hà¹�cha. Slovakia and Ruthenia were given complete autonomy at once. The Soviet alliance was ended, and the Communist Party outlawed. The anti-Nazi refugees from the Sudetenland were rounded up by the Prague government and handed over to the Germans to be destroyed.</p>
              <p>All these events showed very clearly the chief result of Munich: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Germany was supreme in central Europe, and any possibility of curtailing that power either by a joint policy of the Western Powers with the Soviet Union and Italy or by finding any openly anti-German resistance in central Europe itself was ended. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Since this was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>exactly what Chamberlain and his friends had wanted, they should have been satisfied.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR in Russian abbreviation)
              has declassified archive materials related to the 1938 Munich
              Agreement, which triggered the most dramatic events of the 20th
              century.</p>
              <p>Head of the SVR press office Sergei Ivanov allowed Yarmolenko to familiarize himself with the declassified documents.</p>
              <p>"The declassified intelligence documents reflect the political
              processes which took place before and after the Munich Agreement of
              September 30, 1938, which is also called the 'Munich conspiracy,'"
              Ivanov explained.</p>
              <p>These documents were kept in the archives as top secret for 70 years.
              They show that the Soviet political leadership was informed about the
              preparations for the meeting of Neville Chamberlain and Eduard
              Daladier, on the one hand, and Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, on
              the other, and predict its potential military and political
              consequences for Europe. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The papers show what unprecedented pressure
              Britain and France brought to bear on Czechoslovakia, demanding that it
              ceded Sudeten to Germany. </strong></span></p>
              <p>...Later, on November 25, Grippenberg reported his conversation with a
              British government member who assured him that Britain and France would
              not interfere in Germany's eastward expansion.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "Britain's position is as follows: let's wait until Germany and the
              U.S.S.R. get involved in a big conflict," the document reads. </strong></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Within two weeks of Hitler's annexation of Austria, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Britain was moving.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It was decided to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> put pressure on the Czechs to make concessions to the Germans; </strong></span>to encourage France and eventually Germany to do the same; to insist that Germany must not use force to reach a decision, but to have patience enough to allow negotiations to achieve the same result; and to exclude Russia, although it was allied to Czechoslovakia, from the negotiations completely...</p>

              <p>The two outcast Powers drifted together and sealed their friendship by a treaty signed at Rapallo in April 1922. This agreement caused great alarm in western Europe, since a union of German technology and organizing ability with Soviet manpower and raw materials would make it impossible to enforce the Treaty of Versailles and might expose much of Europe or even the world to the triumph of Bolshevism.</p>
              <p>Such a union of Germany and Soviet Russia remained the chief nightmare of much of western Europe from 1919 to 1939. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On this last date it was brought into existence by the actions of these same western Powers.</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>..</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>The Yorkshire Post, owned by Mrs. Eden's family, did its best to 
                  sabotage Lord Halifax's visit. It was rebuked by the London Daily 
                  Telegraph (which is close to Mr. Chamberlain) for printing rumors that 
                  "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There exist and are known to Germany to exist in this country [Britain]
                  a "certain number of people—not all of them obscure [Halifax &amp; 
                  friends]— who would be prepared to welcome a German campaign of 
                  territorial expansion in the East [Austria, Czechoslovakia, Russia]</strong></span> if 
                  by that means Germany could for the time being be diverted from 
                  exploiting her nuisance value in other directions [colonies].</p>

              <p>The PAP continue their grip on political power by making it as difficult as possible for the full participation by a registered electorate of over 2,039,748 Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In Election 2006, only 1,222,884 eligible voters were able to cast their ballot - which represented only 59.95 per cent of the registered list, while the remaining sat at home unable to participate.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_general_election,_2006">When the PAP count of 747,860 votes received is placed on a registered list of 2,039,748 Singaporeans </a>- this represent only 36.66 per cent of the electorate.</p>
              <p>Is this representative of Singaporean support ?</p>
              <p>Can this be any mandate from the people ?</p>
              <p>When bigger countries with larger population than Singapore - such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the USA - can have almost 80 per cent of their population participating in the Election Process, why has Singapore exclude almost half of her population from the process ?</p>
              <p>This make clear nonsense the propaganda that the PAP claims that the Alternative Political Parties are not capable to put candidates to contest in all the constituencies.</p>
              <p>Singapore is only a Little Red Dot, that is smaller than New York City, yet it has more Members of Parliament - (with more Town Mayors) - then New York City with only one Mayor who is paid far less and able to do more.</p>

              <p>i am never a PAP supporters. i understand what atobe and ah chia are writing about. singaporeans do know we are repress, suppress, and ruling with iron fist. why do they still win evert election. my mom is more concern with cleaniness of the living area than politics. my sister is more concern with her rice bowl as she is civil servant. my good friends are more concern about soccer than who running temasek.  i mean singaporeans are fine tune to such a extend to the propaganda of the PAP that we are not concern with who run the country. and many of my uni grads friends think NTUC is a subwing of PAP. sad isnt it?</p>
