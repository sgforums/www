            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Limited choices with biotechnology diploma<br>Mon, Nov 19, 2007<br>The Straits Times  </strong><br><br>I REFER to the article, '2 top cancer research groups to set up shop here' (ST, Nov 5). It stated that the arrival of two prominent research institutes was a 'strong validation of Singapore's importance as a research node'.<br><br>While the presence of these two new research institutes here further cements our role as a regional hub, we should not neglect the local population.<br><br>This year, the biomedical research industry in Singapore came under fire because a large amount of money was invested in this area with little returns in terms of conclusive data.<br><br>Relate this to the fact that most research scientists here are expatriates on expatriate pay.<br><br>Wouldn't it be more cost- effective to hire local graduates who can do these jobs?<br><br>I am aware that one of the most prominent research institutes here does not offer scholarships to polytechnic graduates for further studies and I believe this discounts the fact that there are keen minds in polytechnics today.<br><br>I studied biotechnology at diploma level, under the impression that I would have good prospects in terms of future studies and career advancement.<br><br>However, the fact is that only the top 10 per cent of polytechnic graduates are accepted by local universities. This leaves the remaining 90 per cent of life sciences students with limited choices.<br><br>These choices include going overseas to pursue a degree in biomedical science (which not everyone can afford), or jumping ship and pursuing a degree that has nothing to do with life sciences. I have, unfortunately, opted for the latter.<br><br>Also, I would like to point out that most polytechnic students have at least four months of industrial experience, due to student internship programmes that are a prerequisite of most diploma courses.<br><br>In fact, one of my former polytechnic classmates, who is currently studying in a local university, often has to guide his classmates, who graduated from junior college, in the correct use of laboratory equipment as well as safety protocol.<br><br>Furthermore, I have noted that even with a good degree, job openings in biomedical research institutes are hard to come by.<br><br>That said, one question I feel should be addressed is this: Why groom us when there is little intention of hiring us?<br><br>Denise Mohan (Ms)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>no.. the moral of the story is that those who och and moan are those who don't get what they want...</blockquote>Frankly speaking your comments are pretty myopic.<br>I agree with you, those who don't get what they want do moan and och (whatever this means). What you need to consider is this, are they just sitting on their butts without putting up any effort and whining (which is bad of course) or have they been denied legitimate opportunities even after having worked hard for it? If they have worked hard for something and yet been denied of what they want (or deserve) then i feel they have every right to complain.<br><br><blockquote>you think for one moment the person will be writing this if she was in the top 10%?</blockquote>There will always be a top 10% and lower 90%. Haven t you heard about how grading works, Moderation??? Even if every single student were to be a super duper hard working genius there still would be a top 10% and lower 90%.<br><br><blockquote>grow the hell up.. most other countries have the same pattern... </blockquote>If we practice your logic of "grow the hell up.. most other countries have the same pattern...", i guess all our lives will be "problem free" and we can all live in absolute "bliss". Heck, there wouldn't even be any need for a police force, law, customer service, court, consumer standards etc etc, after-all, all countries have problems right?<br><br><blockquote>you read what your delusions tell you...<br>no one put a gun to her head to make her study that field.. just like no one forced those idiots to throw their money at MLMs.. </blockquote>One does not need a gun to be put in ones head to make a decision. 100% of the time the decisions that we take stems out of our personal perceptions, opinions and beliefs. And how does one form these perceptions, opinions and beliefs? its by what we hear, see, feel and experience.<br><br>The TS made a decision to study BioTech based on what she read, heard and was told by the experts in the relevant field and by the policy makers. How on earth could she have ever known that all that would turn out to be wrong? BioTech is an emerging field in SG and nobody could have predicted its future. So criticizing the TS for the decision that she took is just not right. Tell me, have all the decisions you have taken in your life turned out to be right???? (if yes, then your case is an anomaly, not the norm)<br><br>Btw, you said "you read what your delusions tell you...". that makes me wonder.....if BioTech had turned out to be a very successful industry in SG, would you be commenting " no one put a gun to her head to make her study that field.. "???????<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>her result must b quite sux, thats y kbkp.</blockquote>You come across as a very arrogant dick!!!<br>What makes you think that her grades are poor? Did she mention anything about students with lower grades not getting jobs? Are you aware of the fact that even if a class is full of super hardworking genius students there will still be a top 10% and lower 90% (due to moderation)? Do you know that there are plenty of  Phd graduates (biomedical, biotech, microbio etc) from our local Unis who couldn't find a  descent job outside and had to be "employed" within the university or its research branches just so that they can be provided a job? and i can assure you, every one of those Phd graduate is a hell lot more smarter than you or me.<br><br><blockquote>ppl who dun do that well, sld stay happy with lower jobs.</blockquote>Once gain who the heck are you to say such a demeaning comment?????I guess your arrogance stems from your very owm superiority complex of you supposedly having done well in life and holding a high flying job. am i right??? People have the right to be happy/unhappy with thier jobs....whether its low/high paying , whether they did well/didnt do well. Its a choice for them to make, not for you to bloat about.<br>Btw, taking about "ppl who dun do that well", what excatly is your opinion of having done well in life?? care to explain??<br><br><blockquote>then climb fr there, if u r good.</blockquote>there are too many factors that come into play when climbing the corporate ladder. Just being good doesn't guarantee anything.<br><br><blockquote>frankly speaking, i see most poly, uni students nowadays, other than exam, nv see them work hard or even initiative to learn more "society skills". all enjoymt oni, if u r employer, u wan employ ppl who dun work hard?<br>but if u constantly work hard during studies, u will b an edge above others, and i'm sure u can find good jobs.</blockquote>just like the umpteen number of Phd graduates (that i mentioned above) SG imported i guess????Oh yes, they all have an edge and they have found "good" jobs.<br><br><blockquote>employer wan ppl who work hard, if ur results shows badly, it either means u r stupid or u r lazy. stupid LL, but lazy wan blame who? which employer wan hire lazy bums? while it's true that u uses oni 10% of wad u learnt in sch, but employers look upon results as ur "attitude" twds work.if during studies, u slack, can poor result, yet wan go high prestige comp w/ high pay, then will b unfair to ppl who work hard.unless she is top 10% yet not employed, then LL.</blockquote>Being lazy, stupid might not be the only reason why someones grades aren't good. There could be other factors such as the persons aptitude, financial commitments, health, emotional/social well being etc. Btw, just on hindsight (since you seem to equate low grades with stupidity, not being able to get a job,  and not being able to do well in life) , some of the most successful people in life, more successful that you can ever imagine yourself to be,  ( and by success i don't just mean earning tons of money) have fared extremely bad in studies, many of them have been drop outs....... tops entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers etc etc.</div>

But it's not doing enough to help local grow in this area. The gov has simply forgotten that the local are the only real resource that SG has. Depending solely on FT to build the industry is a short-sighted move as the FT will one day go back to their homeland along with their skill-set.<br><br>Look at India, it can never be that strong in IT without strong encouraging from its gov.</div>
