"It is time that we move our manpower policies for PMEs from a defensive, anti-discrimination position to one where we actively promote and champion the hiring and development of Singaporeans."<br>She noted that from August, firms will have to advertise on a jobs bank for 14 days before applying to hire foreign PMEs.<br>Yet the eventual decision is still up to them, she said. "The Manpower Minister further emphasised that (this) is not about 'Hire Singaporeans First' - but many are asking, 'Why not?'"<br>She wanted employers to have to prove that if a foreigner is hired, it is only because there are no suitable locals. Firms that hire foreigners should also be obliged to have a formal system for training and developing Singaporeans, and to ensure skills from foreign hires are transferred to locals.<br>"I believe that the current negative sentiment against foreign talent will ease when Singaporeans no longer feel that their livelihoods are threatened," she said.<br>If the issue of jobs for Singaporeans is not managed well, such resulting sentiments "can send the wrong signals to employers and foreign investors", noted Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang GRC).<br>Labour MP Patrick Tay (Nee Soon GRC) proposed several ways to help PMEs.<br>The Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications framework of training courses should have a greater focus on PMEs, not just rank-and-file or mid-level staff.<br>Government funding should be more accessible to individual PMEs, and not just for firms.<br>Companies should be given incentives to let employees pursue a "second skill" during work hours.<br>And industries which regularly lay off employees - such as finance - could provide better support for the retrenched, he said. This could take the form of subsidies and payments, to act as a form of "unemployment insurance" to tide them over. "If the PME is laid off with no fault of his or her own, employers have a moral responsibility to see through the career transition for them."<br>For Non-Constituency MP Lina Chiam, the issue was that firms are being treated too well in comparison with workers. She called for "policies that favour Singaporeans, not an absolute growth model" for the economy.<br>This article was first published on May 27, 2014.Â <br><a style="color: #005688;" href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/mps-want-more-protection-support-local-pmes">MPs want more protection, support for local PMEs, AsiaOne Singapore News</a></td>

              When U sayÂ <em>"foreigner have currency at their side"</em>: u mean to say that foreigner PMET are here mainly to earn $$$ here (scrimp and save to avoid SG GST) so that they can retire early/ wealthy in their own homeland (zero GST).<br>Singapore has vibrant economy and tourism business's simply becauseÂ <strong>Singaporeans serve NS and are largely NOT JUST LAW ABIDING BUT ALSO LAW ENFORCING: e.g. SCDF, police, SAF NSmen: who are paid peanuts during NS and for those with low/ no salary, peanuts for performing NS ICT/IPPT etc but are ready to assist when anything happens: e.g. STOMP about inconsiderate behaviour, call the cops when fire/ robbery/ RTA noticed, do CPR on unconscious people, pick up,litter (<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://kindness.sg/">SKM</a>) etc.</strong><br><a style="color: #005688;" href="http://kementah.blogspot.sg/2014/02/singapore-ministry-of-defence-budget.html">SAF itself costs in excess of S$12.56billion p.a. to run.</a>Minus SAF, Singapore's vibrant economy will be less attractive than it currently is. Rather than Singaporeans paying MORE GST to cover the rising cost of running SAF (12.56billion SGD p.a.),<strong>Â foreigner PMET should be made to pay 17% employment pass levy on the three prong reason(s) of:</strong><br>1) to contribute to SAF on which the vibrancy of the SG economy stands, these foreigner PMETs whom companies currently adore due to 17% employment 'tax' savings must be taught to understand that a safe and secure Singapore does not come cheap.<br>2) to remove companies incentive to hire foreigner PMETs over Singappreans by making the 17% company contribution mandatory FOR ALL EMPLOYEES (except that citizens/PR get theirs in the form of CPF top up (status quo)).<br>3) encourage foreigner PMET to apply for citizenship/ PR (must cancel their current citizenship to qualify), contribute to Singapore's nationhood in the long run and have their offspring serve NS rather than leaving Singapore at the drop of the hat should Singapore be invaded by a foreign land (property prices will also be less volatile if the occupants are citizens rather than foreigner PMETs).<br><br>Citizens should NOT have to suffer the 3% rise to 10% GST as they have already contributed by serving NS and reservist duties for peanut allowance (see chart below).<strong>Â Foreigner PMETs must do their part now by paying 17% foreigner PMET employment pass levy.</strong><br><br>As for the last part of your question,<em>Â ".., they can afford to downplay. but can sinkies down play their value?"</em>Â Sinkie's will just have to upskill to take on better paying PMET jobs: e.g. by maybe puting the 17% foreigner PMET levy into a CPF Edusave fund for every Sinkie that can be used to up skill or learn new retirement skill etc (e.g. join an adult university, take post graduate courses etc). Giving employers a 17% discount/ tax rebate for hiring foreign PMET is really going too far already. Sad that Sinkie's are so dependent on foreigner PMETs, we are on the verge of prostituting ourselves to them through the government giving companies a tax rebate of 17% for hiring foreigners (if U can appreciate the savings from not having to pay employer CPF of 17% in that way). Yes, GDP might fall slightly with the introduction of a new foreigner employment pass levy of 17% to give Singapore citizens an equal footing as foreigner PMETs, however, considering the possibility of then being able to avoid increasing the planned GST rise of 3% to 10%, I say we have made the dignified and most respectable choice moving forward.<br>PM Lee said recently thatÂ <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.tremeritus.com/2014/05/04/pm-lee-sg-belongs-to-all-living-here-not-just-sgs/">'Singapore belongs to everybody'</a>: those on employment passes as such should thus understand that they too are responsible for contributing to SAF's S$12.56 billion p.a. budget.

              <p>When the AEC (Asean Economic Community) comes into effect next year, Sinkies should expect more Sinkie PMETs (especially male Sinkie ones) to be out of job.</p>
              <p>Below are the reasons:</p>
              <p>1. If you are an employer, would you prefer to hire male Sinkie PMETs or male PMETs from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar? Male Sinkies cost considrably more and they have to undergo reservist training at least once a year till age 40 or till for whatever medical reason. Employers don't like their staff to go "disappear", right?</p>
              <p>2. Sinkapore is the wealthiest city-state in Asean. It claims to have achieved the Swill standard of living, even exceeding that of Switzerland's. More Asean PMETs will want to come here.</p>
              <p>3. Any Asean PMET who is fluent in Engrand are welcome to work here. The converse is not true. Sinkie PMETs who wish to work in other Asean countries must be fluent in the national language of the host country. Job advertisements in other Asean countries always specify that job applicants must be fluent in the national language. Another example: if a Sinkie medical doctor wishes to practise in say, Vietnam, the Vietnamese medical registration board requires that s/he be fluent in Vietnamese. This is understandable because medical doctors should be able to converse easily with their patients.</p>
              <p>P.S.: LHL is one of the prime movers and promoters of AEC where trade in services and labor is free of encumbrances among Asean countries.</p>
