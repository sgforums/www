              <p>These "people" or should I say companies are only interested in
              $. Therefore if they can pay you the least amount they will. That's
              why you need unions/government to help ensure that companies do not
              take advantage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You need to understand that Singapore wants to achieve
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Swiss Standards/Western
              Economies</span> but hor with that mindset what you are suggesting
              is that the average joe should have low labour cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want Singapore to be Garuda Indonesia ah? One maid tie
              shoelace, one maid for massage, one maid to polish the 'H' on your
              Honda (seldom see Lolls Loyce in Sg). Maybe if we follow the
              mindset of cheaper,better,faster.... one day we might be able
              to employ a cohort of Singaporean maids. Why? Because Singapore
              labour is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SO
              CHEAP</span>. Just because someone does not want to excel means he
              must be paid peanuts meh? Is that humane? Meritocracy is good but
              take it to the extreme and its bad. Singapore labour cost continue
              to be cheap...your SG women will end up as ppls maid sia.
              Already rental from just my 1 house can hire 2 SG ah huay
              at $13-400 each or 3 Kopi Uncles to swat flies. You try in the
              Western Economies that Singapore 'Aspire' to be. 1 Maid dunno cost
              you how much sia. In Oz no one I've met so far HAS a maid. My
              parents used to know a Datuk (who sadly passed away), he has a maid
              (they call it caretaker), part time only like 8-5. 4k+ Aud a
              month. How many Ah Huays in Sg will queue for it? And you want
              your women to be cheaper lol. You want them go Geylang parade? $40.
              I can hire a troupe of them for the 45 mins to be in my circus Lol.
              After that happens.... when you go overseas.... you gonna tell the
              angmoh with pride that your country is Swiss Standard? He will say
              its Bang Cock standard sia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tell you sumthing about the Ang Moh whores here hor. $10k Aud
              a week. $150-200 Aud half hour. What your typical Ah Huay in
              Emporium earns in half a year.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Haha. Somehow you made me laughed. Don't take it personally. </p>
              <p>Why must we follow the swiss standard of living? I for one, do not hope that we end up like the swiss. Their law are much more petty than ours. Our chewing gum law are already laughable, but let them laugh, we need them in place anyway. Do check out on what laws that swiss have imposed. Give you some examples, after 10pm, if you are living in a flat, you cannot flush the toilet. With majority of us living in HDB flats, do you know how smelly and uncomfortable that would be? Also, you cannot wash your car on Sunday. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You like that? </p>
              <p>Got the above info from a friend who went to Switzerland to study. P.s. Their cost of living is sky high. You can try living there if your adjusted high pay can afford it. </p>
              <p>The last thing I would ever want Singapore to follow is the Western Economy. Look at how "well" they managed till they are in debt. Unemployment? 1 in 10 unemployed. Taxed payers money are washed down the drain with healthcare, wars and other miscellaneous stuff. My money used to pay for fireworks, I already so xim tia, you still want that to happen.</p>
              <p>As I said, you cannot increase income level as that would make us very uncompetitive, especially with many of us holding on to average skills. </p>
              <p>You want to talk about maids uh.</p>
              <p>Recently, The Philippines just raised their Foreign Domestic Workers (Maid) pay to at least USD $500. In SGD, that would make up to about $700++ (Go convert yourself). Who on earth would pay such an amount if they can get a same helper from Indonesia with a lower price tag? By doing so, they might inadvertently decrease their taxable amount as lesser people employs these maids. Furthermore, it would lead to an already high percentage of unemployment rife in the country. </p>
              <p>You sure you want Singapore to end up like that? </p>
              <p>You said in another post about Hong Kong. Their food is delicious and cost is comparable to Singapore. A standard Hong Kong Apartment (most of them staying in apartments) which is as big as our dear Seng Kang friends, Kitchen which by stretching your arm, everything is within your reach cost more than SGD$1 million. So what about the poor in Hong Kong? There are poor people every where right?</p>
              <p>Well, they are all congregated into an area called Sham Shui Po. These people living in miserably small flat, or some even better, cage house. Where all they have is a cage to their name. </p>
              <p>I would rather hope for the government is able to through tax, subsidies the cost of living. Even with $1000 pay per month. A family would be able to live comfortably without having to worry for not having a shelter over their head, and to worry about their next meal too. </p>

              <p>Haha. Somehow you made me laughed. Don't take it personally. </p>
              <p>Why must we follow the swiss standard of living? I for one, do not hope that we end up like the swiss. Their law are much more petty than ours. Our chewing gum law are already laughable, but let them laugh, we need them in place anyway. Do check out on what laws that swiss have imposed. Give you some examples, after 10pm, if you are living in a flat, you cannot flush the toilet. With majority of us living in HDB flats, do you know how smelly and uncomfortable that would be? Also, you cannot wash your car on Sunday. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You like that? </p>
              <p>Got the above info from a friend who went to Switzerland to study. P.s. Their cost of living is sky high. You can try living there if your adjusted high pay can afford it. </p>
              <p>The last thing I would ever want Singapore to follow is the Western Economy. Look at how "well" they managed till they are in debt. Unemployment? 1 in 10 unemployed. Taxed payers money are washed down the drain with healthcare, wars and other miscellaneous stuff. My money used to pay for fireworks, I already so xim tia, you still want that to happen.</p>
              <p>As I said, you cannot increase income level as that would make us very uncompetitive, especially with many of us holding on to average skills. </p>
              <p>You want to talk about maids uh.</p>
              <p>Recently, The Philippines just raised their Foreign Domestic Workers (Maid) pay to at least USD $500. In SGD, that would make up to about $700++ (Go convert yourself). Who on earth would pay such an amount if they can get a same helper from Indonesia with a lower price tag? By doing so, they might inadvertently decrease their taxable amount as lesser people employs these maids. Furthermore, it would lead to an already high percentage of unemployment rife in the country. </p>
              <p>You sure you want Singapore to end up like that? </p>
              <p>You said in another post about Hong Kong. Their food is delicious and cost is comparable to Singapore. A standard Hong Kong Apartment (most of them staying in apartments) which is as big as our dear Seng Kang friends, Kitchen which by stretching your arm, everything is within your reach cost more than SGD$1 million. So what about the poor in Hong Kong? There are poor people every where right?</p>
              <p>Well, they are all congregated into an area called Sham Shui Po. These people living in miserably small flat, or some even better, cage house. Where all they have is a cage to their name. </p>
              <p>I would rather hope for the government is able to through tax, subsidies the cost of living. Even with $1000 pay per month. A family would be able to live comfortably without having to worry for not having a shelter over their head, and to worry about their next meal too. </p>

              <p>widening income gap can be minimise but cannot eradicate totally.</p>

              <p>some of the ways include:</p>
              <p>1. taxing the rich more. to use the extra taxes to provide social benefits to the poor</p>

              <p>My fuhrer, let me challenge your points,</p>
              <p>1. Gst is mend to tax the rich and give it to the poor. The Rich spent more on Gst services products whereas the poors just go kopitiam and buy from nearby shops, then the poors get back to school vouchers, NTUC vouchers, bursaries, Conservative charges wavied and many others...</p>
              <p>2. Minimum wage is like setting a benchmarks, it does not allow a free labour market adjustment against the conditon of the economy. Being a country with no natural resources except some old uncles wisdom and grumbling, we are doom if we set a mini wage that cannot match a recession. And bear in mind that when u set a mini wage, it will goes up year by year, and in good time, it will go higher and higher, and it can hardly go down in bad times, our pay structure here is base on meritocracy, performance and contribution. Not simply just paid some lazy bums a wage just because the laws said so ya.</p>
              <p>3. Reduce foreign workers??? hello, do you know the statistic of old people in singapore, it is about 30% of the general singaporean citizens, and it is getting higher, if you remove foreign workers, do you think the locals can handle those physical jobs?? Do u want a old lady serving you, do you want a old man collecting rubbish or doing road work for you???..be realistic, our population are aging, we need foreign workers to help us..look at it this way, and you feel more comfortable with them.</p>

              <p><br>That is why I am smart, tho rich, i also go kopi tiam, Q up for roti prata, buy from small shop that do not have turnover of 1 million per year...therefore no Gst charges. In that way, become more richer, Govt provide the tax, it does not mean you have to pay for the tax, you can evade it, just like car, why go buy and pay Gst and COE?? take public transport or take non peakhr taxi or walk better lor.</p>
              <p>But the funny thing in singapore as i observed, unlike taiwan, the poors are spending more than the rich unneccessary, tho the rich spend, but they spend wisely, buy property, invest and buy what is necessary, the poors and middle class are the ones buying in orchard road and get taxed heavily, they are the one who go for car show room and pay COE, Gst and also installement to those financial loan centres. In the end, people start to grumble and cry foul of no money, high cost of living and all those nonsense, but they forget to ask themselves, are they living within their mean, are they spending wisely??? My goodness, look at those young one like me, drink $7++Gst per cup coffee at posh cafe down orchard road, me 0.70cents can liao...that is the different, hope u all get it. That is why i said, being trained in taiwan is different from sg youth</p>

Even got one boyfren who earn 5k per month at 22yo also say money not enough, buy fcuk fashion, spray Boss perfumes, drink at dlbO, outing at CQ, eat at posh restaurant, coffee at starbuck etc etc... sure lah, give you 10k also not enuf.</p>

              <p>Haha. I still think there is room for improvement for me in Singapore. I'm not chewing on some sour grapes here. But I think there are different pros and cons in each and every country. It depends on every individual. Some people like the laid back life they can live in Batam with their retired sum of money, while some people love living in a fast pace life still digging their gold mine. </p>
              <p>As much as I do not like some of the policies meted out by the Government, I still think I'm more suitable for the style of the Singapore system. </p>

              <p>But we can bridge the gap between them, so that they intermingle</p>
              <p>For starters, the rich and the poor can rub shoulders, each within their means, at supermarkets, shopping malls, restaurants, car parks, etc etc.</p>
              <p>Of course the rich can afford more, the poor just one taste.</p>

              <p>Already the rich have no qualms about driving their Mercedes to go and grab free text books.  The poor (taxidrivers, retirees etc) are paying $100 to gamble at the casinos and steal peoples chips.</p>
