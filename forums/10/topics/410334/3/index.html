              <p>Are you all jealous of the rich people money thats why some of you are trying to ask for government intervention to increase your pay so you can be on par with them? Sorry if this has offended anyone of you, this is what I have observed from some post where some people are pretty upset at rich people.</p>
              <p>These rich people can be rich is because they know how to manipulate the laws and policies, and most importantly, they know how to save and not think only for short term luxury. If the common people in the streets like us can adhere to such habits, you would be surprise at how rich you are. </p>
              <p>And many people living in pigeon hole HDB flats are quite well off. Just that they don't flaunt their wealth or waste on buying huge property. These people definitely didn't get rich by bugging the government to set a minimum wage in their job. </p>
              <p>Social unrest if through material wealth have to be seen accordingly. If the person is paid unjustifiably, such as being paid $2 per hour, then that person has a reason to be unhappy. However, if that person is feeling sore because he/ she is earning that miserable $3000 per month, while others who are in a higher post through hard work are earning $12000, then what can the government do? Push him up artificially to sit at some major position to earn that amount? </p>
              <p>If you are the boss, would you want to have minimum wage? Would you want to pay someone $2500 to do filing and basic admin work? I for one, would not want. </p>

              <p><br>The key word here is consumer, do you want to be the consumer that paid the most Gst?? or do you want to eat at hawker centre to forgo it?? In fact, the most people who are paying Gst, which is a government tax and not the rich profit, are the middle class and some lower class people, the likes of managers, engineers, lecturers, etc etc...these people spend the most on luxuries goods that command Gst.</p>

              <p>Base on your post, you dont know what is happening and you also probably have understanding problem.  Does it sound offensive??</p>
              <p>What most forumer here is not they are unhappy with the rich.  But the stagnant pay for the past many years because of the under cutting foreigners.  Yet cost of living is so much higher and instead of work and save, most are just meeting ends need.  Cost of new HDB Flats compare to 10 yrs ago had increased by more then 50%.  Usually young couple can buy a new HDB and pay with their CPF yet still have some left to save until 55 yrs old.  Now not only CPF remain zero until 55, sooner or later the newer generation will have to top up with cash for monthly repayment.  Since GST increased from 5 yo 7%, many things increased not just 2% but as much as 10% especially daily necessity and food.  Do you thing hawkers got GST? So when they buy their raw material they have to pay for the increase so they increase more then the 2%.  Like noodles from 2.50 increased to $3.  What percentage increased you calculate yourselve.</p>
              <p>Above are not new and if you dont know that so is time you start to learn, read and see more in another perspective instead of the control media news only.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I think you have forgotten or did not see what I have posted in the front. I do not support minimum wage. But I support the lowering of the cost of living in Singapore with the help of the government. I don't read those controlled media news. They don't provide a good source of information good or bad, maybe you can learn this from me. hahaha. </p>
              <p>Whatever it is, lowering the social gap between the rich and the poor is not about raising salary standard. If the person is really smart, you can never be on par with the rich person not matter how much the government bring in the income gap. Thus you might just gain an imaginary inflationary gain in your monetary status. Like that also shiok? Okay lor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Base on what you posted I did not misunderstand you.  And please read my post probably before you shoot.  I too did not claimed or in any of my post that support the idea of bridging the income gap. I too know this is not possible.  My concept is only to bring down the necessity cost.  So who had misunderstand.  If you have read sources from others rather then contorlled media, probably you had not read alot and how can this issue on the GST is such a big issue back then and you had not read any calculation??</p>
              <p>And I'm right also that you dont support minimum wages.  But I dont think your statement is right to say to lower the cost of living by the help of the government, GOV is not god, they are elected and this is their JOB as it is the voice of the ppl who voted them. </p>
              <p>I'm writing straight and I dont twist about like others who even twist the fact.  I just put down my thought and the fact I understand.  You may not agreed that is fine with me.  But when someone start shooting others just because they have different opinion, I am game for the shooting.  Just like Parn a foul mouth bit*h who shooting everyone just because of different thought.  You want to be one of this bit*h by all means. </p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Are you all jealous of the rich people money thats why some of you are trying to ask for government intervention to increase your pay so you can be on par with them?</span> Sorry if this has offended anyone of you, this is what I have observed from some post where some people are pretty upset at rich people.</p>
              <p>These rich people can be rich is because they know how to manipulate the laws and policies, and most importantly, they know how to save and not think only for short term luxury. If the common people in the streets like us can adhere to such habits, you would be surprise at how rich you are. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) And many people living in pigeon hole HDB flats are quite well off. Just that they don't flaunt their wealth or <strong>waste on buying huge property</strong>. These people definitely didn't get rich by bugging the government to set a minimum wage in their job.</span> </p>
              <p>Social unrest if through material wealth have to be seen accordingly. If the person is paid unjustifiably, such as being paid $2 per hour, then that person has a reason to be unhappy. However, if that person is feeling sore because he/ she is earning that miserable $3000 per month, while others who are in a higher post through hard work are earning $12000, then what can the government do? Push him up artificially to sit at some major position to earn that amount? </p>
              <p>If you are the boss, would you want to have minimum wage? Would you want to pay someone $2500 to do filing and basic admin work? I for one, would not want. </p>

              <p>1) Yes yes, Jealous of the rich we are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Each time I buy and sell property I earn $100k aud minus all other costs. I do that once every 1-2 years. Singapore's property market even better since Stamp Duty is alot lower. My mom was retired at the age of 31. Go figure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Minimum won't get me rich ... it just helps the poor.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We can never make the rich earn less, nor the poor earn more so that the incomes are more or less equal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But we can bridge the gap between them, so that they intermingle</span></p>
              <p>For starters, the rich and the poor can rub shoulders, each within their means, at supermarkets, shopping malls, restaurants, car parks, etc etc.</p>
              <p>Of course the rich can afford more, the poor just one taste.</p>

              <p>So common to find the typical mindset in Singaporeans youth. "I choose policy A because earn more $...you cannot make a living your taichi."</p>

              <p><br>and did you not see that i also said that lower income people also paid Gst, but on a lower scale, but if they want to pay more, that is up to them, as long as they can live within their mean and be happy. Let talk about powersupply bills, do you know that our landed property in joo chiat cost us about $700 per month and with Gst of 7% you go calculate it, and a HDB may cost the most $300 per month, so who is paying more Gst, and those rich property paid thousands of dollars in property tax, and HDB only a hundreds or 2 hundreds ++ and for those lower income living in 2 to 3 rooms, I bet there is a waiver.</p>
