              <p>Among the hottest topic in Singapore nowadays is the rising income gap in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Our Gini coefficient is one of the highest in the world.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, Finance Minister rebutted to Sylvia Lim's concerns about the high income gap in Singapore in Parliament by saying, "That's a good question but it can't be helped. Do you want to increase jobs first to improve the economy?"</p>
              <p>I'm pushing for an egalitarian society between social classes as a high income or social gap will lead to disunity in our society. The rich and elites will become too powerful so that they can hire and fire employees at their own discretion, causing high turnoverrates, therefore decreasing productivity.</p>
              <p>So offer your views on how we can decrease the income gap in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Do the Thaksin way by imposing a debt moratorium on the lower income group in Singapore? This was what he did to the rural areas of Thailand as he encouraged rural enterprises to spring up at better advantages. He improved GDP, yet also improved Gini coefficient. Praise to him!</p>

              <p>Actually as much as I hate to say. I feel that by lowering income gap, its really something that can't be help. If a Singaporean working as a cleaner, are you going to pay him almost near to someone who is a CEO? Then it does not reflect the meritocracy in our society. </p>
              <p>I would rather the government lower the standard of living, so that everyone, including the people who are struggling to live a stable life. </p>
              <p>Fallen-Angel said setting a minimum wage. By setting a minimum wage, you really would drive away investors or anyone who wants to set up a company. If company is not able to keep costs low, it eats into their profit margin, why would they take the trouble to set up a company? </p>
              <p>And by introducing minimum wage, I believe lower productivity would incur. After all, no matter how much effort is placed into, at the end of the day, the worker would still get that minimum amount, why then would he want to work hard? There isn't any motivation. Worse still, it could lead to a higher rate of unemployment. Companies would not want to hire these un-motivated individuals. </p>

              <p>So if you spend 1.5 times the amount of time as your peers to earn double of that of your peers?</p>
              <p>Coupled with you spending less $$ due to lesser time and motivation to do so...</p>
              <p>E.g. your peers start earning at $3k working 40 hours week, but you do OT and earn $6k working 60 hours week. They spend $2k and save $1k, but you spend $1.5k and save $4.5k monthly. Or perhaps earn $8k monthly working 80 hours week, and spend $1.5k too, saving $6.5k a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you considered rich or poor?</p>
              <p>To me, how much you earn depends on how much effort you put in life, all the way from the time you were in school till adult. I'm not counting those born with silver spoons in their mouths, and excluding those with born defects and really need help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what exactly are pple talking about poor and rich? Being compensated more for working harder and smarter and knowing how to play the system better... is that fair on unfair?</p>

              <p>tho Singapore had a social income gap disparity, as in many countries, our govt know how to bridge those gap by bringing the lower income in contact with what the rich can enjoy or even better. In socialogy, the alienation of poor leading to the uprising of revolt from them is usually due to a complete neglection and slavery treatment given by the rulers and the richs. How MM lay the foundation that prevent poor from alienation is really a Master Mind that most govt admired.</p>
              <p>1. By providing Jobs, which is the most basic need of every man</p>
              <p>2. By allowing the lower income to enjoy what the rich do, maybe in a lower scale</p>
              <p>3. By creating a living environment that is close to the rich and yet no far in qualities and facilities, eg private house alongside HDB and shopping areas.</p>

              <p>No minimum wage in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Diff to say what is market rate. Many western MNC pay you $4500 but every night work in the office till 10 pm, no OT. Japanese companies pay you $4000 and every night drink with customers till 12 mid nite. Singaporean companies pay $3500 and you go home by 7.  What is the market rate?</p>
              <p>In Singapore, many many non Asian companies. The american companies would pay you high salaries, work your guts out, and you may be out in the next restructuring, reorganizing, merging.....or simply to cut headcounts. The european companies won't pay you so much but are kinder when it comes to retrenchment. don't know about the oz coy.</p>
              <p>As for Asian companies. The jap never pay top of the range, but they take long term view, very few retrenchment, you can work there for life if you can tahan. Working for Taiwanese companies are like working for a family, boss is lao peh, he happy you get very high bonus, basic is often low. Ever work for the PRC or the korean?</p>
              <p>One thing in common, all companies, the top jobs are meant for their own nationals, that is why many people here only complaining about the pay for the low end job, minimum wage, hmmm.....singapore companies are probably an exception, next time our pm could be an FT.</p>
              <p>jobs and pays are up to the companies, good or bad depends on individuals. But when the companies make money, they should be taxed significantly for the people of their host country, not remit the money back home. when the economy is good, the government should use the money to keep the costs of living low for the benefit of the people who elected them, elite or no elite.</p>

              <p>Singapore did not impose minimum wage. However, if it is indeed imposed, companies who would like to save cost, would simply pay you that required amount, and expect you to do your job. Chances are, your pay won't  increase, no matter how much more time you put in, and how much more effort you increase. So why risk this? </p>
              <p>If you are capable, I don't see why companies would not fight to hire and pay you. A recent survey have shown that the current generation are only targeting to be average, and very few of them actually wanted to be the cream of the crop, the best of the best. With so many tom dick harry of the same capabilities around, why should these people pay more to hire you anyway? </p>
              <p>If government intervention is needed to decrease income disparity and have more "rich" people, or all of the same wealth, don't you think those people who don't deserve to be wealthy are the ones who are abusing the system? </p>
              <p>Speaking of FT. I rather the government put in place policies which ensures that Singaporeans are considered first before FTs. And every FTs who are employed, there would be tax payable. This should more or less deter them from employing the FTs. If Singaporeans are really not good enough to do my work, I would rather pay tax and get someone who can get my job done. Most importantly, keep the cost of living low, so even the poorest is able to lead a decent life. </p>

              <p>These "people" or should I say companies are only interested in $. Therefore if they can pay you the least amount they will. That's why you need unions/government to help ensure that companies do not take advantage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You need to understand that Singapore wants to achieve <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Swiss Standards/Western Economies</span> but hor with that mindset what you are suggesting is that the average joe should have low labour cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want Singapore to be Garuda Indonesia ah? One maid tie shoelace, one maid for massage, one maid to polish the 'H' on your Honda (seldom see Lolls Loyce in Sg). Maybe if we follow the mindset of cheaper,better,faster.... one day we might be able to employ a cohort of Singaporean maids. Why? Because Singapore labour is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SO CHEAP</span>. Just because someone does not want to excel means he must be paid peanuts meh? Is that humane? Meritocracy is good but take it to the extreme and its bad. Singapore labour cost continue to be cheap...your SG women will end up as ppls maid sia. Already rental from just my 1 house can hire 2 SG ah huay at $13-400 each or 3 Kopi Uncles to swat flies. You try in the Western Economies that Singapore 'Aspire' to be. 1 Maid dunno cost you how much sia. In Oz no one I've met so far HAS a maid. My parents used to know a Datuk (who sadly passed away), he has a maid (they call it caretaker), part time only like 8-5. 4k+ Aud a month. How many Ah Huays in Sg will queue for it? And you want your women to be cheaper lol. You want them go Geylang parade? $40. I can hire a troupe of them for the 45 mins to be in my circus Lol. After that happens.... when you go overseas.... you gonna tell the angmoh with pride that your country is Swiss Standard? He will say its Bang Cock standard sia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tell you sumthing about the Ang Moh whores here hor. $10k Aud a week. $150-200 Aud half hour. What your typical Ah Huay in Emporium earns in half a year.</p>
