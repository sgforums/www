            <div class='col-md body'>Do we want to be No 1 for population density?<br>Letter from JOHN LUCAS<br><br>With a population of 4.48 million people, Singapore is ranked fourth in the world for population density, and this is only slightly less than Hong Kong's.<br>.<br>Almost everyone will agree that overcrowding degrades the quality of life.<br>.<br>Waiting in line for a long time, waiting in traffic, or not being able to find a place to park do not add to the quality of life. In the past couple of years, it has become almost impossible to find a parking space at any shopping centre in Singapore during the weekend. The same is true at the East Coast Park, Botanic Gardens and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.<br>.<br>Take a stroll through West Mall on a weekend, and you will see the extent of overcrowding. Once the casino, hotels and private homes are finished on Sentosa Island, VivoCity will be also be filled to the brim.<br>.<br>Buses and the MRT are jammed with commuters for hours during the morning and evening peak hours, and car traffic is already very heavy.<br>.<br>Can you imagine what it will be like when the population increases to 6 million people? All these problems will worsen, but it will be too late then, and the result will be some very undesirable conditions.<br>.<br>I am bewildered why people do not express their concern at the push for a bigger population. The financials that will come with a population of 6 million people may be sound, but the cost to the quality of life may not make that justifiable.<br>.<br>Singapore is already breaking financial records worldwide, so does it really need to push harder? Do we really want to be number one for population density?<br><br>Geylang is going to be the next PRC village. Malay village is disappearing very soon when population reach the 6 millions.</div>
