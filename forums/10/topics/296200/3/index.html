Are you referring to another thread (http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=292749) which I am still awaiting your clarifications </span></div></blockquote>I think the voice of people in this forum are speaking up it does not want to be assimilated into a totally Chinese culture even though it is Chinese majority.<br><br>And yes it is both the government dictate and most importantly allowing Singaporean to evolve.<br><br>I believe Â“officiallyÂ” recognized ethnic groups within PRC  56 groups.  But I do believe u canÂ’t just stop there without considered that china has 5000 years to evolve in all characteristics of a homogenous multi ethinic group that range from political, foreign influence, language to everyday social interaction.<br><br>There are dialectic groups that are spoken differently but share written roots characters.  Their holidays reflect its rich history they did not come up with national holidays that are foreign in origin. And I am sure there are many more to bring about a characteristics of a nation.<br><br>If you review China in both modern and old history, with all foreign influence, did they ever come up a 2nd or 3rd foreign language in China?<br>China has also managed to assimilate most foreigners that creep into its territorial. That in itself reflect social behavior of a higher culture abilities to bring about conformance and assimilation of a weaker social structure society.<br><br>ThatÂ’s why I bring about  SG is just an experiences as sg history does not have depth. There is a risk of being cannibalized socially<br><br>Singapore run a different platform altogether, The psyche of a nation that start up recognizing and accepting it as a multi ethnic society. At least in Â“principleÂ” it accept, irregardless of gov practice, by stating itself as a multi racial society, it does not assimilate but seek acceptance of status quo and seek mutual respect. Its education and socially it recognized different races, and preservation of the differences.<br><br>Does it evolved. Yes.   Intermarriages and many different nationalities mingle,  generations down will choose and decide how Sg will evolved probably to a more homogenous groups that is closer to its geographical location if Singapore exist.<br><br>The Wen issue in this context of culture is not so much of Â“WhatÂ” he said? But Â“WhyÂ” he even bother to bring the subject of Culture into power play.  The Chinese for decade have play cold war politics in the UN with the US and Soviet. They know the  international game more than LHL.<br><br>Culturally if you want to consider the application of using relationship and ethnic ties to bend its influence on Singapore and  applying conformance, is how chinese communicate  or is it just a tactics to achieve WenÂ’s political objectives. And I am saying it is more of a tactics than a culturally  move.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

But I do believe u canÂ’t just stop there without considered that china has 5000 years to evolve in all characteristics of a homogenous multi ethinic group that range from political, foreign influence, language to everyday social interaction. </blockquote><span style="color: brown;">Correction.<br>There is no such thing as "homogenous multi ethnic" group. You can either not both at the same time.<br>As I already had said, China is not homogeneous (read "multi ethnic") country.<br>It had never been this way. Even the Chinese historian and current government acknowledge the ethnic diversity of China. What you see in "commonest" of Chinese is a shared history and a common written system which itself had evolved over time. No one says you should "speak" Mandarin in a certain manner or must-covert to "Chinese"...etc.</span><br><br><blockquote><br>If you review China in both modern and old history, with all foreign influence, did they ever come up a 2nd or 3rd foreign language in China? China has also managed to assimilate most foreigners that creep into its territorial. That in itself reflect social behavior of a higher culture abilities to bring about conformance and assimilation of a weaker social structure society.<br></blockquote><span style="color: brown;">Nope.  There had never been a "foreign language" in China.<br>Why? Coz there are already many ethnic minorities and dialects groups, nor does China attempts policy of "assimilation" as you had asserted. Please provide a historical reference which sugguest "assimilation" in the Chinese history.<br><br>As for your concept of "higher culture abilities" overtaken by "weaker social structure society", that is a cruel fact evolution in human civilisaiton and its culture. Overtime, certain less-prosperour and estabished langaug, culture or praceticves will be lost. This is unavoidable and occurs since the earliest time.</span><br><br><blockquote><br>ThatÂ’s why I bring about  SG is just an experiences as sg history does not have depth. There is a risk of being cannibalized socially<br></blockquote><span style="color: brown;">Again, I am trying to decypher your statement. What's "cannibalized socially"???</span><br><br><blockquote><br>The Wen issue in this context of culture is not so much of Â“WhatÂ” he said? But Â“WhyÂ” he even bother to bring the subject of Culture into power play.  The Chinese for decade have play cold war politics in the UN with the US and Soviet. They know the  international game more than LHL.<br></blockquote><span style="color: brown;">You had read to much into a simple reference to Chinese history as in "culture". Hope I am wrong, but I see a tint of sino-phobia here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>This is relate to another thread which I am still awaiting clarificaiton from you to Wen's comment during his visit.<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=292749" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=292749</a></span><br><br><blockquote><br>Culturally if you want to consider the application of using relationship and ethnic ties to bend its influence on Singapore and  applying conformance, is how chinese communicate  or is it just a tactics to achieve WenÂ’s political objectives. And I am saying it is more of a tactics than a culturally  move.</blockquote><span style="color: brown;">Ah! All nations are motivated to make polictical/tactical/strategic maneuves to enhance one's own survival and self-interest. That is taken.<br>However, each nation approach differs and is dependent how each nation sees itself in the world and Global perception of a given country. You can observe that in public words used by a US President, the Chinese Premier, or any other HOS. They have a speicifc agenda to make and share.<br><br>If I were to take your suggestion that Wen's reference to Chinese history as a "tactic", then what you observed is  "Soft Power" in action.<br><br>That "Soft power" projection had worked well for Beijing since 97'  financial crisis in Asia and become more effective globally since post-9/11 when Bush administration squendered their moral potential after they screwed up on Iraq and their so-called anti-terrorism policies.<br><br>US has aliened many of her allies from UK to Australia.<br><br>You can't say the same for China at this juncture.<br><br>So will Singaproe be "colonised" by China? I don't think so.<br><br>Just ask the Australian new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN42pk7eozk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN42pk7eozk</a></span></div>
