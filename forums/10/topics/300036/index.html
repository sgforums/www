            <div class='col-md body'>I thought i quote some points as a reference to think about<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s great strength, then, is also its weakness.  From the very beginning, children who use Singapore Math are taught that everything they learn can be used (right away!) to solve a problem.  This develops the habit of looking for solutions, rather than groping for formulas.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s  method of immediately using a new skill for problem solving is inevitably going to frustrate some children.  Especially in the early years, many children NEED rote repetition of skills BEFORE they are able to put those skills into use.  For these children, SingaporeÂ’s method will not be as effective as SaxonÂ’s.  Although the classical model is not intended as a straitjacket, it does suggest that most young children are not yet capable of thinking critically and/or abstractly<br><br>The Singapore method leads children into Â“logic stageÂ” thinking much earlier than other programs.  If you try Singapore and your child is frustrated, this probably signals a maturity problem; set the program aside and come back to it in a year.<br><br>Generally, I could wish that the Singapore materials provided a little more explanation when introducing new skills.  The explanations given are generally clear, but not lengthy; if a certain skill doesnÂ’t Â“clickÂ” with the student, you will have to think of a new way to present the information yourself.  Also, the explanations are often given in pictures rather than in words, which may bother some parents who would prefer to have written explanations on how to teach the concept.  (Incidentally, the Sonlight description of Singapore Math says, Â“Some students who are not good at math have problems with what they perceive as a lack of adequate review and drill.Â”<br><br></div>
