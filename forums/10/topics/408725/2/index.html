              <p>My point was not to say that everything is fine with my uncle. Sure he doesnt drive a car of his own. Sure he doesnt have investments in stocks, shares. He doesnt have alot of savings. But my point is, it is absolute crap for those people who says it is expensive to raise a kid in Singapore. What they should say, it is expensive to raise a kid and still want to live a life of luxury. It is a matter of expectations. If you want a kid, you would sacrifice alot of things for the kid, nothing can stop you. If my uncle can raise a kid, why cant these graduates do so?</p>

              <p>Hey, my father managed to put me thru University. So what makes
              you think a delivery driver cannot put his kids thru Uni? The only
              regret my uncle has is he could not have a second kid cos he would
              not be able to manage. But this kid he has, he has already plans
              for her to at least manage to put her thru Uni. Dun ask me how, for
              the sake of his kid, he eat lesser, smoke lesser, he will do it,
              its a matter of whether he is willing or not.</p>
              <p>I am 33 and I am an university graduate. I work in a very big
              MNC and in middle management. Should I expect better from the
              government to make it easier for me to get married, have kids, buy
              a HDB or condo, a big car and still can go for holidays?</p>
              <p>I tell you something, I EXPECT big things from myself and thus I
              EXPECT MYSELF to go get it because begging someone, expecting
              someone to do it for me will not ever cut it, we will just get
              disappointed and we will forever blame someone else for our own
              inability to get what we need and want.</p>
              <p>But as you said, to each his own, i have no time to care how
              someone else choose to do with his time but I know what I can do
              with mine.</p>
              <p>Are you married with kids?</p>

              <p>i think the word affordability is subjective.</p>
              <p>some couples i know of are not willing to make sacrifices in their personal indulges and complain about no money to have kids. they drive a 1.6l car, wife go to nail spa, hai spa, facial spa every mth, hubby spent money buying car accessories.</p>
              <p>gasband, i had seen ppl like your uncles, spent within their means, yet can live a decent life.</p>
              <p>some ppl i know of, include myself, give up personal hobbies, eating less at resturants, cutting personal expenses, to raise a family and kids. if you have a wife that work with you towards that objective, you will live a happy life.</p>

              <p>that's a unrealistic statistics, the more appropriate reason it because of the influx of nice, young and sexy PRC gals, Viet gals, Philipinos gals and others.

              <p>the crux of the issue is, as highlighted during my very early posts, not actually the high costs of living but a lot of other complicated issues...mainly on security. </p>
              <p>the liabilities on men are so much higher than in the past....that is one of the main concerns for not getting committed...after so many cases of divorce favouring women side....</p>
              <p>others are rising expectations that culminate into "commercial" than true love .people are finding that marriage is only a piece of recycled paper....recyclable again with higher hopes till there is no perfect destination....giving it unlimited choices esp for women without any financial obligations or liabilities of marriage and divorce...</p>
              <p>this is an overlooked side effects and the irreversible mistake that the government deliberately ignores due to the sensitivity of women charter.... thinking subsidies and other dating programs would just help to resolve it...its not hitting on the true problems as abovementioned...</p>
