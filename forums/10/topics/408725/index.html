Answers users feel that the Singapore government’s plan to launch a new dating campaign for singles will not work.<br><br>A government tender was put out last week for a new month-long campaign to encourage love-shy singles to start dating in the hope it will eventually help boost Singapore’s low birth rate.<br><br>But almost all the 72 respondents who responded to the question we posed on Yahoo! Answers, “Do single Singaporeans need another dating campaign?” believe the government push will not work because it will still have failed to tackle a key issue: the high cost of raising a child.<br><br>Yahoo! user Lily lamented that it less about finding a partner but more about the rising cost of living.<br><br>“Getting married is a huge responsibility. Considering the standard of living in this country is very high, getting married also means that they need to save more money for their future use such as their children’s education, basic necessities such as clothes, food,” she said.<br><br>“If it requires both parents working overtime to support the family and live a ‘comfortable’ life, then they might as well not get married because they hardly get to spend much time with their children and they leave the job of taking care of the children to their maid,” she added.<br><br>ylime agrees: “Everyone’s too busy thinking about money, and we can’t help it. Because the moment you open your eyes in the morning, the bill meter starts.”<br><br>Former television actor Nathaniel Ho (@iamnatho), 25, also tweeted in response to the question and said, “In a nutshell, it’s too expensive to settle down. People want big weddings and HDB, sitting on a mountain of debt before their life starts together.”<br><br>A growing number of career-minded singles are also increasingly comfortable being self-sufficient.<br><br>Yahoo! user, nGin, a Singaporean single in her 30s, confessed: “As a Singaporean female in my thirties, why would I want to get married and invest my hard-earned money into some else (such as spouse, children and family) when I could splurge on my own luxury indulgences?<br><br>“Why would I reduce my chances of career promotion without the ability to outlast my competitive colleagues who can work more overtime and put in that extra bit of effort that has to come with quantitative contribution in the office?” she asked.<br><br>But a few commended the government’s latest effort to play Cupid.<br><br>Another user Kheng Oon Ang said, “Knowing our government, they cannot sit back and do nothing. If they can succeed in helping one couple, it is better than nothing. Every couple counts, so just give them some credit in trying.”<br><br>SComments perhaps summed it up best when he said: “The government needs to put REAL incentives in to make this work, not just another measly campaign. If money is the reason they (couples) are not getting married, having kids, then make MONEY the incentive… reward Singaporeans for having children and bearing the cost of raising up kids and career sacrifices.”<br><br>In light of this, Yahoo! Singapore hit the streets to ask young singles what they thought of the government’s plan for a new dating campaign.</p></div>

              <p>Yup, I fully agree that the very first step to be tackled is the high cost of living in SG first. Otherwise, no matter what campaign they come up with will fail.</p>

              <p>The cost of living is tagged to the companies that ah gong set up.</p>
              <p>So, the livelihood of these company are more important as the croonies bonus are linked to the individual company profit.</p>
              <p>As for the campaign, they know it will be a failure.</p>
              <p>At least they have done their job to encourage people to get marry.</p>
              <p>It is the fault of the people that chose not to marry and thus causing low birth rate and ageing population.</p>
              <p>This eventually support their foreign invasion project.</p>

But my uncle is a delivery driver with auntie as a housewife. He has a flat. And his daughter is doing well. Sure they are not rich, sure they are not as if they are always this comfortable. But my uncle still can smoke, still got money to buy 4D, still can afford a LCD TV, still can have Soundbar, still have has a house, still has a job and still is able to raise his daughter well. Is it difficult to raise a kid in Singapore? Of cos not easy, when was it ever easy? Even during my Father's time also not easy but did they complain? They work hard, they sacrifice for the sake of their children. My father worked so hard  for us that until the day he died, he has never even gone on a trip to Malaysia cos he never even owned a passport. So what do you want government or people to do? Promise you that after you had a kid, the government will promise to give u a condo, BMW and 3 holiday trips a year? Nonsense.</p></div>

              <p>Look, you can't have the best of both worlds do you? I mean afterall yes marriage is once-in-a-lifetime, it is ok to have it grand, But you have to look after your future 'nest', because that is where you have your family and stuff.</p>

              <p>High cost of living, can also marry. Two people can share the high cost of living. Ten people live together, can even lower the high cost of living further. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>If you take out a loan of $162,000 for 30 years, you will have
              to pay $7,843.55 a year (approx. $653.63 a month).</p>
              <p>After your CPF contribution, your take home pay becomes $1,600,
              assuming you are paying off your housing loan by CPF, you still
              need to deduct $254 from your take home pay of $1,600 which leaves
              you $1,346 to pay for electricity, transport, food, baby milk,
              education, books, medical expenses, phone bills, clothes,
              shoes, electrical appliances, soap, shampoo, toothbrush,
              toothpaste, haircut, dental, HDB S&amp;C, Radio &amp; TV
              licence, etc.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You sure $1,346 is enough for a family of 3 these days? What are
              you smoking? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you allocate $5 per meal for each person, it would cost you

              <p>My point was not to say that everything is fine with my uncle. Sure he doesnt drive a car of his own. Sure he doesnt have investments in stocks, shares. He doesnt have alot of savings. But my point is, it is absolute crap for those people who says it is expensive to raise a kid in Singapore. What they should say, it is expensive to raise a kid and still want to live a life of luxury. It is a matter of expectations. If you want a kid, you would sacrifice alot of things for the kid, nothing can stop you. If my uncle can raise a kid, why cant these graduates do so?</p>

              <p>Hey, my father managed to put me thru University. So what makes you think a delivery driver cannot put his kids thru Uni? The only regret my uncle has is he could not have a second kid cos he would not be able to manage. But this kid he has, he has already plans for her to at least manage to put her thru Uni. Dun ask me how, for the sake of his kid, he eat lesser, smoke lesser, he will do it, its a matter of whether he is willing or not.</p>
              <p>I am 33 and I am an university graduate. I work in a very big MNC and in middle management. Should I expect better from the government to make it easier for me to get married, have kids, buy a HDB or condo, a big car and still can go for holidays?</p>
              <p>I tell you something, I EXPECT big things from myself and thus I EXPECT MYSELF to go get it because begging someone, expecting someone to do it for me will not ever cut it, we will just get disappointed and we will forever blame someone else for our own inability to get what we need and want.</p>
              <p>But as you said, to each his own, i have no time to care how someone else choose to do with his time but I know what I can do with mine.</p>

              <p>ok chill man, I have never said your uncle cannot put his kid thru to uni. Pls read again. And if you bring up your own example, I assume it means ur daddy did not earn much too? Well good for you that you are doing fine but being middle management in a big MNC is quite common for someone on the other side of his 30s.</p>
              <p>And I dun expect the govt to provide me with life's luxuries...who in his right mind does that? lol</p>
              <p>To bounce of minister vivian a little, do you expect your kid to have food in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant? There you already different categories....and if you don't mind giving your kid 2nd or 3rd best, I guess there shouldn't really be any issue. To each his own philosophy.</p>
