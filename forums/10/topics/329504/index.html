              <p>Singaporeans are Singaporeans.  It's all about the money. </p>
              <p>Serangoon Garden residents are signing petitions against setting up a foreign workers dormitory near their residences simply because the presence of foreign workers is going to depress their property prices. </p>
              <p>On the flip side, I can imagine the residents welcoming a large foreign expat community like in Holland village cos that would build up a "upscale" image for the area and project an upscale image and hence prime property value.</p>

              <p>i believe is not the races tat concern of this foriegn workers? more like their profession n public behaviour?</p>
              <p>Chinatown u can see many PRC women hanging around too.</p>
              <p>But there are also many foreign expats rom china, india, blangha, ang mo, etc.. which are professionals and well manners here.</p>
              <p>probably the social behaviour of the foreign expats and foreign workers around affect the property value.. either way?</p>

              <p><br>All rubbish and dish collection at food centres are to be given to Singaporeans as the first priorty. Last time u can see many ah neh doing cleaning and rubbish collection jobs, and our older singaporeans were left with no jobs, after much appeal, the govt agreed that such jobs should be given to Singapore uncles and aunties first, however physical jobs like taking whole rubbish bins is still belong to ah neh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other reason for not allowing ah neh and bangalas to doing housing areas cleaning is to prevent resident maids getting pregnant and other sex problems</p>
