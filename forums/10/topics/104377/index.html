            <div class='col-md body'>actually there are more in malaysia, right now the authorities there are struggling to grapple with it.<br><br>According to my cousin a malaysian he says during the early nineties when malaysia was booming his government initiated a lot of infrastructure projects(which you see today).<br><br>Many of these projects where built using cheap and illegal labor from indonesia, thousands upon thousands built bridges, highways, airports and huge complexes. But in a twist it was tolerated cause was rumoured that petty officials "took a piece of the action" hence developers cut corners on both labor and building materials(which you see the problems today)<br><br>But when the projects were completed officials didn't bother to send them back instead let them stay on in malaysia so today they have a 300,000 illegal immigrant problem on their hands  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to refine the term. Overdue Immigrant and Illegal Immigrant<br><br>The actual figure is close to a million inclusive sabah and sarawak. Those illegal immigrant on m'sia construction site mostly are not offically going through procedure to hire them. Most of the are self sneak into m'sia and they hold no passport or valid passes. And most of them are NOT Overdue Immigrant which has valid pass but expires after the construction finishes or being brought in by those contractors.<br><br>Contractor every likes to reap more more profits. It has nothing to do with m'sia government. M'sia government are "big hand" on giving out project cos mostly those related personnel got it. Every one is m'sia know this. You got a government project, you are fat rich.<br><br>Not like spore government who are very calculative on projects. Lots of HDB and contractors got stuck up because no full payment are released them and their profits is low as sg government already calculate how much u are ought to earn.</div>
