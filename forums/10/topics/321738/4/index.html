              <p><br>do you understand the meaning of "subsidy" and a petrol "tax" sparring?</p>
              <p>subsidy is when something cost $1 in the markets, but you subsidise $0.20 to make it cheaper.</p>
              <p>whereas taxing is when the cost of petrol is $1.00, you tax it with $0.40 to make it more expensive.</p>
              <p>right now the citizens are not asking for subsidy, they are asking for the government to estoppel the petrol tax.</p>
              <p>can you differentiate it now?</p>
              <p>aren't we glad you are not the finance minister, you will probably tax anything and everything that is stationery or moves.</p>

              <p>Secondly, the petrol tax is, as the government put it, meant to "curtail Singaporeans' excessive usage of petrol." However, times are different now.

              <p>When does a tax becomes a subsidy?</p>
              <p>Ans. When that tax had been around long enough to be depended as revenue to fund social programmes. If without these tax monies, some social programmes may be curtailed or underfunded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example:- there are est.500,000 cars in Spore. Straits Times, sat, oct 20, 2007</p>
              <p>Avg km/car per year = 20,000km ( 15,000 to 25,000)</p>
              <p>litres used         = 1,666litres ( base of avg 12km/litre)</p>
              <p>Fuel tax received = 1,666 X $0.40cts X 500,000 cars (40cts per litre)</p>
              <p>                        = $333.2 million</p>
              <p>These are only rough figures, would be lesser if based on previous years car population.</p>
              <p>But still, it is an est $300million tax which is not going into some politician's pocket, but for social funding, such as maintenance of smooth roads, MRT works and projects, traffic lights, road signs, etc, etc, for the other 3million non-car owner citizens who use such roads to go to work, school and recreation.</p>
              <p>If we cut away this tax, we will have lost one revenue for such works and will have to dig into our reserves. Thus it becomes our society must subsidize car owners, as they are the heaviest users of our roads ( being that a space 5m long sits only 1 person compared to public transport of 8-10 persons on the same space).</p>
              <p>Similarly, GST can be called a subsidy instead of tax, because our cents paid to gst are used to subsidise other citizens for social programmes.</p>
              <p>Do remember that we own no natural resources. We don't have any royalties significant enough to collect from. All we have to help our fellow citizens for this generation and the next are taxes, as the previous generation had done.</p>
              <p>Such taxes are not crippling, as it is based on free will and not forced. But if all cry out for tax to be removed and give more handouts, then Either we crawl back to Msia for economic support and speak Bahasa Msia or we help one another to maintain our independence and multi-racism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: However, the issue here is that cutting away the tax or subsidy will only help oil price to raise. Simple economics. Although the amount we use is small as compared to heavy users such as China or USA, but if every nation big or small thinks their amounts are insignificant and don't do anything, oil price will continue to climb where no oil price had gone before! </p>

              <p><br>It seems that no one in the world can stop the oil hikes except the oil people themselves.  So, no government appears to be doing wrong. This leads me to assume that they have nothing to do with price hikes. They appear innocent.</p>
              <p>But why is it that oil companies are not taxed more given their revenue sky rocketed?</p>
              <p>Is it not true that oil companies revenue sky rocketed? Not true that middleeast people are driving bigger oil guzzling cars now than before?</p>
