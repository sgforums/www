              <p>Lastly, the petrol tax is there to help the poor. The "poor" poodles that nothing behind their ear and cannot differentiate tax and subsides.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is only simple economics. <strong>The rise in price of oil is largely due by demand. The more people use oil, the higher it will rise. Only by curbing its demand, will oil price falls.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a crucial need to seek alternative energy uses. Fortunately, Singapore has the funds to do so, except that such technologies are not avaliable yet. However, in the case of energy for cars, conversion to CNG is a viable option.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our country survived today and not crippled was due to the hard work and frugal ways of our previous generation and govt. The govt can easily play populist measures and even lower petrol taxes and everything else.</p>
              <p>But then, our next generations will be the ones who will suffer with even higher prices of depleting resources. Our society had always, always thought far and never to neglect or mortgage the next generation's future, and we are not about to do so. Thus the need for funds to find alternative energy resources, quickly. And for that, we need more intelligent people properly compensated to do research and find solutions.</p>

              <p>  Please la... The economy is nt as simple as just Demand-supply zzz. You forgot the fact that petrol is a necessity, it is something majority cannot do without. As such its demand will probably be price inelastic, meaning that an increase in its price will lead to a less than proportionate decrease in the quantity demanded. Therefore,(though it is nt incorrect to say that keeping the price high will facilitate the reduction of petrol consumption), we do hv the right to question its effectiveness and whether it is the most viable method. </p>

              <p>Hallo,</p>
              <p>No offence, I suppose singapore is based on democracy?</p>
              <p>So, the majority have chosen them for , as I was told, the last almost 50 years?</p>
              <p>Wow, that is rare in Europe. Of course, we all know that britain has kings and queens and monarchy since at least the middle-ages. But then, that is another topic altogether. </p>
              <p>I guess this singapore phenomenon is really worth a few Oxford / Cambridge Doctorate level thesis'es to study the management style , how it works and the people's psychology, mentality, culture, the opposition scene. To learn why it is such a unique form of democracy .</p>
              <p>This system is an invention, I am sure. I am really amazed by singapore.</p>

              <p>Let us see if there are any more quotes from the ruling party to compete with the above.    For the moment, shall award mbt as the joker pap member of the year and see if any of his ruling party member beats him to get this award.</p>
              <p>The gahmen have been pushing for more people taking the public transport for months already and I believe shorty said the above is to encourage more and more people to take public transport.    But still, I don't understand he can't differentiate between taxes and subsidy.   </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you attempting to mischeviously divert attention from the obvious flaw in a statement that is clearly not so clever ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If my information is from residing in a rubbish bin, your dubious knowledge must surely be a result from living in a mansion sized garbage bin.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there social spending when the Government insist that Singaporeans should not be dependent on this as a crutch ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Whatever social spending that exist, are the services paid for by the Government at no charge to the citizens, or are the citizens made to pay for such services at prices that result in additional profit to the Government ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Oil is exported by the Oil Companies at prices determined by the global mechanism, with the Singapore Government imposing annual corporate tax on the annual profits of the Oil Companies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Oil is a commodity that is nationalized by most countries. Their own companies are state owned. Those private companies that existed before nationalization have to pay hefty royalties to continue their operations in those countries. I can write out the entire pricing and tax mechanisims, but that would be allowing you to laze. Go to the library and find your answers how the premiums are derived at, but do have a shower first, for you stink, espacially comming from a rubbish bin.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">To make it simple and cast off your smokes that tried cloud the issue, premiums are the over and above costs of oil that a country can get from exports, on the litre.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is sheer nonsense that Singapore do not have enough land, .....for "appropriate" market prices before the URA release the land for development - {adding fuel to the hot property market}.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">That's nonsense to you, who live in a rubbish bin, but a reality for many, who faces high land costs and traffic congestion.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is clear by now that you are only able to see what the Government tell you to see, and know what you need to know.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you qualified even to know if I live in a rubbish bin, when the Government has dumped you into a $27 garbage bin that you picked for yourself from some limited selection offered to you ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are they not similarly affected by Petrol Tax that affect the commercial activities - the prices of goods and services traded ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This Government had forced the previously owned Private Bus Companies to fold by refusing any increases to the fares requested, and which allowed this Government to shamelessly nationalise the Public Transport Services claiming it to be more efficiently operated under one umbrella.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the mind of a juvenile, surely the shopkeeper must have pulled a fast one on you - if the price for rubbish bin has not gone up due to oil, was it made of steel ?</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has
              said the government cannot reduce petrol taxes despite the soaring
              oil prices.<br>
              <br>
              He warned against taking the subsidy route, noting that even
              countries like China and Malaysia have started to re-think their
              policies on this.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Mah was speaking on the sidelines of a community event on
              Saturday.<br>
              <br>
              As pump prices here continue to rise, some Singaporeans are
              wondering why the government is not stepping in to cushion the
              impact by cutting petrol taxes.<br>
              <br>
              The government has always maintained that petrol duty - currently
              about 40 cents for every litre - is meant to promote public
              transport and curb excessive use of cars.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Mah said: "If you price it wrongly, if you subsidise anything,
              people will tend to use it more or people will tend not to use it
              as efficiently as possible and that is going to raise the demand.
              Once you raise the demand, I think that is in turn going to cause
              prices to go up even higher."<br>
              <br>
              So instead of lowering taxes, Mr Mah said Singapore's strategy is
              to change habits and attitudes to cut down on energy
              consumption.<br>
              <br>
              "If you are a motorist, how do you cut down (energy consumption)?
              Reduce the number of trips, if possible. Car pool, if possible.
              Better still, take public transport," he said.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Mah was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a dialogue
              session with Tampines residents.<br>
              <br>
              To help reduce energy costs at the township level, he said, the
              Tampines Town Council is looking at replacing all lights in common
              areas with energy-saving ones.<br>
              <br>
              The chit-chat session was instituted two years ago as a way for Mr
              Mah, who is the Tampines Grassroots Organisation adviser, to meet
              residents in a more informal and smaller setting.<br>
              <br>
              Hence, a lot of municipal issues were raised, one of which was the
              issue of safety in the light of the recent spate of molest cases in
              the neighbourhood. To address this, Mr Mah said the town council
              will seriously look into installing CCTV cameras in blind spots and
              secluded areas around the neighbourhood. - CNA/ir</span></p>
