              <div class="snippet">KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Bernama) -- <strong>Malaysia's nuclear</strong> power programme can start with a small <strong>nuclear</strong> power plant as a power demonstrator reactor before <strong>...</strong></div>
              <blockquote>Malaysia's nuclear power programme can start with a small nuclear power
              plant as a power demonstrator reactor before larger and more
              cost-competitive plants are built, the Science, Technology and
              Innovation Ministry said Monday.<br> <br> "This was the approach taken by Japan, which started with a power
              demonstration reactor generating only 13 megawatts of electricity from
              1963 to 1982 before building 53 larger plants with capacities of
              between 340 and 1,300 megawatts," said deputy minister Fadillah Yusof.<br> <br> "Despite being the only country in the world that has suffered the
              devastating effects of nuclear radiation, nuclear energy now supplies
              almost 30 percent of Japan's total electricity requirements," Fadillah
              said.<br> <br> He represented the minister Datuk Dr Maximus Ongkili in delivering the
              opening keynote address at International Nuclear Conference 2009, which
              is being held at the Putra World Trade Centre here from today until
              July 1.<br> <br> Earlier this month, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said
              Malaysia was keen to emulate South Korea in developing a small-scale
              nuclear reactor for power generation as it was more economical.<br> <br> This, he said, was because South Korea had an edge over other countries
              in terms of technology for small-scale nuclear reactors with 40 percent
              of the country's power needs coming from various types of nuclear
              reactors.<br> <br> Najib said the small-scale nuclear reactor was considered safe and
              could be built next to an urban area that needed electric power.<br> <br> It could generate between 200,000 and 300,000 kilowatts of energy, he
              said during his first official visit to South Korea as prime minister.<br> <br> Fadillah said efforts to support nuclear technology applications,
              especially for nuclear electricity generation, required the relevant
              legal framework and regulatory provisions to be further developed,
              including the streamlining of licensing processes involving various
              regulatory agencies.<br> <br> "Human capital development efforts should also be enhanced through the
              establishment of appropriate academic and training programmes at the
              university level as well as professional and sub-professional levels,"
              he said.<br> <br> International, regional and bilateral cooperation should also be expanded to support these development initiatives, he added.<br> <br> Another critical component is the research and development
              infrastructure required to support the nuclear power programme,
              according to Fadillah.<br> <br> For this, the infrastructure that has been developed by the Malaysian
              Nuclear Agency should be expanded and used by all relevant agencies,
              including academic institutions and industries, so as to avoid
              duplication of efforts, he said.<br> <br> "Even though nuclear technology is not indigenous to Malaysia, the
              necessary capabilities can be developed, just as how the country once
              became the world's leading producer of rubber and palm oil even though
              these commodities were not indigenous our country," Fadillah said.<br> <br> -- BERNAMA</blockquote>
