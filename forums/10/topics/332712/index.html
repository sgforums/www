              <p>Like, designating a speaker's corner, (The right to speak freely is our natural birthright and even that has to be decided by the government??

              <p>you have the right to speak freely. but like some guy said, "your freedom to wave your fist ends at where my nose begins." just don't slander or create trouble, no one will disturb you. you can speak whatever you want on the road, in the coffee shop, in the shopping mall, as long as you don't make a scene.</p>
              <p>but organizing a protest that is going to create trouble is a no go. the setting up of the speaker's corner is the government attempt to get people to speak up. cause in those days, people don't really want to express their views</p>

              <p>i don't think people are powerless to that extent, but i do agree that people will be more involved without intervention.</p>
