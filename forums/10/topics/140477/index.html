            <div class='col-md body'>Well, from a general point of view, I'd believe entreprenuership IS encouraged. But NOT failures.<br><br>Basically it's apparent; it's fine if you want to venture into business and fuel the economy. But if you fail, it's your problem.<br><br>These days, being employed isn't the way to security or wealth. Being employed means UNCERTAINTY. So what's left? Run your own Business. At least you're able to fight to stay afloat - rather than told to leave and not have a fighting chance.<br><br>And, running your own business, gives you the chance to tell others, to leave. Can't beat em, join em! Hire foreigners too! Locals are too expensive!<br><br>See what I mean?</div>

I am with Dennis Wee by the way. Truth is, he made his money during the 1990's property boom. Now its the same, tough business.

            <div class='col-md body'>To be truthful, Entrepreneurship and Venture Captialism is what really fuels a country's economy.<br><br>Example:<br>Why is the American economy so powerful.<br><br>Look at silicon valley for example. They have this culture of taking risks and not giving up. In silicon valley, it's easier to obtain funds if u failed the first time round, coz how the venture captialists feel is that, good! this guy failed b4, now he has experience and he will be more careful this time.<br><br>But down here, oh! this guy failed before... better becareful...of him... no wonder singaporeans are so risk adverse...there's something seriously wrong with our education system.<br><br>We produce scholars who go overseas top unis and come back to the shelters built for them by govt organisations and they are drawing fat paycheck...where is the direct pay back to the society? These scholars are the elites, smartest of the nation, they have all the more reasons to make it big in the business world than ppl who have not as high education as them.<br><br>We dont have the culture of taking risks, and giving ppl a second chance, encouraging ppl to make things happen. Singaporeans are just concerned with getting a high paid job, stay nice house, drive bmws and go holidays.<br>but in the first place if there's no one creating jobs and where is all this wealth coming from?<br><br>but ppl think about it. we cant blame singapore's small mkt, even if u want to operate regionally, it's hard, we are surrounded by malaysia, indonesia, thailand.. these countries themselves are struggling with their own economies, we are considered not too bad compared to them and even if we want to expand to these countries, we dont have the experience or resources like a govt owned corporation with huge fundings from taxpayers money.<br><br>the one company i see got good potential is Asia Pacific Beweries. Even then, it's share price now is too high for me get the kind of returns I want.</div>
