Its not like in the 60s when they had to have a mirror shine to them. If asking your son's boots to be just black, not shiny instead of looking all grimy and dirty is too much, I really wonder what kind of lazy tardy sloth he is that he would prefer to look like something the cat dragged in.<br><br>They learn jungle training so that if hes asked to fight there in the future, he'd actually fight and not cower behind some tree crying for mummy and daddy to come save him.<br><br></div>

SAF should be looking to more thinking soldiers or training more world class strategists than playing with those old outdated toys</div></blockquote>Dear Heartlander,<br>I think u would have a better idea of what NSmen does when u get enlisted for national service.<br><br>According to you, "to WIN an afghan war, WITHOUT dropping a bomb...." are u saying that there is another alternative to what is happening now in afghanistan without resorting to warfare? If u are coming across based on humanitarian angle,( Perhaps u understood Sun Tzu's Art Of War, when he said the acme of a skilled strategist's prowess is to conquer without resorting to a fight. i.e. a bloodless coup.) I applaud your altruisim. But then, what has SAF gotta do with it ?<br><br>Or perhaps what u meant was that the conventional responses i.e. aerial bombardment, ground intelligence gathering missions etc... cannot work. Then what do u think is happening now ? Mazar E Sharif has been taken, so has Herat, then Kabul and now<br>Kandahar. (have i missed out Jalalabad?)<br><br>Our defence (read DEFENCE) policy is based on establishing and maintaining mutual relations with our neighbouring countries. If push comes to a shove, our objective is to project an image that we will make it extremely difficult and futile effort for an aggressor force to take us out.<br><br>Perhaps in the next National Day mobile column drive-past please pay attention to the hardware displayed (they are no longer only 3-tonners) or even better still, wait for enlistment day and u can have an intensive 2 to 2 and half years of vocation trg (provided u are medically fit and physically abled to qualify for the SAF).<br><br>I assure u, your M-16 or (if u are lucky enough ) SAR 21 are more than just outdated toys.<br><br></div>

Its a rare chance to go about doing something which we don't normally get to do as a civilian, and in NS, its a chance to get away from the drudgery or daily life. Of course, being a specialist and therefore not exactly having  to live with the same kind of disciplinary rules as the enlistees does help...hehe...but that doesn't explain why I like range in BMT...I just think its fun<br></div>
