            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pinkish purple papayas:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, the founding father of China, Mr Sun Yat Sun was a cantonese. Much of the chinese diaspora overseas were rich and were cantonese too. they were much involved in donations and war efforts.<br><br>Definately cantonese was taken into consideration. But at last mandarin won over because mandarin was the "guan hua" in Beijing up north.<br><br>Cantonese is known as "yue" language. Many eras ago, GuangDong, GuanXi and Vietnam was an independent kingdom, the "Yue" State.<br><br>Han Chinese came and conquered these lands, subsequently, through much sinicsation. Thats why cantonese is known as "yue yu" and vietnam is known as "yue nan". If u were to disect and observe this 2 languages, cantonese and vietnamese, u will find similarities. like chinese and japanese.</div></blockquote>Sun Yat Sen is actually born into a hakka family in Canton. He is not cantonese by ethnicity.<br><br>Alot of hakkas speak cantonese for business or it was because their ancestry came down to Canton. Even Shanghainese speak cantonese to do business in HongKong.</div>

April 1906.<br><br>Front row from left: Liu Gan Ting, Teo Eng Hock, Tan Chor Nam, Dr Sun Yat Sen, Wang Lie, Lau Kam Seng, Lim Nee Soon; back row from left: Goh Ngo Sow, Teo Bah Tan, Zhang Ji, Chan Lui Ho, Deng Ziyu, Wong Yew Ting, Teo Peng Kay<br><br>Dr Sun Yat Sen chose Singapore as the nerve centre of his revolutionary movement (Tong Meng Hui) in Southeast Asia, due to its excellent geographical location as a port of call and its considerable Chinese immigrant population. It was in this villa that Dr Sun led numerous red-blooded Chinese men in the planning of several uprisings against the Manchu (Qing) government. Shining examples include the Zhennanguan and Huanggang uprisings.<br><br>With his determination and resilience, combined with the massive support from Chinese all over the world, Dr Sun Yat Sen succeeded in establishing a modern China, free from several thousand years of feudalistic rule upon the success of the Wuchang Uprising in 1911.<br><br>Dr Sun came to Singapore on eight separate occasions. His third and final visit to the villa was in 1910 before leaving for Penang with his family. In 1911, the Wuchang Uprising succeeded and he went on to be inaugurated the first Provisional President of the Republic of China."<br><br><a href="http://www.wanqingyuan.com.sg/english/aboutus/aboutus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wanqingyuan.com.sg/english/aboutus/aboutus.html</a><br><br></div>
