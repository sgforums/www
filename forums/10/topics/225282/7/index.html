I have a friend in the same department as I. He likes to talk loudly when other people are sleeping in the bunk and has totally no consideration for others. Whenever he comes back to the bunk, he would shout a loud "Hello" to make his "grand" entry known to the inhabitants of the bunk. Also, he only doesn't know basic manners such as not taking one's seat when one just moves away for a short while. He's one English-speaking snob that I can't tolerate, but I unfortunately have to because we live under the same roof, in fact the same bunk. Sign...<br><br>Secondly, English-speaking Singaporeans are arrogant most of the time. They usually think that their English is so good that they use it to mock or talk sarcastically to those who's language ability is not so strong. Their pompous behaviour is most intolerable. And I can tell you this: Most of the only English-speaking Chinese are snobs - about 95%</div></blockquote>Tsk, you're no better if you generalise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My real life experience today.<br><br>I was on a north-south bounded MRT travelling from Jurong East MRT station to Marina Bay. I was onboard at Jurong East MRT station, so I was able to get a seat, so I sat down comfortably. (No, I didn't see anyone who needed that seat)<br><br>Then on my right sat an Indian couple, with their child. On my right sat two Malays.<br><br>Now the fun begins.<br><br>The Indian couple started to play their music (ermmm, english music lah), As their neighbour, I endured. Influenced by the Indian couple, the Malays also began to blast their music (ermmm, also english lah, but different song). Me, in the center, listening to two different genres of music.<br><br>I wonder what will potatoes say if they were in the same situation as me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As most of us are chinese here, just a point of advise.<br>As a human, we need to know where is our "root" is..... that is very important.<br><br>Our Gov't knew their mistake now, so they are trying very hard to promote chinese speaking..... Do u know why? Becos they knew that in the next 10-20yrs down the line, it will be china market. If we dun know hw to speak chinese, hw to invest in China?<br><br>As we can see, most of our people speak english, to the extend that our kids speak english n forget their mother tongue. Becos we need english to survive in spore, so those KS parent teach their children engilsh in the very young age. But not forgetting 10-20yrs down the line that I mentioned above, they will eventually regret.<br><br>I am now teaching my children chinese 1st instead of english, I want them to survive or succeed in china. Spore are saturated now and europe market are on the down slope, most of the investor in spore are switching their targets to China now, so what i foresee learning chinese will advantage in future than those banana(no offence) but not neglecting learning english too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
