            <div class='col-md body'>Proficiency in mandarin is essential if you want to maintain a competitive edge over PRCs, many of whom are learning to speak English. And stop deluding yourself, there are plenty PRCs who speak and write better English than we do.<br><br>"SINGAPORE is on the right track in its efforts to get its students to be proficient in English but it must maintain its edge as a bilingual society, said Mr David Graddol, an authority on English language trends.<br>Indeed, the monolingual English graduate - the 'monoglot' - will face a bleak economic future, as bilingual or multilingual workers are preferred by companies aiming to globalise.<br><br>Mr Graddol is the author of English Next, a report commissioned by The British Council.<br><br>In an interview with The Straits Times, he spoke of a massive increase in the number of people learning English and reeled off some impressive figures to make his point.<br><br>Two billion - that is how many new learners of English are being added, up to the end of the next decade .<br><br>More than half of all primary school children in China are now learning English, and the number of English speakers in India and China - 500 million in all - exceeds the total number of mother tongue English speakers elsewhere in the world.<br><br>The reason for what Mr Graddol called an 'explosion' is that English is no longer a foreign language for most people. It has become a near universal basic skill, like learning how to use a computer.<br><br>Projecting into the future, in the context of unrelenting globalisation, he said soon it is the polyglots who will have significant competitive advantages over the monoglots.<br><br>'The competitive advantage of speaking just English will ebb away, because soon, everyone will speak English. Advantage can be maintained only by having other skills, such as speaking several languages,' he said, adding that policymakers elsewhere are now looking at Singapore and Finland as models to follow.<br><br>Mr Graddol, whose three home- schooled children learn English, Italian and French, said when one acquires a language, he or she is also likely to develop cultural awareness, which will be a skill much valued by employers.<br><br>'It enables people to build rapport with their clients and helps them avoid the social and business faux pas that can cost them lucrative business deals,' he said.<br><br>Several employers here agreed with his view. They said that as they set their sights abroad, they look for workers who are proficient in other languages on top of English.<br><br>Said Mr David Leong, managing director of regional human resource company PeopleWorldwide Consulting: 'Increasingly, we have employers choosing the bilingual or multilingual candidate over those with just good English.'<br><br>Mr Stephen Forshaw, spokesman for Singapore Airlines, said the very nature of airline operations requires one to be able to communicate well, often in more than one language.<br><br>'Our customers come from all points of the globe and many of them prefer to communicate in their native language. Being able to do so makes them feel very much at home and it is one of the ways we provide that personalised service which customers look forward to.'<br><br>He added: 'SIA has been fortunate beneficiaries of the Singapore education system, in that almost all our recruits can speak at least two languages: English and the mother tongue, which caters for a large proportion of our passengers.'''<br><br>(Straits Times, 15 Dec)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after reading the TS article, I feel quite sad to see the younger generation of chinese singaporeans wrong perception about the chinese language.  This has nothing to do with boorish behavior whatsoever. due to singapore's colonial past and govt emphasis of english as 1st language has somehow has made us lose our roots with our native language.<br><br>language has the amazing ability to act as a tool for bonding human interaction and you'll fit right into a group if you speak their 'language'. when i was living in finland, the locals native language is finnish but yet they speak perfect english as well. Some are even fluent up to 5 languages! To them, english is just an additional language for corresponding to non-natives who have problems understanding finnish but they still make a strong effort to retain mastery of their native language because of cultural identity and for bonding.<br><br>Knowing the native language of the group/person you are talking to certainly helps to break the ice and makes you feel closer and more part of the family.  This is something that I learnt to appreciate and it did wonders for me once I make an effort to learn and speak finnish with the locals.<br><br>I feel that in the world today when singapore is going global, learning english itself is simply not enough, and for chinese singaporeans like myself, taking an interest in chinese and having some fluency in it is a must. I am glad that my excellent command of mandarin has served me well in a lot of situations, you also get the respect from foreign friends to act as immediate interpreters when you travel overseas. I would feel quite ashamed if I as a chinese could not translate simple chinese terms and explain basic chinese culture to my keen-eyed scandinavian friends.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know of English-speaking people who are very rude also. I have a friend in the same department as I. He likes to talk loudly when other people are sleeping in the bunk and has totally no consideration for others. Whenever he comes back to the bunk, he would shout a loud "Hello" to make his "grand" entry known to the inhabitants of the bunk. Also, he only doesn't know basic manners such as not taking one's seat when one just moves away for a short while. He's one English-speaking snob that I can't tolerate, but I unfortunately have to because we live under the same roof, in fact the same bunk. Sign...<br><br>Secondly, English-speaking Singaporeans are arrogant most of the time. They usually think that their English is so good that they use it to mock or talk sarcastically to those who's language ability is not so strong. Their pompous behaviour is most intolerable. And I can tell you this: Most of the only English-speaking Chinese are snobs - about 95%</div>
