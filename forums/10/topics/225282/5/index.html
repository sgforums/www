            <div class='col-md body'>It was wrong of her to generalize. But she did have a point; albeit it's more of a misconception. True; such rowdy behaviour has nothing to do with the language you speak, but I guess it has become a stereotypical view when ah bengs and ah lians generally do not speak good English. And when they do; you definitely wouldn't wanna associate yourself with 'em. It's really a disgrace; ironically; some are really nice people.<br><br>Unfortunately, so many of such impolite, inconsiderate, unrefined, uncouth, rowdy, insolent, peace-shattering behaviours certainly come from a <strong>majority</strong> of such mandarin-speaking youths. Don't flame me yet; go out to the Singapore streets and observe for yourself.<br><br>I could understand everyone slamming, blasting, criticizing and flaming her. Read her article carefully; she mentioned that 'she doesn't mean all mandarin-speaking people; as some English-speaking people ain't angels either'. (somewhere along that line.) Was this too vague or too subtle for people to overlook it? Or was it just a statement use to rebutt when we refute her article?<br><br>To perceive her as narrow-minded; I couldn't agree more. She has indeed perceived and classified such rowdy kids under the mandarin-speaking category. It so happens that none of the English-speaking kids were displaying such intolerant behaviour; or so it seems. Guess she didn't happen to see one?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by trendz:</div><div class="quote_body">I could understand everyone slamming, blasting, criticizing and flaming her. Read her article carefully; she mentioned that 'she doesn't mean all mandarin-speaking people; as some English-speaking people ain't angels either'. (somewhere along that line.) Was this too vague or too subtle for people to overlook it? Or was it just a statement use to rebutt when we refute her article?<br><br>To perceive her as narrow-minded; I couldn't agree more. She has indeed perceived and classified such rowdy kids under the mandarin-speaking category. It so happens that none of the English-speaking kids were displaying such intolerant behaviour; or so it seems. Guess she didn't happen to see one?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>I did catch the part about her qualifying her own stand by saying that not all Mandarin-speaking people are boorish and uncouth and that not all English-speaking people are angels as well.<br><br>However, the main issue that we have with her is her association of the behaviour of the punks she saw with the language they use. It is extremely irrational of her to be attributing their behaviour to their usage of the Chinese language. Even if that was not what she meant, that was definitely the feeling that I got when I read her article. By bringing the fact that they used the Chinese language in their speech into the equation, she pretty much blamed their behaviour on their use of the Chinese language, whether she realizes it or not.<br><br>It's one thing to be ashamed of the antics of the punks she saw, but to blast their mother tongue is another. For the record, I am also ashamed of the antics of Mats and Minahs who smear the name of my race.<br><br>I am ashamed of the boorish behaviour of Mats and Minahs, but I am proud of the Malay language. I see absolutely no reason to attribute their behaviour towards their usage of Malay. In any case, they use it in a stunted manner, at that.... definitely not the epitome of high-level Malay.<br><br>What she really needs to do is to get out more and have a wider perspective of things. With her vision tunneled in to those Chinese youth, she probably doesn't realise that such punks do exist everywhere else - regardless of what language they use, be it English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil, French, German, or Esperanto, for that matter.<br><br>And perhaps by doing so she'll realize the fallacy of her arguments and take language out of the equation that she presented. By all means, condemn their antics, but the language factor that she introduced just screws it all up.</div>

Food for thought?<br><br>I think it not the matter of the word on the surface now, it is the hidden meaning behind the word and the motive of using that word.<br><br>As for Fu*k, i guess it is just so commonly used that most people are used to it already. Plus, you hear it everywhere! Even kids in primary school uses that word. =( But that doesn't mean that it should used. Com'on, we all know that people usually use it for swearing and all. This word should not be encouraged IMHO.<br><br>your past arguements were acceptable, till now I feel.<br><br>regards.<br><br>IMO, if you are born chinese, be proud of it. There are always black sheeps in every culture and thou shall not degrade your own culture because of any that exist. Culture needs time to build, we should treasure it.<br><br>Btw, I am not afraid to say that I dislike those english-speaking chinese. If they make an effort to speak mandarin or simply keep quiet when they dislike it, I am fine with it. But if they openly denouce the language when they are chinese themselves, they derserved to be shot.</div>
