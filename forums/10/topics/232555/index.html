            <div class='col-md body'>According to Peter's principle, a person is promoted to the position of incompetence because of his or her tendency to copy his or her past successful methodology from his or her training or experiences into the next job which may require a totally new approach.<br><br>Hence a lawyer who is trained to control people from passing of laws or regulations will tend to manage people legalistically i.e. based on the psychology that as long as one is supported by forms and legal sanction of some kind, the leaders could do as they like.<br><br>Yet in life, not many problems affecting competitiveness and survival can be solved in such a manner. Problems of practical knowledge application and entrepreneurship are solved because of incentives to people to earn a living or create jobs and not by allowing the government to become more and more powerful through sanction of laws and regulations.<br><br>Entrepreneurship is badly needed in our society due to its demise for many years due to past mistakes in promoting only top-down legalistic governance based on passing of laws and legal wrangling with legal processes.<br><br>If we look at the schools now, we will find that all or nearly all the teachers are teaching the students by condemning them, blaming them for not trying hard or passing certain grades instead of encouraging them to apply knowledge.<br><br>Now the whole society has grown up being subjected to legalistic wrangling and tweaking of rules and regulations on the population due to many years of top-down legalistic system of government.<br><br>URA has tried to use raw powers of land acquisition and summary processes to extend the past conservation of properties to new commercial sites without looking into whole range of newer problems which may be caused.<br><br>Knowledge application is the way to go and people are now the centre of the universe. So schools and politicians cannot use old methods of governance and management if there is going to be greater entrepreneurship and creativity and competitiveness in the future.</div>
