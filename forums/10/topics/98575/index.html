The picture will be bleak as ever with 90% of business failures among the new start-ups over the past years.<br><br>Go to ask any of the more reliable source like the professional engineers or lawyers of smaller firms how they have performed in the past year. Even with lower rentals, the overall economic prospect continues to be bleak.<br><br>Go to ask the trade associations for more reliable information on the state of the economy based on their members' own reports. The picture will be totally different from the ministerial optimistic figures about the unemployment situation.<br><br>The department of statistics should be revamped if it cannot give professional advice to the various ministries how to be more realistic or representatives in datas and information. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my 2c worth..<br><br>this is not to do with economics but with the larger question of how statistics and reports are used by govt agencies. what info i have comes from my conversations and personal experience within the civil svc, though it might not answer whether employment went up or down, it does tell us something about the use of info, or rather the distortion of facts for the furtherance of political agendas. they are mostly from the education/cultural ministries<br><br>i have a ex-uni mate working in the national education branch and he told me that after attending enough meetings with big shots discussing on the NE policy, he came away with the conclusion that NE has one single purpose-the pperpetuation of the rule of a single family/party. he didn't elaborate further..but another classmate of mine did.<br><br>this guy is doing his Phd when i was in his class. he works for MITA, or was..not too sure. he recounted this experience to me. once he told me he was tasked to write a paper on certain aspects of s'pore's history and he did. but he had his research thrown back at him because it did not fit into the minister's views of what history is supposed to be. he was told to re-do his research so that it would fit into the pre-decided politically suitable conclusion...<br><br>these two had to do with the twisting of history/NE for partisan purposes. the next two have to do with education.<br><br>i attended a meeting about assessment of certain subjects. the official from moe went on about how statistics and reports of certain national exams 'confirmed' that students are succeeding as 'critical thinkers'. i rebutted the lady and told her that i had the chance to see the raw data i.e. actual scripts instead of her sanitised version of exam reports/statistics and told her that students are regurtitating and the so-called critical thinkers she mentioned in her report was only like about 5 in every 100. she didnt expect an answer from someone who had seen the raw data so she said its been decided b4 finally shutting-up. similarly, the other teachers there voiced their disagreement. but i do believe from her justification of her 'statistics', it seems that the way to go was to highlight the 5 over the 95 to whichever minister or director to show that someone's version of 'naitonal policy in education' is succeeding. so somehow the opinion of the teachers who teach are 'sanitized' by the time they reach the top...i guess this works well for those bureaucrats becos they get to summit their nice reports to confirm their boss' ego..everyone gets to look smart except the students who struggle with ever increasing work. teach less learn more?<br><br>regarding the discipline issue in schools and society, anyone who is not blind knows that it had nose-dived, yet our august education minister insisted that statistics has shown that it has improved over 15 years. once i had a private conversation with my boss who taught for 40 years, he said we can't publicly contradict the minister but we all know what he said was not true. for example, 15 years ago, no one heard of girl gangs...now they are as pampant as guys. wonder if the minister is blind or deaf or just inept, or worse, irresponsible.<br><br>another chat with a retired veteran of the education service said the same thing. he said after being in the service for 30+ years, statistics can prove anything from improving discipline to increasing passing rates. he even told he he was part of the con job...giving details how exam marks were 'moderated'. not the drawing of the bell curve but really the lowering of passing grade to increase the number of passes in exams. then re-adjusting the raw marks accordingly.<br><br>it no longer surprises me that statistics given out by ministries/straits times about this and that are so rosy in the economy. theres this prevailing culture to use stats to justify or worse, to prejudice opinions. although i do not wish for my country to suffer,  it is hard to believe that everything is so rosy when u actually live 'on the ground' instead of an ivory tower, earning $1m a year. i guess when u earn $1m a year, everything is rosy to u. whenever straits times publishes something glowing about the govt/economy, i double check it with external sources. case in point is the glowing report of temasek published by ST, it seems that very few external agencies shared their optimism.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like we may not recover for we no longer have the guidance from a ft mentor:<br><br>From: ConfuseState 27-Sep 11:37<br>To: ALL<br><br>56295.1<br><br>Albert Winsemius, 'founding father' of Singapore<br>http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn9/soueasia/winsemiu.html<br>Thirty-five years ago, in the spring of 1960, Dr Albert Winsemius<br>arrived in Singapore - soon to become his second fatherland -- for<br>the first time in his life. He headed an international team of<br>experts in the field of development economics. A year earlier the<br>former British colony had become independent, and the government of<br>the young nation had asked the United Nations to invite Dr Winsemius,<br>the founding father of the Dutch post-war industrialization<br>programme, to help them to find out which chances the future would<br>offer to Singapore.<br>By Kees Tamboer<br><br>Dr Winsemius' first impression was anything but hopeful. "It was<br>bewildering," he remembers. "There were strikes about nothing. There<br>were communist-inspired riots almost every day and everywhere. In the<br>beginning one has to very careful about passing any judgement - one<br>does not know the country, one does not know the people, one does not<br>know the men and women who are trying to steer this rudderless ship.<br>But after a couple of months the pessimism within our commission<br>reached appalling heights. We saw how a country can be demolished by<br>unreal antitheses. The general opinion was: Singapore is going down<br>the drain, it is a poor little market in a dark corner of Asia."<br>Within a year, on 13 June 1961, the Winsemius team offered Singapore<br>a development plan. The final assessment was written by Winsemius<br>personally: 'Expectations and Reality' was his motto. This was<br>permeated with an emotional appeal for unity, a passionate warning<br>that time was running out if Singapore was not to sink away into the<br>mud. The gloom was not completely unrelieved, there was one bright<br>spot on the horizon: "In our opinion", wrote Winsemius, "Singapore<br>has the basic assets for industrialization. Her greatest asset is the<br>high aptitude of her people to work in manufacturing industries. They<br>can be ranked among the best factory workers in the world."<br><br>Shirts and Pyjamas<br>After delivering his development plan in the summer of 1961,<br>Winsemius became the chief economic adviser to the Singaporean<br>government. He held this function for almost twenty- five years, and<br>at no time was there ever any written contract. The collaboration was<br>based on mutual trust. Twice a year Winsemius flew to Singapore to<br>spend about a fortnight there - one time it was to help drafting the<br>plans for the coming year, the other time for checking and steering.<br>Part of the deal was that he would come immediately should the<br>government let him know that his help was needed at short notice,<br>which was, for instance, the case in 1965.<br>"When we started with the implementation of the first development<br>programme, Winsemius recalls, "I was convinced that a policy of<br>protection of the home market would come to nothing, because there<br>was almost no home market. I immediately advised them to try and form<br>an economic federation with Malaya. As soon as this aim was achieved,<br>I assumed, we would be able to move over to the next phase and try to<br>conquer a position on the world market. Four years later Singapore<br>was expelled from the Federation, and there were the signs of some<br>initial panic in the state. In my opinion there was no longer any<br>reason for such a reaction. On the contrary, this is the best day of<br>my life, I told my friends in Singapore, for in those first years of<br>development Singapore had proved that it was able to overcome<br>internal antithesis and to work together to build up a manufacturing<br>industry that would certainly be competitive in the long run."<br>Albert Winsemius distinguishes five main phases in the economic<br>development of Singapore.<br>"The first step", he explains, "was to set up low-value industries,<br>such as the production of shirts and pyjamas in factories in which<br>women could work. The contribution made by the women during the<br>initial years of industrialization has never really been properly<br>studied. This contribution can easily be underestimated. It was the<br>only manufacturing activity then with sufficient experience. The<br>sewing machines could be rented, and the girls and women had<br>experience in working with them. Therefore a very quick start was<br>possible in the field of shirts and underwear. This aspect of early<br>industrial development deserves more attention than it has received<br>so far."<br><br>Upgrading<br>The Separation in 1965 marked the beginning of the second phase. The<br>Housing and Development Board (HDB) started with an enormous building<br>programme, under the leadership of Mr. Howe Yoon Chong. "This was<br>very inspiring, people could see what was being achieved. On Sundays<br>fathers and mothers showed their children in what kind of new<br>dwellings they would live presently. In that same period we succeeded<br>in interesting, just as had happened in Holland fifteen years<br>earlier, big oil companies like Shell and Esso in establishing<br>refineries in Singapore.<br>The third phase was that we started as soon as possible with the<br>upgrading. Singapore became very active in promoting education for<br>technical jobs, especially for the electronics industry. In the<br>beginning it was quite a difficult job for me to convince people at<br>the top of the big Dutch electronics company Philips to set up<br>production plants in Singapore. I went to Eindhoven, where the<br>headquarters of Philips are situated, to warn them: you have to<br>hurry, I told them, otherwise there is a very real danger you will be<br>too late and then you will be sure to miss the boat in the growing<br>market of Southeast Asia. The result is that Philips is now one of<br>the big investors in Singapore and is doing a very fine job there.<br><br>The fourth phase was to make of Singapore an international financial<br>centre. Formerly the young state was bound to the English pound<br>sterling. I knew a Dutchman who had lived and worked in Singapore; he<br>was an employee of the Bank of America in London at that time. I<br>visited him and told him we wished to transform Singapore into a<br>financial centre for Southeast Asia within ten years. He told me it<br>could be done in three or four years. He took a globe and showed me a<br>gap in the financial market of the world. Trading, he explained,<br>starts at nine o'clock in the morning in Zurich in Switzerland. An<br>hour later London opens. When London closes, New York is already<br>open. After closing time on Wall Street, San Francisco on the<br>American west coast is still active. But as soon as San Francisco<br>closes, there is a gap of a couple of hours. This gap can be filled<br>by Singapore, should the government not shun taking some drastic<br>measures - such as cutting its links with the British pound.<br><br>Container harbour<br>And the fifth and last phase was that we transformed Singapore into a<br>centre of international traffic and transport. My advice was: build<br>an airport where the biggest aeroplanes can land and let everyone<br>know that they are welcome to land there. In other words, do not use<br>landing-rights to protect your own Singapore Airlines. They followed<br>this advice and it became a success. And thanks to this initiative<br>Singapore has become a tourist centre too, especially for short<br>stays. In the same vein, we started to construct a big container<br>harbour. In Holland I had been chairman of a committee to advise the<br>Dutch government on the problems to do with shipbuilding, so I had<br>some knowledge about what was going on in that world. I saw the<br>enormous growth of container transport between the United States and<br>Europe, concentrated initially in the harbour of Rotterdam. So I<br>advised the construction of a big container terminal in the harbour<br>of Singapore, taking the risk of overcapacity and unoccupancy during<br>the first years for granted. The advantage was evident: Singapore<br>would be the only harbour in the region with container facilities.<br>Nevertheless it was a hard job to convince the harbour authorities.<br>Only after a small conversation with the minister the decision could<br>no longer be postponed. Nowadays Singapore, after Rotterdam, has the<br>second largest container harbour in the world. That surely is<br>something of which to be proud."<br>"In my opinion", says Dr. Winsemius, "it would be next to impossible<br>to transplant the Singapore wonder elsewhere. I have experienced it<br>in other countries. I have given advices to the government of Greece<br>and, for five years, to the government of Portugal. It is senseless<br>to launch an economic development programme in a country which lacks<br>political stability and does not have a government that sticks to<br>that programme in the knowledge that, one day, it will be recognized<br>and rewarded by the voters."<br><br>Kees Tamboer is the economic editor of the Dutch daily Het Parool</div>

There are many pros and cons behind every issue.<br><br>By abolishing say 30% of existing social engineering laws, I think Singapore can still survive and may even do better.
