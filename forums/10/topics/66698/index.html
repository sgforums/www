            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Clement Louis A. Joseph was remanded at Queenstown prison in 1997; he received his termination letter from SIA, while he was there, his employer for 23 years.<br><br>According to the newspaper reports a fellow unionist had informed SIA (his employer) about his detention at the time and yet he lost his case each time.  It seems that the person in detention must report the matter to the Employer.  Is this really possible in each instance?<br><br>The latest High Court ruling by justice Woo acknowledges that Clement Joseph had a reasonable excuse for not turning up for work and yet again he lost his case.<br><br>I am mystified:<br>1) Is a person remanded allowed to contact the Employer / Family by phone while in detention?<br>2)  Why is a fellow unionist statement to the Employer not recognized?<br>3) Is the Employment Act, section 13(2) not flexible in such cases where the employee is not capable of making known to the employer that he or she is unable to turn up for work?  For instance if I am in a coma, how can I report to the employer?<br><br>Are our judges so naÃ¯ve that they cannot interpret the Employment Act in a more humane manner???<br><br>I wish Clement Joseph will be successful in his next attempt at the court of appeal, otherwise we should all be wary as employees in Singapore!<br></div>
