            <div class='col-md body'>Were our Elite Ministers all that brilliant when they envisaged a project to provide for our future water needs.<br><br>With the current rainfalls per annum in Singapore, I think their plans was an EXTREMELY BAD CHOICE. Perhaps they were not so elite as to take into effect the global warming of earth, which would cause glaciers to retreat and more rainfalls dropping in between the tropics (equator included).<br><br>Since, due to global warming and the shutting down of our thermohaline ocean circulation. The region in the tropics will receive more rainfall, as the heat water (from equator and tropics) does not travel to northern part of the pacific ocean to evaporate and turn into rainfall in those northern regions. Most of the water would evaporate in between the tropics and turn into rainfall in between the tropics. That's why we are seeing more rainfalls in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation" rel="nofollow">However, a thermohaline circulation shutdown could have other major consequences apart from cooling of Europe, such as an increase in major floods and storms, a collapse of plankton stocks, warming or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rainfall changes in the tropics</span> or Alaska and Antarctica (including those from intensified El NiÃ±o effect), more frequent and intense El NiÃ±o events, or an oceanic anoxic event (oxygen (O2) below surface levels of the stagnant oceans becomes completely depleted - a probable cause of past mass extinction events).</a><br><br>With so much rainfall and an over abundance of water. What use do we have for a water recycling plant? I think in the end our water recycling plant would end up as another White Elephant, all because of ill-conceived ideas from our Ministers. So many smart aleck elites and they didn't factor in global warming into the equation.<br><br>So is our Hyf|u}{ plant a negative present value investment?<br><br></div>
