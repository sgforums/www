            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe,<br><br>the UN might say yes, but who but the Americans have the military capability to lead the coalition to topple the Mad Mullahs of Iran? Russia? China? Don't hold your breath. The Americans? Read my first post. They neither have the troops nor balls to go in against Iran, at least till they get Iraq and Afghanistan sorted out first. Factor in the need to rest the troops before the next US military adventure and we're looking at at least 5 years if not more. As it is the US military is running on empty with lots of reserves/National Guard called up and being used in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>Unless, you're willing to finance, form, train and lead your own army in...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for your articles internal support for toppling of Irans regime, replace Iran with Iraq and the articles suddenly seem familiar. Before Op Iraqi Freedom the US propaganda machine was predicting similar widespread support for the "Amerikan liberators". That may have been the significant support initially in Iraq, but even that is wearing pretty thin now. Even the lack of attacks in the Shi'ite areas of Iraq is due to tolerance, not acceptance of the US forces. If things don't improve, and control is not handed back to the Iraqis soon, coupled with Iran hovering in the background ready to agitate, we'll see how long things stay peaceful in Southern Iraq.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I would love to see Iran's, DPRK's and the Cuban regimes dumped out into the ashheap of history where they belong, and am happy to see Saddam go. But I'm against the way the Yanks went charging into Iraq Wild West style, and to be frank, your hope of Iran's mullahs going the same way as Saddam is to me, laughable at best. There is simply neither will, nor capability for that.<br><br>And after the US humbling in Iraq (as far as the unilateralism vs multilateralism debate goes), along with their current military capabilties and situation, only reinforces my point</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Viper52, great to see your response at this hour.<br><br>Concerning the US present appetite for another bruising round to handle Iran, you maybe right up to a point.<br><br>However, with the backing of other contributing nations to form a larger UN sanctioned Coalition Force, you may just find the USA in it - as well as France, Germany, other EU countries, and Russia too (not so sure if China will commit the PLA, as she is one of the 5 members of the UN Security Council).<br><br>Obviously, with the military resources and quality material that the USA will provide and far exceeding that from any other UN member countries, the USA will probably take the leadership role.<br><br>I believe that when Iran is targetted by the UN, with the support of all its members, the Iraq problem will be resolved and included as part of an overall UN Iran-Iraqi agenda.<br><br>This is only logical, as Iraq will be the staging post for any assault into Iran, with Afghanistan-Iran border providing a logical second front that will provide some challenge to the limited Iranian resources.<br><br>I will not doubt the resolve of the US citizens when the crunch comes to take on Iran, and they will not give up the opportunity given the participation and sanction of the UN.<br><br>It will be payback time to the Mullahs, who humiliated the USA during the late 1970s, when Ayatollah Khomeini brought the Shah of Iran and held the US Embassy Staff hostage.<br><br>So far the US has only committed two Division Plus in Iraq, and less then a Brigade in Afghanistan.<br><br>The size of the US Armed Forces and its Reserves are large enough to be rotated for duty in Iraq.<br><br>The manner in which the wars were fought in Afghanistan and Iraq during the opening phases, have largely been conducted by joint operation of Special Forces and aircrafts from the US Air Force and the US Navy.<br><br>The number of troops required in both wars were much less then half of that mobilised during Dessert Shielf and Dessert Storm.<br><br>With troop contributions from all UN Member Countries, there will need to be smaller demand for US Ground Troops.<br><br>Unfortunately, Singapore Laws do not allow me to have a Private Army, or operate a "Dogs of War" outfit.<br><br></div>
