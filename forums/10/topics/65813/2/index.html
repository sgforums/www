The reason why the gar'men is starting to notice is because of the increased capacity of Singaporeans to think for themselves and question the status quo nowadays. Just go to thevoiddeck.org and see if we are just a little corner here on the web of Singaporeans who won't buy propangada flat. The truth is, we are hardly alone.<br><br>This forum is no assualt on the PAP, the truth is, this is simply a forum of people who are aware of the apparent injustices in our turf, and are concerned about it. Ie. Singaporeans who are not political unaware. And the simple logic is, the ruling party would not be attracting so much fire here if it was fair and just to the people.<br><br>How many people can be happy with the status quo? Below express stream/JC/Uni students who are regarded as second class and constantly shotchanged their entire lives? A working class person who has to bear tons of costs to make basic ends meet? The retrenched who were booted because their government regarded them as uncompetitive and just expendable units in a myopic economic plan gone badly wrong (ironically those who came up with these plans are still around and reaping in the big bucks)?

The Lee Dynasty? A system that contuines to fleece us with no sense of basic thought for the individual?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by thinkloud2004:<br><strong>To ST and Atobe<br><br>You are right ST....I was wrong to associate this with KTV singing. It should be a concert - with a few hundred participants looking at one singer practically holding on the microphone throughout. And like any other concerts, an occasional guest star is always welcome. Somewhat different lyrics albeit harping on the same tune - a refreshing change no doubt.<br><br>[b] </strong>- since when have these words gotten a new meaning??<br><br><strong> </strong><br><br>Look back at all the posts by Atobe and tell me whether the first 8 words in your sentence is sincere and honest. I am sure the original intention of this forum is not like this - one single writer splashing the pages with unabated skewed presentations of what he claims to be "education" and "awareness",  occasionally punctuated with approving nods by a few others (not more than 4<br>in the last count).   Do you call that "attracting so much fire?"<br><br>On the subject of fairness and justice. How do you measure? Who is the judge?  Would we have been better off if things were done otherwise? Why didn't you say so before things were done? Are people happy? Lets not speculate as you are entitled to your opinion just as I am entitled to mine. We shall have to<br>wait till Polling Day.<br><br>&lt;<strong>People do not oppose for the sake of opposing, just because the Ruling Party has to be knocked off it's throne, despite what they may like to egoistically claim (please, we have better things to do). The truth is, some of the way things are done make people go "what the..."&gt; </strong> -<br><br>but my interpretation of Atobe's scripts thus far says otherwise.<br>Again we are entitled to our opinions so let the rest of the audience decide.<br><br>I have stated my agenda and I believe I have achieved my objective. In the process, I have leaned too much to the PAP and this may have incurred your wrath. I am ready for that when I decided to play the "devil's advocate". Your agenda is different from Atobe's and I do not wish to find out more. I respect your decision to be "unplugged" but I can remained "plugged" if I so wish, can't I?<br><br>You may not like this one but my solution is ---- if you don't have an<br>alternative or solution, shut up and accept things as they are (sorry if I offend more people, but then how?) If you want to say something about somebody, give him a chance to reply. What the audience wants is to witness a debate and then pass their verdict, not entertained by a duet who melodiously croons in harmony.<br><br>A political forum or a concert? The choice is yours.<br><br>Happy Monkey Year<br>thinkloud2004 [/b]</blockquote>What ?<br><br>No more attempt to reply to the postings that have responded to all your bombastic efforts to defend the Ruling Party, but preferring to take another wide sweep of generalised and unsubstantiated claims ? Surely, your tertiary training demand more to justify your position even to be a 'Devil's Advocate' ?<br><br>Is this the best that you can come up with, as your departing shot ?<br><br>A friendly advise - it is unwise and dangerous for you to make a broad stroke of the brush that can tarnish a wide range of people who have placed some value in this Political Corner of sgForum.<br><br>Surely you must be more mature to realise this desparate and bankrupt effort of yours to defend your Political Idols ?<br><br>During the Year of the Goat, we have to deal with sheeps that prefer to be senselessly herded in any directions - as long as there is grass to fatten them, they will happily remain blind with the wool over their eyes, even as the rest is sheared off their body.<br><br>With the beginning of the Year of the Monkey, it looks like the sheep will give way to the antics of the monkeys.<br><br>Are we going to see a bunch of obediently dull minded monkeys to be kept performing to the tune of the Master Music Player, so as to be assured of bananas and peanuts to be paid ?<br><br>Are you aware of how the monkey is trained to work as 'coconuts pickers' and paid only peanuts, while the master walked to the bank with the profits from the sale of the coconuts ?<br><br>If this Political Corner is to be a KTV, so be it, we have at least begun to sing our hearts out, and with practise had built our lungs, voices, and confidence to appear on a bigger stage if need be.<br><br>At least we will not have our skulls cracked open by those with a penchant to 'crack skulls' on a knee jerk reaction.<br><br>All those obedient monkeys will have to beware of the 'skull crackers' - as they have also an appetite for 'Monkeys' Brains'.<br><br>A word of advise, Thinkloud2004, thinking loudly serves no purpose - as when one's thinking is so loud it can affect the brain, which then cannot distinguish the fine differences in sound quality.<br><br>You will then only hear all the sound as a cacophony of noises, and with no expert ability to discern the quality of the noises that can be appreciated as New Music.<br><br>You may wish to relook at the opinions of a Senior Civil Servant, with more years of experience than your upstart attitude have shown, and perhaps draw from his observation before attempting to try to put your feet into some shoes that are definitely too many sizes bigger.<br><br>Visit the thread 'Singapore Bigger than PAP - shouldn't it be ?' and if you care to include the Senior Civil Servant as our Chorus Master in this KTV room, we will know how much more to expect from obedient monkeys that only perform when music is played by the Master.<br><br>Definitely a Happy Monkey Year to you - beware of your Skull Cracking Master with a penchant for Monkey's Brains, and who expertly practise the fine art of "Filling the Stomach, to Dull the Brain".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The lengths to which people can go to justify having their uniqueness and an individual trampled and willing submit to grossly unfair procedures with the faint reward of peanuts never fails to amaze me.<br><br>And yes, this forum is no assualt on the PAP, I don't have a bone to pick with them for being white men, the bone is picked with the way things they are doing. Apparently if you have a problem with that then I assume that if you were in Germany in 1942 and were aware of the concentration camps, they should be condoned as part of being obedient and not raising questions to the ruling party. This kind of dull brained "live and let's not think" unquestioning obedience to "they've helped us rise" authority mentality to life cost 6 million Jews and other minorities their lives.<br><br>After all which German of your kind would question the nazi party, having afforded them a comfortable life and brought Germany out of the mud? Maybe you would go as far as to argue that there is no judge to justify the injustice of gettos and concentration camps?<br><br>The PAP is certainly nowhere near on par with the Nazis when it comes to evil, but claiming such a clean, transparent and orderly democratic system, I'm amazed they think scrunity and critism of their ways can be destablizing and contray to democracy...<br><br>Ahem, if you think this is a KTV of concert, have you been aware that you are probably a member of a much larger, far more nonsensical... and nosier concert of the ruling party? Apparently, noise, and not sense matters to you.<br><br>But then again, I'm hardly surprised of the crass labels coming from your overheated gun barrels, after all, you do show us that you have done your homework in following the ways of your idols, when unable to outreason with logic, switch to vague, sweeping and of course, irrevelant labels sung ad nausuem to discredit your opponent without ever addressing the real issue.<br><br>While I may not agree with what you are saying, I will certainly defend to the death your right to say it, it appears that your approach is to take your ruling idol's approach of "I may not agree with what you are saying... I will put to the death your right to say it"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mr Atobe<br><br>Where is your proposed solution ? You do not have one and all you have done is to pick on my other lines and make paragraphs out of it.<br><br>First you made a mockery of my occupation and then passed insinuations on my education. Then you talked about my age and username with disdain. Even the monkeys are brought into the picture. Obviously your replies are centered around my profile in a bid to discredit me and evade the real issue we are supposed to be debating on. Aren't you guilty of character assassinations, something that you once openly deplored.<br><br>Your message is plain and simple to the audience, "I am now telling you all what you should know about LKY and this Government. You had better listen and agree or else I whack you". Your ultimate aim is to kick out the PAP Government but you don't know how so the next best thing is to kick anybody who supports them. And those who are highly educated or holding high posts deserve a bigger kick because they are the high-end product of this Government.<br><br>What if I tell you I am not a lecturer?<br>Wouldn't all your insults and innuendos against me be null and void? Or it doesn't matter - so long as it is somebody saying something in support of the Government, he is guilty in your own trial court. Obviously you have had suffered much under this regime and are using this forum to get back at the system which you otherwise cannot. A few supportive voices will be a bonus and any spoilsport must be hammered flat.<br><br>I am not interested in what you state yourself to be in your profile. It is through your postings that I decide who and what you are. In any case, your naivety and mentality to see things at face value demonstrates that you cannot discern scenarios beyond what you think is gospel truth, probably blinded by mindless hatred or severe neurosis. Blame the Government for that. Little wonder you are easily deceived by the mammoth figures that you gleefully churned out. And little wonder you can only hide in this place and with a pseudonym, pour out your contempt and disgust knowing full well that the very people you are alleging against cannot and do not reply you.<br><br>Go back to your circle game and hopefully the "Game Over" button is not lit. Or continue with your solo performance. However, the audience will not share your sentiments as enthusiastically as before because like me, many are quite confirmed who they suspect you to be. No encore for you. And my job is done.<br><br>I shall now visit the other threads you recommended.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's amazing how you can turn a simple statement into a multi-paragraph of disconnected gibberish, basically let's hear your cry broken down into several simple points:<br><br>1) You are insignificant<br><br>2) Any form of critique of The Party stems from hate/neurosis/(insert vice)<br><br>3) If you don't agree with me you are a KTV singer or any other childish label I can think of.<br><br>4) It's not about reason, logic, or justic here, it's about rethoric.<br><br>5) Don't even think of rocking the boat as you are all too small.<br><br>Okay... I got it...<br><br>Sadly I must say that Adobe's supposed "sliming" of your character is hardly unwarranted, illogical, or unjustified.<br><br>While you may criticize people who question the figurative status quo as SOBS tellers, KTV singers and Abobe worshippers which I obviously disagree with, the most amazing thing I see is how a person who claims to be intelligent, articuate or logical enough to be worthy of posting here (and believe me the standards aren't so high), are promoting the pratice of switching off and allowing The Party to do our thinking for us as any resistence must be ill-intentioned.<br><br>Have you questioned if The Party's resistence to implementing change was ill-intentioned and not carried out with the people's interest in mind?<br><br>Finally you have been blasting us for well, blasting The Party, prehaps you would be so kind as to indulge us in telling us in all the raised issues, where have they done RIGHT or JUSTICE? Has the critique here been unfair to them? Or is your beef with them simply because they are mammoth and not because they are actually untrue?<br><br>Nazi concentration camps are mammoth as well, do we look the other way and pretend they don't exist because they are too big and bad? Do we accuse those who insist on seeing the truth for it is as paranoid nazi-haters?<br><br>If you think that all these "mammoth" figures on the issues revealed are just SOBS, you demostrate an nearly incomprehensible ability for apathy to the budern the typical Singaporean suffers in working for a country he has no say in the fate in, and is constantly indebted to for no other reason because he was born in it. Do we own our sucess to the PAP, or our forefathers? Are we just getting measured, tiny portions of the Singapore sucess pie and eating all the rubbish when things go bad while the upper class rides cushioning their backsides using our backs? You go think for yourself before you yell out on why some insignificant people are disgrunted...<br><br>KTVs, Concerts, showbiz, and whatever are irrevelent to me, what I want is the truth and reason. And if that truth and reason can be found in what you like to a concert, so be it. Better to know reason and truth in whatever way then to carry on in "dignified" ignorance.<br><br></div>
