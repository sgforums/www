That isn't going to cut it dude.<br><br>I have already presented what I had to present, and you have been quite sediously and tediously avoiding the issue, and to quote Adobe, "boxing with shadows" instead of facing your opponents head on. I find it quite amazing to you that the S.O.B.S of injustice, misplaced trust, organized repression and exploitation not worthy of addressing just because they are the "same old story".<br><br>Do you not represent the demographic of entertainment seekers with hypershort attention spans... with no real bearing with life but waiting for their next quick fix to allow them to get their shots off and feel important?

I'm afraid unlike govt. backed debates, there is a level playing field here and selling flowerly visual paintings to belittle your opponents, while a time honoured tradition with The Party, does little good here, especially when there is a ton of evidence flying agains't you.<br><br>I encourage you to revisit my previous posts, they have already replied to your responses by far. Amazingly, you have completely failed to respond to any of them. Wait.. why not I give you a concession? Unlike you, I would not be as to be so unkind as to demand an answer from you, those the questions I have raised require an answer, could could work on Adobe's points first.<br><br>Conversely, you could contuine to employ your stick-in-ears-and-sing-same-"I cannot hear you, you are a dork" <span style="font-style: italic;">ad nausem</span>, but it's no great intellectual loss to Singapore here.</div>
