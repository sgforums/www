            <div class='col-md body'>First, the supposedly generous handout of ERS shares is to dampen the increase of another ONE PERCENT to the 4 Percent GST, bringing it to an all time high of 5 Percent GST to be effective  from January 1, 2004.<br><br>The ERS payout will vary from $250 to $800 for most Singaporeans - for ease of calculation we shall assume an average of only $500 payable to every elligble Singaporean.<br><br>Unfortunately, before ERS is paid out, firstly, those who do not contribute to the CPF regularly, must deposit a minimum sum of $50.<br><br>There are at least 1,000,000 Singaporeans above 16 years, who are either self-employed, or not working, retrenched, unemployable, retired, or in old age.<br><br>Before handing out anything, the Government will already collect $50 million dollars into the CPF.<br><br>The ERS will then pay out an average of $500 to every eligible Singaporean, and this will amount to about $1.75 billion.<br><br>Here is the big surprise in collection.<br><br>With an annual business turnover in Singapore of more then $250 billion, 1 PERCENT GST on this turnover will allow the Government to collect an EXTRA $2.5 billion before creditting the businesses their due GST refunds.<br><br>On top of the ONE PERCENT INCREASE to the GST, from January 1, 2004, there will also be a 1 PERCENT increase to Electricity Charges.<br><br>The average household electricity bill of $90 PER MONTH, will be increased by 90 cents per HOUSEHOLD.<br><br>This small 90 cents increase to the monthly domestic electricity bill for each home will translate into $900,000 PER MONTH, or an additional $10.800,000 PER YEAR.<br><br>This is based on an assumption that a Singaporean population of 4.5 million will form 4 persons per household - there will be about ONE Million households.<br><br>While Singapore Powers picked up an extra $10.8 million per year with a ONE Percent increase to the Domestic Electricity Rate, the GST also will pick up an extra $10.9 million per year from the extra collected by Singapore Powers.<br><br>In summary, while Singaporeans will seemingly benefit from an ERS  pay out of $1.75 Billion, the Government will take back an EXTRA $50 million paid first to the CPF; the GST will pick-up an EXTRA $2.51 billion, Singapore Powers will pick-up an EXTRA $10.8 million.<br><br>Note that the amounts are not the TOTAL but only the EXTRA being collected from a ONE Percent increase to the GST and the Domestic Electrical Rate.<br><br>This calculation have not taken into consideration the increases to the hospital charges, school and university fees, domestic water rates, fares to taxi, bus service and MRT - all effected during 2003.<br><br>Did the Government sanctioned 'Opposition back benchers' - (from its own 'Pay And Pay' Political Party) - raise any EFFECTIVE objections to such increases GST and Domestic Electricity Charges at this time when deep cuts are made to salaries and CPF, and with more then 5 Percent Unemployment still continuing in Singapore ?<br><br>Happy New Year to All who still believe in the infallible politics and governance of the 'Pay And Pay' Party.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the above news report, it tells of another GOVERNMENT LINKED COMPANY extracting the hard pressed pocket of Singaporeans.<br><br>A THIRD HAND is now extended to take back the Government 2004 ERS handouts.<br><br>Now, fourteen days into January 2004, Singapore Press Holdings has announced that subscription price for daily newspapers delivered to homes will be increased by 10 cents - from 60 cents to 70 cents.<br><br>However, the same newspaper sold at the newstand will be increased by 20 cents for dailies, and 15 cents for Sunday papers.<br><br>This will result in price increases of over 16 PERCENT for home subscribers, and over 33 PERCENT for those buying their daily papers at the newstand.<br><br>With deep cuts to Employer's CPF contributions to workers' CPF accounts, and also deep cuts to workers' salary, it is surprising that the Singapore Press Holdings cannot achieve cost savings that make it unnecessary to make such increases.<br><br>It is also surprising that they were unable to achieve efficiencies in operational and production costs with their multi-million dollar investments in high-tech machinery; and with such high-tech equipment allowing them to increase revenues by taking in more pieces of higher value added contracts.<br><br>Are Singaporeans now made to swallow another bitter pill, since there has been no public outburst to the two earlier increases in December 2003 ?<br><br></div>

We can no longer continue to fully absorb the rising cost,' said Mr Chan.<br><br>He explained that the company's profit last year included a one-time exceptional gain of $188 million from the partial sale of its stake in telecommunications company MobileOne.<br><br>For its core newspaper operations, profits had in fact been declining in line with difficult market conditions.<br><br>Its latest first-quarter results registered a net profit of $83.8 million because contributions from its property arm made up for the weak showing from its newspaper operations.<br><br>He noted that SPH not only produces paid newspapers, but also provides free alternatives, such as the online editions of several of its publications including The Straits Times. It puts out a free morning daily, Streats, and daily news bulletins on Channel i and Channel U, its two free-to-air television channels.<br><br>'SPH strongly believes that our paid products continue to provide value for money, even at the higher prices.'<br><br>Straits Times - Saturday, 17 January 2004<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,230490,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,230490,00.html?</a><br><br></div>

The worst thing any of us can do right now is just to take things as they are and "plug" straight back in. Why? Because if the number of these "articulate" "well-knowledged" and "well-analysed" individuals reach a critical boiling point in their number, the gar'men has two options:<br><br>A.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Congratulations again, for a very educated analysis that presumably did not take too much effort on your part, which seems to reflect your signature cynicism towards those with anti-establishment views.<br><br>Congratulations too, for your clever ability to discern the helpless discontent of Singaporeans - amongst both the educated and uneducated.</strong><br><br>&gt;Thank you.<br><br><strong>Being in academia, would you not care to dig a little deeper to understand the cause for this state of mind, or will that be too much trouble and unsafe for your position in showing your political leanings ?<br><br>Or do you prefer to hide in the safe cloister of being politically correct, in order to preserve your occupation ?</strong><br><br>&gt;You are quite right. I dont see why I should endanger my occupation just to appease your incessant rumblings. And I believe there are many like me, from all walks of life, who feel the same.   The Government has had treated us well and we are quite happy to be in this status quo.<br><br><strong>Leave politics to politicians, and allow others to determine the fate of your future and that of your succeeding generations - (unless you prefer to remain celibate) ?<br><br>As was mentioned in my last post, in the thread 'Singaporeans are fools' - initiated by 'Relevation' - this discussion in sgForums is part of the Singapore Political Process, in which views are exchanged without threading on the paranoia of the Authorities.</strong><br><br>&gt;I hardly see any views exchanged. SOBS are not views. They only make some people angry, jealous and vindictive after reading. After that so what ???  If this is your so called Singapore Political Process, I rather stay with the PAP.<br><br><strong>It is surprising that for someone with such high intellectual leanings, you will want to participate in the lamentable preferences of all those who prefer 'to gather in this small corner to express their mutual self-pity and exchange sobs (Same Old Boring Stories)'.<br><br>Even when you belittle our efforts by describing the exchanges in the manner that you did, it is surprising that you continuously find it interesting enough to return, and burn your time here.</strong><br><br>&gt;Thank you again. You seem to relish on my high intellectual learnings. Sad for you, it is because of this that I read you differently. And we are allowed differing views here, don't we?<br><br><strong>Perhaps you are looking for more 'sobs' - Shockingly Odious Bummer Stories concerning the Government and the Ruling Party ?<br><br>Were there self-pity on the part of any one here ?<br><br>Is this 'Political Corner' that small ?</strong><br><br>&gt;Yeah...tell me more.  At least you should thank me for giving you the opportunity to dig out all the bones and intestines from the Government's closet. This 'Political Corner' is negligible compared with the mass of voters out there, as far as Singapore is concerned.  However, it can be read by all who care to read, here  and beyond. So agenda is important.<br><br><strong>IEvery fire always start with a small spark. In the face of strong wind and inclemental climate that do not favor any unauthorised flame to exist, the fire will not be so easy to start, and will need good preparation, nurturing, and continued nursing to ensure that the flame will burn.<br><br>It does not help, when those who are cynical, prefer not to participate in helping to spark the flame, but instead will try to douse the flame for any hidden agenda that no one will ever know.</strong><br><br>&gt;I dont see any flame, smoke perhaps. There are many ways to start a fire. By your way, you will burn yourself and others around you before many will feel the warmth.<br><br><strong>Where does your loyalty lie?<br>Is it for the interest of Singapore, or for the Politics of the Party ?</strong><br><br>&gt;Neither. It is with Mr Atobe, if that makes you happier.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Out of point here, but let me note few points.<br><br>While this political discussion is on between two experts here, (btw, i am not sarcastic, both have given excellent points) let me inform you guys there is another on other forums on business world, more on network marketing.

The worst thing any of us can do right now is just to take things as they are and "plug" straight back in. Why? Because if the number of these "articulate" "well-knowledged" and "well-analysed" individuals reach a critical boiling point in their number, the gar'men has two options:<br><br>A. Be ousted with a rather undignified fall from grace.<br>B. Forced to affect change itself.<br><br>If anything, we can see that B. is starting to work it's way out slowly. As unfair as they might be, they are far from silly like other 3rd world govts. Our social responsibility is indeed to notice their inconsistencies and do what Singaporeans do best, and that is to lament. In the absence of a credible opposition, keeping a sharp mine and being the very person you so sneer at is the only way of making sure there is some kind of a check and balance out there to avoid getting fleeced entirely.<br><br>Enjoy your stay in the Singamatrix, but I prefer to see the truth as it is. Call an injustice an injustice and not point to the past "glories" of the PAP to justify them, as if it's their right to contradict themselves and fleece us because it's their birthright. </div></blockquote>&gt; Thank you for the reply. Agreeable with your Option B. I respect your balanced approach although I am not sure if any of us can be totally "unplugged" from the system. Without doubt, there are discrepancies on the part of this Government that have to be addressed. Perhaps the next thing we want to realise is how we can be heard by those who are at the helm. I believe they will listen when the presentation is reasonable. On the other hand, as evidenced in some other posts, mud slinging and name calling will only serve to alienate us further with the problems remained unsolved - unless of course their agenda is simply to demolish the ruling party, whatever consequence notwithstanding.<br><br>thinkloud2004</div>
