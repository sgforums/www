Manpower and preferred new technologies like bio-tech, fuel-cell cars, solar energy and gas energy applications can be incorporated into this EMP.<br><br>Based on such master plan, we can aim to create New technology start-ups by pre-planning the careers of best technology students to go into new areas of technology applications even before leaving schools or going into universities.<br><br>Our Best students are now taken away by US space companies because our government does not understand technology application and there is no senior ministers well versed in this aspect,<br><br>By pre-planning the above-stated new start-ups, we can eventually catch up lost grounds in technology applications the key to our success not all the rhetorics and talks about education and leadership or meritocracy.<br><br>The government leaders have not done enough to nurture and develop the value-add industries we need to save eneegy or increase competitiveness.</div>
