            <div class='col-md body'>Put it this way...i have to agree that some people, Djs get more heat because we hear their voice only...have very very fake accents. It's more likely from TV and a need to be different from others.<br><br>People are quite GIGO...listen to too much American on TV and sooner or later, you will sub-conciously try to sound American. What's worse is that the genral public think that that's cool. So with GIGO and public approval(to a certain extent) people will continue with what they do.<br><br>For me, i say if you can pull off an accent then go ahead. Especially for DJs, since your voice does your job for you. But the of course, if you can't just don't do it. I don;t mean to be critical here, but Mario of Power98 really gets on my nerves. I have no idea where his accent originates, but that doesn't matter. I have no idea what he's talking about.<br><br>And as for clear Singaporean english, for something more contemporary, try Jamie Yeo, Carrie Chong or even Glenn and the Flying Dutchman. They speak english that doesn't sound out of this world, can be classified as Singaporean, and most importantly, you actually understand what they are saying.<br><br>Thats what matters...getting your message across, not your I'm-trying-so-hard-to-impress accent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Guest_111:</div><div class="quote_body">Good English has nothing to do with accents or what you end your sentences with.  Every region or country has their unique way of speaking.  The only thing that Singaporeans (I find) don't do is speak in complete/proper sentences.  Too many shortcuts to the point where it's difficult to understand.  especially longer conversations.</div></blockquote>Yes, i agree with you. However, my observation is that many Singaporeans have been brainwashed to believe that:<br><br>1) Having an accent denotes Good English, OR<br>2) You are a Geh Ang Moh.<br><br>And yes, i agree that many Singaporeans actually have a good standard of English. The problem arises when they take short cuts and ignore proper sentence structure, or mix languages, when speaking.<br><br>And yes, the problem with forcing people to speak proper english is that there are so many variations of english being spoken. Just try listening to Alex Fergusen during a post match interview!<br><br>Lee Hsien Loong was probably just trying to get the younger generation to identify with him - with disastrous results i might add. He makes himself sound silly.</div>
