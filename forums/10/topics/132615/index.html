Every region or country has their unique way of speaking.  The only thing that Singaporeans (I find) don't do is speak in complete/proper sentences.  Too many shortcuts to the point where it's difficult to understand.  especially longer conversations.</div>

Like I said, I know a hong kong girl who grew up in essex. her essex accent is so strong the 1st time i spoke to her i thot it was becos she grew up in hong kong and wasn't accustomed to speaking english. until i found out she pratically lived in essex since she was 3.<br><br>fake accents from locals r one thing. saying a brit has a fake british accent is well... like saying ah beng has a fake singlish accent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>so what do u do in your spare time when u conveniently gloss over or forget what u post previously?<br><br>so is it acceptable for a DJ who speaks in a very singlish manner to be average in pronunciation whereas an angmoh presenter MUST be 100% perfect in english? this is like saying if u're chinese your spoken chinese must be 100%. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>go n think. i dunno wots your point of aiming them. they're humans also.</div>
