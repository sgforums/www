              <p>putting forth personal agendas into criminal justice defeats the foundation behind what justice is....it has to be weighed on a case to case basis due to its particularities than at large, and its level of dangers and harm to the society...even human rightists' total abolishment of capital punishment does not serve the society good at the extreme end...and likely end up in an unstable state from the socio-economic perspective as well...</p>
              <p>capital punishment should be dealt with reservations but it still has to be evoked categorically, and a thorough and constant review of the criminal procedures and judicial system is important....</p>
              <p>it is critical to note that the concurrent majority may or may not be in the right state of mind to decide over capital punishments, given its multiple agendas, motives, angst and emotive elements etc, though and it should be served as an essential social reference..</p>

I did not mean 2 consenting adults can do something to another individual that is not consenting, I meant they can do what ever they want with eachother. If some one does not want to be killed but some one kills that person that is murder. If some one wanted to be killed and some one wanted to kill that person and their proper legal documentation was all prepaid who are you to stop them from both having their wishes fulfilled, this does not directly effect you so who gives you the right to intervene. The same thing goes with drugs and robbery. If some one does not want to be robbed you do not have the right to rob them if some one does not want to use drugs you do not have the right to give them drugs. On the otherhand if they wanted to be robbed or use drugs why not let them. Its their life let them live it how they would like to.</p>
