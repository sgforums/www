              <p>Sometimes, it could also be mutual. Like the commanders asked if he can still continue since its lower limb, and that if he dont feel well during the training, he can stop anytime. That kind of agreement.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I've seen some commanders who are like that. </p>
              <p>People who report sick due to URTI, kena called "pussy" or "ku niang."  So sometimes, we'd just suck it up and don't report sick.  "Pain is temporary, Pride is forever." </p>
              <p>Or sometimes on att B, we'd just insist on participating.  Sort of "indirecT" pressure.</p>

              <p>wow...sometimes i'm realli amazed at the narrow point of view of some people who post on forums..and i realised how comfortable youngsters...or if there are adults here...how these adults get so comfortable with life..don't start pointing and blaming without using the pile of soft tissue in that skull of urs...</p>
              <p>when u're in NS..u have to be responsible for what u do..if what the report from mindef is right..then more than 50% of the fault lies with the deceased..i apologise on my remarks...but it's true..it's the responsibility of the men to look after themselves on their own side..and ur commanders can onli do it to a certain extent...if u got att C and don't tell anyone...juz go for training..u wanna blame who...?the commander..?the MOD..?the officer..?ur bunkmate..?or urself..?no one knows ur body better than u do..if u know there's something wrong...don't go ahead and push urself..there's no meter on our foreheads to show our condition or rpm..anyone here managed to install one..?can suggest to the SAF...but till then..i think it's truly the men's responsibility to care for themselves..</p>
              <p><br>no commanders will force u to participate..they care for u also...they will encourage u..juz like ur parents might encourage u to eat more vege...coz it's ur own good..but they don't tied u down and inject vege juice into ur veins..ask the commanders.."sir, isit ur responsibility to encourage the men to participate in the activities more..?"..a responsible commander would always say yes..but if "sir..do u ask ur sick or unfit men to participate in the activities?"..they will say.."yes..but onli if it doesn't involve risking them <strong>and</strong> if they themselves feel that they can deal with the activity at their status"...so some responsibility lies with the commander..especially when the commander has so many men to look after..the men themselves have responsibility too..</p>
              <p>another point to note and question...where is the deceased's buddy...`?we have a buddy when we're in army don't we..?this buddy got to care for u and u got to care for ur buddy too..where did this guy go...?so who's fault isit...?the MOD...?he wasn't even there..?u ever heard the CEO of HP suddenly out of the blue call a front sales staff to ask if he is okie and ask him to step off duty..?</p>

              at Lim Chu Kang Camp on Tuesday morning had been given three days
              of medical leave on Sunday for a hamstring strain.</strong></p>
              <p>Relatives and friends learnt of this as they paid their last
              respects to the full—time National Serviceman at the Ubi Teochew
              Parlour on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p><strong>Private Foo collapsed while doing chin—ups at Lim Chu
              Kang camp</strong>. The Ministry of Defence said he was brought to
              hospital where he died shortly after.</p>
              <p><strong>It’s learnt that Mindef is investigating why Private Foo
              was training while on medical leave.</strong></p>
              <p>Private Foo will be cremated at Mandai Crematorium on Thursday
              morning.</p>
              <p>Many remember him as an athletic young man who liked to play
              basketball.</p>
              <p>Clifton Seah, the cousin of Private Foo, said: "I’m very
              shocked. He was a fine young man. My brother was on the phone with
              him barely 12 hours before he died. It’s a great loss." — CNA</p>

              <p>i juz hate the way u post ur question ready to blame people on the higher level management..have u even serve NS yet...?u know what's the significance of NS..?what role does the SAF play in this country...?what's the bigger question here..?can u be trusted to protect singapore in the times of uncertainty..?can u run the extra km knowing that the lives of ur own family and wife and kids are at risk...?or will u sit on the battlefield playing ur psp...?could u as a top management of a big company protect every single employee from getting fired if the employee don't even care about themselves..?</p>
              <p>and what expendable..?u think the saf realli treat their men as expendable..?u ever saw foreign armies..?u're talking about the army...the defence of the country..but if they think nsmen like us are expendable..u think they will have a term called "peace-time-training"..?then again..u should ask urself..do u treat urself as expendable..?and..u know what is chain of command...?u submit ur MC to ur form teacher or direct to ur principal..?or direct to Minister of Education..?</p>
              <p>it is a tragic loss..truly i feel it..but maybe we shouldn't start blaming people for it..someone alive may hold a small responsibility..but ultimately..we have to look deeper and still open our eyes to the big picture...</p>
              <p>and i forget to mention this in my previous post..i first apologise to who it may concern..maybe the parents and friends around him could have done more to caution him and warn him on such health hazards..but who wans to get blamed..?</p>
              <p>could u DR Who...?could u have done more to prevent his fate..?should the blame be placed on u too..?</p>

              <p>Another poor NS guy dies..number 4 dis year..but there are many
                  more suffering outside. I urge all those who care to protest to the
                  Government as death during NS is a Very Big issue. Since i am also
                  a <span>NSF</span>, i know there are just so many gaps in
                  the training. I took MC and was really sick..i must go to jalan
                  Beser to submit the MC and go back home (stay in Tampines)as i am a
                  scdf. During the moring training, the instructor will always ask
                  who is not feeling well infront of 100hundreds of other
                  trainnes..how can anyone dare to voice out??</p>
              <p>I am really very angry with the Government as they only give the
                  Family a little bit of $$ and shut their mouth up and bring the
                  issue to an end.<br> Remember this is already the number 4 death..we NS guys a treated
                  like Bangaldash worker.. i die die also have a Diploma. F the
                  Government.</p>

              <p>think it's a good point u bring up here..about the reporting of the MC..maybe more can be done..but then again...i have a question for u...</p>
              <p>would u risk ur life or would u juz jolly well step out...?pride or life..?</p>
              <p>and to everyone one out there..would u rather this guy step out and step aside..?or would u rather this guy die in ur camp's training session..?he might juz be standing beside u and collapse...think about it...</p>
              <p>there maybe more than a way to ask if anyone is not feeling well..but we're all men..all born different..even our eyeballs are different in size..so u wanna blame someone for not feeling well..?would u laugh at someone who stands out and excuse himself from the training..?then maybe u would be the one who should be blame for such instances...because u've created a mockery out of these people such that others dare not step up even if their life is at risk..tycoapollo...think about it the next time u walk into the training ground with ur buddy...</p>
              <p>about ur money from the government issue..u got to ask..who's responsibility isit..?totally the government...?is the family onli getting that single amount from the government for it..?the family didn't buy insurance for the deceased..?who's responsibility is it for buying insurance for the deceased..?the family..?or the government..?coz as far as i know..the government has already educate it's people to buy insurance..did u buy any..?if u have a road accident and pass on, yet don't have any insurance..u blame LTA...?and what exactly is the use of this insurance money when u get it..?u get ultimately rich and gain a profit out of someone else's death...?or is it for the family to deal with the after expenses of the deceased and to cope with the sudden turn of financial burden in the next few years to come..?</p>
              <p>lastly..there's a phrase that i learnt some years ago..and it has brought mi good ever since..</p>
              <p><strong>"Treat onto urself how u want others to treat onto u."</strong></p>
              <p>if u treat urself like a bangladesh..people will treat u like one...if u treat urself like a soldier..u will be treated like a soldier..what do u treat urself as..?</p>

              <p>Much as I sympatise with him, I have to say he is partially for his own death.</p>
              <p>If he has an MC. why didn't he sound out and be excused instead of going through the morning exercise? He should be responsible enough for his own health to not push himself. Now his parents are the only ones that mourn his death. Is that the way he account to his parents? He would rather have 'face' among his peers then think of his family? That's the mentality of so many youths nowadays.</p>

              exercise often in order to have a strong heart so that they don't

              <p>when u're in NS..u have to be responsible for what u do..if what the report from mindef is right..then more than 50% of the fault lies with the deceased..i apologise on my remarks...but it's true..it's the responsibility of the men to look after themselves on their own side..and ur commanders can onli do it to a certain extent...if u got att C and don't tell anyone...juz go for training..u wanna blame who...?the commander..?the MOD..?the officer..?ur bunkmate..?or urself..?no one knows ur body better than u do..if u know there's something wrong...don't go ahead and push urself..there's no meter on our foreheads to show our condition or rpm..anyone here managed to install one..?can suggest to the SAF...but till then..i think it's truly the men's responsibility to care for themselves..</p>
              <p><br>no commanders will force u to participate..they care for u also...they will encourage u..juz like ur parents might encourage u to eat more vege...coz it's ur own good..but they don't tied u down and inject vege juice into ur veins..ask the commanders.."sir, isit ur responsibility to encourage the men to participate in the activities more..?"..a responsible commander would always say yes..but if "sir..do u ask ur sick or unfit men to participate in the activities?"..they will say.."yes..but onli if it doesn't involve risking them <strong>and</strong> if they themselves feel that they can deal with the activity at their status"...so some responsibility lies with the commander..especially when the commander has so many men to look after..the men themselves have responsibility too..</p>
              <p>another point to note and question...where is the deceased's buddy...`?we have a buddy when we're in army don't we..?this buddy got to care for u and u got to care for ur buddy too..where did this guy go...?so who's fault isit...?the MOD...?he wasn't even there..?u ever heard the CEO of HP suddenly out of the blue call a front sales staff to ask if he is okie and ask him to step off duty..?</p>

              <p><br>Go look through the Straits Times or any local Forums' archives on reports of NS related deaths, and you tell me just how ISOLATED this is. And estimate for yourself how much SAF/Mindef have so far compensated (if amount is S$111k) to local parents for the loss of sons to date.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: <strong>20—year—old Private Joe Foo Wei Rong who died at Lim Chu Kang Camp on Tuesday morning had been given three days of medical leave on Sunday for a hamstring strain.</strong></p>
              <p>Relatives and friends learnt of this as they paid their last respects to the full—time National Serviceman at the Ubi Teochew Parlour on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p><strong>Private Foo collapsed while doing chin—ups at Lim Chu Kang camp</strong>. The Ministry of Defence said he was brought to hospital where he died shortly after.</p>
              <p><strong>It’s learnt that Mindef is investigating why Private Foo was training while on medical leave.</strong></p>
              <p>Private Foo will be cremated at Mandai Crematorium on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p>Many remember him as an athletic young man who liked to play basketball.</p>
              <p>Clifton Seah, the cousin of Private Foo, said: "I’m very shocked. He was a fine young man. My brother was on the phone with him barely 12 hours before he died. It’s a great loss." — CNA</p>
