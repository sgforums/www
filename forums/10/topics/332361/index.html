              <p>SINGAPORE: <strong>20—year—old Private Joe Foo Wei Rong who
                                      died at Lim Chu Kang Camp on Tuesday morning had been given three
                                      days of medical leave on Sunday for a hamstring strain.</strong></p>
              <p>Relatives and friends learnt of this as they paid their last
                                      respects to the full—time National Serviceman at the Ubi Teochew
                                      Parlour on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p><strong>Private Foo collapsed while doing chin—ups at Lim Chu Kang camp</strong>.
                                      The Ministry of Defence said he was brought to hospital where he
                                      died shortly after.</p>
              <p><strong>It’s learnt that Mindef is investigating why Private Foo was
                                      training while on medical leave.</strong></p>
              <p>Private Foo will be cremated at Mandai Crematorium on Thursday
                                      morning.</p>
              <p>Many remember him as an athletic young man who liked to play
                                      basketball.</p>
              <p>Clifton Seah, the cousin of Private Foo, said: "I’m very
                                      shocked. He was a fine young man. My brother was on the phone with
                                      him barely 12 hours before he died. It’s a great loss." —

              they just take action against the platoon commander and cover up cock

              <p>can a person die suddenly from a hamstring injury?I dunno...I am not the expert...but assuming the death is unrelated to the hamstring... then it seems pretty suay to be investigated on SOP when the MC has got nothing to do with the death...I am quite sure we all know that procedures arent always followed...both in SAF and elsewhere.</p>

              <p>Well, I know my view is optimistic and you will say "wah, bullshit how can someone die just from chin up, even if no chin up he may also die"</p>
              <p>but, lets say even if he die, he won't die during NS (forgive me if I doesn't sounds right here). My point is the blame is on those people in NS who like to dig their grave and add one more tragedy into the history of NS. Why ask the guy with MC to do chin up?</p>

              <p>If you think about it,</p>

              <p>Well, I know my view is optimistic and you will say "wah,
              bullshit how can someone die just from chin up, even if no chin up
              he may also die"</p>
              <p>but, lets say even if he die, he won't die during NS (forgive me
              if I doesn't sounds right here). My point is the blame is on those
              people in NS who like to dig their grave and add one more tragedy
              into the history of NS. Why ask the guy with MC to do chin up?</p>

              <p>during my last ICT. i already write in suggestion that NS men should have a different IPPT passing critieria compare to regulars and full time NSmen. the current system that base on age groups are irrelevant and fail to take consideration that while working and take care of family , we has limited time for keeping fit.</p>

              Another poor NS guy dies..number 4 dis year..but there are many more suffering outside. I urge all those who care to protest to the Government as death during NS is a Very Big issue. Since i am also a NSF, i know there are just so many gaps in the training. I took MC and was really sick..i must go to jalan Beser to submit the MC and go back home (stay in Tampines)as i am a scdf. During the moring training, the instructor will always ask who is not feeling well infront of 100hundreds of other trainnes..how can anyone dare to voice out??
              
              I am really very angry with the Government as they only give the Family a little bit of $$ and shut their mouth up and bring the issue to an end. 
              Remember this is already the number 4 death..we NS guys a treated like Bangaldash worker.. i die die also have a Diploma. F the Government.
              
              Protest Prtoest Protest..The Ministry Of Defense pls step down..

              <p>How many more? I wonder, just wonder, how many more must die before Mindef bucks up? Literally, up their bucks so that people, DO NOT die unnecessarily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cover up stories or whatever, a screw-up is a screw-up right from the beginning. WHY didn't and DON'T they spend more, on medical screenings of new enlistees??? Too costly? Eating into operating costs? Too much work? Lack of expertise? WHAT? WTF?!?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The previous death was also Cardiac related, and in the papers the 'relevant authorities' said that it would be TOO COSTLY to provide Cardiac Ultrasound scans to determine enlistee's cardiac health. Imagine, a First World and World Class country - and such attention to details on medical screenings for its own soldiers TOO COSTLY??? I know, so they say it is onto the parents to provide such high level high cost checkups. Hey man, what's new with this government we are perpetually stuck with?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean, lifestyle of the young these days are saturated with high cholesterol food; burgers, fries, fried chickens, bubble teas, etc etc. Academic excellence means liitle time to play, and play usually means seated in front of the PC gaming away the hours. Do you think young people are generally healthy now a days?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is HIGH TIME Mindef wakes up their old stuffy ideas, and re-assess the general health of enlistees before they further reduce the population of True Blooded Singaporeans. Spend some money to advertise on TV encourage schooling teens who are at least 3 years to enlistment to watch their diets, &amp; exercise often in order to have a strong heart so that they don't friggin drop dead during training. Generally EDUCATE the young society to prepare for NS and not let their health sink to a dangerous point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where the hell are the government's foresight??? Afterall this is not like the first case, or as they would love to phrase "isolated case". Friggin learn from it for once for Christ sake! Get it right for crying out loud.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People aren't Guinnea Pigs for Trial and Error approach to defense force buidling!</p>
