            <div class='col-md body'>veteran MP Loh Meng See also announced his retirement from politics. Mr Loh, 57, who took over the Kampong Glam ward from the late Mr S Rajaratnam in 1988, had dubbed himself Â“one of the last MohicansÂ” during an earlier interview with TODAY. The MP had asked to step down and will be replaced by newbie Denise Phua, 46, acting principal for Pathlight School.<br><br>Â“Obviously, along the way, because of my principles and unyielding position in some of the areas Â— well, I make no apologies Â— I could have upset some people in the process Â… Politics is about always sticking to your fundamental beliefs,Â” aid Mr Loh, who had previously spoken out against having a casino here, even after the decision was made.<br><br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/202426/1/.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do we need to condemn MPs who spoke against the casino proposal.<br><br>Which is more important, having more yesmen produced by the whip to serve party interest or objective and accountable MPs who could speak up for us in parliament.<br><br>What do you think will happen to our country if we continue to allow our ministers to utter and present only one-sided policies which serve on the narrow interests of increasing surpluses or elitism based on broad-brushed assumptions.<br><br>Even today, if we are going to consider the casino issue again, it may be found that those who spoke against casino proposal might not be wrong.<br><br>So why do we want to banish them to siberia so young. Having a casino may not necessarily be a correct decision unless more is done to convince the people that definitely the impact is positive - job creation and overwhelming benefits in spinning all other sectors of the economy and not just tourism.<br><br>I have not seen any economic master plan being put forward to justify casino to show such impact. All that we are told is that casino will create jobs based on assumptions not really carefully planned master plan to use casino to bolster the whole economy throughout all sectors.<br><br>Given the marginal benefits of some tourism job creation it may not be worth all the social problems and moral degradation that will happen to the whole society thereafter. If Mr. Loh Meng See has his convictions about such issue, it is good to take the cue from the people and go and join the opposition to serve the citizens on this matter of conscience. If we can do away with casino and grow the economy on real talented management of the economy we should try harder especially if our economy can do without one.</div>
