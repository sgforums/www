            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at history of the political dissidents or even that of the political opposition you will realise that we are talking about men with solid credentials and excellent academic qualification. Men who were judged to be able to hold high office. However once they take on the position of opposition they become dishonest liars,cheat and what not. How the hell they were chosen to hold their previous position shows the poor judgement of the people/system that appointed them in the first place. That itself should insult the intelligence of the educated people. Overnight, I'm a morphed from being a judge,lawyer,lecturer, to a cheat, liar and idiot...damn the opposition, they are such a bad influence on me....LOL</div>

It would not take long before we have our very own "freedom figher" who the orginal historical records might call "opportunist" or a "covert resistance fighter" who was just working for the Japanese. All this has happen and Japan and China are still arguing over what actually happened. But then we have no one who will argue with us...</div>
