              <p>Police called her family at 9 am on <strong>Thursday</strong> morning to ask them to pick up Madam Voon Chot Yin from the Tanglin police station.</p>
              <p>A member of the public found her wandering in a daze along Kim Yam Road at 3.30am on Thursday and alerted the police.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>But her family says the immigration authorities' arrival records indicate that she had somehow made her way back here on <strong>Sunday</strong> - without her bus ticket or her passport and with less than $20 on her.</p>
              <p>...</p>

              <p>so...</p>
              <p>this old granny came to the sg customs without her passport (let's not speculate how she manage to get pass the my customs. Customs officers are usually more concerned with ppl coming INTO their country than with ppl LEAVING their country)</p>
              <p>our customs officers somehow managed to verify that she's one of ours and decide to let her through even though she doesn't have her travel documents with her.</p>
              <p>AND THEN, they decide to simply let her loose on the streets? None of them felt the need to find out why or how she's there without her passport?</p>

              <p>No idea, report didn't say. But I guess it makes sense for custom to let her in if they some how know she is Singaporean. I mean if my grandma somehow turn up at custom, then the custom refuse to let her in and just let her wander off back into Malaysia even though they knew she is Singaporean, I will be damn angry at the customs lor.</p>

              <p><br>this has to be a rare exception.</p>
              <p>imagine ppl coming in claiming to be singaporeans and insists to come into sunny sgp. how do they handle this? even if they let ol' grandma in, they have to get written details from her to confirm. it is gonna be tedious. grandma got dementia some more, probably disorientated and confused.</p>
              <p>i think there is some cover up somewhere.</p>
              <p>postnote: huang na's killer, that MYsian guy, have demonstrated it is not difficult walking past sgp immigration undetected. i guess coming into singapore has the same flaws.</p>

              <p>the other day, as i came in thru 2nd link, i saw a male ICA cop wearing make up and walk like a lady, i asked the counter officer why ICA can employ guy like this??? he told me, ICA is shorthanded, they need at least 1000 more officers, but at the moment, no choice, ladyboy also take.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess internally, ICA at immigration checkpoint have some working problem, most of them are doing multi tasking, they look gloomy and unhealthy maybe this is due to short handed and long hours of working, these may result in heckcare attitude, therefore in the situation like a demantia old ah ma, nobody want to care about it.</p>
              <p>Something must be done by the management to look into the problem.</p>

              <p>Culture? yeah right....<br><br>In fact, I would say the culture here in Singapore is this "Do anything you like but don't get caught". <br><br>So the ICA officer main concerns are double portion. If he is corrupt and screw the FT lady as bribe, he has to be sure that he do it right so that he will not be framed. <br><br>And talking about doing it right.....you not off to your pub yet?<br><br><br></p>
