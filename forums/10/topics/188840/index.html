I imagine that someone who earns $600/month will be extremely grateful to the government.<br><br>Of course, as stated by Chris Neo, the government could really be regarded as benevolent and generous only if this was their money! But this isn't. This is the tax payers' money.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The leader said it was crucial to benchmark ministers millions' salaries to the highest paid private sector executives or bosses to prevent corruption.<br><br>If Jack Welch or Bill Gates work in Singapore, our ministers' salaries might be benchmarked another 10 times or more I believe. Now our GLC CEOs like MediaCorp, Comfort, PSA and seconded ex-army or ex-politicians are being paid millions by way of benchmarking or upgrading as if to justify ministers' salary push.<br><br>That is why our economy has been declining since the 1970s losing out in competitiveness because of the super-inflated salaries of CEOs and the top layers. But workers would be the ones to get their wages and CPF cut in any recessions not the top layers.<br><br>Union did not raise objections or alternative solutions to problems regarding competitiveness due to self-rewards of highest salaries pushed by questionable benchmarking practices.<br><br>Hundreds of thousands are not good enough to make men desist temptation. This kind of leadership is based on concepts and assumptions.<br><br>Well UMNO had sacked one minister for corruption - buying of votes is a corrupt act. We are supposed to be a first wprld country. Yet our leaders say giving of free monies to citizens 6 days before polling is not corruption despite receiving the million dollar to prevent corruption.<br><br>By coincidence perhaps a few days before last election similar goodies or monies were given to the electorate in the form of ERS. So what is corruption and who defines corruption. Will the judges refer to the statutory definition which states : giving of monies, kind or gratuities in exchange or expectation of favour is corruption. If not will they refer to Oxford or Chamber. If they still cannot come to a definition of corruption, then who will define corruption.<br><br>We are placed at the top of the corruption free index. Is the index updated to include distribution of monies to electorate in election. Is it reliable?</div>
