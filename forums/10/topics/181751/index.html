            <div class='col-md body'>gee i could actually tell u why Singaporeans seem to be fairly unpopular elsewhere, but it would offend those with a delicate sense of blind national pride, u know, the same group of people who simply refuse to acknowledge that Singapore faces many problems and is not the utopia they imagine it to be. The same group of people who make the rest of us unpopular, with the ugly image they project. No I can't say more, because it would offend them. If I say anymore they would start to blindly label me a 'quitter' or some other brainless unjustified label.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing I can say for sure is that Singapore cannot go about forging diplomatic ties and cultivating good relationships with every countries out there. Certainly in some point in time, Singapore will be force to take side.<br><br>Diplomacy policy is a double-edge sword. If improperly handled, its citizens will suffered from the spill-over effect no doubt, yet being friendly and a 'yes' man at each world government meets certainly do not reflect too well either!<br><br>Instead of questioning on the popularity of Singaporeans oversea, shouldnt we ourselves as civilised citizens reflect upon the government polices and determined who is right and who is wrong instead of turning to boycotting like what the minority of petty citizens in some other country had done before.<br><br>In my opinion, unless we are very sure that our government had tackled international issues recklessly and neglect national survivality and progress entirely, if not, saying Singaporeans are unpopular oversea is generally not a fair statement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

The same group of people who make the rest of us unpopular, with the ugly image they project. No I can't say more, because it would offend them. If I say anymore they would start to blindly label me a 'quitter' or some other brainless unjustified label. </div></blockquote>you are not quitter, you are just too unique in your own ways that you are finding it hard to blend into the conservative singapore society.<br><br></div>
