Such non-prosecution or leniency suggests that blogs or internets were modern communication facilities for personal outreach and not exactly as public as the national newspapers. Treatments of pornography or other offences over private blogs or internets should be understood fully in their own perspective before further extension of general laws over such communications.</div>

Remember Micheal Faye?

However because white MRT stations had become a hot political potato so its associations to white elephant is too apparent a threat to tranquility of the masses.<br><br>There will be a case of implications of white elephant than as serious enough to merit attention and investigation whereas nudity of sarong party girl has no such implications but can be viewed as art.<br><br>The decision of the police then will depend on overall political control agenda. If racism is a good case to extend the long arm of sedition law which will also give follow-up police power to justify more control on the net posting, then there will be a case for investigation and action as that will be a good political agenda. For nudity the case for intervention on net posting might not be as sound. GRC was conceived of for racial harmony or balance but there is a political agenda behind as well - political positions will be hampered from fielding larger no. of group candidates to form the next alternative government.</div>
