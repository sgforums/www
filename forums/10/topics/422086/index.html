              				Chin Siong vs Lee Kuan Yew: The true and shocking history <br><br>Part
              				I: Our man <br></strong>08 Jul 07<strong><br><br></strong>"The
              				men who led Singapore to self-government and independence were
              				swift to produce an authorized version of their struggle…,”
              				historian T N Harper observes, "it began with Lee Kuan Yew's
              				dramatic broadcasts as Prime Minister on Radio Malaya in 1961.
              				The plot and the moral of this story are clear: by the political
              				resolve and tactical acumen of its leaders, the fragile
              				city-state weathers the perils of a volatile age and emerges into
              				an era of stability and prosperity."<br><br>However, much to
              				the discomfort of the Minister Mentor who hitherto has had a
              				relatively free reign in portraying "the period as one in
              				which Lim Chin Siong and the left were outmanoeuvred by the
              				tactically more astute Lee Kuan Yew," Harper cautions that
              				"authoritative new archival research sheds new light on the
              				high politics of the period."<br><br>In other words, Lee's
              				bravado with which he presently speaks covers up much that took
              				place during those years. <br><br>In truth, Lim Chin Siong's fate
              				was sealed right from the very beginning by the power of the
              				British colonialists – and not Lee Kuan's political
              				prowess. <br><br>At that time British authorities were already
              				devising ways on how to stop Lim's ascent in Singapore's
              				politics. Southeast Asia historian, Greg Poulgrain, writes that
              				"In the Public Record Office in London are some of the
              				observations and stratagems pursued by both the Colonial and
              				Foreign Office – revealed now more than thirty years after
              				the events – on how to deal with this rising star, Lim
              				Siong Chin."<br><br>With Singaporeans becoming more educated
              				and the advent of the Internet, events surrounding the heroics of
              				Lee and his PAP during the period of independence and merger with
              				Malaya "no longer looks so unilinear and uncontested."<br><br><strong>The
              				emergence of Lim Chin Siong<br></strong><br>Harper recounts the
              				"meteoric" rise of Lim Chin Siong as a student and
              				trade union leader in the early 1950s who was at the heart of the
              				anti-colonial politics that had erupted all over Asia following
              				World War II. <br><br>By unifying the labour movement and
              				galvanizing the overwhelmingly Chinese-speaking electorate
              				through his formidable oratorical skills (he once told his
              				massive audience: "<em>Saya masuk</em> first gear, l<em>u
              				jangan gostan</em>!" – "When I go into the first
              				gear, don't you go into reverse!"), Lim captured the
              				attention of the masses.<br><br>And Lee Kuan Yew's too. This led
              				to an association between the two men and the subsequent
              				formation of the PAP. The anglophile Lee (Harry, as he once
              				wanted to be called) saw the power of his younger
              				Chinese-educated comrade. <br><br>Even within the PAP, "Lim
              				eclipsed Lee Kuan Yew and other leaders in the popular following
              				he commanded..."<br><br>But in his memoirs, <em>The Singapore
              				Story</em>, published in 1998 Lee Kuan Yew condescendingly
              				described Lim as "modest, humble and well-behaved, with a
              				dedication to his cause that won my reluctant admiration and
              				respect."<br><br>The truth is that Lee didn't have much of a
              				choice. Lim Chin Siong was at the front, back and center of a
              				political movement that commanded national attention. From all
              				accounts, Lee would have been marginalized if his parasitic
              				instincts had not been so acute.<br><br>Popular as he was
              				locally, Lim Chin Siong did not confine his politics to within
              				Singapore. Despite British efforts to isolate the island from
              				anti-imperial movements that engulfed much of Empire, Lim would
              				draw inspiration from liberation movements elsewhere in Africa
              				and Asia. <br><br>His speeches in the early 1960s repeatedly made
              				reference to events in the colonial world as well as to South
              				Africa, Korea, and Turkey. This sense of internationalism had a
              				"deep resonance" in Singapore. <br><br>The colonial
              				government countered by censoring imported reading material.
              				"This," writes Harper, "would continue, even
              				intensify, after self-government as the PAP government
              				increasingly saw itself as pitted against what Lee Kuan Yew was
              				to term the ‘anti-colonialism' of global liberation
              				movements." <br><br>In other words, Lee was not the hero who
              				led the fight for Singapore's freedom. This might come as a shock
              				to some but as declassified documents reveal, it was Lim Chin
              				Siong who insisted that Singaporeans' freedom and independence
              				were not for compromise.<br><br>It was also "what really
              				caused the British authorities to consider [Lim] such a
              				threat."<br><br><strong>The talks collapse…<br></strong><br>When
              				David Marshall became the chief minister after his Labour Front
              				won the elections in 1955, he organised a delegation to London
              				the following year to negotiate independence from the British.
              				Marshall included both Lim Chin Siong and Lee Kuan Yew in his
              				team.<br><br>The chief minister fought hard, some say too hard,
              				to wrest power from the British in the internal affairs of
              				Singapore. He opposed Britain's power to appoint the police chief
              				who in turn had power over the Special Branch, as it was then
              				known. It was the Special Branch that gave the authorities the
              				power of detention without trial. <br><br>The idea of retaining
              				the power of internal security whilst granting self-government,
              				Marshall accused the British, was like serving "Christmas
              				pudding and arsenic sauce." <br><br>Lim Chin Siong supported
              				the chief minister on this and demanded a constitution that
              				transferred power to the local government with only defence and
              				foreign relations left in British hands. <br><br>The British
              				refused the demand and the talks collapsed. Marshall returned to
              				Singapore frustrated and, amidst condemnation by Lee Kuan Yew,
              				resigned as chief minister. <br><br><strong>...Lim Chin Siong is
              				detained…<br></strong><br>Lim Yew Hock took over the position
              				and led another visit to London the following year, which again
              				included Lee Kuan Yew. But this time, Marshall and Lim Chin Siong
              				were not part of the negotiating team. <br><br>More accurately,
              				Lim Chin Siong could not go because Lim Yew Hock, as chief
              				minister, had placed him under arrest, ostensibly for instigating
              				a riot.<br><br>The episode began when Chief Minister Lim closed
              				down a Chinese women's group and a musical association. A week
              				later, he banned the Chinese Middle School Union which provoked
              				further unhappiness with the locals.<br><br>Undeterred he
              				arrested Chinese student leaders and shut down more organizations
              				and schools, including the Chinese High School and the Chung
              				Cheng High School. Given the already tense situation between the
              				Chinese-speaking people and the colonial authorities, this was a
              				highly provocative act. <br><br>At that time any Singaporean
              				leader worth his salt could not have sat by idly. And so Lim Chin
              				Siong came to the fore and spoke up for the students. The late
              				Devan Nair, former Singapore president, joined in.<br><br>A
              				12-day stay-in was organised at one of the schools and Lim Chin
              				Siong was scheduled to speak at a nearby park one evening. <br><br>It
              				wasn't long before the police appeared and ringed the crowd.
              				Suddenly a mob started throwing stones at the police who then
              				charged with batons and tear-gas.<br><br>Violence erupted and
              				spread, with police stations being attacked and cars burned. By
              				the end of the chaos 2,346 people were arrested and more than a
              				dozen Singaporeans were killed. <br><br>The blame was squarely
              				pinned on Lim Chin Siong who was arrested.<br><br>But did Lim
              				Chin Siong really cause the mayhem? Who was the "mob"
              				that started attacking the police?<br><br>At that time, Chief
              				Minister Lim made no bones that the Lim Chin Siong was the front
              				man for the communists who had started the violence. Lim was
              				arrested by the Special Branch the following day. <br><br>Lim
              				vehemently denied this accusation and countered that the chief
              				minister was a colonial stooge. As declassified documents now
              				reveal, Lim Chin Siong was largely right.<br><br>Entitled <em>Extract
              				from a note of a meeting between Secretary of State and Singapore
              				Chief Minister, 12 December 1956</em>, the archival note recorded
              				that it was Chief Minister Lim who "had provoked the riots
              				and this had enabled the detention of Lim Chin Siong."<br><br>Poulgrain
              				even documents that full-scale military assistance was requested
              				by prior arrangement. Singapore Governor, William Goode,
              				acknowledged that the colonial government was not beyond
              				employing the tactic of provoking a riot and then using the
              				outcome to "achieve a desired political result."<br><br>Indeed,
              				Poulgrain noted that "[Public Record Office] documents show
              				these were the tactics of provocation that were employed in the
              				1956 riots that led to Lim Chin Siong's arrest." <br><br>A
              				few weeks after Lim Chin Siong was behind bars, Lim Yew Hock
              				visited London in December 1956 and was "warmly
              				congratulated on the outcome by Alan Lennox-Boyd, Secretary of
              				State for the Colonies."<br><br>And yet, in his memoirs, the
              				Minister Mentor concludes that the Malayan Communist Party "in
              				charge of Lim Chin Siong" were behind the whole affair and
              				that Lim Yew Hock had purged Singapore of the communist
              				ringleaders.<br><br>…<strong>and the talks are resurrected<br></strong><br>And
              				so in the 1957 with Lim Chin Siong under detention, Lim Yew Hock
              				led the delegation to London. But during the negotiations, it was
              				Lee who "played a crucial role in sweeping away the earlier
              				obstacles to agreement on internal security by resurrecting the
              				proposal for an Internal Security Council (ISC)." <br><br>The
              				ISC was structured in a way that Britain and Malaya outweighed
              				Singapore in the outfit. Why was the PAP supportive of such an
              				arrangement? <br><br>Historian Simon Ball said it best: "Lee
              				wanted an elected government but not one that could be blamed for
              				suppressing its own citizens."<br><br>Even more damning was
              				an archival "Top Secret" document that recorded: "Lee
              				was confidentially said that he values the [Internal Security]
              				Council as a potential ‘scape-goat' for unpopular measures
              				he will wish to take against subversive activities."<br><br>But
              				the PAP continues the charade. Recall what Dr Ow Chin Hock wrote
              				in his letter in 1996 about the arrest of Lim Chin Siong and
              				other Barisan leaders: "The [ISC] had a British chairman,
              				two British members, one Malaysian members and three Singaporean
              				members. Together these four non-Singaporeans outnumbered the
              				three Singaporeans on the council."<br><br>In any event,
              				unlike the one led by David Marshall, the negotiations in 1957
              				had little spine and gave away too much of Singaporeans' rights.
              				As a result, both sides expeditiously reached an agreement for
              				self-government, an agreement that Marshall called "<em>tiga
              				suku busok merdeka</em>" (three-quarters rotten
              				independence).<br><br>But self-government was not the only
              				subject being discussed. On the side, the British also wanted to
              				introduce a clause that would bar ex-detainees, or subversives as
              				the authorities called them, from standing for elections.<br><br>Lee
              				supported such a move – one that he would surely have known
              				would cripple party comrade Lim Chin Siong's political career.
              				<br><br>In his memoirs, however, Lee Kuan Yew wrote: "I
              				objected to [the introduction of the clause] saying that ‘the
              				condition is disturbing both because it is a departure from the
              				democratic practice and because there is no guarantee that the
              				government in power will not use this procedure to prevent not
              				only the communist but also democratic opponents of their policy
              				from standing for elections'."<br><br>A declassified British
              				memo contradicts this: "Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party
              				with Lim Yew Hock in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the
              				‘subversives ban'."<br><br>Perhaps this is not
              				surprising as the British had noted that the "present
              				leadership of the PAP is obsessed with the need to persuade the
              				politically unsophisticated masses that the PAP is ‘on
              				their side' and this involves demonstrating that the PAP is not a
              				friend of the foreigner…"<br><br>And this is perhaps
              				the reason why Lee told Britain's Secretary of State, Alan
              				Lennox-Boyd: "I will have to denounce [the clause]. You will
              				have to take responsibility."<br><br><strong>London to the
              				rescue…again<br></strong><br>A few months after Lee returned
              				from the constitutional talks in London in March 1957, the PAP
              				conducted elections of its executive council. Lim Chin Siong was
              				still under detention and could not challenge Lee for the party's
              				leadership. <br><br>Lim's supporters, however, outnumbered Lee's
              				rightwing faction and were elected to the executive council of
              				the PAP. <br><br>The British, through Lim Yew Hock who was by
              				then "viewed as an altogether more compliant tool of the
              				security apparatus," ordered the arrest of Lim Chin Siong's
              				supporters, thereby securing Lee Kuan Yew's continued control of
              				the party. <br><br>Harper records, that despite Lee's protests
              				against the crackdown of his party's leftwing, "not all were
              				convinced of his innocence in the matter."<br><br>In his
              				1998 memoirs, Lee Kuan Yew describes the fateful detention of the
              				PAP's leftwing leaders by giving much prominence to Lim Yew
              				Hock's decision while adroitly playing down the role of the
              				British.<br><br>After the talks in 1957, and given the
              				stubbornness of Marshall and Lim in the 1956 talks, the British
              				were persuaded that Lee was their man.<br><br>Another set of
              				talks were arranged in May 1958 and thereafter "there was an
              				unspoken assumption that the PAP would govern after the 1959
              				elections."<br><br>Writer T J S George repeated this
              				observation that "repeated [British] intervention to ensure
              				Lee Kuan Yew's political survival confirmed the feeling that Lee
              				was by now Britain's chosen man for Singapore."<br><br>Poulgrain
              				recounted his own experience with British intelligence officers
              				who were operating in Singapore in the early 1960s. One told him
              				about a group of officers who were listening in on Lee Kuan Yew
              				making a speech, railing against British imperialism. <br><br>"The
              				diatribe," Poulgrain writes, "brought only a jocular
              				response from this group, one of whom openly commented that Lee
              				was going a ‘bit over the top' considering that he was
              				actually ‘working with us.'" <br><br>The historian
              				states plainly that Lee Kuan Yew personified the essential
              				long-term interests of the United Kingdom in Singapore.<br><br>Lee
              				himself played up this position when he told the British
              				government that the PAP was really London's "best
              				ally."<br><br>The British agreed. Secret documents now show
              				that London's assessment was that Lim Chin Siong was increasingly
              				bringing pressure to bear on Her Majesty's Government and "unless
              				forestalled by Lee, may well be able to make the pressure
              				decisive."<br><br>Lee was grateful. He indicated that "he
              				and his other reputed moderates in the PAP regard the continued
              				presence of the British in Singapore as an assurance for
              				themselves."<br><br>From then on, despite the British
              				concerns of Lee's "totalitarian streak that rides roughshod
              				over all opposition or criticism", Lee's PAP and London
              				"became locked closer together."<br><br></span></p>

              				Jul 07<strong><br><br></strong>After securing control
              				of the PAP with the aid of the British, Lee Kuan Yew was still
              				left with the problem of the detained Lim Chin Siong and his
              				supporters. <br><br>This was a source of embarrassment for him.
              				Seeing this, Lee announced that he would secure the release of
              				his party comrades before taking office if the PAP won the
              				elections in 1959. <br><br>Behind the scenes, Lee negotiated and
              				secured the private agreement of then British Prime Minister
              				Harold Macmillan that the prisoners would be released by
              				promising that he (Lee) would "move against them if they
              				departed from the party line." <br><br>In return for
              				promising to secure their release, Lee had secured Lim Chin
              				Siong's and other detainees' pledges of allegiance to the party's
              				manifesto.<br><br>Following PAP's victory in the 1959 election,
              				Lim and six other detainees, were released. <br><br>Question: If
              				Lim Chin Siong had really been the one who started the riots in
              				1956, shouldn't he have been charged and imprisoned, rather then
              				released? <br><br>In truth the PAP and the British themselves
              				were playing fast and loose with the law. The affair confirmed
              				suspicions that all the backroom dealings was for political ends,
              				not national security.<br><br>In any event, Lee assigned Lim –
              				who, if not for all the machinations, would have been the leader
              				of the PAP and prime minister – the post of political
              				secretary in the ministry of finance, the Siberia of politics at
              				that time.<br><br>In the meantime, detentions without trial
              				continued under the new Lee government and the ISC continued to
              				be used as a front for the PAP's acts.<br><br><strong>An indecent
              				proposal<br></strong><br>Fed-up with Lee's autocratic style and the
              				delay of releasing the remaining detainees, PAP MP and mayor Ong
              				Eng Guan denounced the government for its dictatorial methods and
              				moved a motion in the Legislative Assembly to abolish the ISC.
              				<br><br>Harper wrote that because of the secrecy under which the
              				ISC operated "not all members of Lee's cabinet were aware
              				that the Singapore government had not pressed for the releases
              				since early 1960."<br><br>In his memoirs, Lee wrote that
              				"Lim Chin Siong wanted to eliminate the Internal Security
              				Council because he knew that…if it ordered the arrest and
              				detention of the communist leaders, the Singapore government
              				could not be held responsible and be stigmatized a colonial
              				stooge."<br><br>What the Minister Mentor did not say, but
              				what Harper reveals in his chapter, is shockingly contradictory:
              				"In mid-1961, therefore, to seek a way out, Lee suggested to
              				the British that his government should order the release of all
              				[the remaining] detainees, but then have that order countermanded
              				in the ISC by Britain and Malaya."<br><br>Such a craven act
              				was even rebuffed by the British. The acting Commissioner, Philip
              				Moore, stated that the British should not be "party to a
              				device for <strong><em>deliberate</em></strong> misrepresentation of
              				responsibility for continuing detentions in order to help the PAP
              				government remain in power." (emphasis added)<br><br>Moore
              				suggested that the best solution would be "to release all
              				the detainees forthwith." Lee, however, "was unwilling
              				to present the left with such a victory." <br><br>In a most
              				damning indictment, Moore said that Lee "has lived a lie
              				about the detainees for too long, giving the Party the impression
              				that he was pressing for their release while, in fact, agreeing
              				in the ISC that they should remain in detention."<br><br>And
              				if one thought that Lee Kuan Yew could not sink any lower, he
              				did. He turned to his saviours and warned that should he lose in
              				an upcoming by-election, he would call for a general election,
              				which he fully expected to lose. <br><br>This was because he was
              				facing defections in the Legislative Assembly on his refusal to
              				release the remaining detainees. And should he lose the
              				elections, he warned the colonial masters, David Marshall, Ong
              				Eng Guan and Lim Chin Siong would form the next government.
              				<br><br>This, he calculated, would be so distasteful to the
              				British that it would rally them to his side. <br><br>He
              				presented the scheme at a dinner with Commissioner Lord Selkirk,
              				Philip Moore (Selkirk's deputy), and Goh Keng Swee: Lee would
              				order the release of the prisoners, the British would stop it
              				through the ISC, and he would then announce a referendum on
              				merger with Malaya (the story behind merger is explained below).
              				<br><br>This would provoke opposition from his party mates as
              				well as Lim's supporters whom he would then banish to Malaya.<br><br>A
              				1961 memo between the then Commission in Singapore and the
              				Colonial Office in London revealed that Lee calculated that this
              				move "would force Lim Chin Siong to reveal his hand
              				completely and resort to direct action, in which event the
              				Singapore Government would relinquish power and allow the British
              				or the Federation to take over Singapore."<br><br>In short,
              				Lee was willing to sacrifice the efforts to secure the
              				independence of Singapore to achieve his own political ends!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As it turned out,
              				Selkirk wanted to have nothing to do with the "unsavoury"
              				proposal.<br><br><strong>Merger – on one condition<br></strong><br>At
              				about this time, Malaya's Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman
              				revived the idea of a federation of Malaysia consisting of the
              				Borneo territories (now Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei), Malaya (now
              				peninsular Malaysia), and Singapore. <br><br>In exchange for
              				territorial concessions in Borneo, the Tunku as the head of the
              				federation would allow Britain to maintain a strategic presence
              				in Singapore.<br><br>The proposal was put forward because the
              				Tunku was having problems of his own with the left in Malaya.
              				This was not helped by the strength of Lim Chin Siong's left in
              				Singapore. Kuala Lumpur saw the necessity of crippling Lim's
              				support and wanted Lee to be its hit-man. <br><br>For the
              				British, the idea of a Malaysian federation was an acceptable
              				compromise because it allowed London to maintain influence in the
              				region while relinquishing its colony which it was going to lose
              				anyway given the irresistible anti-colonial sentiment fanning the
              				globe at that time. <br><br>As for Lee Kuan Yew, the idea was
              				heaven sent. Harper documents that Lee saw the Tunku's concept of
              				a "Malaysia" as crucial to his own political survival
              				because of the growing strength of the left.<br><br>The left's
              				strength was amply demonstrated when Lee's rightwing faction lost
              				two by-elections in quick succession – the first to Ong Eng
              				Guan in April 1961 (Hong Lim) and the second three months later
              				to David Marshall (Anson). <br><br>Lee was rattled. Then PAP
              				chairman, Toh Chin Chye, recalled: "He was quite shocked. He
              				drew me aside after the results were announced and asked me what
              				to do. I said, 'Hang on!'" <br><br>Toh also revealed that
              				Lee had written to him that "the trade unions, the Middle
              				Road crowd wanted him to resign" and that they wanted him to
              				replace Lee as the prime minister. <br><br>Toh did not recommend
              				Lee's resignation. But the reason he gave was that it "would
              				divide the government and it would appear to the people of
              				Singapore that we were being unsteady," hardly a ringing
              				endorsement of Lee's leadership.<br><br>These developments
              				precipitated an open split between Lee and Lim Chin Siong. Lim's
              				group suspected – correctly – that Lee was up to no
              				good in his pursuit of merger with Malaysia and they openly
              				called for the abolition of the ISC.<br><br>In July 1961,
              				legislative assemblymen, parliamentary/organising secretaries,
              				and members of the PAP split from the party and formed the
              				Barisan Sosialis. Lee's party was shaved to bare bones. <br><br>At
              				the time, Harper writes, "there was an immense political
              				momentum, a sense that the future lay with the Barisan
              				Sosialis."<br><br>Even then, Lim Chin Siong never wavered in
              				his commitment to governing Singapore in a democratic way when he
              				wrote in a press statement that "any constitutional
              				arrangement must not mean a setback for the people in terms of
              				freedom and democracy."<br><br>This contrasts with the PAP's
              				demonisation of Lim as a front for the communist out to destroy
              				the democratic way. <br><br><strong>Closing in on Lim<br></strong><br>Meanwhile
              				In Malaya the Tunku insisted that Lee re-arrest Lim Chin Siong
              				before he would allow Singapore into the federation. <br><br>One
              				of the reasons was because if the detention was conducted after
              				merger, the Kuala Lumpur government would be responsible for it
              				and it would be seen as cracking down on the Chinese in
              				Singapore, increasing communal tensions.<br><br>As for Lee's
              				part, he saw the detention of Lim as his trump card and wanted to
              				secure the merger first before he moved against the Barisan
              				leader; Abdul Rahman would have no incentive to proceed with
              				merger once the threat of Lim was removed.<br><br>But the Tunku
              				was firm: No detention of Lim, no merger. Lee knew he had to
              				act.<br><br>And so a two-part plan was hatched to bait Lim and
              				colleagues: "In the first phase, the Barisan would be
              				harassed by the police and the government. This was designed to
              				provoke it into unconstitutional action, which would initiate a
              				second phase of detentions, restrictions and other actions to be
              				sanctioned by the ISC."<br><br>Lim's opposition of allowing
              				the British to retain powers of detention during the
              				constitutional talks in 1956 rang truer than ever and Marshall's
              				colourful description of "Christmas pudding and arsenic
              				sauce" were beginning to sound very apt.<br><br>The
              				diabolical scheme was vehemently opposed by the British
              				Commission in Singapore. Lord Selkirk told his superiors in
              				London that "in fact I believe that both of them (Abdul
              				Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew) wish to arrest the effective political
              				opposition and blame us for doing so." <br><br>In the months
              				leading up to Lim's arrest, Selkirk wrote to his superiors in
              				London again, imploring them not to cooperate with Lee:<br><br></span>"<span style="font-size: x-small;">Lee
              				is probably very much attracted to the idea of destroying his
              				political opponents. It should be remembered that there is behind
              				all this a very personal aspect…he claims he wishes to put
              				back in detention the very people who were released at his
              				insistence – people who are intimate acquaintances, who
              				have served in his government, and with whom there is a strong
              				sense of political rivalry which transcends ideological
              				differences."<br><br>Contrast this to what Lee wrote in his
              				memoirs in 1998: "Lim Chin Siong…knew that if he went
              				beyond certain limits, [the ISC] would act…"<br><br>Lim
              				need not have gone "beyond certain limits" as
              				declassified documents now reveal, Lee was determined to put him
              				in prison, communist or not, limits or no.<br><br>More
              				shamefully, Lee will not admit that he was the one who had pushed
              				for Lim's detention.<br><br>Selkirk's deputy, Philip Moore,
              				reviewed intelligence reports and concluded that there were no
              				security reasons to detain Lim Chin Siong: "Lim is working
              				very much on his own and that his primary objective is not the
              				Communist millennium but to obtain control of the constitutional
              				government of Singapore."<br><br>But London was determined
              				not to allow democratic scruples from getting in the way of its
              				strategic presence in Southeast Asia. It acquiesced to Lee's
              				plan.</span></p>

              					February 1963 the ISC, under the direction of Lee, ordered
              					Operation Coldstore where 113 opposition leaders, trade
              					unionists, journalists, and student leaders who supported the
              					left were arrested. Top of the list was, of course, Lim Chin
              					Siong.<br><br>Historian Matthew Jones recorded that the arrests
              					"primarily reflected the imperative felt by the
              					decision-makers in London to respond to the needs and demands of
              					the nationalist elites."<br><br>Not for the first time, the
              					British had come to the rescue of Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Behind
              					bars, torture and psychological abuse were meted out in liberal
              					doses. Amnesty International documented much of this in a report
              					in 1981. <br><br>The state of Lim Chin Siong under detention
              					makes for sordid reading. According to (the late) Dennis
              					Bloodworth, Lim came close to taking his own life while in
              					detention. He had gone into depression. In 1965, when he was at
              					the Singapore General Hospital Lim tried to hang himself from a
              					pipe in the toilet. He was rescued just in time. After he
              					recovered he was sent back to prison. <br><br>Four years later,
              					he penned a letter to his former comrade-turned-arch-enemy and
              					capitulated, saying that he had "finally come to the
              					conclusion to give up politics for good" and repudiated the
              					"international communist movement."<br><br>Even then,
              					Lee banished Lim to London in 1969 and allowed him to return to
              					Singapore only ten years later.<br><br>What kind of treatment
              					Lim received at the hands of his foes that turned him from a
              					spirited and charismatic national leader who walked tall among
              					his people into a forlorn political non-entity, Singaporeans can
              					only imagine.<br><br>For Lim is not talking, he passed away in
              					February 1996, forever carrying his secrets with him to his
              					grave.<br><br>It was not Britain's finest hour. Far from the
              					honest-broker that everyone had expected Britain to be, the UK
              					Government had actively engineered Lim's downfall and Lee Kuan
              					Yew's capture of the prime ministership. <br><br>As it is, the
              					historic account is hardly a heroic tale of the PAP's courageous
              					triumph over the Barisan, as official accounts would have us
              					believe. <br><br>Instead, declassified documents now show that
              					it was a sad tale of private dealings and cowardly machinations
              					for the attainment of power. <br><br>At his funeral which
              					overflowed with his former Barisan comrades and supporters,
              					eulogies recounting Lim's selfless dedication to a free and
              					democratic Singapore were read. As his casket was pushed into
              					the furnace, a thunderous and defiant applause
              					resounded.<br><br><strong>Referendum: To merger or to merge?<br><br></strong>After
              					having fulfilled his promise to Tunku Abdul Rahman to arrest Lim
              					Chin Siong before merger, Lee set his sights on taking Singapore
              					into Malaysia. He called for a referendum to obtain the people's
              					mandate for the move, a decision that Britain and the Tunku
              					objected to.<br><br>A referendum was hardly necessary as Lim and
              					other Barisan leaders were behind bars. One suspects that a vote
              					was needed to give the PAP the mandate to move in this
              					direction. <br><br>Indeed Lee, with not little false bravado,
              					wrote in his memoirs: "I remained determined that there
              					should be referendum." <br><br>Democratic? Hardly. Instead
              					of asking Singaporeans to vote for ‘yes' or ‘no' to
              					merger, Lee proposed a ballot that allowed the people to vote
              					only for merger under three options:<br><br>Do you want
              					merger?<br>A. in accordance with the white paper, or<br>B. on
              					the basis of Singapore as a constituent state of the Federation
              					of Malaya, or<br>C. on terms no less favourable than those given
              					to the three Borneo territories?<br><br>And so after the
              					referendum in September 1962, Singapore moved one step closer to
              					becoming a part of an independent Malaysia. <br><br><strong>Regrettable
              					but necessary?<br><br></strong>Lee Kuan Yew, would have us believe as
              					he wrote in his memoirs, that the use of detention without trial
              					was "most regrettable but, from my personal knowledge of
              					the communists, absolutely necessary."<br><br>Harper
              					dismisses this argument: "It was…inadmissible to
              					argue, as Lee Kuan Yew did, that the exercise of these powers
              					was ‘regrettable', but dictated by historical
              					necessity."<br><br>The truth is that "through this
              					adversity…the Barisan Sosialis still adhered to
              					constitutional tactics."<br><br>Indeed, in the entire
              					campaign to cripple the opposition, Lee Kuan Yew and his
              					rightwing PAP faction has repeatedly resorted to using desperate
              					measures of detention without trial, brazenly accusing his
              					opponents of being a front for the communists.<br><br>Harper
              					makes it even more explicit:<br><br>"After 1959, Lee Kuan
              					Yew had urged the necessity of defeating the radical left
              					through open democratic argument, whilst trying to provoke them
              					into extra-legal action. The left, however, had not been
              					deflected from constitutional struggle. Therefore, from mid-1962
              					at least, Lee concluded that this confrontation could only be
              					resolved by resort to special powers that lay beyond the
              					democratic process. This merely exposed the extent to which the
              					crisis, as the British argued, a political one, and not a
              					security one."<br><br><strong>The last chapter<br><br></strong>Lim
              					Chin Siong's fight for Singapore may have come to a close, but
              					another one is just beginning – the fight for history to
              					be written the way it should be. <br><br>Declassified secret
              					papers are beginning to provide a glimpse into what really took
              					place during the 1950s and 60s, especially in the
              					behind-the-scenes dealings. <br><br>Beginning with <em>Comet In
              					Our Sky</em> more will be revealed. But as Harper tells us "many
              					files remain closed and many files that have been released have
              					had key documents ‘retained' by the original government
              					department." These include key documents on Lim Chin
              					Siong's detention in Operation Coldstore in 1963.<br><br>As the
              					real story emerges, the Singapore Democrats will play our part
              					to urge this process along – in cyberspace – thus
              					ensuring that the memory of Lim Chin Siong and what he and his
              					Barisan colleagues did for Singapore will forever remain with
              					us. <br><br>This is crucial as our past is still our present.
              					Lim had argued that arbitrary powers of detention without trial,
              					in whoever's hands be they white or yellow, will continue to
              					make Singapore unfree and our struggle for independence elusive.
              					<br><br>"The people ask for fundamental democratic rights,"
              					he argued, "but what have they got? They have only got
              					freedom of firecrackers after seven o'clock in the evening. The
              					people ask for bread and they have been given stones
              					instead."<br><br>More than half a century later, can any
              					Singaporeans say with hand on heart that Lim Chin Siong was not
              					right? </span></p>

              				IV (final): What they teach in school<br><br></strong>In case
              				you're wondering what they're teaching our kids in school about
              				Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP, take a look at this. <br><br>One
              				textbook for GCE O-level students and approved by the Ministry of
              				Education started off thus:<br><br>"There was always a
              				significant Chinese-educated faction within the party that held a
              				different political view. From its founding, this faction was led
              				by Lim Chin Siong, who adopted violent strategies through riots
              				and street demonstrations. As this division developed, it split
              				the party into two wings: the non-communist wing led by Lee Kuan
              				Yew and the communist wing led by Lim Chin Siong."<br><br>Describing
              				Lee as someone who "championed the causes of ordinary people
              				and gained their trust and respect," the book goes on to
              				enumerate some of Lee Kuan Yew's political activities that
              				brought him to prominence. <br><br>One such activity was Lee's
              				cooperation with the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) who wanted to
              				work with the PAP "because Lee Kuan Yew was reliable and his
              				name inspired confidence." <br><br>The textbook also teaches
              				that the constitutional talks in 1955 happened because as "major
              				leaders such as David Marshall and Lee Kuan Yew both demand[ed]
              				self-government (and merger with the Federation of Malaysia), the
              				British were forced to increase the speed of reforms." <br><br>But
              				the British, apparently, found David Marshall to be a "weak
              				and indecisive <br>leader" and were thus "reluctant to
              				grant self-government to such a leader." This, the text
              				says, was the reason why the London talks in 1955 were
              				unsuccessful.<br><br>Then there was the crackdown on the PAP's
              				leftwing in 1957 after Lim Chin Siong's faction won the
              				leadership of the PAP. The book left us with no doubt that "The
              				communist success in this party election…was achieved with
              				some deception." <br><br>As a result Lee Kuan Yew and five
              				of his closest supporters resigned from the executive offices of
              				the PAP "in disgust" which meant that "the PAP, a
              				legal party, was now captured by the illegal communists."<br><br>The
              				text adds that this was "the classic strategy that the
              				communists called the ‘united front'" and that "this
              				incident explained why the PAP leadership regarded election as
              				serious business even till today." <br><br>Following the
              				resignation of David Marshall, negotiations with the British to
              				grant self-government went much smoother because, with Lim Yew
              				Hock as Chief Minister, prospects of reaching an agreement on how
              				to "deal with the threats posed by the communists" were
              				much better.<br><br>There was no mention of Operation
              				Coldstore.<br><br><br><strong>And the correct answer is…</strong><br><br>Another
              				book, a self-study revision programme for Secondary 2 students
              				"based on the New Syllabus by Ministry of Education",
              				compiled a series of study notes and questions. Correct answers
              				were provided at the back of the book.<br><br><br>Some of the
              				multiple-choice questions went like this:<br><br>I. The
              				______________ in the PAP supported the Communists.<br>(1)

              				(c)<br><br><br><br>IV. The PAP had a _________ plan for Singapore
              				and it was an honest party. <br><em>Answer</em>:
              				comprehensive<br><br><br><strong>What is your opinion about Lee Kuan
              				Yew?<br></strong><br>Students were also asked to read extracts and
              				then answer questions.<br><br><em>Extract A</em>: <br>"And we
              				needed somebody like Lee Kuan Yew, who can be strong and firm
              				when needed to be, to get things done. I think Singapore was
              				fortunate to have men like Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee at the helm
              				in 1965 to do what was needed. It was Lee Kuan yew's' [sic]
              				characteristic [sic] – when you accept to do a job, do it
              				well – or else don't' [sic] accept the position if you are

              				your opinion, to what extent is the above write up true of Lee
              				Kuan Yew correct (sic)? (5 marks)<br><br><em>Answer</em>: <br>I
              				feel the above extract is very true. He was Singapore's first
              				Prime Minister. He held that post from 1959-1990. He is widely
              				acclaimed by Singaporeans and people world over as the architect
              				of Singapore. He is responsible for transforming Singapore into a
              				modern city. He made Singapore stable and secure. He saw
              				Singapore through the years of merger and separation. He fully
              				understood the challenges a small independent nation would face.
              				Singapore had no natural resources. Singapore had limited land.
              				The only asset Singapore had was its people.<br><br>To make an
              				island with any constraints prosper must have been a challenge to
              				him. His philosophy was if you take on the job, you have to do it
              				well without any excuses or "ifs" and "but".
              				If you feel you cannot handle a particular job, then don't take
              				it.<br><br>The Singapore after the Japanese occupation, the
              				Singapore after its separation from Malaysia was one full of
              				problems, full of challenges. He, as Prime Minister, at the helm
              				of the government, was worried but not negative in his thinking.
              				He knew Singapore had to survive as an independent nation and he
              				was determined to make Singapore succeed.<br><br>It is true that
              				we needed someone of Lee Kuan Yew's calibre to steer Singapore at
              				that time. It is also true that Singapore and the people of
              				Singapore were fortunate to have him at the head. What we are
              				enjoying today, all the comforts, high standards of public
              				health, education, housing, transport and communications are all
              				the results of the dedicated, untiring, unselfish work of Lee
              				Kuan Yew and his team of leaders.<br><br><em>Question 2</em>:
              				<br>Enumerate some of the qualities of Lee Kuan Yew that you can
              				infer from the passage. (3 marks)<br><br><em>Answer</em>: <br>Strong

              				(sic). The honest leaders have succeeded in attracting foreign
              				investors to invest their money in Singapore. What is more than
              				all these is:- The leaders have set a good example and have
              				passed on all their good qualities to the people of Singapore.
              				Most Singaporeans are hard working, law abiding and honest in

              				agree that all the peace, stability and security that the people

              <p>Actually LKY's authoritarian streak could already be seen way back in 1962. He probably saw most singaporeans as a bunch of uneducated citizenry who didn't know what's good for them. It happens even till this day:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In 1962, a Referendum was conducted to see what
                                      Singaporeans think about the prospects of merger with Malaya. The
                                      people were given 3 options :</strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option

              <p>Just a few years back in the 50s, he was talking about freedom of speech and expression in parliament. I think when LKY really goes six feet under, real history would portray him as a brilliant and decisive leader yet one who is prepared to slither his away around in order to let the ends justify his means.</p>
              <p>Think bukit ho swee fire (current area near tiong bahru plaza). There's still a rumour till this day that he instigated it so that the slums may be removed and his proposed flats may take place. Of course, this is just a rumour but never say never.</p>

              <p>Anyway, when suharto was president of indonesia, the school textbooks were full of praise for his government. And there was no internet back then.

              <p>The same thing will happen to LKY. He has done a lot of good for singapore....no doubt. He will be remembered as one of the great men of the nation but historians will also write about him in ways he would never have consented to if he were still alive.</p>

              <p>LKY says the reason why we don't have Fortune 500 companies is because we are too small a population.</p>
              <h2 class="date-header"><span>Saturday, January 22, 2011</span></h2>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Why S'pore can't produce a Fortune 500 company</h3>
              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <p>SINGAPORE is too small and its talent pool is too small to produce a world-class manufacturing giant of the Fortune 500 class.<br> <br> It must therefore continue to rely on foreign multinationals  to drive 
              its growth, despite best efforts to nurture local enterprises.<br> <br> Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew expressed this view when he was interviewed for the book, Hard Truths, launched yesterday.<br> <br> Asked by a team of Straits Times journalists about the  direction for 
              the Singapore economy, he was blunt about the impact of  the country's 
              small size and limited talent pool on companies' ability  to grow, 
              especially in manufacturing.<br> <br> 'Look, unless you are big enough, the champions in any  particular 
              industry will be the ones who are the best in their field,'  he said. <br> <br> He cited Hong Kong, with seven million people. 'What has  Hong Kong got?
               Property developers and market players. Is Li Ka Shing  making a 
              product that is selling worldwide? No, he's just acquiring real  estate,
               ports, retail stores and telecoms companies.<br> <br> 'What is the most successful company in Hong Kong? (Trading  company) Li
               and Fung. Two bright brothers, but they are in logistics  chains for 
              every company. They're not in manufacturing because they  can't 
              compete.'<br> <br> Even Taiwan, with 20 million people, has fallen on hard times, for all its electronics manufacturing successes.<br> In Singapore, digital entertainment products maker Creative  Technology,
               once Singapore's tech golden boy, has found the going tough.<br> <br> 'Creative was one of the few companies that were  trailblazers. But look
               at the trials and tribulations they had to go  through. They've had to 
              recruit people from Silicon Valley to keep up  with the competition 
              because Singapore doesn't have the critical mass of  talent,' he said.<br> <br> And even if a company grows and is successful, it will  eventually be 
              gobbled up by bigger companies. 'Get to world class and  there will be a
               company that's eyeing all these possible take- overs,'  he said.<br> <br> He cited food manufacturer Tee Yih Jia, founded by 'Popiah  King' Sam 
              Goi, which sells its frozen food products overseas including  in the 
              United States.'Once it begins to succeed in America, it will be  taken 
              over by conglomerates like PepsiCo,' he said. 'How do I know?  Because 
              I've attended PepsiCo meetings. They collect foodstuffs from  around the
               world and sell them in their outlets in Latin America and in  all the 
              cinemas across the world. <br> <br> 'They will buy up Tee Yih Jia, and Tee Yih Jia can't compete with them because where are its outlets?'<br> <br> Mr Lawrence Leow, president of the Association of Small and  Medium 
              Enterprises, agreed that Singapore faced insurmountable  challenges to 
              producing a global manufacturing company. <br> <br> But he felt Singapore could produce global companies in  other areas. 
              For example, technology companies like Facebook need not be  constrained
               by the country's size. Singapore could also attract foreign  SMEs to 
              team up with local ones, he added. <br> <br> Mr Douglas Foo, founder and chief executive of Sakae  Holdings, which 
              has 40 sushi restaurants in Singapore and 30 more  overseas, said Mr 
              Lee's comments reflected the 'real and brutal facts of  the business 
              world'.<br> <br> Adapted from an article on the ST, 21 Jan 2011</p>
