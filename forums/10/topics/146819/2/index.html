God forbid ...... the Singapore Police Force (and its Security Agencies - ISD ) is an instrument of the Government a.k.a the Ruling Party, to look after the interest of the Ruling Party ONLY !<br><br>After FORTY YEARS of social development, is the Singaporean of the 21st Century, similar in social-political attitude and behavior as the Singaporean in the 1950s and 1960s ?<br><br>Has there been no iota of change in social responsiblity and social cohesiveness towards the Country and the Community ?<br><br>If the answer is doubtful, or NO, then what is all the hullaballoo of National Day joy that is spread across the front pages of the Straits Times ?<br><br></div>

What is their track record ?<br><br>Zilch... it was the first experiment at Self-Government, with the current Ruling Party stepping into the shoes of Government, as the Third Political Party to do so - after two Chief Ministers - Lim Yew Hock and David Marshall.<br><br>There was also self-doubt by the leadership of the Ruling Party then, when they first stepped into the shoes of Government, and no longer sitting on the Opposition bench in Parliament.<br><br>The true colors of Singaporean will always rise to the occassion - when Challenges of Change have to be faced.<br><br>Singaporeans have faced many worst crisis since Self-Rule in the 1950s, AND after FORTY 'FRUSTRATING' YEARS of INDEPENDENCE under the tight grip of an autocratic ONE-PARTY Government, surely enough experience has been accumulated to tackle the numerous problems.<br><br>Is there truly a dearth of TALENT amongst Singaporeans, or is it simply a dearth of INTEREST to come forward and participate in the Politics that are practised by the Ruling Party ?<br><br>It is TALENTED SINGAPOREANS - who stood up in the past to join the various sectors and levels of Government, as well as in the Private Sector, that had contributed to the success of Singapore over the last FORTY YEARS.<br><br>Do you seriously believe that the ELITE CIRCLE of the Ruling Party had made Singapore WITHOUT the participation and contribution of efforts from SINGAPOREANS ?<br><br>The FUTURE belong to SINGAPOREANS with a VISION, a HOPE, and KNOW WHERE WE SHOULD BE HEADING.<br><br>POLITICS should be a competition of ideas, of ambitions, of dreams, ALL FOR THE BETTERMENT OF SINGAPOREANS and SINGAPORE.<br><br>Unfortunately, the type of Politics that is practised in Singapore, is a Politics of EXCLUSION, where talented people are afraid to stand-up to be counted, for fear of being ridiculted, for fear of failure, for fear of public rejection.<br><br>Since the POLITICS of EXCLUSION is practised, the potential of OPPOSTION PARTIES have to be viciously suppressed, ridiculed, obstructed, and confined, so as to put the Ruling Party's position in a better light.<br><br>Firstly, before doubting the Opposition Parties, and to have a better understanding of the Opposition Party's potential capability, perhaps we should give the Opposition Party an opportunity to project their ideas with an open mind, before shooting them down with a knee jerk response.<br><br>Secondly, are we setting higher standards to measure the Opposition Party, than the Ruling Party ? Are we more forgiving and tolerant to the mistakes of the Ruling Party, or do we simply have no choice but to be forgiving and tolerant, and simply hit the Opposition Parties harder for their failure to be better than the Ruling Party ?<br><br>Thirdly, if ever the Opposition Parties step into the shoes of Government, do you think it is not in our own interests that SINGAPOREANS should come forward and offer FULL CO-OPERATION and SUPPORT to the new OPPOSITION GOVERNMENT - in the same manner that we have so obediently shown to the present Ruling Party a.k.a the present Singapore Government over the last FORTY YEARS ?<br><br>This piece may not assure you of the ability of the Opposition Party to govern Singapore, but the fact that it is only after FORTY YEARS, that MM LKY has slowly begun to admit his mistakes - despite the strong protests and warning of those wronged policy position - will show clearly that the Ruling Party is not failure-proof.<br><br>Their inability to accept alternative views has caused hardship that will have long term effects to Singapore and Singaporeans.<br><br>Can Singaporeans continue with this kind of autocratic TOP-DOWN decision makeing process, in which the voices of the people are heard, but the paternalistic position of 'I KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU' continue as a guiding policy of the Ruling Party ?<br><br>To better understand the potential capability of the Oppositon Party, perhaps you may wish to - firstly - make an attempt to read the book written by SDP CSJ : 'Your Future, My Faith, OUR FREEDOM' - which incidentally has been adopted as the SDP party manifesto.<br><br>This book was written in 2001, and had identified the problems faced by Singapore, and how these problems are to be resolved, and where Singapore should be heading.<br><br>Surprisingly, since the book was written in 2001, recent Government a.k.a the Ruling Party has paid close attention to those problems that have arisen, and taken partial measures and actions that are quite similar to the solutions stated in the book written by SDP CSJ.<br><br>Are the Singaporean TALENTS the monopoly of the Ruling Party only ?<br><br>Are Singaporean Talents no longer seen to be talented when they join the Opposition Parties ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ndsef:</div><div class="quote_body">Thanks pikamaster for joining in the discussion. I see that both you and atobe "assume" that the system is rotten to the core.  To me the system just needs some tweaking to it. It is akin to a rotten branch on a tree that needs to be removed before the whole tree gets infected.<br><br>To you, I have this question, " On what grounds do you think or believe that the present government is rotten to the core and has to be removed?" And what would your proposed solutions be for a better Singapore?<br><br>This is important, because, we can yak all day long about this is not good that is not done properly. So if you or Atobe is in the hot seat of the PM, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE SINGAPORE A BETTER PLACE?<br></div></blockquote>nsdef,<br><br>1) disease spreads fast. look at bird flu.<br><br>2) I don't know abt Atobe (dun 4get ur caps) but for me, I think that the system has a rotten core, not that it is rotten to the core i.e. it has some very good peripherals, but the core engine is kinda rusty.<br><br>The grounds?<br><br>1) NKF... duh... problem with accountability<br><br>2) Elitism, which is becoming a cause for social division. you can even see <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> effect within this forum itself, even within ur other thread, the one abt opposition. Notice many of the grouses go against "the elite". Such a class system is not beneficial to society in the long-run and would possibly cause more disunity than overpopulation. (not ur pt, so u can ignore this; the 2nd phrase I mean) Ironically, it is the pillar of meritocracy that forms this problem. the history of the concept is rather strange: Meritocracy started out as a derogatory word used by an author criticizing capitalism, and was transformed into an ideal through the rhetoric of the British Government...<br><br>3) Unlike Atobe (I think), I do have the basic framework of a policy plan whould I become PM (which I may never become unfortunately becos I'm not deciding to join any political party). It is outlined below:-<br><br>[Preliminary Policies]<br><br>a. Rewrite the Constitution to gvie it a more democratic character, which I am doing now already btw. Though due to time constraints, not gone beyond Part IV. (Article 19).<br><br>b. Divorce ELD from PMO and CPIB from SPF. Put CPIB under newly-divorced ELD.<br><br>c. Dissolve MITA.<br><br>d. Get local arts people to manage NAC.<br><br>e. Make MOE immune to Parliament.<br><br>f. Establish a (temporary) minimum wage.<br><br>g. Get Fandi Ahmad to be principal of Sports School.<br><br>h. Sack Lim Boon Heng and CJ Yong. (no personal grudge, merely to keep NTUC and the Judiciary politically neutral.) Separate FairPrice from NTUC.<br><br>i. Set up a Council of Inter-Religious and Moral Affairs (CIRMA) comprising the heads of all the religions. The body shall promote harmonious inter-religious ties or at the very base, serve as a peaceful platform through which issues, such as the current islamic fundamentalism, can be resolved.<br><br>j. Make Prefectorial Boards, Student Councils and Student Unions independent of school administrative control. Abolish School uniforms and school ties.<br><br>k. dissolve the 'Y' section of MCYS.<br><br>[Mainline Policies]<br><br>a. Create Singapore Journalists' Assiociation from journalists currently working in the press. Get Michael Backman or Lee Han SHih to head SJA. Divorce SJA from SPH. SJA will gather news and op-eds independently ands ell them in packages to newspaper companies like Straits Times or TODAY, who will then hire SPH to print the papers for them.<br><br>b. Reorganize CDIS into a School of Linguistic Knowledge (SLK), a School of Historical Knowledge (SHK) and a School of Utilitarian Knowlege (SUK). SLK will train teachers to teach and design syllabuses for language, literature, dance, theatrical studies, visual arts, architecture and music, including 3rd Lang, and decide a list of literary texts for exams. SHK will train teachers to teach and design syllabuses for Integrated Education, Southeast Asian History, European History, Chinese and Indian History, American History, Japanese History, Geography, Politics, Philosophy and Sociology.  SUK will train teachers to teach and design syllabuses for Physics, Engineering, Chemistry, Mathematics (A+E, C+F) , Biology, Microbiology, Life Sciences, Molecular Science, Quantum Mechanics, Environmental Conservation, Economics, psychology and all other related fields.<br>SUK and SHK together will prescribe the list of texts for Textual Study. CIRMA shall regulate the teaching of Religious Knowledge.<br>NOTE: CDIS will create syllabi for uni education as well.<br><br>c. Bring together the newly independent student unions and the STU to form a collective body called the Educational Parliament (EP), presided over by the Deans of SUK, SLK, SHK, NUS, NTU, SMU, NAFA, UNSW Singapore. This body shall regulate youth and education.<br><br>d. Allow students in and beyond puberty the right to vote for their union leaders and their Estate Managers. The Estate Manager shall replace the current headmasters/CEOS/Principals, and his/her pay shall consist of both a fixed component and a variable component. The variable component shall be voted on annually by EP. For that particular session, EP will be presided over by the DEM, rather than the EM.<br><br>e. Surrender the handling of schoolyard discipline to specially-assigned police officers. The only constant will be that homework is a mandatory obligation of the student. Decentralize Boys' and Girls' Homes to campuses.<br><br>f. Make all schools co-ed.<br><br>g. ban abortion.<br><br>h. Abolish the law against private homosex.<br><br>i. Abolish the Death penalty and ban Euthanasia.<br><br>j. Repeal the Land Acquisition Act.<br><br>k. Repeal the Defamation Act.<br><br>l. Replace the ISA with a series of Acts providing the same functions, but respecting Citizens' privacy at the same time.<br><br>m.   Create under CIRMA a high court of appeal called the Court of Religious Justice (CRJ). To prevent formation of Theocracy, limit CRJ's powers to reduction of severity of sentences.<br><br>n. Add CIRMA in as one more avenue which bills pass through before Presidential Assent. To prevent Theocracy from taking root, CIRMA may only have temporary veto power and will have to submit a Memorandum to the House of the Miscellaneous, as Parliament shall be called, explaining why the bill was vetoed.<br><br>o. Make all companies in the country sell 50% of their shares to their staff. Establish by law that 50% of a Corporation's (as defined by the Constitution) shares must be owned by its staff.<br><br>p. Dump SEF, NTUC and CASE into one debating body under the supervision of the Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This body will be responsible for deciding on macro-economic policy.<br><br>q. Peg basic ministerial salaries to the median wage of the rest of the population, and have the variable proportion (bonuses, pensions etc) decided on by public referendum of citizens above 16 years of age.<br><br>r.<br><br>[Appendix Policies]<br><br>a.Put all charities under the charge of CIRMA.<br><br>b.Dissolve the Ministry of Trade and Industry.<br><br>...to be continued<br><br>(sry,having maths tute now)</div>

Abolish School uniforms and school ties.</strong><br><br>Student council committees can't even manage themselves at sec sch level and you want to offer autonomy?<br><br>School uniforms given a sense of belonging and identity. It will be difficult to set a similar standard to plainclothes should that day come.<br><br><strong><br>g. ban abortion.</strong><br><br>This has been debated over countless times over countless years. No one policy can declare an outright banning of abortion despite its ills to society because it is in fact killing a foeteus, which being a living person, has a right to live.<br><br><strong><br>i. Abolish the Death penalty and ban Euthanasia.</strong><br><br>While the death penalty is primitive at times, there is no viable alternative for it at the moment. Life imprisonment doesn't even cut it. Perhaps if mind-warping (forcefully reprogramming a convict's mind to adhere to society) is possible in the future, it may be a humane substitution to the DP.<br><br>Euthanasia is a similar argument to Abortion, except this time, a person should be given the right to die in a dignified manner of his choosing.<br><br><strong><br>l. Replace the ISA with a series of Acts providing the same functions, but respecting Citizens' privacy at the same time.</strong><br><br>You can't re-design the ISA into a series of polices and <span style="color: red;">still respect citizen's privacy</span>.

Establish by law that 50% of a Corporation's (as defined by the Constitution) shares must be owned by its staff.</strong><br><br>No profit-making business will agree to your suggestion since it gives undue power to the staff which will eventually lead to 'company-hostage' situations in decision-making instances.<br><br><strong><br>p.

Better to have them form an independent body to provide the necessary check on the welfare of consumers and workers, completely separate from the govt. The way the late Ong Teng Cheong sanctioned a strike by workers during his tenure as NTUC Chief in Jan 1986 showed how important it is to have your own union backing when workers are being exploited.
