This department has been around even before PAP came into power as it was set up during British colonial government days.<br><br>Check out their role here:<br><br>http://www.ago.gov.sg/<br><br>The EDB audit issues is because EBD has been audited for many years by commercial auditors. For those in the know about AGO, they audit BEYOND what the commercial auditors does which is "true and fair opinion on the financial statements." AGO looks at the above PLUS:<br>- compliance with government procurement procedures<br>- detailed scrutiny of internal control procedures, governance<br>- areas that could potentially be reportable (very wide).<br><br>Check out the Audit Act under statutes.agc.gov.sg and Constitution for their additional roles as well.</div>

If they make mistakes which are accidental and not deliberate with no denials of persistent problems, citizens can understand.<br><br>However the many problems we are discussing under this topic are not matter of accidental mistakes but deliberate and persistent failures or lack of accountability and transparency especially after many losses failures as pointed out in many incidences by high-level people like Ngiam Tong Dow and ex-president Ong Teng Cheong.<br><br>Furthermore ministers have publicly claimed themselves to be the world's best talents so as to be paid the highest salaries to retain their talents.<br><br>In such a situation, our ministers, the AG and all the professional auditors should not be easily excused for the basic and mundane problems mentioned by you. They will be expected by citizens to practise the highest professional standard of accountability and transparency commensurate to their talents and salaries as expected so as to prevent similar NKF malpractices or irregularities. The pre-signing of cheque or hidden profiteering by HDB etc may be just the tip of the iceberg.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(Extracted from <a href="http://www/managefranchise/blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">www/managefranchise/blogspot.com</a> )<br><br>Most businesses are today still managed in an ad hoc manner resulting in complexities and uncertainties which lead to idling, delays, inefficiencies, losses, scandals or malpractices.<br><br>Despite the Asian Financial Crisis, many businesses continue to be managed in an ad hoc fire-fighting manner with senior management only concerned with making decisions leaving implementation to the subordinates.<br><br>When troubles happen, the senior management has many escape routes one of which is to conduct a post-mortem Management Audit to determine the cause or causes of problems to punish a scapegoat.<br><br>It may be asked : why a management audit and not hold the senior management of responsibility to take preemptive or corrective or advance actions instead of leaving issues and problems to chance occurrence before taking actions.<br><br>Process management like OSP Process Management is aimed at preventing problems and solving them in advance before their occurrence, viz:-<br><br>(1) Establish complex and conceptual goals and tasks in Follow-through lego-like component work processes.<br><br>(2) Objective supervision, Clear definitions of roles, duties and quality-time-cost control.<br><br>(3) Coordination and knowledge application.<br><br>(4) Effective Communication and feedbacks.<br><br>(5) Logical work processes, measurement of performance, corrections.<br><br>(6) Objectivity, accountability and transparency.<br><br>(7) Clearly defined Filing, retrieving of records.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Motivation of workers in knowledge application.<br><br>(9) Effective Departmentalisation and delegation.<br><br>As the saying goes, it is easy to find faults as anyone can make mistakes.<br><br>Processes set up in follow-through sequence and integrated into daily work routines will avoid the errors and mistakes of the kind as discovered belatedly by the Auditor General.<br><br>Being set up in attainable component work processes the whole organization will gel their works with coordination, teamwork and knowledge application at every level.<br><br>The traditional management or financial audit might be the most effective in finding faults but will such audit lead to preemptive solutions, efficiency and prevention of malpractices as found in NKF and many others.<br><br>Once tasks are established in cause-effect lego-like component work processes the management and lower rungs will be connected into a whole allowing regular and consistent actions to be taken to realize result-oriented performance with hands-on control, comparison, processing and corrections to attain organizational efficiency and productivity.<br><br>In the globalization age, it is critical to empower staff to achieve higher level of efficiency through coordination, teamwork and knowledge application by all staff.<br><br>Therefore, there is an overriding need to change the current mindset of management from one which is based on fault finding to one which will be more hands-on and proactive as that will be the only way to solve many of the problems reported by the Auditor General.<br><br>Process management will also be most effective in upgrading efficiency, accountable good corporate governance and results.<br><br>If the solutions are proposed after the events or facts are found out credit will not be given to such finding for the same finder was himself probably unaware or unable to prevent its occurrence in the first place in most situation.<br><br>If your organization is thinking of spending thousands on conducting a management or financial audit surely it will be more beneficial to devote some time to process management as the latter while being more cost effective will be the more creative way to upgrade efficiency instead of fault findings without contributing to final solutions of problems.<br><br>So there is an alternative solution to all those problems mentioned by the Auditor General. Problems are not that complex and overwhelming when tasks are laid out in objective component work processes and processed through forms and work forms via a call centre so that everyone will be able to work with coordination and teamwork and knowledge application to achieve results.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOC Exclusive (Reproduced from online.citizen)<br><br>The original Auditor General OfficeÂ’s (AGO) audit of 12 Ministries and associated statutory boards has revealed irregularities to an extent not fully revealed by the recent Public Accounts Committee (PAC).<br><br>According to the AGO, losses of public monies added up to $6.2 million, a substantial amount of which is still unaccounted for.<br><br>The Auditor GeneralÂ’s preface to the report states that Â‘This audit approach is not intended to reveal all errors and irregularities.Â’<br><br>In the report, the Ministry of Law lost a potential $77,666.64 safety deposit because its computer system could only register sums to the nearest dollar. It appears under the header Â‘No $77,666.64 security deposit because of 36 centsÂ’.<br><br>The report details how these millions were lost in a detailed account of mistakes and dubious practices.<br><br>The Ministry of Home Affairs, for example, charged rental far below the market rate, forgoing $2.38 million that should have gone into state coffers. The Ministry of Law, in addition to the 36 cent mistake, left our public funds $386,829 poorer by failing to implement rental increase. This was described as an Â‘oversightÂ’.<br><br>The list goes on.<br><br>The Ministry of Manpower delayed collecting a $501,998 debt for a grand total of 15 years. When it decided to finally recover the sum of money, the company disputed the debt owed but the Ministry did not have the necessary paperwork to Â‘substantiate the debtÂ’. National Development lost us $228,000 in foregone rental, and Trade and Industry overpaid $1.87m in grants to a statutory board (since recovered).<br><br>The largest outstanding sum identified was the Ministry of Health: $136.2 million for Phase III of the National University Hospital development project has still not been recovered despite having been completed in 1996.<br><br>More questions than answers<br><br>The report raises more questions than it answers. Procurement irregularities are unexplained: a National Development contract was awarded for an eighth ranking bid (in terms of price) out of 11 without any justification. Further, the officers signing the contracts were not authorized to do so. Under the column Â‘subsequent actionÂ’, all that is said is that the Ministry Â‘streamlined procurement proceduresÂ…which would prevent such lapses from recurringÂ’. Not even an ex post facto explanation about the dubious procurement.<br><br>The Â‘subsequent actionÂ’ detailed for other irregularities and mistakes do not offer much elaboration. In the case of the Ministry of ManpowerÂ’s half a million dollar mistake that spanned 15 years, it gave assurances that Â‘levy debts will be resolved within a much shorter time frame in futureÂ’ and that Â‘future relevant documentsÂ’ would be retained.<br><br>TOC Opinion<br><br>Theonlinecitizen (TOC) recently reproduced in full the report by the Public Accounts Committee (here), convened by Parliament to scrutinize irregularities highlighted by the Auditor GeneralÂ’s report for financial year 05-06. It gave few concrete figures to highlight the irregularities it was pointing out.<br><br>TOC has obtained a copy of the original AGO report, which gives a far more comprehensive overview of the scope of the irregularities. This is reproduced in full (see below). We hope that members of the public will step forward to scrutinize the report and ask the necessary questions of our public servants.<br><br>In light of the limited scope of the Auditor-GeneralÂ’s report, we believe that the public deserves a more thorough audit of its public offices. Further, action needs to be taken to examine why these mistakes occurred in the first place: What are the fundamental causes of these lapses? Is it systemic or is it just incompetence on the part of the departments involved?<br><br>What were the consequences of these multi-million dollar mistakes?<br><br>This report can either be swept under the carpet to the further detriment of the credibility of the media and our government, or it can serve as a reference point for a new era in government transparency and accountability.<br><br>We hope the latter will prevail.<br><br>From the Auditor General OfficeÂ’s website:<br><br>Â“Non-compliances with procedures in the use of public funds are signs of weak internal controls. As audits are done on a test check basis, the weaknesses found could be an indication of more widespread problems. Many frauds, big or small, occurred because the weak controls were exploited. Weak controls involving small amounts could also be exploited resulting in larger losses. In the Report of the Auditor-General for the Financial Year 2005/06, individual cases of loss of public moneys were mostly small but these collectively amounted to $6.2 million.Â” (Link)<br><br>You can view a copy of the Auditor GeneralÂ’s report as follows (pdf file):<br><br>Part 1 - The cover and content list<br>Part 2 - Introduction<br>Part 3 - Main report<br>Part 4 - Main report (contÂ’d)<br><br>Please visit also the Auditor GeneralÂ’s Office website for some FAQs.<br><br>Please do send us your views/articles on this issue.
