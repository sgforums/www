Casino gambling is worse because the casino is setup to induce people to gamble. Sure you might say that they can go to Genting... that is not so easy like going to Marina South. Like smokers, you think that theu don't know it is bad for their health?<br><br>Gambling operators are people who exploit the weaknesses of human beings. Now we know that the PAP has no qualms for exploiting the weaknesses of Singaporeans.<br>Actually the casino issue had been debated to death and it is no pont going through it all over again.<br><br>The point is that we are paying them millions and the best that they can do is to come up with contrversial and harmful methods.</div>
