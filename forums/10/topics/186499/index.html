            <div class='col-md body'>This is not what we can get from our 140th:<br><br>Temasek's<br>Email gaffe<br>Accidentally sent to media, document reveals its sensitivity to its image and ties with government. By Sara Webb. Reuters.<br>Mar 30, 2006<br><br>Reporters rarely get a glimpse behind the scenes at Singapore's notoriously secretive state investor, Temasek Holdings.<br><br>But the company accidentally revealed more than it intended this week when it e-mailed an internal document to journalists that set out how Temasek officials should reply to tough questions from the press.<br><br>"We are trying to find out what happened," said Temasek's spokeswoman Eva Ho in an email to Reuters on Wednesday.<br><br>The briefing document, received by Reuters and other news media, covers 59 potential questions ranging from the firm's government ownership and potential conflicts of interest to its motivation for buying banks and telecom companies overseas.<br><br>"While it is standard practice around the world for company officials to be briefed by 'spin doctors' on how to handle the media, the document shows which areas Temasek considers particularly sensitive.<br><br>The 13-page briefing spells out what to say when the media asks whether the appointment of Temasek CEO, Ho Ching - the wife of the Prime Minister - was 'politically motivated' and whether there are conflicts of interest because Lee also heads the Ministry of Finance, which owns Temasek.<br><br>"We are not here to discuss politics since we are not politicians or a political organisation. Our CEO is accountable to the board of directors' which is headed by an independent chairman just like any other commercial organisation," is Temasek's official response.<br><br>Temasek's chairman, S. Dhanabalan is a former cabinet minister who entered politics in 1976 and who held several cabinet positions between 1980 and 1993 including Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Trade and Development.<br><br>He was also chairman of DBS Group Holdings, Singapore's biggest bank, which is partly owned by Temasek.<br><br>Singapore's blue-chip companies such as Singapore Airlines and telecom firm, Singtel, whose CEO is the Prime Minister's brother.<br><br>The document, which mainly covers Temasek's purchase this week of an 11.55% stake worth USS$4B in emerging markets bank Standard Chartered, shows how sensitive Temasek is about its image at home and abroad, as well as its relationship with Singapore's government.<br><br>"The Singapore government, as a shareholder, is not involved in our investment decisions and business operations, much less in the businesses in our portfolio companies" is the official reply to questions about the government's involvement in business.<br><br>Temasek has helped spark a political crisis in Thailand and attracted hostility when it led a consortium that paid US$3.8B for Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's Shin Corp.<br><br>"Our investment in Shin Corp reflected our confidence in Thailand's long-term growth" is the answer top two different questions - question 46, on the Shin takeover, and question 47, which reads: "Now with Standard Chartered, you are seen as taking over Thailand's financial services as well. Isn't this politically motivated?"<br><br>One stock reply in the document sounded all too familiar to reporters covering the firm.<br><br>In case of a news leak about the Standard Chartered deal before the signing of the deal, Temasek spokespeople are instructed: "We do not comment on market speculations".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter how Temasek is corporatised no one will believe the crap that it is only a commercial organization which answers only to its own board. Who are the board members?<br><br>Even if Temasek can side-track the query to open up and be accountable for a while, can it hide the fact forever that it is actually custodian of Singaporeans' public funds?<br><br>It is incredible that Temasek appears to be able to do as it likes like the NKF under Durai. It should be held accountable as trustees or custodians for any actions causing losses. Some such wrongs have been exposed by the foreign parties Temasek has had dealing with e.g. insider trading ireported by a Japanese company  by one of Temasek's employees.<br><br>Ex-president Ong Teng Cheong was right in asking for accountability and transparency of organizations like Temasek to list down its assets and valuations.<br><br>Government has missed a valuable opportunity to use the office of elected president wisely to allay certain lack of information giving rise to unnecesary fears and uncertainties as reported in the international press.<br><br>It is sad that in investing people monies in so many projects overseas, Temasek cannot even understand the fundamental principle that it has to reveal information on how such decisions are made and what kinds of management reviews are being conducted on such investments.<br><br>Why must citizens only rely on foreign press to understand such investment decisions and actions. Why are our own press not daring enough to ask for or publish such matters.<br><br>MM Lee has apparently not been very forthcoming in answering the journalist on such issues such as the unwillingness to provide information and lack of accountability and transparency on the part of Temasek or the government.<br><br>The latest email leakage scandal is indeed uncalled for and could have been less embarrassing if Temasek has been more open and accountable. MM Lee has defended his lack of accountability on certain matters like control of the press by rhetorics that he would not tolerate foreign press setting agenda for Singapore. Is he reserving then all the right for him alone to set agenda for Temasek or Singapore?<br><br></div>
