            <div class='col-md body'>Leopard 2 as rear guard... err... kinda wasted right?<br><br>The Su-34 Platypus, is still based on a Flanker design tho its a side by side cockpit.  Basically, its a long range attacker, but i still doubt the kitchen and toilet part.<br><br>As for the back firing missiles, the russians have been tooling around with it for quite some time. They removed the countermeasures pod and replaced it with a rear facing radar.  They also mounted a reverse facing R-27 ARH Missile. Technically it can fire backwards... but they still have problems with the velocity issues... cos if the plane is moving forward, the missile is gonna fly backwards... its gonna need a lot more propulsion to do so.<br><br>Btw, The russians got the idea of the Su-34 from the American F-15Es.  F-15Es fly long ranged penetration and can drop "big ones" in enemy territory, and get out.  Its packed with an advanced TEWS thats incorporated in its jamming suite.  OF course, the Russian copy probably wont be as good as the American one simply becos the Russians are still a decade back in avionics technology.<br><br>I'd laugh to death if Malaysia bought Su-34s then realising its a side by side cockpit arrangement.

In the US, the Apache are used as a Calvary force, a concept similar to an RDF.  The calvary covers more ground to engage an enemy that is not anticipated in that direction, or leads a fast assault.<br><br>Of course, an RDF like what Tripwire stated, needs air superiority, cos we would want to be able to resupply, or perhaps evac that force.  However, with Singapore's concept of warfare, its not likely that will happen.  Rather, the RDF will Drop in, or amphibiously assault in, take out enemy within their given operations zone and area.  After that, they would wait for the Armored spear Together with mechanize infantry to fight through the "cut-off" troops. And we will have our reinforced line.</div>

And the RDF under Army's command.  I feel we should move the command of the Apaches to the Army.  In the US, the Apache are used as a Calvary force, a concept similar to an RDF.  The calvary covers more ground to engage an enemy that is not anticipated in that direction, or leads a fast assault.<br><br>Of course, an RDF like what Tripwire stated, needs air superiority, cos we would want to be able to resupply, or perhaps evac that force.  However, with Singapore's concept of warfare, its not likely that will happen.  Rather, the RDF will Drop in, or amphibiously assault in, take out enemy within their given operations zone and area.  After that, they would wait for the Armored spear Together with mechanize infantry to fight through the "cut-off" troops. And we will have our reinforced line.</div></blockquote>the 3 service of SAF is as one unified command, it doesnt matter whether the apache is under RSAF or Army, because eventually they are under one unified command structure that seeks to maximise the benefits of an equipment to the best possible use.<br><br>as for your strategy on flanking and then moving the forces up to link up with the insertion force. its nothing new and have been practiced before in war and peace time training, the problem is.. such a move soaks up alot of airlift and sealift resouces... and there is a danger of the forces unable to link up, then the insertion force could be in peril. the flanking move is not without its risk, the use of such a move requires detail planning, intelligience and ground preparation.</div>

Air Superiority is easy for our Air Force. I mean that the RDF would be formed after the RSAF received all its CH47D Chinooks and additional CH47SD later and also after the army receive the LWSPH and Terrex AIFV.

If we don't prepare advanced equipment, we may not be able to fight a superior foreign invasion force.<br><br>However, Carriers are still out of the question, cost of maintenance and defending it alone will kill.  Imagine the amount of defense spending that could have gone to the developement of other modern weapons, thats ill spent on a carrier we don't need.<br><br>As for the LongBow radar, its still in negotiations from what i heard.  Basically, what the longbow radar does is, detection and acquiring targets over obstacles such as hills.  Its mounted on top the rotors so it can peer above obstacles like periscopes over water.<br></div>
