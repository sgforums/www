            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CenturionMBT:</div><div class="quote_body">Even if the Migs were as good as the malaysiaas have said ,how many migs they have and how many F-16s we have?By the time they have fired their all missiles, they would find 20 or so F-16s tareting them.Besides,what is the range of a migs radar compared with that of the E2Cs.And furthurmore, our JF-16D could jam their radars from a long range, rendering their radars useless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>Actually, Both the F16 and the MIG29 are very capable. In terms of performance, the MIG29 may emerge victorious most of the time.<br>Why? The MIG29 is highky agile and can withstand very high Gs even with full load of weapons. Look at its wings and you will understand that the designer took effort on designing a strong, large and powerful airframe. Its wings is thick and wide, like the F15's. Its powered by 2 engines etc. These features allows it to perform the world-known Cobra manoeuvre. If you put an F16 and a MIG29 on a one-to-one combat, the MIG29 would win most of the time. I said most because this largely depends on the pilot. In a dogfight, the MIG29 can beat the F16 flat. But, the problem is that colse combat or dogfights willl never take place in the modern aerial warfare. What takes place is either you are fired before you can see your enemy or you fire at your enemy before you can see him. This capability needs a large radar, modern avionics and systems incorporated into the cocpit and of course, the weapon. If you take a look in the cockpit of the MIG29, you will see that the control panels are old, so old-fasioned that it looks like what you will see in the MIG15 of the Korean War! As for the F16C, you will see colour multi-mode displays, radar screen etc. If not in a colse combat situation, the F16C will emerge victorious. Why? Bigger radar, much bigger than the MIG29. Modern systems, equipments and avionics, ability to fire the AMRAAM which in fact, is a better missile than the Adder. If, with the help of the E2C, the range at which the AMRAAM can be fired to a target would even be greater.<br><br>The MIG29 is a design of the cold war, where close air combat is still the method of acheiving air victory, but when comes to the modern aerial awrfare, few can beat the F16C.<br></div>

To be replace by the F-18E/F super hornet and later on by JSF.<br><br>F-18 got problem with limited range and weapon load, which is why the F-14 remain in service with the carriers despite the original intent to replace the F-14 with F-18. F-18 also got a slew of problem when used landbased, such as the undercarriage being to far back and this alone leads to quite a few crash on the runways.<br><br>F-18 furthermore does not have LANTIRN, Bubble canopy, HOTAS and HMS like the F-16s. In fact, the RSAF tried out the F-18 way back and decided to dump it in preference of the F-16.<br><br>F-18 is now filling the role of the A-6 intruder which is an attack aircraft.<br><br>the new F-18E/F super hornet will address all the problems currently associated with the the old hornets, such as having conformer fuel tanks to increase range and totally redesign the undercarriage to enable better handling when used land based. But the Super hornet WILL NOT BE ready until 2005 at the least.<br><br>The malaysians bought the MIGs for several reasons, but non of them are sound reason. Malaysia purchase the fulcrum on a half hard cash and half barter exchange basis as it is too poor to afford to pay for all the Fulcrum with cold cash, luckily the russians dont mind taking the rubber sheets, oil and palm oil as payments for the planes. so affordability is probably one of the main reason why malaysia bought the fulcrum.<br><br>Other western nation which are already overflowed with food and oil, onli wanted cold hard cash which malaysia dont have.</div>

What is true and what is not? How reliable is his information in the number of weapons and equipments that SAF operates?</div></blockquote>i have read the book. i must say that the account is fairly accurate. BUT unfortunately, as expected, the author also face a big obstacle in getting sensitive information from his sources. Most of the information he provided is equivalent to a compilation account of what has happened to SAF since its formation, most of it from official publications...just look at the thickness of the appendix on notes and u know what i mean.<br><br>Although the author did tried his best to give us additional information about secret developement in the SAF and DSTA with respect to weapons and formations...understandably, such information are hard to confirm and even harder to deny.<br><br>One point i disagreed with the book was its short account on a possible war between singapore and malaysia with MAF as the foe and potentially involving indonesia.<br><br>The author claimed that SAF has continuously trained if not practised the possibility of a war against malaysia. while that may be true, it is doubtful that SAF would open a second front using Brunei as a spring board, In fact, i would even put forward the suggestion that in the event KL should fall under SAF onslaught, the indonesians might take the opportunity and occupied east malaysia totally, this obviously would result in turn singapore holding southern malaysia to counter the increase size of indonesia. In fact, even thailand might want a piece of malaysia northern lands if it see the MAF weakened and thrashed.<br><br>The author believed that SAF would attack the southern part of malaysia and make inland blitz attack up to 80km deep into johor and form the mersing line. the author believe that such a move would be beneficial to SAF in that :<br><br>1. it secures singapore's water supply<br>2. the defense line is close to singapore and can be easily supplied and reinforced in crisis.<br>3. that southern johor is less populated vis a vis melaka and KL which means less patrol problem.<br>4. most of singapore's economic investment is in southern Johor and thus protects singapore's economic interest.<br>5. that the 80km deep penetration prevents the malaysian arty from hitting singapore.<br>6 (my own opinion) wiped out the malaysian army southern command, leaving little more than 20,000 MAF soldier facing the 500,000 SAF soldier.<br>7. (my own opinion) with a foothold on malaysia, RSAF is now effectively within reach of KL, maleka, penang, ipoh and alor star, this would presumably force KL to the negotiating table OR.....ehhee, we can always drop a few encouraging FAEs over KL and IPOH(sadly, the FAEs would literary devastates KL and IPOH like hiroshima and nagasaki), alternatively, singapore might (as the author claimed) start a second front using brunei as the spring board and ... 'accidently' or 'unintentionally' results in the separation of east malaysia from peninsula malaysia into 2 different country.....hheheehee....<br><br>Upon establishing the mersing line, diplomatic solution would then be tabled in the international arena.<br><br>and to further enhance singapore's bargaining position, SAF has achieved (according to the author) the ability (or tenacity) to withstand a first blow from malaysia, this would make singapore the victim of the dispute rather then the aggressor and bring international favour on our side.(the author failed to point out that if malaysia is run by muslim fundamentalist, even if singapore throw the first punch, much of the western world would still be on our side ;&gt; ).<br><br>But the flaw of this strategy is on the basis that malaysia would be forced to the negotiating table, in the event malaysia refuse to 'cooperate', then the total occupation of malaysia (possibly with thai assistance) may have to be considered unless singapore wants to end up fighting a border war for the remaining history of the state with disasterous consequence since malaysia does have more man then we can field. and we cant field our man on the front forever, so.... we need to go in, kill off all the malaysian resistance and its entire leadership, and encourage the division of malaysia into a dozen states.<br><br>Another problem is...in the event that malaysia is willing to go to the negotiation table, we will still need to hold southern johor forever....since goodwill and trust is no longer in existance. Singapore would then end up perpetually forever in a state of war.<br><br>So...in my view, holding the mersing line can only be considered as a long term plan after the war, when the dust has settled, but when the war is first started, it would be foolish to stop at mersing line, in fact, i feel that we should wipe out MAF, decimates malaysian economy and infrastructure and massacre its entire leadership structure. showing mercy to the enemy is the sure proven way of committing suicide.<br><br>Believing that malaysia would honor its new peace treaty with singapore is self-defeating, all these only results in giving malaysia breathing space, so that they can rebuild their military and come at us again and again and again....soon, singaporeans would be demoralised by continuous war and many would emigrate. SO the author's strategy is flawed in my opinion. I think the only way singapore can survived a post war with malaysia is ..... by ensuring that there is NO malaysia left after the war.</div>
