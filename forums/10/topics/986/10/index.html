            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">Here is something new...<br><br>How feasible it is to convert A4SU to drones (for SEAD purposes - to lure the SAMs to fire at the drones and SEAD Vipers to strike the radars), UCAVs (Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles), and UAVs spy planes???<br><br>I have this vision that if RSAF can convert some A4SU to UCAVs, then they will really be some force in the region.... BTW, wonder if the current technology is available to do so.<br><br>How is a remote console going to command an aircraft that will provide live images, target information and situation awareness? A UCAV is unlike the UAV which only job is to capture images and fly back home. A UCAV will need to provide the remote controller (pilot) to have the same situation awareness as if the pilot is in the cockpit himself perhaps through the use of virtual reality.<br><br>Furthermore, if the technology available today can provide the necessary bandwidth to download so much information to a single jet? How about a couple of fighters at one time???<br><br>Some really interesting thoughts... I hope this will generate a couple of comments from everyone.... tripwire, viper52, shotgun, et. al.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>I think the UCAV would be very feasible in the future.... especially helpful for a country like ours with small population coupled with high spectacle rate.....<br><br>But i disagreed in that a UCAV needs to have a remote human pilot.... on the ground or whereever they choose to place the command centre..... the presence of a command centre makes it a hot target for enemy actions... either overt or covert.<br><br>I believe a better option is to provide the UCAV with advance logic AI to allow the UCAV to ID the enemy with advance IFF and engage at will when given full permission from ground command..... If all the UCAV can communicate with one another... they could collaborate and assit one another to achieve maximum kill.... *dream.... a group of 4 to 6 UCAV fighters chasing and closing on each enemy fighter like a wolf pack, or a pirana frenzy attack that will tear any enemy air force to shreds beyond recognition!!* in the event of lost of communications... the UCAV can be pre-programmed to either to CAP, proceed with planned mission or return to base....<br><br>The UCAV construct must be designed for possible mass construction. yet resuable to cut cost... but... if it is cheap enough... no reason why the UCAV cannot do a kamikaze... hehehee.... we will contruct a shinto temple for the UCAV... hehehee....<br><br>Another addition will be STEALTH... yes... i mean STEALTH UCAV...... terrorise the enemy... hahahaahaha.......<br><br>The UCAV must also be easy to deploy... AKA... no need stupid runway... i prefer UCAV with the ability to be launched like the MRLS system.... the landing part can be handled by a net system.... by having the UCAV on MRLS... means... the army can get air support anytime and anywhere they need it... because.... they will literary be carrying the air force with them.<br><br>But... we can have 2 type of UCAV... the smaller size for CAS and battlefield recon, the bigger version for Deep strike, air superiority, strategic strike or CAP.... we could even build a navalised version and convert our latest LST (more like LPD to me) into an aircraft carrier for hundreds of UCAV!!! heheeee.......<br><br>my imagination running wild tonight... hahaha.....<br></div>

As early as 1994, the Military Technology magazine was already reporting about Singapore talking to some European companies about acquiring second hand submarines. Mindef fervently denied any such ambition. Malaysia and Thailand at that time was eagerly trying to acquire submarines themselves. In the end, history tells us that Singapore did acquire subs, and our neighbour???? hee hee...<br><br>Well, Malaysia did eventually loan the Daken from Sweden. Will see what their next move is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The sonic boom of a bullet can be heard. Just drowned most of the time I guess. Anyway, the F-15sqn as stated, is on an exchange basis.  See them flying around quite often.<br><br>Did any tomcats take off when the kitty hawk was in town?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any idea why then is RSAF considers the F-15Es as one of the candidate for the new type of fighters? Perhaps it is the range and load capability. Rafale and Typhoon are nowhere near the range and load capability of a Strike Eagle huh.</div>
