            <div class='col-md body'>I guess I am not the only person who reckons that RSAF Vipers do not have the AVEN system installed on the PW F100-229 engines.<br><br>However, I had a picture of an active USAF Viper (looks like a Block 32) on trial on a thrust vector system called the Lo Axis. It works like the Multi-Axis Thrust-Vectoring (MATV) version where the axisymmetric nozzle features full 360-degree thrust vectoring at a maximum deflection angle of twenty degrees. The nozzle is adaptable and fits any model F100 engine.<br><br>Maybe this is what tripwire is trying to say... MATV/Lo-Axis is operation and can be retrofitted on operational F100 engines and RSAF Vipers are retrofitted with that.... But still this is unconfirmed.... No indication that USAF has adopted this and Mike is right to point out that the Americans usually (not in the case of Block 60 Vipers to UAE, 50+ to Israel and Greece) do not allow others to have a version more capable than theirs.<br><br>Who knows, perhaps USAF reckons that the JSF is about to be produced and the JSF will beat any F-16 MATV pants down. Furthermore, with AIM-9X, MATV means squat. No vipers with MATV will be able to escape X-winders, or for that matter even Python 4s or ASRAAMs.<br><br></div>

Parts commonality is not the most important consideration in making a purchase, but it is one of the most important factors when buying follow on batches of the same aircraft. The GE and PW Vipers are different beasts, and if half your Viper fleet is GE and the other half PW, it'll lead th severe logistical problems. If you're going to get a new batch of the same plane, but with different engine, then might as well get a new type.<br><br>Parts commonality not only offers logistical ease, it also allows crew which are familiar with one type of equipment to work on your entire fleet and not  train a new set of crew to work on the new type. Economies of scale are also another factor, its cheaper to buy 40 sets of X than to buy 20 sets of X and 20 of Y. Singapore is rich, not stupid.<br><br></div>

Parts commonality is not the most important consideration in making a purchase, but it is one of the most important factors when buying follow on batches of the same aircraft. The GE and PW Vipers are different beasts, and if half your Viper fleet is GE and the other half PW, it'll lead th severe logistical problems.

            <div class='col-md body'>"if i remember correctly... JSF have Vector thrust engine right?? but i dont know JSF very well... correct me if i am wrong...<br>"<br><br>Yup, and VISTA is used to test Flight Control Systems for JSF, a program which required extensive changes to the F-16 structure, avionics control systems etc. Just to install the JSF's FCS. Let say for a moment, we DO have AVEN, we would also need to make extensive changes and not just to the structure. All 3 batches of our F-16s were bought at prices of average US25-30 million(and this figure includes spares, engines, weapons and training - DoD figure). Using common sense, would the price be kept so low if such extensive mods were required?<br><br>"the RSAF Falcon is even heavier that IAF falcons with spine... right??"<br><br>Wrong. A dead giveaway is the wheels. Block 40 Falcons onwards have enlarged main LG wheels/doors. Our has this, so does the IAF's, if RSAF MTOW is really somuch heavier,  bigger wheels will be needed to take the weight<br><br>"the freedom of information act... pardon my lack of knowledge.... but i thought the act is something like.... the govt can keep thing secret for a period of 30 years...after which, the information will be made available to public... am i wrong??? if not... can you scour the DoD website for methods of Anthrax concentration method... heard that its worth quite a fortune in the black market..."<br><br>What I meant to say is that the Americans have regulations that REQUIRE them BY LAW to declare all conventional arms sales of big-ticket items to other countries, F-16s included. There can be no way that the Pentagon can secretly sell F-16s out to any country.<br><br>Stick to the topic in your arguments and counter-arguments. Stop bringing irrelavant points like anthrax in. You're arguing like a Malaysian politician.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>"see??? neither of us wanna put our friends on the line...."<br><br>Exactly, I use sources that I can openly declare to argue our F-16s has no AVENs(DoD website/lists of F-16 serials/simple deduction), you just say, "I know our F-16 has AVEN, but I can't tell you how I know". Then whats the point of telling us something you can't/refuse to substantiate?<br><br>"... did i ever said RSAF falcon have GE engine???"<br><br>You didn't but I'm still waiting to see your website listing our F-16s.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My argument is simple. RSAF F-16s have no AVENs. I know because:<br><br>1) No F-16s show up in arms sales to Singapore other than 4 known batches: 1 in 94, 96, 97 and 2000. 3 batches have been delivered, I have seen pics of almost every single one(including those based in US). And they don't have AVENs<br><br>2) AVEN/TVN/MATV was never fitted to any F-16 other than the 2 flying testbed: VISTA (terminated in 97) and another Block 30 terminated in 95<br><br>3) Let say for a moment that your argument is that the AVENs were fitted later, after delivery to Singapore. So wheres the paper trail? Like I said DoD has to release all contract details, no matter how small(as example, DoD website lists contracts for Singapore purchase of AIM-7 and -9 training rounds, and 8 Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods even BEFORE any F-16C/Ds were delievered). Don't you think that a separate contract for any AVENs will be listed if they were purchased separately? And if they came with the planes, don't you think they're going to cost more than 25-30 million each?<br><br>[This message has been edited by rsafpage (edited 26 October 2001).]</div>

Come on. You cant take the SuperHornet as an example, that's comparing durians with mangoes... The CFTs give the Falcon a deep-strike capability. Its EW suite gives it unprecedented survivability in all-missions, especially deep-strike. AESA radar enables sinultaneous terrain-following and airspace-scanning...Granted, dogfighting capability takes a hit due to the decreased T/W ratio, but in return, the vast gains in other areas more than makes up for it. It is in dogfighting that T/W matters the most but dogfighting is not ALL that the Falcon does.  I believe that it can hold its own in combat versatility when compared to the Rafale, though the Rafale, of course, has much more development potential..<br><br></div>

What I said was that a contract like a batch of F-16s with AVENs or after-sales conversion to AVEN F-16s is not something like a shipment of 100 M-16s to some freedom fighters. You cannot cover up a big sale like F-16s or AVENs with a entry of $2000 toilet bowls.

            <div class='col-md body'>Granted, I have exagerrated with the remark that Block 60 is a souped up 70s airframe, I stand corected.<br><br>Compared to the original F-16, it is a quantum leap in capablity and performance. But bringing us back to the original context of the argument, when Tripwire used the sale of Block 60s to UAE as an example that the US does not mind selling weapons more advanced than it has to other countries, is where I feel its wrong. To compare the Block 60 and the Rafale and Eurofighter in the same breath ? LM doesn't even dare to do that. It has always marketed the Block 60 as a cheaper, less capable alternative to the Rafale and Typhoon which will allow customers to get more aircraft and with a proven combat track record. If it is such a quantum leap over the Block 50/52, why do you think the USAF is not showing interest? The newer Block 50+/52+ have CFT capability and colour MFDs, granted miniturization allows the 60 to carry FLIR/TFRs etc internally, but carrying the LANTIRNs externally does offer the 40/42/50/52 more flexibility in that they can lessen the weight and leave the pods at home when not needed instead of bringing along deadweight on missions they are not needed on.<br><br>AESA is not what its all cut out to be. It has potential, I'll allow that, but even manufacturers privately admit the technolgy is still new, and that there are still limitations to the system which might take years to iron out before AESA can perform up to its potential. Which is when planes like the Typhoon and Rafale are slated to receive theirs while retaining conventional radars.<br><br>US arms export policy is always politically and self-driven. They look after their own interests first. If they think that the 60 is such a quantum leap over the 50 etc, they will NEVER clear it for export even before the first example has flown.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">Granted, I have exagerrated with the remark that Block 60 is a souped up 70s airframe, I stand corected.<br><br>Compared to the original F-16, it is a quantum leap in capablity and performance. But bringing us back to the original context of the argument, when Tripwire used the sale of Block 60s to UAE as an example that the US does not mind selling weapons more advanced than it has to other countries, is where I feel its wrong. To compare the Block 60 and the Rafale and Eurofighter in the same breath ? LM doesn't even dare to do that. It has always marketed the Block 60 as a cheaper, less capable alternative to the Rafale and Typhoon which will allow customers to get more aircraft and with a proven combat track record. If it is such a quantum leap over the Block 50/52, why do you think the USAF is not showing interest? The newer Block 50+/52+ have CFT capability and colour MFDs, granted miniturization allows the 60 to carry FLIR/TFRs etc internally, but carrying the LANTIRNs externally does offer the 40/42/50/52 more flexibility in that they can lessen the weight and leave the pods at home when not needed instead of bringing along deadweight on missions they are not needed on.<br><br>AESA is not what its all cut out to be. It has potential, I'll allow that, but even manufacturers privately admit the technolgy is still new, and that there are still limitations to the system which might take years to iron out before AESA can perform up to its potential. Which is when planes like the Typhoon and Rafale are slated to receive theirs while retaining conventional radars.<br><br>US arms export policy is always politically and self-driven. They look after their own interests first. If they think that the 60 is such a quantum leap over the 50 etc, they will NEVER clear it for export even before the first example has flown. </div></blockquote>"If it is such a quantum leap over the Block 50/52, why do you think the USAF is not showing interest?"<br>There was an F-16X version which was with a delta wing, I think it is the pic of the F-16 posted a few posts above, that had ALMOST the capability of the<br>JSF fighter(lack stealth, of course), and was cheaper than the JSF. However, the USAF hurriedly cut funds to more research on this variant because they did not want Congress to get wind of this aircraft and then forcing them to accept the F-16X instead of the JSF. So as not to be stuck with an aircraft model which did not have anymore upgrade potential left, they did not want the F-16X.<br><br>"If they think that the 60 is such a quantum leap over the 50 etc, they will NEVER clear it for export even before the first example has flown"<br>Not so. It seems each of the services decide whether or not to sell, and the USAF is much more willing than say, the Army, to sell stuff more advanced than what they have.<br><br>As for that part about the AESA radar, could you give me where you got than? I'm pretty interested in AESA radars, and I'm always trying to find out more on them :-)<br></div>

The US has repeated said that it will not intriduce new weapons technolgy to this region(hence the stalling on AMRAAMs to singapore and Thailand), then wouldn't selling AVENs(IF it exists - and I've yet to see a publication or source that it is fitted on PRODUCTION - and not testbed F-16s)be a violation of that rule.

What I said was that a contract like a batch of F-16s with AVENs or after-sales conversion to AVEN F-16s is not something like a shipment of 100 M-16s to some freedom fighters. You cannot cover up a big sale like F-16s or AVENs with a entry of $2000 toilet bowls.

By blabbing about RSAF Vipers having AVENs on a public forum, you've already wiolated the rules you're supposed to work under.

Using the list from Scramble(some members whom I've met and corresponded with for years), please explain how AVENs were fitted to some of our F-16s, as RSAF distributed the 3 batches more or less evenly bwtween the Singapore and US based units. FYI, the US-based units have pics of their aircraft have all over the Net and books, and they don't have AVENs as far as I can see.<br><br></div></blockquote>...... peng.... why am i talking to a mule....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm Let me reiterate my point.  When the US government cannot let make arms sales in secret to certain countries, does not mean it WILL NOT do so.  Damn it, I don't even know what this is all about, why is there discussion about such black sales when nobody actually knows about them.  Whether our F-16s have DASH or similar HMS, its the duty of pilots to keep their mouth shut about it.  Unless that is, some military mag makes publications on it.  But let me ask a question of logic and reason.  Malaysian MiG-29 has HMS, a very advantageous feature in a dogfight.  Do you think Singapore will decide to lag behind in this area?  Malaysia has acquired Adders, do you think Singapore is gonna just sit back and not acquire other MRMs and wait for AMRAAMs.  AMRAAMS which may not even effectively counter the vympel R-77?  I have seen publications on Israeli mags that almost confirm Singapore purchased Alto/Derby.<br><br>To whoever who was "advising" against buy the derby simply because we had Sparrows, read on.<br>The AIM-7E is a very old missile.  It is Semi Active Radar Homing, which requires the launch aircraft to paint the target continuously or the missile will fail.  That means the F-16 firing must point its nose @ the target.  The Alto/Derby, and the AMRAAMs we have not recieved, are ARH, Active radar homing, which means they can paint and track the target on their own, allowing the F-16 dodge other inbound missile.<br><br>High profile weapons, like AMRAAMs, (conveniently splashed over headlines of local newspapers), are stalled because they do not wish to introduce this kinda weapons in the region first.  But, Singapore and Thailand are CLEARED to recieve them.  Thailand recieved the clearance much earlier.<br><br>To Viper52, unlike the US government, we do not have a Freedom of Information Act.  We also do not publish every single military secret we fucking have on the internet, nor splash our F-16 Modifications for everybody to see.  We also don't like telling people that we bought Alto/Derby just because we fucking didn't recieve our AMRAAMs.  For people outside the military, they can only speculate, but no one will every confirm with anyone outside what we have and what we don't have.  So neither is anybody here confirming anything.  All people here are doing are just offering a simple "why not?" to reasonably believable claims.  Even pilots won't know the kill probability of their missiles until they fire their first warshots.  Until the government confirms the F-16s have HMS (which it doesnt have a NEED to), there is nothing wrong with discussing the possibility of having it or finding evidence that we have it.</div>

He sai he saw almost ALL not ALL. You don't need to snoop around RSAF bases to get numbers:<br><br>- Combat Aircraft magazine May 99 lists ALL the Cannon-based RSAF Falcon serial numbers PLUS several pics of them<br>- KokuFan magazine Feb/Mar 2001. Features shots of NOZZLES and more of 6 140 Sqn Vipers in Australia on exercise<br>- AFM one of the 2001 issues shows 4 RSAF Falcons on an article of an Israeli Air Combat Manoevuring system sold to Singapore<br>- USAF Yearbook 2000 features the Luke based RSAF Squadron<br>- The following websites have several shots of RSAF US-based Falcons on Red Flag and Maple Flag exercises:<br><a href="http://www.steehouwer.com" rel="nofollow">www.steehouwer.com</a>  <a href="http://members.xoom.com/bgilson/" rel="nofollow">http://members.xoom.com/bgilson/</a>  <a href="http://www.air-and-space.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.air-and-space.com/</a><br><br>There are of course more legit sources of photos I don't know about. But using the sources above, you can get a fairly good idea of ALMOST ALL of the Vipers from the 3 batches.<br><br>These pictures are easily available and can be sourced all over the world. Don't need to do any spying or illegal methods to see these pictures and to see pics of almost all the Vipers in RSAF inventory.<br></div>
