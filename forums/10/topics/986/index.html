            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br>i've attach one of the postin from this particular forum... the URL add was <a href="http://users3.cgiforme.com/javad/messages/513.html......" rel="nofollow">http://users3.cgiforme.com/javad/messages/513.html......</a>  just wonder isit true... any comment????<br><br>This message was posted by Flanker, posted on April 01, 2001 at 08:09:39 coming from No domain available<br><br>Whats the use of singapore aquiring the amraams in responce to malaysia's aquisition of the AA12 adder?.. the AIM120 may be advanced.. but their F16's has a smaller radar with smaller detection range than the Mig 29's operated by our(malaysian) airforce!!!!!!!! while their AIM120 is also much shotter ranged to our Adders ,So in the BVR fight.. the 1st Fox 3 uttered will be by our Pilots n not those singaporeans.. and if the F16 did manage to evade n come closer for a dogfight, it will probbably be his last..Our HMS will allow us the 1st shot again.. coupled with the migs excelent agility!!..its just plain suicide for those singaporean F16's to ever think of winning a dogfight with our Mig 29's!<br>I'm not saying this much in hatred towards singapore.. but its just that their goverment cant help but to be a sheer nuisance to us being at our own backyard! For God sake they depend on us from food to water, if we really would want to attck singapore.. we would just have to cut their food and water supplies...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>p/s we didnt aquire the migs nor the adders for aggresion reason, but solely for the purpose of defending our borders.Fortunately for the singaporeans we do not believe in that way..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Hooyah for us dont quit!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RMAF AA12 ADDER does indeed have a greater range than RSAF AMRAAM.<br><br>but....... till now, the russian didnt gave the malaysai a single AA12, that is why singapore dont get to keep those AMRAAM we bought from USA becos the US wont release it to us unless another nation a.k.a. malaysia manage to get its hand on the AA12.<br><br>secondly, the malaysai upon realizing the difficulty of getting the AA12, now have to end up begging the US for Sparrow BVR to counter the Sparrows BVR missile already in RSAF inventory.<br><br>IF malaysai have AA12, why the fuck u think they want to waste money buying Sparrow BVR.<br><br>so the dream of malaysai Mig shouting the first FOX3! onli happens in their imagination fueled by cock up news reporter who simply love to butter their leaders stuck up ass.<br><br>for your information, the AA12 can only work with russian made radar which is a crap when it comes to ground attack, which is why maharaja have to end up buying hornets to do that bombing part.<br><br>furthermore, the AA12 require guidance for most of its initial flight all the way up approximately about 40km from its intended target. during this time, if the Falcon initiates EW, ECM,ECCM or decided to do an NOE, that AA12 would become one blind adder.muahahaaa<br><br>Malaysai says their mig got big radar, so it means long range. what kind of crap relationship is there between size of radar and the range of a radar??? but then we have E-2C, which piggyback one giant radar dish. i would like to see the mig carrying one of that to beat the range of our hawkeyes. hahaaa<br><br>Malaysai thinks that its mig got HMS very shiok, can have wide 45 degree cone of firing. tell the malaysai go home makan pisang. tell them RSAF F-16 also got HMS with python-4 that has a firing cone of 60 degree and with a 2 hit flight programe. plus AVEN vector thrust engine that boost the most agile fighter in the world (F-16 not fulcrum) a further 30 percent increase in agility. Tell them that RSAF F-16 got LANTIRN that enables our falcons to bomb malaysai all night long while their fulcrum like all the kuku birds of malaysai, cannot do night combat and is pitifully dependent on fly by instrument if they wish to die in a night fight.<br><br>Tell them too, that RSAF falcons are wild weasels, combined with the best EW suit from US and Isreal. tell them too that RSAF now has 3 times more falcons than they have fulcrums, all pilots trained in US of A. Tell them we have KC135R that can send our falcons all the way to perlis and bomb their banana tree if we so desire.<br><br>And if all those above is not enough, we are currently looking into Rafael, SU-33MK, Typhoon, JSF and Viggen, the next generation of fighters to replace our skyhawks or tigers. each of those above got systems and weapons that malaysai can only see in their comic books. weapons like JSOW, Apache SOW and stealth features.<br><br>NOT ENOUGH??? HELL..... RSAF now got more than enough firepower to wipe 3 RMAF clean off the face of the earth without much sweat.<br><br>but why we even bother to counter the statment from a guy whose country that dont even have enough money to train its pilot, maintain its planes, buy spareparts and have to rely on foreign engineers to keep their planes flying????<br><br>for god sake, with onli 17 mig, this translate to no more than 8 mig is available to defend the whole of malaysai airspace at any one time. how great a defense is that????? we got more planes doing fly by on national day then they have defending the entire malaysai air space!!!</div>
