            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 cents.  No I have not done NS yet, but I like to keep ahead regarding military issues.  I believe that if there is gonna be a war, information is ammunition.<br><br>True, our procurement and development advanced weaponry will start an arms race.  But, even if we were to stop modernizing, will our neighbours see that as a sign of goodwill or a sign of weakness?  What makes you think they will stop modernizing?  It is unfortunate, but this the way the world works.  TiT for Tat or, You scratch my back and i scratch yours.  Diplomacy is the key to preventing an arms race from erupting into a war.  Arms race can be seen as "joint military development" or a plain arms race, this depends on diplomacy and bilateral ties.  So far, Singapore has done its part in extending a warm hand of friendship, but particular regional neighbours have not returned their hand in a similar fashion. Instead they point fingers criticizing everything.  Whats their motive? To divert their public attention or what?  Nobody knows.<br><br>The truth is, if neighbours are not gonna smile and shake your hand, better make sure your pistol is locked and loaded.  You never know when you're gonna need it.  To halt or slowdown modernization in fear of starting an arms race is foolish and suicide.  Sure, one should not develop a weapon too powerful that it can lead to a Major arms problem, but Singapore is just purchasing according to her own needs as strategic planners map out potential threats.  Why would Singapore purchase potentially offensive weapon such as attack helicopters?  These fast riding weapons have roles that allow it to take out long ranged weapons such as howitzers while staying out of SAM range or cover.  "He who breaks his opponent's weapons may strike with impunity." Sun Tzu art of war.  And we all know the best defense is a better offense.<br><br>I don't know about the rest of you.  I'm not financially well off, and I cannot leave the country in times of crises.  As much as I have considered retiring to Australia, that would probably in the last days of my life.  And I am sure there will be many others like me, we have no where to go.  Singapore is gonna be our home, we are gonna live here and die here if there is gonna be a war.<br><br>Sure we do not have much to defend.  Condos are not economic assets, neither is an airport worth human lives.  I am sure we had MUCH less to defend in 1942, condos sure are worth more than kampongs, and Changi Airport worth more than the lousy RAF strips.  If the volunteer corps saw worth in laying their lives for their kampongs and strips, I don't see why we will not lay down ours for our Changi Airport and Condos.  The Foreign forces based in singapore in 1942 saw them as mere worthless infrastructure.  Do we, who live in Singapore see the toils of our past generation as worthless infrastructures too?  Singaporeans are becoming more materialistic, many will answer Yes.<br><br>Look @ the native americans, the caucasians stripped their land, many of them have lost their own culture.  The Jews attacked lynched and many fled, if not for the formation of Israel, would they still have their culture today?  Whats the difference? The native americans could not defend themselves, while the Jews held off the Ragheads during the Yom Kippur.  If they fall, they will be gone.<br><br>If Singapore loses, gone will be our hardwork.  Our IT infrastructure, our culture, our way of living, our Singlish, our multi-racial society.  It maybe replaced by one that regards 1 race superior over the others.  To those who can leave the country in a Safe 747 to a far off land, they won't care.  Those of us who cannot leave, it will mean the world to us.<br><br>Leaders should lead by example, but they don't have to foolishly charge into a fray to get themselves killed while accomplishing nothing.  Such people will not even fit to be leaders.  Leaders will lead by setting an example to resist, to inspire the people and to instill the essence of courage.  And when necessary, pick up a rifle and pull the trigger.  If there is such a fine leader, he should not die, cos if he does, hope will be lost.<br><br>I may not have sang Majulah Singapura since I left secondary school.  But when i hear it @ 6am on the radio, I'm glad.  Hell, at least its our anthem.</div>

Arms race can be seen as "joint military development" or a plain arms race, this depends on diplomacy and bilateral ties.  So far, Singapore has done its part in extending a warm hand of friendship, but particular regional neighbours have not returned their hand in a similar fashion. Instead they point fingers criticizing everything.  Whats their motive? To divert their public attention or what?  Nobody knows.<br><br>The truth is, if neighbours are not gonna smile and shake your hand, better make sure your pistol is locked and loaded.  You never know when you're gonna need it.  To halt or slowdown modernization in fear of starting an arms race is foolish and suicide.  Sure, one should not develop a weapon too powerful that it can lead to a Major arms problem, but Singapore is just purchasing according to her own needs as strategic planners map out potential threats.  Why would Singapore purchase potentially offensive weapon such as attack helicopters?  These fast riding weapons have roles that allow it to take out long ranged weapons such as howitzers while staying out of SAM range or cover.  "He who breaks his opponent's weapons may strike with impunity." Sun Tzu art of war.  And we all know the best defense is a better offense.<br><br>I don't know about the rest of you.  I'm not financially well off, and I cannot leave the country in times of crises.  As much as I have considered retiring to Australia, that would probably in the last days of my life.  And I am sure there will be many others like me, we have no where to go.  Singapore is gonna be our home, we are gonna live here and die here if there is gonna be a war.<br><br>Sure we do not have much to defend.  Condos are not economic assets, neither is an airport worth human lives.  I am sure we had MUCH less to defend in 1942, condos sure are worth more than kampongs, and Changi Airport worth more than the lousy RAF strips.  If the volunteer corps saw worth in laying their lives for their kampongs and strips, I don't see why we will not lay down ours for our Changi Airport and Condos.  The Foreign forces based in singapore in 1942 saw them as mere worthless infrastructure.  Do we, who live in Singapore see the toils of our past generation as worthless infrastructures too?  Singaporeans are becoming more materialistic, many will answer Yes.<br><br>Look @ the native americans, the caucasians stripped their land, many of them have lost their own culture.  The Jews attacked lynched and many fled, if not for the formation of Israel, would they still have their culture today?  Whats the difference? The native americans could not defend themselves, while the Jews held off the Ragheads during the Yom Kippur.  If they fall, they will be gone.<br><br>If Singapore loses, gone will be our hardwork.  Our IT infrastructure, our culture, our way of living, our Singlish, our multi-racial society.  It maybe replaced by one that regards 1 race superior over the others.  To those who can leave the country in a Safe 747 to a far off land, they won't care.  Those of us who cannot leave, it will mean the world to us.<br><br>Leaders should lead by example, but they don't have to foolishly charge into a fray to get themselves killed while accomplishing nothing.  Such people will not even fit to be leaders.  Leaders will lead by setting an example to resist, to inspire the people and to instill the essence of courage.  And when necessary, pick up a rifle and pull the trigger.  If there is such a fine leader, he should not die, cos if he does, hope will be lost.<br><br>I may not have sang Majulah Singapura since I left secondary school.  But when i hear it @ 6am on the radio, I'm glad.  Hell, at least its our anthem.</div></blockquote>beautiful words.... but still only words.<br><br>In fact... u pointed out the very problem of singapore... we fight, not because we feel it is our duty to fight a.k.a. loyalty, courage and patriotism. BUT we fight because we have no other alternatives a.k.a. out of desperation, fear and coercion.<br><br>in a country where the govt would not pull out an extra buck to alleviate the difficulties of its own citizens like those in destitude or suffering from HIV and other diseases.... it makes one feel the cruel efficiency of a high power CPU... a heartless one.<br><br>come war and if i should lay my life for the country... will the country remember my sacrifice and do all it can to support the family i left behind.... OR will the country treats me just as another number in the registry of death and continue to work with cold harsh efficiency and my family forced to subsist as best they could?<br><br>Remember my dear fellow countrymen... the govt never promised to fend for your family should u die in service of the nation BUT we as Citizens are expected to die for the country if need be.<br><br>Nevertheless... having seen how the govt deals with foreign talents with wide open arms and how quick the govt has been in discarding fellow singaporeans suffering from AIDs.... what is there worth defending?? the land, the buildings, the cars, the airport and the land we stand on... .... what are these to a dead man?<br><br>the govt stand on HIV awakens me... the govt only value us as long as we can contribute to the economy... and when we cant or became a burden..... we can only hope for divine deliverance.. A gracious singapore indeed, the PM called... nobody seems to be listening in the civil service.<br><br>Better to run away and live then to die in war for the country... as long as u live and can contribute to the rebuilding of singapore. i believe the govt would still welcome u with open arms, deserters or not. On the other hand... if you should become handicapped in war... pray the govt would have enough compassion to grant u a measly allowance like NSF for u to just get by.<br><br>Secondly... there are good leaders no doubt... but as humans with limited capacity and capability... it is obvious... that under duress... they could end up being managed by those that they were supposed to be managing OR they would end up doing things wrong and creates havoc if they force their wills upon their subordinate despite their deficiency in experience, knowledge and qualification to the problems faced.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hardware:</div><div class="quote_body"> One question, will people donate money to  HIV's patients for their treatment. If there is a possibility, can we decide who to donate to? For example, those who got infected from their parents and through family member or from attacks by HIV carriers. And Not for those who had contacted Aids from prostitude, alot of 1 night stands and homos.<br><br>This may sound cold-blooded but it would serve as a warning to the public. Therefore all donations will be given only to victims.</div></blockquote>I sincerely hope that the govt will try to help the less fortunate in singapore... not just the sick or terminally illed but likewise those who are at the bottom of the society.<br><br>The govt should reach out to them and give them a helping hand... becos often.. many in destitude dont even know where to approach for help.<br><br>Sadly.. govt assistance for the poor seems miserable.. i believe many of u have read in the paper of govt grants to poor individuals worth merely a measly few hundred at the most... sad...<br><br>without care and concern... society will break apart and the pyschological impact on the rest of us to see the cold-hearted nature of the civil servants makes one become just as materialistic and uncaring...<br><br>HOW the hell the govt expect our social defence and pyschological defense to withstand the test of a crisis where every man will be left to fend for himself???<br><br>No point buiding a strong economic and military defence...because if the people lost heart in the country due to a breakdown in psychological and social defense... then obviously we are gonna loose any war that comes knocking on our door.<br><br>Among the 5 defence of total defence... pyschological and social defence must come first and foremost... else though we may have lots of weapons and high tech stuffs to toy around... we will continue to hear people dissenting about the purpose of NS and whether any singaporean would stay to fight.<br><br>i believe sun tzu say something about winning the hearts of the people and uniting the minds of the populace before going to war. sadly... our govt seems to flop pretty bad with respect to this.<br><br>IF the people of singapore cannot feel a common sense of unity.... then... we are gonna loose the war. at this point... the people of singapore are little more then a pile of scattered sand...</div>

IF the govt just laid back and say... there is no need to improve further.. then one day we will find ourselves not so well off.<br><br>And though malaysia may not be better then singapore.. there are strong points too in malaysia over singapore... first and foremost, i believe many malaysians will fight to save their country.. not much hope seeing that here in singapore if we continue to have bureaucrates running the shows instead of technocrats.<br><br>JUST look at how badly we lost against manchester united in the soccer match.. this is the team that is supposed to get singapore into the world cup!! and look at how they pat each others back when we lost 1 to 8!! instead of saying we lost more goals to MU than malaysia who only lost 6.. our dailies went around praising that we manage to score 1 goal while malaysia score nothing!!<br><br>IF I AM THE PM.... I WILL FIRE THE ENTIRE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL AND PUT ManU TEAM MANAGER ON IT!!<br><br>if singaporeans can be replaced by foreign talents because we dont make the cut... then we too must demand that local officials who dont make the cut to GET LOST and be replace by foreign talents as well!<br><br>NOT fair to play double standard right??</div>
