            <div class='col-md body'>J Black, the E-2s were upgraded a while back. IIRC the article in ST said it was a local upgrade, with colour CRTs and not too sure what else, no mention of radar upgrade, and I really don't know anything else.<br><br>However there was some loose talk in some aviation mags, nothing certain, that RSAF was previously interested in getting PHALCON some years back. Nothing came out of that one though...I think...<br><br>Just wondering, what do you guys think will come to Asian Aerospace 2002? There was nothing on the AA website yet...<br><br>Me thinks with the fighter contest entering the final straight, the Typhoon and Rafale will come, together with the usual F-15s and F-16s from PACAF assets in Japan, but I think aircraft attendance will be hit by the general security and economic conditions worldwide, and we might end up seeing a 2nd "RSAF Open House" like the 98 show, when action against Saddam caused the withdrawal of a lot of USAF and USN aircraft and forced RSAF to "plug in" an F-5S and a TA-4SU at the last minute to make sure theres not too many gaps at the static display.<br><br>I saw the Typhoon at RIAT 98 in UK, it made a single pass flyby with the Red Arrows then, and I sure like to see its full display to see how it stacks up...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Hawkeyes were, as reported, mainly software upgraded. No mention about hardware upgrades. However, it must be noted that software upgrades can improve the performance of a radar quite substantially by maximising the hardware's potential.<br>Does anyone know roughly when Singapore's Falcons will be slated to be replaced? any chance they will be upgraded in order to postpone replacement?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd say the vipers will stay for at least another 15 years.  By then, we would have a main fleet of Typhoons and have the F-16s in a pure strike/SEAD role.

Able to work as a MLD, IRST, FLIR and Night Vision equipment at the same time, with full 360 degree coverage!!! jeez, i'm salivating.... I just hope that when we can get it, we wont get a downgraded version, which is possible, as its stealth is a new capability in this region....<br><br></div>
