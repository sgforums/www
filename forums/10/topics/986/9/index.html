Both tripwire and Viper52 made their points. It is always good to see people passionate about their believes. In Singapore, we are taught to only accepts authority and never questions. Here on the internet, we should be able to voice whatever we wish, however passionate it might be.<br><br>I can see that tripwire and Viper52 have substantially knowledge about military hardware especially in RSAF inventory. They might be right, they might be wrong. Who cares... we are here to voice what we have discovered through official or unofficial sources. People can choose to believe that they wish.<br><br>Afterall, we know that Mindef and RSAF will not reveal what they intend to keep as secret by hook or by crook. Anyone leaking sensitive information will never get out of their hands. If by mistakes they accidentally leak any informaiton to the public domain, they that's their fault.<br><br>There are more secrets of RSAF then if the Vipers have MATV, Lo-Axi thrust vectoring, AVEN F110 engines, or any other things they might have.<br><br>Its all in the name of interest and fun that people throw challenges at each other to "prove" their sources...

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is something new...<br><br>How feasible it is to convert A4SU to drones (for SEAD purposes - to lure the SAMs to fire at the drones and SEAD Vipers to strike the radars), UCAVs (Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles), and UAVs spy planes???<br><br>I have this vision that if RSAF can convert some A4SU to UCAVs, then they will really be some force in the region.... BTW, wonder if the current technology is available to do so.<br><br>How is a remote console going to command an aircraft that will provide live images, target information and situation awareness? A UCAV is unlike the UAV which only job is to capture images and fly back home. A UCAV will need to provide the remote controller (pilot) to have the same situation awareness as if the pilot is in the cockpit himself perhaps through the use of virtual reality.<br><br>Furthermore, if the technology available today can provide the necessary bandwidth to download so much information to a single jet? How about a couple of fighters at one time???<br><br>Some really interesting thoughts... I hope this will generate a couple of comments from everyone.... tripwire, viper52, shotgun, et. al.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"As well as the F-16, Singapore's Air Force also has a big fleet of F-5 Tiger II. Their introduction started in 1979, although over the years some second hand aircraft have also been added. In the meantime eight of the F-5E have been altered into RF-5E Tigereye-photographic reconnaissance aircraft and the rest has been thoroughly modernised. The F-5S are now equipped with a Grifo radar. They also have a 1553B-databus as well as a cockpit with displays, a new head-up-display and helmet sight. Elbit of Israel was responsible for system integration, although the lion share of the work was carried out in the country by Singapore Technologies Aerospace."

It should be like the current UAV aircraft, where waypoints are fed to the computer and the plane essentially flys itself.<br>Communications - How can we ensure that the communications link wont be broken? The enemy will surely try to break our link with the UCAV, and this ties in with the autonomy the UCAV has.<br><br>Other problems are how do you integrate the UCAV's operations with the rest of the air-force? problems like flying in the same air-space, giving the chance of mid-air collisons surface.</div>

Data transmission/Networking technology is ever evolving... who knows what will be available in 5 years or 10 years time. We might be able to come up with an algorithm that can allow multiple video rely. Perhaps CNN has something in the pipeline that DSO can borrow...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> hee hee.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>What i feel being the most possible would be a instruction to switch to a backup programme.

It easy to program an UAV for a recon or spy mission as the flight plans are pre-determined. For UCAV, the vehicles must either have an AI so capable of making decision to attack targets which are ever changing or moving; or be able to support remote presence, ie Virtual reality.<br><br>US/UK solution to the UCAV is to have at least 1 manned craft to command a few unmanned crafts. The pilot of the manned craft will designate the target or directthe UCAVs to their targets.<br><br>Alternatively is to use the drone method. Each UCAV is controlled by a remote station with the a ground-pilot controlling the aircraft. This will call for all the information to be uplink to the satellite and downlink to the control station at real-time. Very high bandwidth method. The remote station also has to purposely built to mimic the cockpit of the aircraft for the pilot to "feel" like actual flying of the aircraft. This technology is kinda available in the form of ACMI, but need some serious technology advancement to make this viable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is possible to design artificial intelligence for the UCAV.  I mean, all you have to do is borrow the AI codes from respectable Simulation games.<br><br>I remember when I took my first crack at Su-27 Flanker.  It was THE toughest sim in town. In terms of air-combat, the AI was almost fantastic, almost impossible to beat given the restriction of the keyboard and joystick.  Only problem was, the AI tend to freeze when a long range SAM is fired at it.  It would just fly straight, popping chaff n flare and BOOM.  Dead AI.<br><br>In anycase, there are many ways to go about handling the UCAV.  Being the IT centre that Singapore is, we would probably see a mix of all of the above or something totally ingenious.<br><br>By the way, anybody heard of anything about robot combat units in the SAF?  Supposedly combat arms such as high powered rifles and MGs mounted on mini-mechanised units. Kinda like moving-turrets.  I sort of heard this rumor flying out from thin air one day.</div>
