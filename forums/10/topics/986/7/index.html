The cobra manoeuvre is indeed not easy for a normal pilot to achieve but if there is enough training, any particular MIG29 pilot can do it. This manoeuvre Russian, so Russian pilots must know how to do it. In a dogfight, it is extremely useful.<br><br>Imagine you are a pilot of lets say... an F16C and you are on the six of a MIG29(of any model). Suddenly, the MIG pulled up and an experienced pilot would not follow suit. Not because your falcon is not agile enough but your jet which is going at speed of 3 times the fulcrum will crash into the Fulcrum. Why? because when a cobra manoeuvre is put up, the MIG pilot will pull up but at that split seconds, the pilot decreased his throttle to the lowest. That will make the MIG stay nose up, stay still at that position for about 3-4 seconds and then due to gravitational pull, the nose of the fulcrum will head almost vertically down. An experienced MIG pilot will know that he must not immediately pull up as it will cause him to blackout. When the MIG suck in enough air into its intake, the pilot will know when to go to full throttle again. This will give the MIG an advantage as it will be at the six of the F16C which had passed below him but if the F16C pilot is alert and intelligent enough, he will bank away before the MIG can get at his six as the time needed for the MIG to start its throttle takes some time. If possible and quick enough, the F16C can get back at the MIG's tail again. So, the Cobra manoeuvre would be a good evasive action and to escape from being hit by gun. I think tohse who know the cobra manouevre would agree with me that the cobra manoeuvre is better used as an evasive action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Really, the cobra maneuvre is just a crowd-pleasing maneuvre for air-shows, thats all. In combat, energy is life. In using the cobra, the pilot sacrifices all the planes energy in return for 1 shot, which die die also must kill his target. If not, he will be a dead duck, as his plane will not be able to recover in time. Also, this is a hypothetical situation where its a 1V1 situation. if the enemy has a wingman, he's a dead duck, totally, absolutely. Even the Russians acknowledge this.<br>However, they said that the cobra-maneuver was not intended for close combat. Rather, it is to be used to deceive the AWACS radar by taking advantage of the weakness of the doppler effect. two flights of aircraft flying very close together would approach the AWACS, and one flight would execute this maneuvre, causing the AWACS to lose track of that particular flight, while holding track on the other flight proceeding towards the AWACS. The flight which executed the cobra would then dive for the deck and hopefully the AWACS would not track them in the ground-clutter. They would then race to the AWACS to finish it off.</div>

In combat, energy is life. In using the cobra, the pilot sacrifices all the planes energy in return for 1 shot, which die die also must kill his target. If not, he will be a dead duck, as his plane will not be able to recover in time. Also, this is a hypothetical situation where its a 1V1 situation. if the enemy has a wingman, he's a dead duck, totally, absolutely. Even the Russians acknowledge this.<br>However, they said that the cobra-maneuver was not intended for close combat. Rather, it is to be used to deceive the AWACS radar by taking advantage of the weakness of the doppler effect. two flights of aircraft flying very close together would approach the AWACS, and one flight would execute this maneuvre, causing the AWACS to lose track of that particular flight, while holding track on the other flight proceeding towards the AWACS. The flight which executed the cobra would then dive for the deck and hopefully the AWACS would not track them in the ground-clutter. They would then race to the AWACS to finish it off.</div></blockquote>AWACS fly damn high and has a very long scanning range....<br><br>true that 2 plane flying close could end up being mapped as a single blip on the radar... but everyone knows that....<br><br>In fact... upon confirmation of potential intruder... fighters would have been launch to intercept and investigate the bogey radar blip....<br><br>And no AWACS will allow any unidentified aircraft from getting near it... including the AWACS fighter escort will see to that... once an UFA reach within a certain distance from the AWACS... it is automatically considered as hostile unless it can ID itself...<br><br>that idea the russian came up with if bullshit....<br><br>if the ground clutter can supposedly cover the radar signal of an approaching fulcrum... why dont the 2 fulcrum starts out by doing NOE???<br><br>obviously this isnt gonna work... becos AWACS are designed to specifically to pick up such NOE intruders which would be invisible to ground base radar....<br><br>And even if the fulcrum managed somehow to fly towards the AWACS... in order to attack it... the fulcrum needs to gain altitude since AWACS usually works in high altitude... the minute the fulcrum break off NOE.. it will be detected by the AWACS... once the fulcrum reach about certain height... even the ground radar can detect it...<br><br>time to rock....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Patriotic Tim, I think you watch too much Top Gun liao.  You're probably thinking about the "I'll pop the brakes and He'll fly right by....."  Sorry, but that does not exist in close air combat.<br><br>There are a lot of pre-requisites to enter the cobra maneuver.  The plane must first fly STRAIGHT at a speed of 350mph.  To fly straight in close combat will almost guarantee you dead.  Then the MiG-29 or Su-27 must pitch up above 90 degrees, thus offering a bigger target to shoot at.  When the aircraft recovers from the cobra maneuver, it will stagger around 280mph, near stall speed, forbiding the aircraft from anymore evasive manuever.<br><br>If I was a pilot behind the MiG-29, I'd take a missile shot when he starts running straight.  If he's caught attempting the cobra, he'd be caught like a dead duck without a chance to evade.  (You cannot turn in a cobra, or risk entering a steep spin).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the cobra is kinda confused with a similar manuever.  I forgot the name but this is how it goes.<br><br>The flanker first enters a steep climb, 90 degrees vertical.   Once that is established, cuts the engines down to idle, slowing the climb.  It will reach a point where there is not enough thrust to climb, and it actually slides back down on its tail. The nose dips, heading down towards the ground, re-engaging the engines back to full military.<br><br>This maneuver can be used to temporarily confuse a tracking AWACs.  They might think that the aircraft stalled while attemptin to climb.<br><br>However, the point in all this, is not demonstrating how the manuevers are useful in combat.  But rather, how the aircraft can withstand high angles of attack without stalling.  This allows the aircraft to turn tighter at lower airspeeds.<br><br>TVC aside, most western aircraft can only turn at a certain rate.  The F-16 bein one that can turn the fastest, with minimal loss of airspeed.  Once the limit is reached, the F-16 cannot continue to increase its turn rate without runnin the risk of losing all its airspeed and stalling.  The Su-27 and the MiG-29 were designed to push the limit.  The had high AOA tolerances, to allow to push the turn rate beyond the limits of conventional aircraft, without stalling.<br><br>If you were an F-16 pilot, looking back, u will suddenly realise the flanker managed to actually "OUT TURN" you beyond the physics of conventional flight.  This being a normal sustained turning flight. Combined with a simple High G Yo Yo, the flanker can almost out turn the F-16 easily.  ( of course, the F-16 pilot can counter with a High-G Yoyo of his own.)<br><br>[This message has been edited by Shotgun (edited 23 October 2001).]</div>

Thus for Singapore to venture this alone is pretty unprecedented given RSAF prudent track record of select equipment only after they are fully tested and used by quite a few operators for at least a substantial period of time.  This is evidence in all their military hardware purchases.<br><br>Not to say that you are wrong. I am sure that RSAF have many things that the general public are not aware of.

The whole benefit of having a high off-boresight angle missiles like Python 4 is that the Off-boresight angle is achieved through pilots "looking" at the target rather than locking on by the radars/HUDs.<br><br>I do however believe that RSAF already have Python 4 in its inventory.

I am just not sure that Singapore is being approved to purchase HARMs.  US have a very funny policy of not wanting the regional countries to have certain weapons until the neighbouring countries have similar weapons thru other parties such as the Europeans or Russians.<br><br><blockquote><br>*** Dont seem that obvious to me... if something is that obvious... so much for military secret....

I don't think we can boast too much about what RSAF have or don't have, especially the hush hush stuffs.  RSAF is  very capable. I have read about their capabilities, I have spoken to some pilot friends, technicans (I even have a relative who works in RSAF as a technican attached to a F-16 sqn in the US).<br><br>I am aware that my knowledge is limited and who like to hear from people who knows more, but have hard concrete evidence (either seeing the stuffs themselves or know of some RSAF personal who have seen or use the weapons).</div>
