Look at Brazil, even under one of the most capable coach in the world. They struggling even to qualify World Cup. If Singapore's 'World Cup' team can beat ALL teams in ASIA in the next 10 years, then I'll go to Mah Bao Tan to apologies and slap myself for cursing him for all these years. I love Singapore but I couldn't help cheering for MAN UTD when they GOAL!!! That should wake FAS(Singapore) and Mah's biggest joke in Singapore history.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All these arguments about MIG-29 better than F-16 are pointless my neighbour.<br><br>Just take a look at real combat scores. MIG29s got shot down by F-16s all over Yugoslavia and Iraq. Any F-16 kills by MIG 29? None.<br><br>Besides, what good is MIG-29 for Malaysia? It is so short legged that it's got problem flying to Sabah from Kuantan let to say staying up in the sky performing CAP.<br><br>MIG-29's inferior computer tracks one enemy at a time, F-16 tracks more than 10 my friend. And yes, where are your AWACS?<br><br>F-16s flies by wire. MIG-29?<br><br>Lastly, RMAF should really look into it's logistic before buying planes. Maintaing F-18 and MIG-29 in the same Air Force is gonna be a logistic nightmare. A large fleet of serviceable MIG-15s and MIG-17s for kamikaze, may be a much better choice over some MIG-29s and F-18s that cannot fly. hahaha...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to correct something.  Yes although the Serb's MiG-29's suffered massive casualties, yet it was up against a massively funded multi-national force with almost unlimited logistics for operations in that area.<br><br>The MiG-29s did however, claim kills, an F-15E Strike eagle and F-117s.<br><br>It was never the Serbian tactic to fly against the F-16s and many did not engage them.  Their MiG-29's suffered from shortage of parts as well as taxing operations.  Instead the Serbian 29's took the passive tactic, using their EOS system instead of active radar.  Believe me, they had the ability to launch the R-27 (sparrow alike), but chose not to.  They chose to stay low, and passively track NATO aircraft and launch R-73s. The MiG-29's ability to track bandits passively was definitely helping the Serbs.  And I have to agree that they functioned well against the NATO Forces.<br><br>Also, the MIG-29's the Serbs were flying were the old MiG-29As, totally not upgraded, (u should look into the cockpit of that dammed thing, totally analogue).  The Malaysian MiG-29s are somewhat Upgraded I believe.</div>
