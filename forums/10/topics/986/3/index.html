            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, why Singapore collects defense information about certain nations for analysis whether they are able to defend themselves from a foreign threat.  This in turns tells SAF how safe Singapore is around them, and whether we have to worry about a threat from their direction should they be unable to defend themselves.<br><br>In otherwords, Singapore is not actually gaining information so that we can someday prepare offensive operations against those nations.  But rather, aid in defense of ourselves and those nations around us. =P<br><br>I STILL wanna noe about those 70 typhoons!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I wouldnt be surprised if they really do buy the EF2000s.  But, I was really hoping they would have gotten the F-15Es.  F-15Es rocks man.  Their TEWS are so advanced that they have the ability to jam SAM radars to kingdom come.  Also, they can switch from a strike role to an air-to air role easily, hell, their range is long, without tanker support... WOOO!<br>The Strike Eagles were actually designed to fly solo nuke missions, past enemy defense, get their bomb on target and get back.  Imagine what this kinda capability will do for the RSAF.  But so far, i heard no one outside the United States operated the Strike eagles.  And Honestly, I really don't think Singapore needs 70 of these super eagles, 1 squadron will do fine. =PPppPPpp</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the skyhawks, maybe i can reply your question. Of the 80+ skyhawks that we operate, only 40+ is in service now(already minus the squadron replaced by 20 F16C/D). The rest is kept in store. We really cannot operate 80+ Super Skyhawks after purchasing the F16C/D which is more expensive to maintain and operate per plane. Anyway, the issue on weather which plane the EF200 would replace, i THINK that it would probably replace both the F5S and the A4SU and the total number of EF2000 purchased would be fewer than the total number of A4SU and F5S added together.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i would prefer the SU30MK over the Typhoon. My dream is for a force of 30 SU30MK long-range strike aircraft, 80+F16C/D BVR interceptor/attack aircraft. That would be the most perfect of all, but i believe that there are not any country using the SU30MK other than Russia and they won't waste energy and money starting the factory for 30 SU30MK and after that, end of story. Reason why is because SU30MK is long-range, caoable of penetrating deep into enemy territories and from what i know, there's something like a small kitchen behind the cockpit and something like a toilet too! i read it from World's Aircraft.</div>

With no pants or underwear of course.  The swapped the Zhuk Radom for a brand new microwave. Their RIght MFD houses a good portion of turkey , and their center MFD a good loaf of bread.  So' they'd  call it the Su-30KT.<br><br>ANyway, the idea would be fun. Hehehe.  I seriously support the idea for the 70 Eurofighters.  And perhaps 1 operational squadron of F-15E eagles.  RSAF will have enormous range with them new puppies in our inventory.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course it would be nice to get both the typoons and the f15s in our air force,but logistic wise,its gonna be a nightmare.that would mean that we have to train our technicians,everyone to handle 3 different types of systems,equipment etc....(dont forget our f16s)<br><br>that leads to 3 different simulators,instructors etc etc,your get the picture?i recall some article where this leading defense magazine described this particular country buying 3 types of plane to replace just one type...creating whole chain of problems,eg training,no spares etc...<br><br>thats why so many aircraft manufacturers  are offering and claim that their aircraft can doing everything,multi tasks,sort of like "bao gar liao"..<br><br>anyway,i am not too worried abt exactly wat places the airforce is getting,just the fact that we already have one of the best in the region,and that our arforce ppl are not exactly dumb ppl,lets enjoy ourselves and all cheer when we get news here and there abt the type pf planes we are getting</div>
