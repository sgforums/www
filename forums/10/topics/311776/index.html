              <p>Judging from all the happenings so far over the past many years, crisis after crisis against so many objections he persisted in taxing and underspending tax monies for hoarding of surplus.</p>
              <p>No matter how right people are in their objections against such pay-and-pay policy nothing has changed.</p>
              <p>He has succeeded in psyching his whole team to believe in "no welfare" "no free lunch" (except for themselves) so every one has toed this line and nothing has changed.</p>
              <p>He will not change because in this uncertain world only one thing is certain - monies is power. With monies he can project himself as a successful leader and go around the world behaving like great leader. He could talk equal to all the great leaders everywhere. That power has been driven into his own ego and nothing will change that any more. If any body ever criticize his doings he would call them ungrateful or say throw me out if you can.</p>
              <p>So to all the people who writes long long analyses and articles and good reports full of wonderful data to support a change it is a waste of time. His ego is so high that rights do not matter any more. It is might of monies which is more important to him.</p>
              <p>That is why prices keep increasing because under that policy government is not going to pay for citizens' basic services like housing, medical, utility etc etc. The latest HDB flat prices will continue to go up from S$300K to S$400K and $500K for a 5-room flat using tricks like market subsidy and designer flats to make more monies. This is cleverly called market subsidy or designer affordable housing and here and there newly married couples would be slowly told to buy their wedding home from the resale market as Mah (the affordable housing minister) is not giving free lunch even though lands were free to government or HDB because they were paid with people's own monies.</p>
              <p>So the moral of the story is monies is power. Surplus will glorify his success and no one is going to stop him hoarding more monies from taxes and profiteering on lands and infrastructures to build that monies.</p>
