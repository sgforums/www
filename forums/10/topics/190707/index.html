Despite the odds stacked so heavily against them, SDA and WP won these seats fairly comfortably.<br><br>What does this mean for the other constituencies? Despite a drop in the votes (PAP's claim to a strong mandate is a brave front for what they must recognize is a falling level of support), a good 66% of the population still support the PAP.<br><br>Detractors who used to talk about upgrading as the reason for PAP's hold to power are obviously wrong. Hougang and Potong Pasir have shown us that if the people want to, they will vote the Opposition despite upgrading and the attendant financial rewards. And those who talk about fears of votes being traced are obviously the most cowardly of Singaporeans. The thousands in Hougang and Potong Pasir were not afraid and had voted the Opposition all the same.<br><br>The only conclusion that one can draw is that apart from these two constituencies, the vast majority of Singaporeans still support the PAP.</div>

Other good suggestion include the need to cut down on a system based on power play by one man or a group of men which will lead to lopsided policies based on assumptions and pride of individuals that benefit no one except the personages.<br><br>There is now a need for people to understand the importance of going back to basic of accountability and transparency.<br><br>There is nothing sinister or unreasonable in what people are asking or what the oppositions or people who voted for opposition are asking. Their views are along the above-mentioned lines of thinking which may be simply put as progress and further upgrade from the old system of so-called leadership which in the final analysis is only self-centred power play to suit the individuals. Only when there is collective leadership and motivational management, will there be real success as practised by Fortune 500 companies.</div>

The outcome is that they will vote for PAP. From this, we can see that despite singaporeans may support the opposition, but the votes still go to PAP.<br><br>You can't say it's a fair election. You cannot conclude things based on an unfair voting stance. Let's say, if we go out with your friends, you bring 10 friends and I don't know them, but they are your friends so if anything goes, they are very likely to root/support for you. If one day, we had a disagreement on who is a better person to lead the company, your 10 friends will support you because of the connections between you guys and girls. But if, I supposedly, took out $1,000,000 cash and is willing to give $100,000 each to anyone who support me, honestly from your heart, will you say that the 10 friends who support you will still vote for you to lead the company? Will you say that hey, the voting outcome is fair? I think this world is realistic. Someone point a gun at you, you're probably gonna do his biding, even though it's against your normal procedures. That's life.</div>
