He can mentor without responsibility for any outcome of his mentoring even if mentoring goes wrong. So MM is a redundant position which is created with power but without responsibility.<br><br>MM can push for a casino and if casino fails he need not resign.<br><br>(2) PM is not able to act on his own and if he acts on advice of MM he can say that it is the cabinet or MM's decision and not his own decision.<br><br>(3) All the elections and MPs are redundant, and just for show as MPs probably have no power to elect their own PM and if they ever disagree with MM's mentoring as to who should be the PM they may be overruled or sidestepped because there is no constitution to resolve such a crisis or conflict.<br><br>(4) PM will have to be paid three salaries for in addition to his own salary the public have to pay the salaries of SM and MM.<br><br>(5) In the event MM and SM disagree who has higher precedence or authority?</div>
