              <p>Every citizen has certain birth rights like the right to elect the
              government from the best individuals of passion and talents and
              leadership but down here this is not possible because such right has
              been taken away or eroded by a government which has slowly over time
              used all kinds of fear tactics to make citizens believe otherwise.<br> <br> The kind of government we have today has no longer the visions to serve
              the people the kind of visions it once shouted during merdeka. <br> <br> Why? Because the people themselves are too naive to have accepted or
              falsehood of propaganda without exercising their birth right to
              question the good and bad of government but just blandly reelected them
              believing in falsehood and propaganda. May be it is selfishness on the
              part of people themselves. So the lessen to be learned is we should not
              be selfish for our own smaller benefits and goodies and stand up to
              start asking for citizens' rights to check and elect good government
              with visions.<br> <br> Under such unfortunate circumstances as seen in our case we have today
              elected a government which has become bolder and bolder and will pass
              all sorts of laws to increase their powers and ignore the people's
              needs. <br> <br> The frequent falsehoods paraded to us the citizens through the
              government's yes-men ministers and controlled media include "all men
              are equal and no one will be left behind", "affordable housing", "rule
              of law", "racial harmony", "freedom of press is lawlessness", "yes-men
              are million-dollar talents" "foreign talents create jobs" "small and
              resourceless island", "meritocracy equal opportunity", "no free lunch".<br> <br> While all the above-stated propaganda look good they are seldom
              implemented for citizens' benefits. They are implemented to increase
              the power of a few elites and yes-men who continue to deceive all with
              falsehood and excuses to increase their own personal power at the
              expense of ordinary citizens.<br> <br> So a few self-interested yes-men in power are using whips to control
              all the MPs who could hardly do anything for citizens or allow citizens
              to exercise their right to ensure good corporate governance. Every
              major problem affecting citizens are easily denied legalistically by
              denials using such propaganda. The few self-interested yes-men have
              circumvented and eliminated all of such citizens' rights. <br> <br> Without exercising citizens' exercise or ability to exercise such right
              through the public media or holding of protests to express their needs
              collectively such self-interested power that be will continue to use
              falsehood to govern and we will continue to elect and be governed by
              rogue government</p>
