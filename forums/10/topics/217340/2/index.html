Archaic. an instrument used for drawing blood.<br><br>I will now proceed to investigate the appropriateness of usage of this term with respect to each of the main players in this case.<br><br><strong>Derek Wee</strong> ("one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country" as alleged by Wee Shu Min):-<br><br>Being a productive tax paying member of the Republic of Singapore, it is unlikely that any of the definitions are relevant despite Wee Shu Min's heinous allegations.<br><br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Not guilty.<br><br><strong>Wee Shu Min</strong>:-<br>Non productive member of society who doesn't contribute to tax revenues. Off spring of a reasonably affluent politician who has been granted a scholarship at tax payers' expense. Obviously, these tax revenues should have been put to better use by funding a more intelligent, less emotionally retarded person who otherwise would not have the necessary resources to finance their tertiary education and would more likely contribute back to society instead of engaging in mindless rantings and diatribes.<br><br><strong>Verdict: </strong>Guilty of being a leech on 3 counts.<br><br><strong>Wee Siew Kim:-</strong><br>Back bencher MP who rode into parliament via the coat tails of the incumbent PM through the flawed GRC system. Like all other PAP MPs who sailed into office without having to contest in any election, he is of course drawing a huge salary (by world standards) despite having to contribute nothing. As yet, he is still unknown for any significant contributions to society. Best known for publicly defending the bigoted views of his own daughter while likely being the party guilty of inculcating such values privately.<br><br><strong>Verdict</strong>: Guilty of being a leech on 2 counts.<br><br>Taken from the <a href="http://whispersfromheart.blogspot.com/2006/10/wee-wee-saga.html" rel="nofollow">whispersfromtheheart</a> blog :<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>mom's friend sent her some blog post by some bleeding stupid 18-year old singaporean called Elite- wee (WHY do all the idiots become Elites, why?!) whining about how singapore is such a paradise, how elites (ie, 83 of them and more, all wearing white) leeched from their well-paid jobs, how the pool of singkie peasants (dismissively chucked between inverted commas) is really a tsunami that will consume them all (no actually he didn't say that, he probably said THAT'S THE BRUTAL TRUTH, DEARIE.), how the reason why everyone wants elite kids is that they're the only bunch in this world immuned to fragile ricebowls, how the government really needs to save elites from inevitable boredom of wearing white but they aren't because they are peanuts-shoved-up-ass elites who control how their wardrobe works, yadayadayadayada.i am inclined - too much, perhaps - to dismiss such people as crackpots. stupid crackpots. the sadder class. too often singaporeans - both the neighborhood poor and 66.6% socialites who sell their souls for upgraded lifts - kid themselves into believing that our society, like most others, is compartmentalized by breeding. ridiculous. we are not a tyranny of the academically capable and the clever, we, the peasants are the upper class, their masters with the whip.sad Wee attracted more than 50 comments praising him for his poignant views, egging in a chorus of rejoinders that climax at the accusation of lack of peasant intelligence in the form of good spelling and grammar because his all-too-true views had been rejected by the singkie forum. while i tend to gripe about how we only have one functioning 83-yr old elite in the cabinet (he issues all visions for Singapore), i think the main reason for its lack of recognition was that his incensed diatribe was written in pathetic little scraps that passed off as sentences, with poor spelling and no grammar. there was also a total lack of sensitivity to peasant feelings.WEE, wee, wee darling, how can you expect to have an iron ricebowl or a solid future if you cannot empathise accordingly? to become the top drawer in the cabinet, one need to suck ass with the right sensitivity level. didnÂ’t your father teach you this?<br><br>if you're an elitist, life will give you less balls. that's just how things go. there's no point in lambasting the peasants for making your paradise one that is, i quote, "far too intellectually unstimulating lacking good spelling and grammar". it's the same everywhere. yes mediocrity exists, and it is sad, but most of the time if people like you are preferred over others, it's because you made it so. it's so sad when people like Elite-wee lament the kind of world that singapore will be if we make it so uncertain for them. go be friggin dictator in another peesai, if uncertainty of success offends you so much - you will certainly be proclaimed a talent and a visionary. More so if you are a knuckledusters-wearing-bully in a cul de sac, which, given your ball-less elitist penchant, i doubt. then again, it's easy for me to say. my future isn't in leeching on the system but i guess right now it's a lot brighter than most elite's. Wee will read this and brand me as an 18-year old peasant, one of the quitters who will chabo the country. go ahead. the world is about winners and losers. it's only sad when people who could be winners are marginalised and oppressed by the elites. is dear Wee repentant? has dear Wee been denied a right of reply? has dear Wee been forced into shutting his blog? has dear Wee had his political career massacred by the government?i should think not. dear Wee is one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country, and in this world. one of those who would prefer to be waxing lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for a life of serving the peasants, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a Elite professional. it's not even about being a representative of the people. these shitbags don't want anything without "$$" and a guaranteed risk-free career.<br><br>please, get your f*cking elite uncaring face off this tiny dot.</span>[/b]</blockquote>Wah, she is getting more famous everyday.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Unfortunately, many of my RJC friends have low EQ and common sense.<br><br>Most only know how to memorise and practice questions and possess very weak critical thinking skills."<br><br>"To follow up on what fellow Rafflesian, Gene, said above, I would like to emphasise that the majority of us from RJC are not like Shu Min.<br><br>In fact, few of us sympathise with her current "plight" (not that she is taking it badly, she was in fact laughing and mocking at the responses on various websites).<br><br>What had happened also did not surprise us because she is well known in school to have an inflated sense of superiority and low tolerance of the pedestrian and the uncultured.<br><br>But please remember that one Wee Shu Min does not make RJC. The rest of us from RJC should not be impeached because of her."<br><br>"I'm a classmate of Shu Min in RGS and RJC. Many of us don't know her well because she does move around in her own exclusive circle of the smart and well-connected.<br><br>And yes, she is conceited, overbearing and thinks that she and her clique own the world. But, I do think some of the comments here are excessive, even unreasonable.<br><br>You can fault her character and her worldview, but is there a need to descend to vulgarity?"<br><br>"As a Rafflesian, I am saddened that our good name has been smeared by the poison pen of one elitist female.<br><br>The saddest part of this episode is that she reminds me of the remark made by newbie Michael Palmer, "Before I joined the grassroots organisation, I never knew there were poor people in developed countries".<br><br>Where does the PAP find such freaks?
