With the exception of few guys who were convicted for posting racism remarks on the net, Miss Wee is perhaps the only blogger in Singapore's history that had to shut down her own blog and apologise in another person's because of an entry.<br><br>While Miss Wee's remarks were insensitive and rude beyond doubts, the net was and would never be deprived of bloggers or forumites who enjoy indulging themselves in such languages. What essentially made the public react so strongly was perhaps because she was born who she is, not just as a Wee, but a daughter of THE Wee, MP of Ang Mo Kio. If she was not born into such family, her views will only invite limited flaming, definitely not to such standard. Are we having double standards here just because she is the daughter of an MP, or more correctly a PAP MP? Is the public only reacting because of her lack of sympanty and sensitivity?

In return, she received the ultimate flame any netizen had yet experienced. With the exception of few guys who were convicted for posting racism remarks on the net, Miss Wee is perhaps the only blogger in Singapore's history that had to shut down her own blog and apologise in another person's because of an entry.<br><br>While Miss Wee's remarks were insensitive and rude beyond doubts, the net was and would never be deprived of bloggers or forumites who enjoy indulging themselves in such languages. What essentially made the public react so strongly was perhaps because she was born who she is, not just as a Wee, but a daughter of THE Wee, MP of Ang Mo Kio. If she was not born into such family, her views will only invite limited flaming, definitely not to such standard. Are we having double standards here just because she is the daughter of an MP, or more correctly a PAP MP? Is the public only reacting because of her lack of sympanty and sensitivity? Or is there a psychological element of "She's related to the PAP, LETS DIG HER IN!!!!".<br><br>It is in my view that while her father may not demostrate the best quality of a potential statesman, any partisan feelings should not spill over into their family. Let's just treat Miss Wee for who she is, an 18 years old teenager ranting on the net.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I don't see why she should be let off lightly. It gives those with status  in our society a bad image. And also it portrays our society to be rotten. If you disagree on having her imprisoned...fine...punish her and make her do 500hrs of Community Involvement Programme or so at some Old Folk's Home to let her open her eyes and see how do the middle and lower class Singaporeans live. That should open up her thoughts. Because I don't see the reason why do people with high-profile status always get away with things.</div>

Best known for publicly defending the bigoted views of his own daughter while likely being the party guilty of inculcating such values privately.<br><br><strong>Verdict</strong>: Guilty of being a leech on 2 counts.<br><br>Taken from the <a href="http://whispersfromheart.blogspot.com/2006/10/wee-wee-saga.html" rel="nofollow">whispersfromtheheart</a> blog :<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>mom's friend sent her some blog post by some bleeding stupid 18-year old singaporean called Elite- wee (WHY do all the idiots become Elites, why?!) whining about how singapore is such a paradise, how elites (ie, 83 of them and more, all wearing white) leeched from their well-paid jobs, how the pool of singkie peasants (dismissively chucked between inverted commas) is really a tsunami that will consume them all (no actually he didn't say that, he probably said THAT'S THE BRUTAL TRUTH, DEARIE.), how the reason why everyone wants elite kids is that they're the only bunch in this world immuned to fragile ricebowls, how the government really needs to save elites from inevitable boredom of wearing white but they aren't because they are peanuts-shoved-up-ass elites who control how their wardrobe works, yadayadayadayada.i am inclined - too much, perhaps - to dismiss such people as crackpots. stupid crackpots. the sadder class. too often singaporeans - both the neighborhood poor and 66.6% socialites who sell their souls for upgraded lifts - kid themselves into believing that our society, like most others, is compartmentalized by breeding. ridiculous. we are not a tyranny of the academically capable and the clever, we, the peasants are the upper class, their masters with the whip.sad Wee attracted more than 50 comments praising him for his poignant views, egging in a chorus of rejoinders that climax at the accusation of lack of peasant intelligence in the form of good spelling and grammar because his all-too-true views had been rejected by the singkie forum. while i tend to gripe about how we only have one functioning 83-yr old elite in the cabinet (he issues all visions for Singapore), i think the main reason for its lack of recognition was that his incensed diatribe was written in pathetic little scraps that passed off as sentences, with poor spelling and no grammar. there was also a total lack of sensitivity to peasant feelings.WEE, wee, wee darling, how can you expect to have an iron ricebowl or a solid future if you cannot empathise accordingly? to become the top drawer in the cabinet, one need to suck ass with the right sensitivity level. didnÂ’t your father teach you this?<br><br>if you're an elitist, life will give you less balls. that's just how things go. there's no point in lambasting the peasants for making your paradise one that is, i quote, "far too intellectually unstimulating lacking good spelling and grammar". it's the same everywhere. yes mediocrity exists, and it is sad, but most of the time if people like you are preferred over others, it's because you made it so. it's so sad when people like Elite-wee lament the kind of world that singapore will be if we make it so uncertain for them. go be friggin dictator in another peesai, if uncertainty of success offends you so much - you will certainly be proclaimed a talent and a visionary. More so if you are a knuckledusters-wearing-bully in a cul de sac, which, given your ball-less elitist penchant, i doubt. then again, it's easy for me to say. my future isn't in leeching on the system but i guess right now it's a lot brighter than most elite's. Wee will read this and brand me as an 18-year old peasant, one of the quitters who will chabo the country. go ahead. the world is about winners and losers. it's only sad when people who could be winners are marginalised and oppressed by the elites. is dear Wee repentant? has dear Wee been denied a right of reply? has dear Wee been forced into shutting his blog? has dear Wee had his political career massacred by the government?i should think not. dear Wee is one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country, and in this world. one of those who would prefer to be waxing lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for a life of serving the peasants, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a Elite professional. it's not even about being a representative of the people. these shitbags don't want anything without "$$" and a guaranteed risk-free career.<br><br>please, get your f*cking elite uncaring face off this tiny dot.</span></div>
