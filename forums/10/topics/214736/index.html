The UK needs to be aware of that being one of its competitive advantages," he said, adding the regulatory environment was also an important factor.<br><br>"It would be possible to go somewhere where there is zero corporation tax which would save us in the region of 400 million pounds ($754.1 million) a year. But those places tend not to have regulators as complex and aware as the FSA (Financial Services Authority).<br><br>"As much as banks moan about regulation from time to time, having your HQ based with a good and globally renowned regulator builds customer credibility. If we were to lose that then we would have a problem," the spokesman said.</blockquote>2.i think sg is courting HSBC to move its HQ here,or at least part<br>of its HQ operations.<br>This news is 'leaked ' by Lion Bank,as called in HK,to<br>get most incentives from UK government for  keeping its HQ there!!<br><br>Profit tax in UK is 30%.<br><br><img src="http://a248.e.akamai.net/7/248/3622/e716076333f167/www.img.ghq.hsbc.com/images/c04/logo.gif"></div>
