            <div class='col-md body'>CPF contribution is 1.5% higher?! What the hell are you thinking Mr Lee??? Have you lost all traces with your Sanity, your Artistic Integrity? Have you lost the cool, logical and balanced mind that the great leaders need when forging plans of Singapore's calibur? You have singlehandedly destroyed CPF and its integrity with this change. You have harnessed the chains of malice and incompetency to drive your hellish steeds of destruction and despair through the rejoicing worlds of the living and ruin CPF in the process. Words simply cannot EXPLAIN how angry I am with this change, your development skills and your love for the human race. Here is what you have done by increasing the contribution:<br><br>What the hell were you thinking? I have supported you for 18 long years Mr Lee, 18 years, ever since you took the Singapore's Matrix from Mr Goh's dying hands by his hospital bed 3 years ago promising to uphold the tradition of excellent development as his winded breath wheezed a promise that was only half finished before his gentle head slumped into the creamy hospital bed pillow and then tears streamed down your mottled face as you screamed why into the sky and beat upon Mr Goh's corpse in uncontained rage and anger towards God and the unfair world he created dooming the most cherished to die first.<br><br>You have destroyed your vow to your father when you met on that fateful summers noon as a young and lost map boy who didn't have a true purpose in the world and decided to ask those with more wisdom because you were afraid of being unable to live up to the great expectations bestowed upon you, down at the serene windy lake with it's glassy surface and lone fisherman in a small and easily overturnable boat hovering quite near the center worrying about feeding his family and the deers trotting off in the distance being jealously eyed by small rabbits who envied their youthfulness but at the same time were glad they were such innocent symbols of cuteness that were sometimes ignored by the MEDIA, you have destroyed the oath you took with him as he decided to leave the glowing jeweled crown with the more exuberant youth of his dying generation.<br><br>You have betrayed your mother and father, whose sole wish for you as a small, frail orphan child by the name of Oliver Twist who worked his way up on PAP using relentless precision to take down his financial rivals to ultimately rise to stardom. was to create a popular contribution rate that was balanced and enjoyed by all.<br><br>DID YOU FORGET THE VOW YOU MADE WITH ME IN VIETNAM WHEN I DRAGGED YOUR LIMP BODY FROM THE THORNY BRAMBLES THAT HAD ENSNARED YOU, WITH THE VIETNAMESE INSURGENTS FIRING THEIR CHEAP BUT EFFECTIVE RIFLES BEHIND OUR BACKS, AND THE WEAK SMILE YOU GAVE TO ME AFTER YOU REALIZED YOU WEREN;T GOING TO BE TORTURED FOR INFORMATION REGARDED THE SINGAPORE GOVERNEMNT? DID YOU FORGET THE PROMISE YOU MADE TO ME AFTER LHY WALKED FREE??? AFTER THE DUNKING SCANDAL?<br><br>When we saw the first Pokemon movie and both cried in unison as Ash was turned to stone but then cheered as the tears of the crying Pokemon brought him back to life and you told me you never wanted to cause pain like that to the small children of the proceeding generations ever again.<br><br>No Mr Lee, you have forgotten, and with that, you have DOOMED us all to an eternity of imbalance.<br><br>Yesterday I saw a elderly man jumping off a 20 storey building AND PROCEED TO GO GODLIKE WITH HIS CPF CONTRIBUTION!<br><br>This is the final straw Mr Lee, I'm quitting the country because of your strange fetish for CPF contribution, it is obvious you are being manipulated by the Mafia or other local crime syndicate. I've seen the Departed Mr Lee, I know you and all your Irish gangster kind. GG Mr Lee, I might come back when you decide to balance the CPF contribution again, but until then you're dead to me.</div>
