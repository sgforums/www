              <p>surveys conducted by the Gallup Organization in 70 countries representing nearly half the world's population, 30 percent of people said they would choose Obama as president of the United States against eight percent who said they preferred McCain.</p>
              <p>In four close US partners in Asia -- Australia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea -- residents came out clearly in favor of Obama.</p>
              <p>Two-thirds of Japanese and Australian respondents said they preferred Obama to McCain, who only scored about 15 percent in the two countries.</p>
              <p>In Singapore and South Korea, meanwhile, the pro-Obama vote outpaced the pro-McCain vote by around two to one.</p>
              <p>"McCain and Obama have each pledged to reinvigorate and strengthen partnerships with the four developed Asian countries and take a more active role in Asian regional organizations," Gallup wrote.</p>
              <p>Nine out of 10 people polled in India and Pakistan and seven in 10 in Bangladesh said they had no opinion about whom they would prefer to see in the White House in Washington come next January.</p>
              <p>Gallup said the disinterest among South Asians revealed "a great disconnect between many of the world's poorest inhabitants and the politics of the United States."</p>
              <p>Latin Americans showed a similar disconnect, with 68 percent of those polled in central America and Mexico and 58 percent in South America voicing no opinion about the US election.</p>
              <p>Middle Easterners in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories chose Obama over McCain by a margin of at least two to one, although three-quarters of Palestinians said they didn't think the result of the US election would change much in their country.</p>
              <p>A majority of Europeans in 14 countries said they wanted an Obama victory, with the Dutch and Norwegians the strongest Obama supporters in Europe: nearly three-quarters in both countries said they preferred him to McCain.</p>
              <p>In France, 64 percent chose Obama against four percent for McCain, and in Germany, where an Obama rally in Berlin gathered some 200,000 people in July, the Democratic presidential contender was supported by 62 percent of those polled compared with 10 percent for McCain.</p>
              <p>In Africa, a median of 56 percent of poll respondents chose Obama -- meaning the percentage who chose the African American presidential contender was higher than 56 percent in half the 22 countries polled and lower than 56 percent in the other half.</p>
              <p>A median of nine percent chose McCain, who did not beat Obama anywhere in Africa, even though the current US administration of Republican President George W. Bush has a high approval rating on the continent.</p>
              <p>Bush in July signed legislation tripling funds to fight the killer diseases of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa under an initiative launched under his administration in 2003.</p>
              <p>In Kenya, where Obama's father hailed from, the Democrat was supported by nearly nine in 10 poll respondents; McCain had the support of three percent of Kenyans.</p>
              <p>Around 1,000 people were interviewed face-to-face earlier this year in most of the countries that took part in the surveys.</p>
              <p>Survey sizes in Kuwait, Japan, Pakistan, Mexico and India were 484, 750, 804, 873 and 2,000 people respectively.</p>

              <p>But when it comes to who will win, it has to be</p>
              <p>Obama. Having said this, no one will guarantee anything about his performance.</p>
              <p>Its not about who is more handsome.</p>
              <p>Its not about who is smarter.</p>
              <p>Its not about who is more experienced.</p>
              <p>Its purely a decision to choose between 2 politicians. Yes, politicians are politicians.</p>
              <p>Obama is also not gonna able to solve the debt problem of USA. Period. No one can.  Thanks to Bush junior.</p>
              <p>I do not see how USA can be prosperous again in the next 5 years.</p>

              <p>Not true. Obama has his supporters in the well-to-do liberal circles here as well. McCain has his supporters in the conservative Singaporean circle too.</p>

              <p>Here is some real info on CFR, not bullshit NWO horse crap:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chatham House had close institutional relations with a number of other
                  similar organizations, especially in the Dominions.  It also has a
                  parallel organization, which was regarded as a branch, in New York. 
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This latter, the Council on Foreign Relations,</strong></span> was not founded by the
                  American group that attended the meeting at the Hotel Majestic in 1919,
                  but was taken over almost entirely by that group immediately after its
                  founding in 1919.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This group was made up of the experts on the
                  American delegation to the Peace Conference who were most closely
                  associated with J.P. Morgan and Company. </span> The Morgan bank has never
                  made any real effort to conceal its position in regard to the Council
                  on Foreign Relations.  The list of officers and board of directors are
                  printed in every issue of <em>Foreign Affairs</em> and have always been loaded with partners, associates, and employees of
                  J.P. Morgan and Company.  According to Stephen King-Hall, the RIIA
                  agreed to regard the Council on Foreign Relations as its American
                  branch.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The relationship between the two has always been very close.</span> 
                  For example, the publications of one are available at reduced prices to
                  the members of the other;  they frequently sent gifts of books to each
                  other (the Council, for example, giving the Institute a
                  seventy-five-volume set of the <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> in 1933);  and there is considerable personal contact between the
                  officers of the two (Toynbee, for example, left the manuscript of
                  Volumes 7-9 of <em>A Study of History</em> in the Council's vault during the recent war)...</p>
