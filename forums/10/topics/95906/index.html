Singapore just pay tribute like Malacca lor.....don't forget we have vietnam, laos, burma , thailand, malaysia buffering us. They also know it is not easy to maintain an out of way territory. Besides why would they destroy a cash cow like singapore who is investing in them, that would be a wrong tactical move. Singapore have no natural resources ...and Singapore is located between malaysia and indonesia...Indonesia will become a headache for china if china takes singapore. I think china likes to walk over....not swim over. Russia on her borders, India on her borders ....she has to defend the mainland too.<br><br>Besides territorial expansion means u need more people to man the borders while economic expansion means u just need a few vessel states and collect cash.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my earlier writing on PM Lee's visit to Taiwan<br><br>Clear and Present Danger of Taiwan War<br><br>According to a report by the Australian Defence Minister, the Chinese<br>officials are all talking about an eminent WAR against Taiwan. And<br>these are not just talks only. In preparations for war, the Chinese<br>arm forces have made many military maneuvers over the past months<br>with the most recent one, openly declared as a mock up amphibious<br>assaults on Taiwan mainland. This military exercise will be enhanced<br>by a live firing of ballistic missles from a missile base in China.<br>It will be the most important military preparations on the Chinese<br>side for a total showdown with Taiwan. Anyone who is familiar with<br>military operations, these are the signs of "pre-ops" preparations.<br>You will have military exercises again and again before you really go<br>to war. If we track Chinese military exercises for the past 12<br>months, it is eminent that they are really preparing for war. All the<br>elite forces have been positioned in the southern part of China.<br>China has cleared most of the diplomatic obstacles with other<br>regional rivals like India and Russia. Thus, it could concentrate on<br>the one front that matters most to it.<br><br>Taiwan's Ah Bian has planned to make big changes and amendments<br>(almost creating a totally new one) to its constituitions in 2006.<br>This is the fundamental reasons for China's determination to choose<br>arm conflicts as a mean to end the 5 decade old stalemate over<br>Taiwan.<br><br>The most important question we want to ask is, what will happen to<br>Singapore? If US decided to get involved in this war, what's our<br>role? Same role as in Korean and Vietnam wars? We must bear in mind<br>that we are dealing with a potentially big military power that have<br>ballistic missiles capabalities. If we get involved and US tried to<br>use us as a tap to tighten on China's supplies (basically oil), we<br>might have to face ballistic missiles flying over our heads!

And<br>these are not just talks only. In preparations for war, the Chinese<br>arm forces have made many military maneuvers over the past months<br>with the most recent one, openly declared as a mock up amphibious<br>assaults on Taiwan mainland. This military exercise will be enhanced<br>by a live firing of ballistic missles from a missile base in China.<br>It will be the most important military preparations on the Chinese<br>side for a total showdown with Taiwan. Anyone who is familiar with<br>military operations, these are the signs of "pre-ops" preparations.<br>You will have military exercises again and again before you really go<br>to war. If we track Chinese military exercises for the past 12<br>months, it is eminent that they are really preparing for war. All the<br>elite forces have been positioned in the southern part of China.<br>China has cleared most of the diplomatic obstacles with other<br>regional rivals like India and Russia. Thus, it could concentrate on<br>the one front that matters most to it.<br><br>Taiwan's Ah Bian has planned to make big changes and amendments<br>(almost creating a totally new one) to its constituitions in 2006.<br>This is the fundamental reasons for China's determination to choose<br>arm conflicts as a mean to end the 5 decade old stalemate over<br>Taiwan.<br><br>The most important question we want to ask is, what will happen to<br>Singapore?

            <div class='col-md body'>The recent speech by PM Lee and George Yeo is targeted at US as audience. They are practically telling the Americans that in the event of a Taiwan war, Singapore will not get itself involved in any ways. Singapore will refuse to let US use our facilities as supporting base for US marines. That's the clear message that we have made.<br><br>I think this is the most important message we want to get across, to US, not Taiwan. And I think this is the right direction.
