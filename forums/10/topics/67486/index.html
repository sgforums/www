This would reduce the overall cost of doing business in Singapore.<br><br>In its report, the committee had asked if the Government had adequate policies, guidelines and review processes to ensure that excessive surpluses were not left to keep compounding, or wasted on extravagant projects.<br><br><strong>TOO MUCH CASH ?</strong><br><br><strong><span class="large">Statutory board  Accumulated Surplus (FY 2002) </span></strong><br>Monetary Authority of Singapore $13.6 billion<br>Jurong Town Corporation $9.1 billion<br>Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore $2.5 billion<br>Central Provident Fund $1.6 billion<br>Urban Redevelopment Authority $1.3 billion<br>Public Utilities Board $1.2 billion<br>Singapore Labour Foundation $662.9 million<br>Singapore Totalisator Board $589.8 million<br>Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore $573.9 million<br>Land Transport Authority $426.7 million<br>Source: ESTIMATES COMMITTEE<br><br>Straits Times - Thursday Edition 22 January 2003<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,231299,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,231299,00.html?</a><br><br></div>
