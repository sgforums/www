If we over-estimate demand and over-supply, we end up with under-utilised assets - a costly outcome.<br><br>"Between over-supply and under-supply, I would prefer to slightly under-supply than to over-supply as this will put pressure on ourselves to intensify usage and minimise over-consumption."<br><br>And on that basis, the Ministry revealed details of its masterplan.<br><br>The new Khoo Teck Puat hospital in Yishun will open in 2010 and more general hospitals are planned, including one in Jurong which will open before 2015. </blockquote>But <strong>today (6 days later)</strong>:<br><blockquote><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hospital in Jurong on hold</span><br>Tenders called now will mean higher building costs: Khaw</span><br><br>THE hospital in Yishun will come up as planned in three years, but the Government will take its time to build the one in Jurong.<br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan, speaking at a community event in Yishun yesterday, said rising construction costs in recent months would swell building costs of Yishun's Khoo Teck Puat Hospital by 10 to 20 per cent.<br><br>He told reporters that in hindsight, he should have started work on the hospital two or even three years earlier.<br><br>But since the Government had committed itself to opening that hospital by 2010, it would make good on its promise, he added.<br><br>'But it does mean that for Jurong hospital, the western hospital which I am planning, I will take my time,' he said.<br><br>There was no point heading into the whole construction frenzy when the tender price is too high, otherwise 'the high cost will eventually be borne by everybody, by society, by the Government and by patients', he said. [quote]</blockquote>Even for someone who 'forgets' his promises and deadlines so often, this must be a new record!!<br><br>6 days ago.... $2 billion dollars, 6 day later... suddenly no money. Next time he says "slightly under-supply", you know what he means!!<br><br>Build F1 racing track in 1 year for FT, no problem!! Plenty of money.<br>Build hospital for Singaporeans, 4 years haven't even start.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
