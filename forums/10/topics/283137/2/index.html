With the rising construction costs, the $2 billion will not go as far as it was projected to do.

Since when did the minister retract his earlier statement? The Yishun hospital will be built in 2010 whilst the Jurong Hospital will be built before 2015. The $2 billion is committed and will be spent. Explaining why the Jurong Hospital project is pushed back relative to the Yishun Hospital, the minister said that rising building costs make it logical to delay building projects. However, because the givernment has already committed to the Yishun project by 2010, that will go ahead despite the higher costs.<br><br>Perhaps a course in English Comprehension would be a good idea.<br><br></div>
