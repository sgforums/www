That's what folks like you do...<br><br>I'd think I certainly know more about labour rights and the role of various labour movements in the world than you, given the fact I did an internship at the UN HQ in New York(through the ILO's Liaison Office with the UN) when I was a student, working broadly on a vast spectrum of UN issues(the exposure gained from working with staff seconded to the ILO notwithstanding).<br><br>For the record, working with a UN NGO only exposes you to the ground conditions(I suppose it's the equivalent of lab lessons for a science class) of wherever you worked and would most probably not expose you to the daily activities that go on at the ILO, which provides one with much greater exposure to labour issues on a global scale, with regard to the work they actually do (with case studies, etc). If you're interested in labour issues, you might want to consider trying out for a stint at the ILO HQ in Geneva, Switzerland (at least, a friend of mine who had a stint there - and currently works there - as a student claims the exposure you get in Geneva is unparalleled)...</div>

He was also against this kind of shock therapy and wondered what is wrong with giving people a few days notice.<br><br>No doubt perhaps it may affect productivity of the abt-to-retrenched worker in question but<br><br>lidat ask people to go home is very unethical<br><br>At least they will have some time to find another job<br>imagine a stretch of days without income while waiting for job acceptance<br>how do u expect they feel?<br><br>and the govt may say they tried to give jobs to people and accuse us of being picky<br><br>but look at what jobs they offered<br>CLEANING JOBS<br>WASHING JOBS<br><br>if we need to work these jobs, we no need ur help at all, we can find ourselves better.<br><br>and lastly the govt say our economy is growing is totally bulls.h.i.t<br>there are still so many jobless people out there<br><br>and pay rise sux. The rich oni gets richer while the poor remain, well poor<br>If spore allows demonstration, there sure be chaos in the streets.<br><br></div></blockquote>You should write to MOM or Mr. Lim Boon Heng, who were in charge of this matter - industrial conciliations and protection of workers' right.<br><br>What you have suggested makes sense. It will prevent companies from abusing their power as an employer to do as they like to cause suffering of workers.<br><br>It would seem that for pragmatic reasons, our ministers and NTUC labour chief will always forget to look after such workers' rights.<br><br>Mr. Lim Boon Heng will be receiving a labour award today for his contributions to workers' rights and labour movement. How ironic he is able to receive award of such nature without doing anything about workers' basic right to notice of termination.</div>
