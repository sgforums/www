Most graduates will not be researchers or University lecturers....the majority will look for jobs in industry.<br><br>Personally, I'll much prefer to employ a poly grad who can do the work, although not particularly good at the underlying theory; rather than a graduate who can talk about the theory but is unable to deliver.

Artist?<br><br>You're just throwing out ridiculous examples for the sake of it. In Singapore? Don't you know it's virtually impossible to earn a decent living going pro? or being an artist?<br><br>Look at our sports scene. Sprinters like Uk Shyam Poh Seng Song are not given anything other than a scholarship (short term and he bailed out on disagreements) and a pathetic allowance. Our so-called professional S-League players average 2-3K a month (star players earn up to 6K and only 1 per team) and they can only keep playing like this for 10 odd years. After that, what can they do? Not every player is as capable as our ex-national Goalie David Lim who turn businessman after he retired from soccer.<br><br>In fact i would say he is the only man who has managed his own life after sports. Sundram went into coaching (which flopped at Jurong FC) and Fandi had a business selling prata that winded up.

And they are paid wages to a much lesser extent on contract basis, which does not amount to much because they are fully sponsored on their respective equipment.<br><br>Can the same be said for every sport?  Does it apply to Soccer? Basketball? Netball? Swimming? These are some of our core sports that receive outstanding incentives from the SSC and the SNOC annually.<br><br>How they manage their subsequent finances is irrelevant. Save Fandi, has any other footballer made it big?<br><br>What is the potential for locals to go abroad and play? Nevermind willing, are they capable first? Do you even have any idea what it takes to compete at that level before you blurt out the term 'abroad'? You think hard work is sufficient?<br><br>Do you begin to understand just how difficult it is to live life as a sportsman? Look at Tan Howe Liang and C Kunalan. Champions in their respective fields but glorified instructors now, earning a mere pittance.<br><br></div></blockquote>i reckon it boils down to many other factors. i've 2 close friends. one was a tennis state player for malaysia, the other was a S'pore national squash player. they have both retired from competitive sports but are earning heaps from their coaching/ trainer jobs.<br><br>but for sports like soccer. maybe the prospects would be pretty bleak. ironic, given the popularity of the sport.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, and if everyone took up coaching as the only future for ex-sportsmen/women, there would be an excess of coaching talents and subsequent ones will be crowded out in a congested and competitive market.<br><br>But that is indeed one option to sustain the careers of sportspeople. With Ang Peng Siong's self-made Aquatic Performance School and David Lim's Swimfast, our swimming future can only look brighter.<br><br>Ok we're deviating from the original threadline.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think Singapore can ever have its equivalent of the Bobby Charlton School to nurture young footballers? Not in this lifetime. The high cost of living has made the BA an end-all in life. The reason is that degree holders tend to earn more than non-graduates. What can a football star do when his playing days are up? Not everyone is cut out to be a coach. The rest fade into oblivion and live the rest of their lives in penury as they struggle to make a living as a blue-collar worker.</div>
