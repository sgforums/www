            <div class='col-md body'>Government does not change its narrow elitist and tax-and-recover policies for so many years now because the citizens have generally no views or opinions.<br><br>Many would just agree with what government is doing. Even scholars readily accept the government's past policies. New MPs are quiet in parliament hardly raising any issues concerning high costs or anti-business GLC practices or laws.<br><br>That is the reason why today we still see the government believing in their past narrow academic or elitist education and civil service recruitment systems.<br><br>Many citizens are brainwashed into believing that the government knows what to do and will do the right things. Worse they believe that whatever the government it will always be the same or other government can be worse. So there is nothing for now the citizens can do to change the government?<br><br>The educated young who cannot find jobs after graduations will be the first group of people feeling the pinch. They may be the ones to react in the ballot.</div>
