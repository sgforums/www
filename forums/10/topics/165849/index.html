            <div class='col-md body'>so the PAP is still stuck with the maxim "if it ain't broken don't fix it".<br><br>Scholar system may become obsolete<br>Like China's imperial exam, Singapore's way of selecting top scholars will outlive its usefulness in a changed world.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Nov 27, 2005<br><br>SINGAPORE'S early successes were built largely on the back of a scholarship system that - broadly speaking - followed imperial China as a way to recruit the 'best and brightest" to serve the country.<br><br>For 1,300 years of imperial examination history, China's emperors had selected 100,000 state-level and more than a million provincial scholars to administer the vast country.<br><br>Although the details differed, the objective of ancient China and 21st Century Singapore was similar - aimed at getting the best scholars who do well in education to help run the country.<br><br>But it worked well under their respective circumstances.<br><br>For China, however, the method became outdated and was ended in 1911 because the world had changed.<br><br>The imperial exam tested only literature, poetry and essays, but not science, math or any of today's modern studies that were needed by a changed world.<br><br>The question now is whether Singapore's scholarship system of selecting the best has also outlived its days in the 21st Century that needs entrepreneurial and innovative skills.<br><br>The government spends millions to provide some 200 to 250 university scholarships each year to the best students here based on examination results, out of 1,200 to 1,400 applications received by the Public Service Commission.<br><br>Competition, just like in ancient China, is strong and the successful are chosen for the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me schools. They are sent to the best universities abroad and given high-paying official positions.<br><br>The Chinese imperial system was a method to evaluate ability and select officials in dynastic China on the basis of merit rather than social position or political connections.<br><br>Similarly, Singapore leaders also advocate meritocracy. Lee Kuan Yew was an admirer of Confucian teachings, which formed a big subject in the imperial exam.<br><br>But both systems had unintended side effects. In China, the majority of those who sat for the exam were from the wealthy class.<br><br>In Singapore, a recent report said that 75% of scholarship winners lived in private condos or landed property, the rest in cheaper public housing estates. The rich continue to have an edge.<br><br>Lee, now Minister Mentor, admits that academic grades cannot determine the best intelligence or capabilities but until a better way is found, he said they remain the criteria.<br><br>But in the innovative world, can it continue to work when circumstances are changing so rapidly? Today private enterprise and human innovation, not knowledge of science and engineering, are the new gods needed for survival here.<br><br>Some Singaporeans believe that Lee's scholars' class may also become obsolete just as the imperial examination went out of fashion.<br><br>In fact, the Lee government had exceeded imperial China in recruitment.<br><br>Over the years, the large intake of scholars into the bureaucracy and military leadership was so heavy that it has created a hole in the economy. It has deprived the state of a rich source of potential entrepreneurs.<br><br>The brightest students are filtered into a secure, well-paid bureaucracy where they developed an ability to 'play safe' and avoid taking risks so that they can keep their jobs, the opposite of the new Singaporean we need.<br><br>Despite of - or because of - the scholar class, Singapore remains sadly behind its trade rivals in entrepreneurial spirit and capabilities.<br><br>It has led Lee to get the government to release up to half of its state-supported civil service scholars to move into starting enterprises, with questionable results.<br><br>For years scholars have been running state-owned enterprises, but it is not the same as taking risks with their own money and careers. Few are prepared to take personal risks to start their own companies.<br><br>Good grades may not make good businessmen and often have nothing to do with them.<br><br>Scholars may produce good bureaucrats and administrators but they do not necessarily have sound judgment, market ideas or profits, qualities needed in the new economy.<br><br>Dr Phua Kai Lit, a sociologist who received his PhD from Johns Hopkins, wrote that Singapore had become a country "increasingly ruled by economists, engineers, and other technocratic experts with First Class Honours undergraduate degrees, Oxbridge and Ivy League Master's degrees and PhDs."<br><br>"Whether this society truly fulfils (the Singaporean) dream and meets his expectations is a question worthy of debate," he said.<br><br>Another reason why it may not survive long is that it promotes an elitist class, which despite the leaders' best efforts, is growing more unpopular with the new generation.<br><br>Actually, offering high civil service jobs to scholars is not uncommon in many countries - but not in politics. The unique feature in Singapore lies in its use to select Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament in the ruling party.<br><br>In other democratic countries winning elections is a deciding factor, but the predominant strength of the People's Action Party virtually rules out this criterion.<br><br>R.K. Vasil wrote in 1992, "The PAP has established a unique system of recruitment of its top political leaders and Ministers.<br><br>"Talented individuals are 'spotted' and have to pass through a barrage of observations, interviews, attachment to a veteran MP and, allegedly, even psychological tests before being offered safe parliamentary seats to contest (under the PAP banner) in General Elections.<br><br>"After winning these safe seats, they may be offered responsibility as junior ministers and if they pass this test, they would then be offered higher level positions with greater responsibilities"<br><br>For the present, nothing much will change but, as the leaders themselves say, nothing remains the same for long in this fast-moving world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This problem of over-producing graduates and academicians at the expense of entrepreneur and creative spirit in the economy could have been avoided if the leaders were not so over-confident of their pet assumptions.<br><br>It is very simple fact of life that the bests in every field are not necessarily top students or top academicians. There is a common saying: there is a mandarin in every profession.<br><br>Winston Churchull was never good in studies. Bill Gate was not a top student. Albert Einstein was never a scholar.<br><br>In our private sector, who were the creators of jobs or starters of business. More often than not, the bosses who gave jobs to scholars are seldom scholars.<br><br>So while we need scholars for certain positions in the public service, we do not need so many scholars in every field or department. It is a fallacy to build the country on scholars. If such a system is indeed the best, China could have become an advanced country after 1,300 years of trying out such a scholar system and employing so many scholars in civil service.<br><br>If the scholar system has worked well in Singapore, we would not be lagging the Asian tigers in entrepreneurial spirit and technology start-ups.<br><br>All these errors show that it is dangerous to rely on one man in running a country because his ideas and assumptions could be terribly wrong. Worse there may be no one to correct him.<br><br>It is a very simple fact that a country only needs a certain number of top scholars to do teaching and research works.<br><br>The rest of the population who are not so inclined in academics should be exposed to practical knowledge applications through broad-based education.<br><br>Citizens have given many such feedbacks a long time ago but the leaders failed to listen.<br><br>Now as a result, Singapore is lagging behind the Asian tigers in entrepreneurial spirit.<br><br>Our scholars have been unable to solve the persistent high cost and the 20 major policy errors as posted in this forum. In science and technology, we are lagging behind in many fields despite the large number of scholars we have produced.<br><br>We are lagging behind in technology start-ups but EDB is claiming success in so many ventures. They have to be honest with themselves and not be so complacent.<br><br>We are lagging behind in chip and computer designing capabilities, engineering excellence and high technology start-ups. This lack of technological competitiveness will make us lose out in economic competitiveness.<br><br>It will take many years to make good even if we start to send people to expose themselves in practical knowledge applications and even if our MOE reverse the academic streaming into practical knowledge application.<br><br>Tweaking of the present education system will not work unless there is major change and total commitment to reverse the past academic approach.<br><br>Train more people to teach practical applications and technology start-up within our education system and bring more educators into applying their knowlege in practical environment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Selecting the top students for scholarship systems is a great way to weed out the hardworking students from the lazy ones. Talent is cultivated in our school systems and culture, and no unit of measure is able to determine it. If a student is good at studies, it gives promise that the student is mature and hardworking. It is also work while to spend more money to invest in their hardwork.<br><br>It is up to the scholars and their mentors, bosses, culture and singapore's society to shape these people into the leaders of the future. Forward thinking, initiative and vision comes with hard work, experience and the willingness to learn. Scholarships are still given to US citizens and every where else in the world.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cavinkoh:</div><div class="quote_body">Selecting the top students for scholarship systems is a great way to weed out the hardworking students from the lazy ones. Talent is cultivated in our school systems and culture, and no unit of measure is able to determine it. If a student is good at studies, it gives promise that the student is mature and hardworking. It is also work while to spend more money to invest in their hardwork.</div></blockquote>In running a country, selectiong a few academically able and giving them scholarship is one way to level the rich and poor. If we groom the scholars and give them opportunities to rise up and achieve success for the community, that is something worth doing that can be supported by the masses.<br><br>So there is no disagreement with scholarship and the system of using the scholarship to help run the country.<br><br>The problem we need to examine in our case is not the pure belief in scholarship system for the reason as stated. It is that we might have become so totally obsessed with scholarship that there seems to be no other solutions to promote entrepreneurship and pro-business environment to grow the economy.<br><br>Figures were sufficiently given in the first post that we have spent huge amounts of our resources in grooming scholars thinking that they will lead to solving all the problems in our country.<br><br>One may ask: then what happens. Do we lose more or gain more. It may be immaterial as no one may be the wiser. However, one consequence does happen - we fail to recognize that succcess is not produced by these scholars in the running of the country.<br><br>There are many problems created by assumptions or concepts of all kinds in running the place. We have to contend with high costs due to a tax-and-recover system of running the country. There are 20 major poicy errors as posted in other thread. Like China, our scholar system of running the country has not made the country stronger or modernised.<br><br>What is wrong with such scholarship system? We have narrowly practised it to the extent that we neglected mass participation in knowledge application in every field.<br><br>We overlook the importance to grow and entrepreneurial spirit among the masses to succeed. We fail to bring about innovations or practical broad-based education but keep producing more and more scholars and give them higher jobs and higher pays presumably so that the scholars will lead us to some kinds of nirvana or success. This obsession is the myth we should remove.<br><br><blockquote>It is up to the scholars and their mentors, bosses, culture and singapore's society to shape these people into the leaders of the future. Forward thinking, initiative and vision comes with hard work, experience and the willingness to learn. Scholarships are still given to US citizens and every where else in the world.

After 40 years we are now looking for results to see if we have based on scholars running the country we indeed have done well. Is it true that our scholars have helped us to produce a more competitive economy or are we only producing scholars to give them good jobs and higher rewards.<br><br>We must look at our policies to see if they are right or wrong as practised by the scholars. We must examine our entrepreneurial spirit and creativity. We must look at our economic competitiveness whether they are produced in some way that enable us to grow and succeed in the next level of growth.</div>

If something really needs changes and total change, I would say it. For education, it not only needs tweaking, it also needs a total change. I will not want the scholar system. I will want the education system to be more hands on than theories. It is through experiences that we grow up and learn from our mistakes. If we just study theory, and anything that goes against theory will be wrong. That is really obsolete. However, if your experiments go against theories, you can redo and find out what is wrong. If there is still no wrong and despite repeated experiments and you get the same results, then question the theory. Remember, a theory is not obsolete. It will change with time. Just like the theory that Earth is the centre, not Sun. Not Sun is the centre, who knows in future it will be some other stars or planets that is the centre of solar system?</div>
