            <div class='col-md body'>A Malaysian's view on the scenic bridge:<br><br>Bridge saga makes all poorer<br>By raising sand and military overflying rights, Singapore ensures these issues remain out of reach. Chandra Muzaffar, The Sun<br>May 15, 2006<br><br>Kuala Lumpur - AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE Tan Sri Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak has provided a rational explanation on why the Malaysian government decided not to build "the bridge" to replace the Johor Causeway.<br><br>The first three options that he outlined would have been detrimental to our national interest.<br><br>1. The first option - acceding to Singapore's request for a lifting of the 1997 ban on the export of sand to Singapore and allowing the Singapore military access to Malaysian airspace as trade-offs for the building of a full straight bridge - would have been perceived by a lot of Malaysians as an affront to our national sovereignty.<br><br>2. The second option - building a half bridge to join the Singapore part of the Causeway - would have embroiled us in contentious legal wrangles, sapping our financial resources.<br><br>3. The third option - building a half bridge in the hope that eventually it can be linked to a full bridge - would have placed us at Singapore's mercy and subjected the nation to ridicule.<br><br>4. The fourth option - not to build the bridge at all - was perhaps the only way out of a difficult situation. By exercising this option, however, Malaysia has had to pay a heavy price.<br><br>The Mahathir administration had already constructed a RM1.2 billion Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex without obtaining a firm, formal agreement from its Singapore counterpart on the building of the bridge.<br><br>It had also awarded the contract for the bridge to a developer who will now have to be compensated - to the tune of RM100 million.<br><br>It was neither responsible nor intelligent to make decisions of this sort which have become an "albatross around the neck" of the present government.<br><br>The Singapore government also "shot itself in the foot" by insisting upon sand and airspace as the trade-offs for its consent on the bridge.<br><br>Because of this episode, no Malaysian government in the foreseeable future will even be able to open a discussion with the Singapore government on the question of allowing the Singapore Air Force access to Malaysian airspace.<br><br>It has merely reinforced the suspicion that pervades a significant segment of the Malaysian populace about the real intentions of the Singapore government, which is perceived as a close security ally of both Washington and Tel Aviv.<br><br>The Singapore government could have used the bridge proposal from the Malaysian government to improve its image among the Malaysian people.<br><br>True, the bridge would have benefited Malaysia - specifically Southern Johor - more than Singapore but it would have also further enhanced the cross border flow of people and goods to the advantage of the latter.<br><br>Besides, the water flow in the Johor Strait that the bridge would have facilitated, and the return of marine life, would have benefited both neighbours.<br><br>More than anything else, a bridge would have been a wonderful symbol of the importance we accord to friendship and understanding between our two peoples.<br><br>But when one is obsessed with reaping the most from every situation, when one's kiasu mentality has instilled in one a morbid fear of losing out, how can we expect a magnanimous gesture of goodwill from our dear neighbour?<br><br>Dr Chandra Muzaffar is the president of the International Movement for a Just World (Just).</div>
