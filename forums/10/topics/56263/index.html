            <div class='col-md body'>Brave... thats what I would describe MP Amy Khor. Despite the fact that she knew that she would be going against the decisions of her "bosses", she still spoke as how she felt the people on the ground wanted her to in Parliament.<br><br>As a voter, it gives me confidence in knowing that our, i.e. us commoners, views are mentioned in Parliament. It signals that our views do matter. It is sad to have the PM say that she is trying to erode trust between the govt and the people. Somehow, I feel that my trust in and respect for her has increased tremendously.<br><br>Whether in the long run, we will be better off or not... I believe we will be. Why? Singaporeans are smarter and more resourceful than that. Whether its 3% or 6%, we will survive. Not becos it was a good decision to cut the CPF by x%, but becos we are survivors. PR-wise, it was a good point that the PM brought up that the voters will show if we support him or not. Becos he knows that we will make adjustments (disposable income falls and we spend less, simple!) ... and at the end of the day, he can take credit for making the right choice. Sigh...<br><br>MP Khor was quoted in the papers as saying "As an MP, I must be able to face robust rebuttal." Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner here. Unfortunately, not everyone in her position (as an MP), is gamely enough to realise the wisdom in her quote.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must say that it is interesting to read the opinions of Atobe and Wuming. Wuming is right to say that we are lucky to be living in Singapore - clean, safe and amenities are there. But I disagree with the "leave if you dun like this place". I have had plans to go and I am sure many others have as well, however, there are other reasons to stay, one very strong reason is FAMILY.<br><br>I began this thread becos I felt that MP Amy Khor did something noble and something that deserves all our respect. She highlighted the general feeling "on the ground". This despite the fact that she knew she would probably get into trouble. To me, thats a making of a strong person - doing the right thing despite its consequences. One of her main roles as an MP was to represent the people that voted her in - becos they trust her to bring their thots to the leaders of the nation. She gets reprimanded for that. I dun think she was agreeing with the opposition. She merely did what was her main duty is to her constituent - to speak up for them.<br><br>Is betrayal a strong word? Everything is subjective and rather than say "Sit down and hush", proper explanations should be provided. It has been said that the reduction in CPF is "good for us" well i guess so is the increase in GST. There are many examples of CEOs accepting a lower pay cheque, becos, as leaders of the company, they are willing to suffer with their employees. Extend this to the political arena... Some years back, SAF officers were taught to "lead by example".... now extend that to the political arena.<br><br>My friends and I have given up on defending or cursing Singapore politicians. Its no use here. An MP who spoke up for her people got reprimanded by her leader. Its sad, very sad. To me, its unjustified.<br><br>I think the mission statements for our politicians have to be reviewed. Somehow, someone instilled a rule that the Singapore Parliament is meant to have no other views other than the ruling party's view. Now that does not sound very democratic, does it? I am beginning to wonder if the Singapore pledge stands for anything now.<br></div>

MPs of a party need only to speak in line with the party's stand only after all the arguments and discussions in the parliament.<br><br>i guess PM was unhappy not with her stand or her view cos in the end she supported the cuts and only translated her constituents' opinions. wat irked him alot was the thing about betrayal.<br><br>he prob felt there was a need to vigorously rebut this point cos it was one of the pillars of government. if he rebutted only mr low, ppl may wonder how come amy khor got nothing for using the same word. so he had to lash out on both, paying some price along the way wich he thought worthwhile.<br><br>in that regard i disagree with some notion abt OB markers brought out in the papers over this issue.<br><br>but yes, whether it was a political move or not, wat amy khor did was correct morally and should be applauded by the ground.</div>

Humans are selfish by nature and politicians <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> human. One of the hardest admission to make is that all humans err and are not infallible. Everyone makes mistakes - one's true worth then is whether that person is willing to admit to that mistake.<br><br>Whether its paranoia or for the better good of Singaporeans, I think one can argue both ways. All I know is that sooner than later, Singapore will be known as Marine Parade GRC looking at the extension of the election boundaries - isn't this akin to command and conquering land? Like I mentioned before, Singaporeans are resourceful enough to adjust to the current circumstances and at the end, we will "make do". Is it becos of the changes implemented by our govt, one can only speculate. Or is it truly due to the sacrifices that Singaporeans make in light of the force majeure circumstances? Force majeure becos we dun have a say in decisions and choices, we are treated as children and told to fall in line and listen. The very people whom we chose to articulate our views to our leaders instead chose the easy route and maintain their silence for fear of reprimand. Our lives are affected (whether for good or for worse) - are the other MPs claiming that the people that they represent have no objections to it? If so, we are truly robots then. We cannot think for ourselves and we have no opinions.<br><br>The recent establishment of the Cut Waste Panel and the request for employers to listen more to employees (to me) is futile and too late. You make the decisions, you tell us the dates that such decisions will come into effect, you pass the decisions through parliament then you go out and seek opinions? Anyone can tell you that the process is mixed up.<br><br>I agree with Atobe about the protesting issue. Its like they are sticking their tongues out and fanning their palms by the side of their cheek singing, "nah nah nah... you can't do it.... even if you wanted to... "<br><br>I think Atobe's final question should really be<br><br>"In a political system that deny space for honest and sincere objections, can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY TRULY </strong></span>exist when the opinions from a few is forced through over the others ?"</div>
