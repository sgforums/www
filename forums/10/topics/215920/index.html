Of injecting drug users surveyed, 14 per cent reported using ice in 2000.  This jumped to 45 per cent in 2004 then fell slightly to 38 per cent last year.  New figures are due out next month.</strong><br><br>Mr Dillon welcomed steps to improve psychiatric emergency care, but warned against losing sight of problems caused by heroin and alcohol.<br><br>"We still need to remember that the biggest cause of illicit drug death continues to be heroin and the number one problem that hospitals are seeing around the country continues to be alcohol,'' he said.<br><br>AAP and Elicia Murray</blockquote>2.not just drugs problems. Sure corruptions involved.<br>if u stay in Aussie,pl share more here.<br><br><img src="http://mud.mm-a4.yimg.com/image/1321962527"><br><br>3.<strong>added 27.10.2006</strong><br><strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20876,20656833-12854,00.html" rel="nofollow">This drug lives up to our worst nightmare,OPINION Matt Price,October 28, 2006</a></strong><br><blockquote>"It's big, it's big," he exclaims. "It rots your brain and we really don't know how to deal with it. The hype is completely justified. People - parents - should be very scared."....<br><br>They saw for themselves the extra security guards deployed to cater for the ultra-aggressive ice victims and the lock-up cells used to placate patients lurching out of control.....<br><br>"It's as if after all these years experimenting they've finally come up with the perfect drug, particularly suited to the Australian lifestyle. It's cheap, it's small, it's easy to hide. It works instantly and is insanely powerful. You can smoke it or swallow it or inject it. You don't rely on the Mujaheddin or sunlight or rain for supply, people can cook it up in their back yard. The dealers are making huge profits and, unlike heroin, you're not going to die straight away."<br><br>Where we're sitting is a short walk from the notorious Kings Cross strip. Fulde waves his arms and grunts: "And don't think this is confined to Darlinghurst and the so-called degenerative underclass. Ice users are across every level of society. That's what's really frightening; there are so many people using who we don't see here, or haven't yet. They're in trouble and just barely coping." .....</blockquote>If u are sending kids to Aussie,just do some home works and Good Luck.</div>
