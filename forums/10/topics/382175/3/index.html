              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's policy of destroying chinese education system and imposing english as dominant language and suppressing dialect is a complete rubbish policy in my view.</p>
              <p>You only have to look at the standard of english and chinese of Singaporeans to see that all of his languages policies had been a total and complete failure.</p>
              <p>The basic reason lies with the rubbish education system, a flaw that many had criticised in the past but only now after so many years did Lee Kuan Yew dare to admit that he failed.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew is worthless at making social policies.</p>

              <p>I have to disagree with you on that.</p>
              <p>English standards of Singaporeans, while not very good, is not that bad either. In Asia, we are the country where our English can be understood by the West. We are in effect, something like a gateway to Asia.</p>
              <p>For instance, where I am working now, the westerners commended on my English (though I think my English is average only), saying that its very easy to understand, and I am able to express myself pretty well. They are generally impressed when a Chinese walks in and speaks quite ok English.</p>
              <p>If we had decided on Chinese as first language instead, I think Singapore would not have survived the 1st 40 years of its independence, honestly.</p>

              <p>But the fact remains that Post Independence, the world was an English speaking world. Regardless of the internal political reasons (Though i think weakening the Chinese dialect speaking majority was one of the happy accidents, not the main goal), Singapore as a whole would benefit more on the global stage then by strictly implementing English.</p>
              <p>My grandfather insisted that my mother and her siblings attend Chinese schools in the morning and English schools in the afternoon.

              <p>Actually, in the earlier days, the Chinese in ä¹�å…«è¡Œ doing business with the malaysian and indonesian were using Chinese. local business use dialects and malays. english is used only for government and legal matters.</p>
              <p>With the growing presence of america in the reason, english is used more as regional language, while chinese was nothing but a tie with the communists in china. since the 60s japan, and the 4 tigers all prosper by trading with the US. english became more important than ever before. BUT, you don't find any japanese who can't speak japs, a taiwanese who can't speak chinese or a korea who can't speak korean.</p>
              <p>language is not only for business, it is also part of a culture. The french will tell you that the french language is their culture. The passing down of culture æ–‡åŒ–çš„ä¼ æ‰¿ cannot be done using another language.</p>
              <p>our grandparents were aware of the global situation then by sending us to learn english, but ignoring our mother tongue, be it chinese, malay or indian will surely dilute the learning of our culture. but damn, I don't find malay who don't speak malay, or indian who speak only english. It is very sad for singaporean chinese.</p>
              <p>sometimes I wonder if India were to prosper earlier and faster than china, would we be asked to learn english and hindu?</p>

              <p><br>Who or what makes "a commie" ?</p>
              <p>Would you believe that anyone who is a Chinese, Chinese educated, a social activist and opposes the PAP - will stand a high chance of being labelled a "commie".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Communist Russia and China - any concerned citizen who will dare to oppose the Communist Government, he will be labelled a "Revisionist"; and still it becomes more ironical that in Singapore - such a citizen activists will be labelled a "Communist".</p>
              <p>Any country that is intolerant of alternative or opposing views, will have the authorities label the actions of these activists in the most negative ways - when such activists are in fact Nationalists.</p>
              <p>The British Internal Security Department had advised the British Colonial Government not to act on LKY's advise to use the ISA to arrest those whom LKY had accused to be Communists - as the ISD reports had found no evidence to support LKY's claims.</p>
              <p>The British ISD even clarified that those who were accused by LKY to be Communists - were in fact Nationalist clamouring for Singapore independence from Colonial Rule.</p>
              <p>Can Dr Lim Hock Siew - educated in English as his foundation, and graduating as a western medical doctor - be a Communist as accused by LKY and arrested in the 1963 Operation Cold Store ?</p>
              <p>Was it about "communists" - or was it all about removing the threat of politicians who are sharper and with great intellect that LKY feared ?</p>

              <p>I have to disagree with you on that.</p>
              <p>English standards of Singaporeans, while not very good, is not that bad either. In Asia, we are the country where our English can be understood by the West. We are in effect, something like a gateway to Asia.</p>
              <p>For instance, where I am working now, the westerners commended on my English (though I think my English is average only), saying that its very easy to understand, and I am able to express myself pretty well. They are generally impressed when a Chinese walks in and speaks quite ok English.</p>
              <p>If we had decided on Chinese as first language instead, I think Singapore would not have survived the 1st 40 years of its independence, honestly.</p>

              <p>It's rather strange though, one thing i noticed is that Cantonese teenagers continues to speak their dialect among themselves it has always given me the impression that Cantonese is the dominant dialect group, which isn't true.</p>
              <p>But it's rarely the case with the Hokkien or Teochew.</p>
              <p>While i can agree that we have a part to play with the decline in dialect, i don't think the answer's as straight forward as being completely due to LKY's efforts.</p>

              <p><br>I think Hong Kong plays a part in this aspect about Cantonese. Cantopop is pretty popular in this part of the region, and this helps to keep the dialect alive.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese, well they have Hokkien songs, however, somehow to my novice ears, Cantonese songs tend to sound nicer than Hokkien songs, no offence intended.</p>

              <p>Uncle,</p>
              <p>I will take yr last statement, LKY do not fear anyone, in fact, he respect anyone who is smart and clever. Having said that, he will remove anyone who block his way to the top, whether you are a intellectually wise doctor or a stupid gangster, he knows how to play his game. The question is, how can there be people who are sharper with great intellect get removed by him.? The British are there for the taking, he aligned his policy with the British and gained their support, once that is done, the stupid brits will arrest anyone he said, because to the Brit, they dun care whoever they are, yellow, dark or brown skins are not their concern, they can always push that blame to a stupid lawyer LKY, who is the PM then. Luckily enuf, the cold war with the commies was at it height during this time, and to the west, anything that is chinese or russians, cannot be trust, and Singapore was alway at western influences, therefore, if Uncle Lim was able to comprehend the enviroment and situation of that time, he should be on the British side before LKY did, so, in a way, we youngster see him as plain stupid, not highly intellect enuf to match LKY</p>

              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">GCK Said Singapore should be made relevant but should relevant means "common" Does Singapore really want to be seen the homogenous as the rest of the region? <em>By the way PRC has an image problems it isn't well like....</em>Should Singapore be Unique...differentiate from the main competitors in the region?</span></span></p>

              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">This I fully agree, many european speaks more than 3 languages.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small; color: #0000ff;">I was once in a meeting with Spanish, English, Korean....and the common language in that meeting was Spanish.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">I attended meetings in paris where the language of the meeting was French, and Indonesian in JKT.  I was told in south america they conduct meeting in spanish. </span></span><br>I once attended a meeting in houston on china bz dev, while the language of meeting was english, more than half the white americans across the table spoke very fluent mandarin, and I knew then why the hq believed they could better handle china from houston than from singapore. </p>
              <p>English is an important language for international business, but our advantage in the language is reduced when others pick up english. but when it comes to local business, we will be greatly disadvantaged if we dont know the local language, whatever that is.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #000000;">We can never sound like a PRC, they learn american pronunciation and our singlish pronunciation originated from victoria english, big difference in accents, especially among PRC.</span></p>
              <p>It will take years staying in the region for any caucasian to be able to distinguish a PRC, ROC, HongKonger, Singaporean, or Malaysian, just as difficult for asian to distinguish a dutch, austrian, english, danish....</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) Lastly after 40 years of independent Singapore finally reach a world stage where we are not mistaken to be in China....but the southern tip of Malaysia....So lets not confused the world again by projecting ourseleves as chinese from China.....Hellloooo!!!</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">even during the 90s in the first MNC I worked for, a guy from Leverkusen actually asked me if I were proud of the great wall, haha.. Ignorant people are ignorant because they don't know, not because others confuse them. Many Singaporean Chinese are confused themselves with their ethnic identity, looked chinese, but can't find the chinese - ness, and don't like to be called banana.</span></p>
              <p>Speaking proper mandarin is not projecting ourselves as chinese from china, just like speaking proper english doesn't mean our ancestors kneel to her majesty the queen.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as the PRC chinese, the people in beijing, shanghai, and guangzhou all speak mandarin with diffferent accent, and singapore mandarin is more similar to the ROC mandarin. </p>
              <p>Asian Chinese are differentiated by our culture, not by the language we speak.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">please just because he barks doesn’t mean that you should hastily Jump…</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">This is a good ending statement, it is our language, and our culture, what we inherit from our parents, what we need to pass on, whether we are in singapore, or when we move out go elsewhere, the government don't decide for me. While admitting making mistake in the past, he is making another mistake now, by telling the teachers how to teach.</span></p>

              <p><br>I think Hong Kong plays a part in this aspect about Cantonese. Cantopop is pretty popular in this part of the region, and this helps to keep the dialect alive.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese, well they have Hokkien songs, however, somehow to my novice ears, Cantonese songs tend to sound nicer than Hokkien songs, no offence intended.</p>

              <p>Uncle,</p>
              <p>I will take yr last statement, LKY do not fear anyone, in fact, he respect anyone who is smart and clever. Having said that, he will remove anyone who block his way to the top, whether you are a intellectually wise doctor or a stupid gangster, he knows how to play his game. The question is, how can there be people who are sharper with great intellect get removed by him.? The British are there for the taking, he aligned his policy with the British and gained their support, once that is done, the stupid brits will arrest anyone he said, because to the Brit, they dun care whoever they are, yellow, dark or brown skins are not their concern, they can always push that blame to a stupid lawyer LKY, who is the PM then. Luckily enuf, the cold war with the commies was at it height during this time, and to the west, anything that is chinese or russians, cannot be trust, and Singapore was alway at western influences, therefore, if Uncle Lim was able to comprehend the enviroment and situation of that time, he should be on the British side before LKY did, so, in a way, we youngster see him as plain stupid, not highly intellect enuf to match LKY</p>
