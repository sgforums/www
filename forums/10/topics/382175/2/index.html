              <p>More importantly, it's the practical reason why English is the de facto international language, and why Chinese will never be.</p>
              <p>It's about simplicity. Chinese is just too complicated to be adopted by everyone in the world.</p>

              <p>I think the point soul_rage is trying to make is that it is harder than English.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty ok with either language, but i think it was just a fact that as a technical language English is better suited than any other options considering the global stituation then.</p>

              <p><br>I can't say i completely agree with you there, personally i think Chinese is versatile enough a language to pick up and master and quite suitable a language for technical purposes as well.</p>
              <p>But the fact remains that Post Independence, the world was an English speaking world. Regardless of the internal political reasons (Though i think weakening the Chinese dialect speaking majority was one of the happy accidents, not the main goal), Singapore as a whole would benefit more on the global stage then by strictly implementing English.</p>
              <p>My grandfather insisted that my mother and her siblings attend Chinese schools in the morning and English schools in the afternoon. Though I'm sure we like to convince ourselves that the people post independence were mindless sheeps being herded by LKY, i believe they were quite aware of the global stituation then.</p>

              <p>If you ask the westerners about Chinese, many will tell you that Chinese is the most difficult language to learn (together with German). The foundation of the language is very much different from English.</p>
              <p>Moreover, with us Chinese focusing 5000 years on culture and the language, it is indeed a more sophisticated language to learn. Which language can describe a scenario or situation in just 4 words?</p>
              <p>But then again, I won't say I am correct, coz I am no language expert. I am just merely saying this based on my experience with global work. Who knows, maybe in 2 or 3 generations' time, China becomes the defacto superpower, that perhaps everyone HAS to learn Chinese in order to get a foot into the market?</p>

              <p>It is quite obvious that the Taiwanese 'Hum' has no integrity to respect Singapore or Singaporeans - even as it has taken up residentship in Singapore.</p>
              <p>If the Taiwanese 'Hum' has the slightest bit of integrity in its "hum" - it would not have insulted an 80 year old Dr Lim Hock Siew, who had stood his ground, and refused to  surrender to the torments poured on him by the ISD dogs released by LKY.</p>
              <p>If the Taiwanese 'Hum' has any integrity left, it should get out of Singapore and return to Taiwan.</p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's policy of destroying chinese education system and imposing english as dominant language and suppressing dialect is a complete rubbish policy in my view.</p>
              <p>You only have to look at the standard of english and chinese of Singaporeans to see that all of his languages policies had been a total and complete failure.</p>
              <p>The basic reason lies with the rubbish education system, a flaw that many had criticised in the past but only now after so many years did Lee Kuan Yew dare to admit that he failed.</p>

                  the same condition and needing a blood transfusion. The first, a
                  Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later.
                  The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few
                  days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a transfusion and

                  per cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The
                  whites score on average 100. Asians score more ... the Bell curve
                  authors put it at least 10 points higher. These are realities that, if
                  you do not accept, will lead to frustration because you will be

                  passed over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this
                  earth, been isolated from each other, developed independently, had
                  different intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils... I
                  didn't start off with that knowledge. But by observation, reading,
