              <p>The term language is culture already differentiate btw culture and language, it is by understanding the language that you get to know better of the culture, both them must interwind and evolve together. But without knowing the language, you can also adopt to the culture, like some ang mo also practice chopstick and bowl to eat food, especially on chinese foods, but they do not neccessary need to know the culture. Yes, language and culture works hand in hand, but to me, Language is not Culture hor</p>

              <p><br>This is where cultured sensitive comes into specific and not being a monolithic culture that overshadow the rest......For particularly Chinese writing characters are part of chinese culture as Chinese characters are a derivation of calligarphy thru inscription from expressing objects. Thus you can said language ties into its cultured.</p>
              <p>While other languages such as spanish are oral phonetics. and influence by various civilizations such as Arabic, and other European language. So its less of cultured influence.</p>

              <p>You have not widely visit the world enuf, if you are in Tapei, beijin or shanghai talking to American trained management, scholars and trainers, they speak fluent American english with a New yorker accents. Therefore, in near future, we can see PRC speak perfect slanted American English, and they are hunger for it. For those PRC who are here in Singapore, these are the begining stage, and also these group are those from rural areas, they dun understand english or singlish, not wrong, after all, they are from China Chinese, you cannot expect them to speak like singaporeans singlish, but those who are educated here will find it hard to speak American english.</p>

              <p><br>why you sound so upset? Language is part of a culture, not The culture. many people learn the language without adopting the culture. Many of us speak English but we do not necessarily accept or adopt the culture, many indonesia may speak very little mandarin or dialects but practice a lot in the chinese culture.</p>

              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">I was just wondering if generally Singaporean learned the right lesson coming out of this rare acknowledgement. Or it is his subtlety of charting new direction for Singapore?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">I just thought that this is not about the right brain vs left brain or adopting English as priority....but rather how policies was set without much questioning and debate....or examine….the system..So stop repeating the past hast decision. <span><span style="font-size: small;">.....there are hardly any debate of the direction of What Singapore should Take....</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">So what if we took the wrong path in English?  I mean if today America or Europe still dominate the future economies would he make such revision remarks?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">GCK Said Singapore should be made relevant but should relevant means "common" Does Singapore really want to be seen the homogenous as the rest of the region? <em>By the way PRC has an image problems it isn't well like....</em>Should Singapore be Unique...differentiate from the main competitors in the region?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">The future language isn't about Mandarin or English bilingual.....</span></span><span><span style="font-size: small;">....U got to be able to understand at least 3  APEC languages.......</span></span></p>

              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;"><em>1) Do you really want to sound like a PRC when u speak English? When your MNC counterpart could not distinct you to be PRC or Singaporean?</em></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;"><em>2) Do you really want to pronounce ph as phy because most chinese have a hardtime grasping the "H" and if you are old and your crown fall off....!!</em></span></span></p>

              <p><br>I encounter usually two standard remarks about Singaporeans in my work.</p>
              <p>1. We speak too fast, so much so that our pronounciation is not done properly, and people tend to miss what we said</p>
              <p>2. We tend to be lazy in the way we end our sentences and articulation of words. Most other native English speakers tend to give an energetic 'lift' to the end of their sentences, and to emphasize at times on certain words to drive through what they want to express.</p>
              <p>Appropriate emphasis of words tend to help drive through understanding, because most times, people don't need to catch the entire sentence to understand, but just the key words.</p>
              <p>That's basically 2 things about our 'Singlish'. It's not that I advocate us to sound like an American or English, etc, but it does us immense benefits if we learn to slow a bit, pronounce better, and make appropriate emphasis on words in our sentence. After all, language is mainly a tool for communications, it doesn't hurt to help others understand us better.</p>

              <p>I can understand the economical value of being able to speak English so that native English speakers could understand us.</p>
              <p>What i don't understand however, is why we seemed to have to be so ashamed that we are speaking it with a local flavour to it? Why do we have to look down on those who are not speaking the "proper English"?</p>
              <p>I'm sure there would be Americans that would find it hard to understand the Scottish/Irish/Welsh English speakers, and British who would find it a little difficult to grasp what people living South of the Mason-Dixie Line are trying to say.</p>
              <p>Why do we have to be so uptight and self conscious about our local flavour of English? The feeling is like we actually think Singaporeans who couldn't speak the "proper English" are somehow stupid or belong to an inferior class, to be despised and looked down upon when it's perfectly fine to use for communication with locals.</p>
              <p>Are our English so horrible that a few conversations with native speakers wouldn't solve? What's the big deal with using Singlish that why we have to be so embarassed about it?</p>

              <p>Because english is foreign alien language and singlish is a bastardised version of it.</p>
              <p>So people feel ashamed of speaking a bastardised version of english.</p>
              <p>Some more they don't see people on TV speaking singlish who are authoritative figures, so they don't have an example to follow.</p>
              <p>They say "oh look at Lee Kuan Yew, he doesn't speak singlish, he speaks proper english, so singlish is not for high and mightly elites."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually the correct way should be for people to speak their native language, not go and speak foreign alien languages, then cannot speak properly then feel inferior.</p>
              <p>That is a rubbish way of nation building but of course if the one making policies is a fucking anglo dog...</p>

              <p><br>Whether we are ashamed or not is besides the point. The point being, it's not really an accent issue, but more a laziness issue that resulted in our lazy style of English. Even if I speak with proper emphasis on words, my accent is STILL singaporean. That's how my colleagues see it. The way we speak is still predominantly Singaporean flavour.</p>
              <p>The only difference is in speaking properly, and not in a slid-shod manner much like how we dress up in Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Are you serious in having your relevant statement made in this Forum - when you cannot even understand a simple sentence made by Arapahoe, and develop your argument into your characteristic nonsensical garbage that only a 'hum' is good at ?</p>
              <p>No one will want to comment on your pathetic "hum" English skills in spellings and sentence structures - can you even make any sense of what you want to say to be relevant in anyway to Arapahoe's post ?</p>
              <p>Are you thinking your sentences in your Taiwanese "hum" dialect and writing it out in exact word-by-word translation into English ?</p>
              <p>Was Arapahoe questioning the reasons for taking Class Action on LKY, or was he asking the possibility of a Class Action being taken against LKY ?</p>
              <p>If you cannot even understand the meaning of what Arapahoe said, it is due as much to your flippant ways to simply make a hurried reply - just to score another hit for your record busting vanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the information of your "hum-burger" - the "burger" in your statement is what you eat; and it should be that you will want to have the guards to get the "bugger" out, as you have been buggered by that bugger, which caused you to be the "hum" in the  "hum-bugger" that you have now become.</p>

              <p><br>I remember a few years back, when I tried to penetrate the Japan market with my partners, there were places whereby gaijin ( foreigners) arent allowed to enter. My money was spurned. Not an issue to me afterall, its their loss.</p>
              <p>However, after I practiced speaking the jap lingo, not as good as a native speaker of course and limited to basically my trade's biz, doors that were once closed were opened to me.</p>
              <p>It seemed ridiculous to me, an educated and pragmatic biz person, to believe that such simple stuff as speaking their lingo would help rather than the funds my partners were putting in. It was a lesson I learnt, never to be forgotten as my partners expanded to the world.</p>
              <p>Similarly, China is now a raging economic juggarnaut. We are similar in many ways with them, and for us to perfect mandarin is not an issue. It is in our genes and heritage, and the best position to tap into their wealth for our ourselves and our country.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, be realistic, it is the old guards whom are holding the reins of power. They are chinese speakers. It is only a few China CEOs that speaks perfect trade english. The larger power holders are mainly mandarin and even dialect speaking. As for the harvard educated yuppies, they are still puppies where power and money is concern.</p>
              <p>Thus the need to perfect our mandarin to talk to the leaders who controls all, and make them comfortable with us without interpreters, an added advantage we will have over what other non-chinese speaking bizmen from foreigns can offer.</p>
              <p>This is only my insight, and sigh ( always have to have a disclaimer)...I dont claim I am right, and what is written here is only for consideration, and not action if they choose not to.  </p>
