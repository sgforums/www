              <p><br>Are you serious in having your relevant statement made in this Forum - when you cannot even understand a simple sentence made by Arapahoe, and develop your argument into your characteristic nonsensical garbage that only a 'hum' is good at ?</p>
              <p>No one will want to comment on your pathetic "hum" English skills in spellings and sentence structures - can you even make any sense of what you want to say to be relevant in anyway to Arapahoe's post ?</p>
              <p>Are you thinking your sentences in your Taiwanese "hum" dialect and writing it out in exact word-by-word translation into English ?</p>
              <p>Was Arapahoe questioning the reasons for taking Class Action on LKY, or was he asking the possibility of a Class Action being taken against LKY ?</p>
              <p>If you cannot even understand the meaning of what Arapahoe said, it is due as much to your flippant ways to simply make a hurried reply - just to score another hit for your record busting vanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the information of your "hum-burger" - the "burger" in your statement is what you eat; and it should be that you will want to have the guards to get the "bugger" out, as you have been buggered by that bugger, which caused you to be the "hum" in the  "hum-bugger" that you have now become.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What should be done to a kid who does not listen to adults and think so highly of itself and insist to impose its will with its stupid remarks - that can only be caused by its persistent behavior like a stubborn and useless "hum" in its tight shell ?</p>
              <p>If "language is not culture", and "accent is culture" - which direction does a Taiwanese "hum" intend to lead the discussion to ?</p>
              <p>If "language is not culture" as so loudly declared by the Taiwanese "hum" - after having said that - how did the "hum" so brilliantly decide that "language work hand in hand with culture" ?</p>
              <p>How does the brilliance of a "hum" English intend for others to understand that - having said all that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">language is not part of culture</span></em>" and that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">language work hand in hand with culture</span></em>" - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">it does not exist apart from culture of any particular race/tribe of people</span></em>".?</p>
              <p>The brilliant intelligence of a Taiwanese "hum" is clearly brighter when its idiocy shine through the fog of its mischievious "hum" brain.</p>

              <p><br>Does the Taiwanese "hum" believe that the meaning and process of "Class Action" is for LKY to sue himself ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese "hum" is in its top form at being irrelevant.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the "hum" could have attribute the following said to LKY that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">we have to clear all these rubbish in the street even if it is a mistake</span></em>" - did LKY make another mistake again by opening the doors to let in all the rubbish immigrants that include the Taiwanese "hum" to spread its filth this time, when LKY had locked away loyalist Singaporeans that dare to challenge him ?</p>
              <p>Do we need a Taiwanese "hum" to explain what had transpired in Singapore, and to re-interprete the political events to put a kinder light onto LKY ?</p>
              <p>It would have been far more productive for the Taiwanese "hum" to return to the Bar Forum or to the Taiwanese Political Forum then to appear in this Speaker's Corner and attempt to change history with the PAP's propaganda fed into its "hum".</p>

              <p><br>Here is a Pengz San incident ....had one day asked my staff to go to the production lines to ask the PRC supervisor on what color in the order is he packing....</p>
              <p>My staff came back with a small pcs of paper indicate "6"</p>
              <p>I thought why pcs count?? I ask for color not numbers, because my staff speak spanish and the chinese supervisor "may  misunderstood"...so later in the same day i was in the production floor and ask the supervisor again.....</p>
              <p>He said "Tai Lao "Loke" Six"   in Cantonese......he was trying to write "GREEN" in Catonese....but he can't write so he wrote number "6"  </p>
              <p>Morale of the incident......if you want cheap and good this is what you get...so at the end of the day.  Who you send for what kind of job? </p>
              <p>For private business irregardless is a black cat or white cat so long as the cat catches mices he/She gets the job done thats fine. Cause at the end of the days Money Talks louders than word.  </p>
              <p>So for me I just have to expand my imagination when i communicate with my supervisor.  If you can't speak mandarin well, even if they look down on you but at the end of the day MONEY TALK the louders....</p>
