Jeyaretnam receiving a Human Rights Defenders award from the activist group Think Centre.<br><br>Mr Jeyaretnam dressed for the event in a T-shirt with the words 'Human Rights' written boldly across the front.<br><br>Before an audience that included opposition politicians, civil society activists and other interested observers, he accepted a small gold-coloured plaque from Think Centre president Sinapan Samydorai.<br><br>Mr Jeyaretnam praised the Think Centre for daring to honour him even though the authorities viewed him as a 'disturber of the peace'.<br><br>The man who broke the People's Action Party's monopoly in Parliament by winning the Anson seat in a 1981 by-election, said it was 'exhilarating' to be recognised at the age of 78, for his work in human rights.<br><br>Mr James Gomez, deputy secretary-general of the Workers' Party, of which Mr Jeyaretnam was once secretary-general, read out parts of a letter from the London branch of Amnesty International, which congratulated the veteran human rights activist and praised his contributions in the field.<br><br>The three-hour forum also featured speeches by Mr Samydorai and Dr Tan Chong Kee, a member of the board of directors of the theatre group Necessary Stage.<br><br>They criticised Singapore laws that allow detention without trial and limit freedom of expression here.<br><br>Separately, the police yesterday rejected an application by the Open Singapore Centre to hold a forum titled, Freeing Myanmar - How Can Asians Help?<br><br>Police spokesman Stanley Norbert said the application was turned down because 'the proposed event is likely to be contrary to the public interest'.<br><br>The Open Singapore Centre, led by opposition politician Chee Soon Juan, had planned to hold the forum today.<br><br></div>
