            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, MediaCorp should have plenty to learn from the Koreans as an article from littlespeck reveals:<br><br>A jewel of an idea<br>Captivating millions, promoting Korean culture, food and tourism at one go; MediaCorp can't have a better teacher. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Sept 22, 2005<br><br>At 7pm, Mondays-to-Fridays, instead of watching prime news or Channel 8, tens of thousands of Singaporeans are enthralled by a Korean TV blockbuster "Jewel in the Palace" (channel 55).<br><br>This has breached a new realm of modern TV. Dae Jang Guem (The Korean title pronounced Ta Jang Jing) is based on 16th century Korea and the plots and intrigue in the Royal Palace.<br><br>It is a big winner for South Korea, beyond just measuring audience.<br><br>The 70-part series (over three and a half months) is preceded nightly by brief explanations of Korean palace traditions, food (helped by the country's top cuisine expert) and its traditional medicine.<br><br>The plots are very engaging. For Seoul, the rewards lie in the promotion of Korean traditions and tourism globally. The CDs are already out.<br><br>It took Korean (viewership: a whooping 57.8%) and Taiwan TV by storm before coming here.<br><br>It is based on the story of a real historical figure, the first and only woman to serve as head physician to the King in the rigidly hierarchical and male-dominated Joseon Dynasty.<br><br>In spring 2004, it made its debut in America (Chicago).<br><br>The main filming locations - Jeju-do Island, Korean Folk Village, Naganeupseong, Suwon Hwaseong Haenggung Palace, and Changdeokgung Palace - have tourism attractions, attracting large crowds of fans, especially from Taiwan.<br><br>Benefiting from the popularity are many Korean restaurants everywhere. It introduced traditional dishes, in particular the imperial cuisine consisting of steamed food, soup, kimchi, etc.<br><br>There's quite a bit of demonstration of cooking imperial food, all part of the plots and therefore escaped being boring.<br><br>It's something MediaCorp and our tourism authorities would love to have produced here.<br><br>Singapore's tourism (8.5m a year) needs the boost; so does its home- grown food. It takes some imagination to put them together, and the Koreans have done it.<br><br>It shows how the power of a simple idea, well executed by a few talented stars, not necessarily high-powered, high-tech, can be turned into a entertainment winner.<br><br>Seoul had been behind Tokyo or Hong Kong in movies and television for a long time - until now. The gap is fast disappearing.<br><br>The TV people in Hong Kong may be fighting back, though.<br><br>At 8 pm after the Korean show, the same channel has started running "War and Beauty", an absorbing Hong Kong serial that also deals with palace plots and intrigues, but in old China.<br><br>It's like a season for royal thrillers, a battle royal. In economic spin-offs, however, the Koreans are winning hands down.<br><br></div>
