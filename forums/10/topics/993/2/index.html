Most instructors in any training sch (by now), will train you hard, but in a reasonable manner.<br><br>do u know that in my BMT, there was a famous incident just after parent's visiting that resulted in the OC being charged (at least he was rumoured to be charged). in any case, he was removed from his post. this is the result when u "torture" recruits. pls...with all you soft complain kings, who dares to "torture" any of you now?<br><br>Littleman is right. Basically u need DISCLIPLINE. the hallmark of a armed forces. and adrian, the govt cannot tell you to go and die, that much is true. the constitution can. when u finally get enlisted, pls pay more attention to the words in the SAF pledge and if u ever make OCS, study yr military law a bit more. u'll find that yr officers have every single right to ask u to charge and possibly die simply because the nation demands it and the President gives yr officer the right to order it.<br><br>and yes, yuu_kajima, war is a tough thing. probably the worse part is what it does to you psychologically. there are tons of Vietnam war stories abt new conscipts unable to take the mental pressure and the psychological demands. if you can't even handle a little pressure of making a fall-in timing, i despair for you.<br><br>try to buck up. 2.5 yrs is a short time, u'll realise when u leave the service, but it can be very long too, if you have poor attitude. same advice to adrian<br><br>generally, the new batches of officers and specs are not as hard and unbending as last time. are you in any way a lesser man than the rest of us? i'm sure u're not. if you can't take a bit of hardness, u'll learn that you won't be able to achieve anything in this world, even outside the military context.</div></blockquote>Well, I wasn't refering to BMT alone--note the title says national service, not BMT. And yes, I agree with you(though I don't like your tone) Bmt is only the tip--I have plenty of commando and Guard pals to tell me All about it. But to experience it? U kiddin'? Once you hear it, you get fits. And, I HAVE gone through BMT. Unlike most people, I'm not gonna forget it and say--Nah,it was nothing. It WAS hell. You know it, I know it. Unless you were in White horse co. or Pes c co,.etc. I was pes b, in Advanced BMT. so 3 field camps etcetc. And yeah, I know of the Post-Traumatic stress disorder. It came with the pressure of watching people you know and care about die in front of you. Some kind of shock, I think.(Shivers) War...what's it good for?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Yuu_Kajima,<br><br>Well, from what I can see, you seem rather bitter about your NS days, so I gather you might have had a bad experience in the army to feel so strongly about things? And mm......Monkey God, hahaha, I can still remember his famous theme, he is not really that bad a guy.<br>Well, I would actually expect PTP people to grumble a bit, afterall, PTP training is centralised on the physical aspect itself. I went through my BMT at Nee Soon Camp, but I do know how tough PTP training is like. I would agree that the transition from a civilian into an army guy in PTP might be quite extreme, especially since people admitted to PTP are usually not the more physically inclined, but given the short amount of time to beef everyone up, the PTIs don't really have the luxury of choice. But haven't you come out of PTP a fitter man, and proud to say that you have endured the four months of shit you went through? 20 pushups, 100 pushups, makes no difference I"m sure at the end, when you actually realise you can do 100, rite? PTIs look like the meany that they are, but agitation is one of the best motivation to reach your limit. It is an ordeal those few months I am sure, but I think it is necessary.<br>For me I don't really think that it is that bad going to OCS or SISPEC, in fact, I was actually glad I got into OCS. Anyone here remember the assurance by our instructors that we are the lowest form of being in the SAF? That was very reassuring, hahaha...... the training and everything was expectedly tough, but going through all that have given me the confidence I have in many aspects of life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, your comment that officers are only pawns in the military chessboard. I agree with that, to a certain degree. Officers however, are trained to be decision making pawns. People on top tell you the mission, constrains and everything. The officer does the thinking and delegation. People on top definitely don't give commands like "ask your man to strap himself with explosives blah blah blah", that would be ridiculous.<br><br>You asked why it is worth dying for a piece of land? Well, when Littleman mentioned he was willing to die for his country, I pretty much doubt that it was just a piece of land he was referring to. It encompasses the people within, people like your family and friends. You don't fight for a piece of land, you fight for your people, and the place you call home.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You mentioned if you can't kill, why bother to be trained to kill......<br>Picture it this way, right now, during peace, no question about it, noone in the right mind would train you to kill. We don't want mercenaries here do we. But NS is training you for war. In times of war, when you are left with the choice, kill or be killed, and the choice kill or subject your people to the enemies, that would be a different matter. The enemy that you are faced with, if not gotten rid of, might be the same one that is going to harm your family.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you have Guards and Commando friends who tell you all about their training. Then, good for you. You should then know that by their vocations, what are the dangers that they are expected to face while protecting the country and people like you and I.<br><br>What good is a war? Well, the answer is, war is the lousy. You would be psycho to think war is good. But that does not mean that National Service is not necessary. Preparing for a war is the best way of defending against it. Let me take a mundane example, you walk down the street with your girlfriend, some thugs come along and snatch your girlfriend away. Do you defend your girlfriend or do you just walk away thinking of peace, and let the police handle the matter? Of course I'm not saying don't call the police, don't misunderstand, but after the call, you are going to sit down and wait while letting your girlfriend be subjected to the thugs? It is the same case for a country. An agressor comes and invade your country. As a country, not being prepared, are we just going to call for foreign intervention without us doing anything to defend ourselves? Look at Kuwait for your example.<br><br>Oh yah, i forgot, u mentioned previously if u were to die, u would rather die with your family rite?? Think World War II, would that be of any use?<br><br>And I am running out of time, your concept of freedom, well, I won't comment much about it, but a book I would recommend is the Lord Of Flies. Everyone can have all the freedom they want to do anything they want, but is that necessarily good?<br><br>All the best, and if you are still in the army, best of luck then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, let me introduce myself, i am not new to this forum, have been reading it since last month but i have posted nothing cos i don't feel the urge. But after knowing that LittleMan had left the forum permanently (sad cos i always support his ideas, his is  a person who is so clear about his thinkings ...) ... and all those postings by yuu_kajima, i just wish to say something ....<br><br>first of all, the very first post by yuu_kajima was not written in a way for discussion. It was just a piece of complain. He is just out to vent his anger.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Well, at least, to me, it is tough, because I'm not the sort to exercise regularly, although I'm a school player<br></strong></blockquote>i am too not a tough person. My timing for SOC was always one of the lowest in my platoon. But i try. I volunteered to run in SBO rifle helmet in the early morning run while all the rest of my platoon mates are in PT kit. I am not good, but i try.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Did you go for PTP? Our total BMT was 4 months because of that<br></strong></blockquote>i am not a PTP batch. But i am a monointake. And in monointake, our BMT is not in School (BTS) but in Unit. You want to know how tough that is ? Go ask your mono-intake frens. There was a week when the whole company only slept for 3 hours, yes, for THE WHOLE WEEK, NOT 3 hours everyday.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I-Don't-think-any officer would command like that<br></strong></blockquote>you think i thought who confirm ? sounds familiar ? If there is a need, it will be done.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I'd much rather be beside my family, fighting away intruders, so that even if I die, at least I die with my family, in my home.<br></strong></blockquote>so you are suggesting that we shall not have an army at all and when the intruders come, we just fight the away from our home/ And if they attack your nieghbours' house, it is also none of your business ? as long as you are safe ? I think LittleMan is right, you "put yourself above everything else". But he is polite enough not to use the word "selfish".<br><br>you said :<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>keep your threats and insults off this forum. I don't know who you are, and I don't give a damn. Just discuss, talk, and don't scold-<br></strong></blockquote>then said :<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>YOU are the hideous one.<br></strong></blockquote>still dare to say :<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>At least we don't, see?<br></strong></blockquote>you simply slapped yourself.<br><br>btw, why you say LittleMan is hideous ? I don't get it. He is hideous in what sense ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>(Shivers) War...what's it good for?<br></strong></blockquote>nobody in this thread ever says war is good. And because it is no good that's why we need a strong and effective army to deter potential aggressors like what Revelations said.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>There are no war heroes--only good killers.<br></strong></blockquote>huh ? you are saying Lim Mou Sheng etc etc are killers ?<br><br>yes, war is ugly, but when someone attacks you what will you do ? sit down and preach ? Or maybe have a forum like this to discuss ? Or beg them to go away ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But would THEY want to die as eagerly as YOU do?<br></strong></blockquote>i don't think LittleMan is "eager to die" like what you said. But he will give no hesitation to sacrifice his life for his country when required. For that i applaud him.<br><br>yuu_kajiman is not here to discuss, he is here to complain. But i sympathise you yuu_kajiman, cos you are so full of hatred and misery.<br><br>LittleMan always answers ALL questions posted to him be it here or in Chit-Chat. Cos he is truly out for a discussion. But yuu_kajima, you have avoided so many questions posted to you by him and just keep yaking away. Why ? Here's the questions LittleMan posted :<br><br>1. <strong>can you explain this statement and justify yourself ?</strong> (YOU SAID : I'm thinking that little man is either a higher ranking NSman or not even enlisted. )<br><br>2. <strong>what makes you think that i am not a man ?</strong> (YOU SAID : If that's the kind of treatment you'll give to humans, think of it given to YOU daily, if you were a "MAN" like us. )<br><br>3. <strong>may i ask how do you define *democracy* and *communism* ?</strong> (YOU SAID : Singapore isn't a democratic state--it's communist! )<br><br>4. <strong>what kind of power you want ? YOU make decisions for the country ?</strong> (YOU SAID : The people have no power--can't you see? )<br><br>5. <strong>Btw, can you name any politicians who fly to miami to suck coconut milk when his people is fighting ?</strong> (YOU SAID : Politicains make their own ideas, call people of their country to die for them,a nd they fly off to miami sucking on coconut drinks)<br><br>6. <strong>Without freedom, what can you do ?</strong> (YOU SAID : THEY too, are fighting for their beliefs. They, too, are fighting for someone else's beliefs. They , too, are dying for the beliefs. Don't you have any of your own ideals, little man? )<br><br>if you are here for a discussion like you said in your post, do you mind answer these questions ? They were posted to you.<br><br>btw, your officers and sgt will never ask you do something they themselves cannot do. Don't believe ? Challenge them. That's what my platoon mate did and he lost. Terribly.<br><br>[This message has been edited by LittleMan Supporter (edited 08 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear yuu_kajima,<br><br>I am a strong believer of real peace--not the peace all governments promote by setting up Armies to threaten each other. THAT is merely a "keep at bay by means of violence" method. I do not believe in it.<br><br>I think the 'real peace' that you believe in only exists in an ideal world where  people care about one another and only use things that belong to them. However, the world that we live in is not ideal. People do steal from one another, people do kill their fellow human beings and in a bigger scale, countries do attack one another (remember Iraq's invation to Kuwait).<br><br>Governments do not like to go to war (in general) because it simply costs too much, in terms of lives, money, properties, time and lots of other things. However, that doesn't mean that they do not need armed forces to defend their countries. After all, you have to defend what is yours, right? How can you do that without an armed forces and a well-trained one at that? Are you going to leave the country at the mercy of other countries?<br><br>Furthermore, armed forces do not only serve to defend the country from external attack. They also defend the country from internal attack. What I mean by internal attack is incidents within the country itself that threaten the stability and the security of the nation, e.g. riots, strikes.<br><br>Therefore, armed forces are essential in the existence and well-being of a country, not to mention the peaceful lives of the people who live in the country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From someone who has juz completed bmt.... i will say SAF nowadays is pretty wellfare....<br>Training wise is quite relax too... in fact i dun find the training tough at all. Trench digging isn't as scary as it seems to be. U might get a few blister here and there for 24 click... but other than that its pretty okie. In fact the training is so easy that one of my platoon mates  said this," I think Singapore is finished if all of us received this kind of training."<br><br>I think NCC training are also tougher than BMT training. Some ppl might find it tough.... but like what my platoon guys says," u find it tough not cos the training is tough but bcos u are weak".<br><br>U consider running up and down the building torture? Well i can tell u its nothing compare to those torture during our father's days. Everything is so welfare nowadays.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree... I seriously think that saying that bmt is very welfare is an understatement. Just look at all the rules and guidelines that instructors have to follow.<br>Even my secondary school band camp was tougher than BMT, both physically and mentally. It is quite sad that BMT has come to such a stage. You can see the discipline dropping already. Though most of us won't admit, we do need an occasional whacking or so in order to keep ourselves on track.<br>BMT I feel has become a honeymoon phase. If pple are still complaining about it, then they must be really spoilt.<br>Army training is meant to be tough, otherwise how are we to survive the arduous conditions of war? Hard training during peacetime will only serve to strengthen our mental will which is much needed in hostile times. If a soldier cannot even take running up staircases, change parades, turn-outs.. and choose to adopt the short-term view that that is all part of the instructor's sadistic nature, then the future of our armed forces is bleak.<br>The phrase: tough training is the best form of welfare is very true, but it's just that many of us refuse to acknowledge it because we naturally detest it.<br>Just imagine that one day we are indeed engaged in a war. The simple act of being able to be ready in the shortest possible time due to the numerous turnouts we had during peace time, could decide whether we remain alive. Would you still complain?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To stereotype the masses, and the condition, I have this to say<br><br>First for the officers, sergants and those in command. You have learnt command and control through hardknocks.. after 10 months of grueling training in OCS, you are out to prove your worth. The world is at your knees, and you wish to command your platoon to victory... and that means, your men must follow your instruction.. but then.. wait, You might SUCK!! Not all officers suck...but perhaps you do, and your men are not dumb. They are not going to follow your instructions if you suck!! Then of course, you might not really suck. Maybe its just the welfare? Granting that nights off? Or perhaps you just need to communicate more with your man?<br><br>Now.. even if you suck, you still wish to lead your men to success.(What's the 10 months for right?) But remember this.. your men will hate u when you suck! You can't gain their respect, and later you realize realize that you have not fulfil your wish to be a good leader.. now, you are pissed. "The army ought to be tougher!!!" you said.. Of course you say that.. a leader without a chance to lead and excel and overcome (familar?)<br><br>Now you wish the army would have been a whole lot tougher, the men would have been a whole lot more obedient, and hey.. if BMT was tougher, perhaps your men will obey u even if you suck!!<br><br>And to that I say, its a vicious cycle. Sad but true. And this group of people form the &lt;siao on&gt; cohort in the army.. generally, they are the ones that think NS should be 5 years, and reservist should be a 50 years cycle.. they love the army and continue bragging about it 50 years after ORD.<br><br>..next.

            <div class='col-md body'>the men.. the privates, and the CPLs..this is another stereotyping kind of opinion. So don't shoot me.<br><br>You entered NS, and like the rest, the road ahead is filled with uncertainty.. perhaps you might just love it? Perhaps your Platoon commander might have been such an influence that you will strive for a place in OCS.. then again, maybe you might hate it. Coz punishments are never rational. irritional punishments might have been there to train you up... or maybe not. It just be because your officer had a tough day.. and hey.. what a nice anger venter you look like.<br><br>Rational or not.. there is a limit to what a human (a teen probably) can take... it didn't take long for you to pick up the impression that your officers suck. And if your officer suck, perhaps the rest suck too.. and hey, don't they all come from the same place?<br><br>And look what happened to your expectation of your career(?) in the army. From a recruit full of zest and vigor, one who wishes to be a cut above the rest, now you just wish time will pass faster, and hey.. perhaps if you downgrade, life will be easier.. and time will pass.. How about pretending to be a mashmarrow? They don't send mashmarrows to NCO course do they?<br><br>Oh yes it worked. You are posted to your unit as a men.. rifleman perhaps? Sadly, life don't get any better.. you soon realize that there are tons of people like yourself.. any discussion before bedtime is a badmouthing session about your PC and CSM..<br>and the fact that some of your superior SUCK does act to the terrible impression that this whole organization is giving u. "I hate this place!!!" you say.<br><br>Generally you are the cohort who thinks NS should be only 23 days. Reservist once every century. Sad but true...<br><br>So if you are one of those who posted here, and you do not in anyway fit into one of this 2 stereotype, chances are, either you are wierd, or have never done national service before.<br><br>Its a mutually exclusive thing. Commander and Men will never have the same perception and outlook for what's right.<br><br>Thanks for listening.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Illegal Operation (edited 09 April 2000).]</div>
