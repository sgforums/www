How much does our ministers worth if they work in private sectors? What kind of salary the govt. </strong></blockquote><br><br>Can you learn to read? Did I say about paying NSmen 83K a month? Use some common sense. Let me elaborate. If the ministers' salaries are reduced and used it to pay NSmen using the amount reduced. Would it not be better? As I have stated my stance, if we need to bribe our ministers so that they will not join the private sector or so that they will not be bribed, does it makes sense that they are really trying to serve the nation? Being in the parliament is a way of serving your country, it is not just for the pay. If a minister cannot forsake his private sector's salary, what's the point of him serving?<br><br>Being a NSmen is a way to serve our country, it is not just for the pay. Thks, its your point. If you regard salaries as bribe money, i'm also being bribed for 10yrs already. Pls don't call cops...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>How long will USD 1.5 billion reserve last?<br></strong></blockquote><br>Excuse me, you can't read? It's 150 Billion USD. In reply to your question, very long if it's used for the increment in SAF personnel salary.<br><br>oops typo error. Surely, i can read or i wouldn't be lured to your message. 150 Billion is a lot of money, isn't that Singapore's reserve for rainy days? (not a question for you but for me). My grandpa, grandma, father, mother and all my uncles, aunties must enlist to be legible for parts of these 150 Billion reserve.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If regulars pays are unattractive, no one would be stupid enough to be bonded for 6yrs or more.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Telling me 2-3K for a regular specialist is a lot? Telling me 2-6K for officers, it's a lot? Sad truth, there are always stupid people in the world, furthermore, there are people who think SAF is a good organisation but once they're in it, they realised how 'good' it really is. After you signed the bond, what to do?<br><br>I had a friend who worked as a asst. manager in OUB earning lesser than 4K per mth. Well, i'm very very lucky earning close to 10K but have to work to f**king hard to keep my job. you know time is real bad for electronics. In SAF, people are holding the unbreakble bowls. There is a big amt of gratitude (money!) regulars will receive upon their R.O.D. I wonder if that is attractive. (another question for myself)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>What kind of defence issues and threats New Zealand has to face daily?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Can't see how big a country NZ is? A defence force is still a defence force. What are the area Singapore need to defend? What are the area NZ need to defend? Dare you tell me NZ face no potential external invasion?<br><br>Who is going to attack, sabotage, invade and destroy NZ? Question to myself again. Indonesia, Australia, India, East Timor, Brunei or Malaysia. I DARE to say because I'm Ready To Strike. Oops, old habit dies hard.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Flankly, i not a supporter of PAP but I accept the fact that NO opposition parties could match or replace PAP.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>No credible opposition parties? I hear that commonly and how much do you know about opposition parties? How many opposition parties do you know there is in Singapore? Fact is? There are credible opposition parties, JBJ and his party is a good example.<br><br>HA HA HA. JBJ and WORKERS PARTY is a good example of sue and appeal. I was in Taiwan for the past few weeks. How is JBJ's case? Have to ask you, I don't know where is his office or i would like to ask him personally. Idiots never learn but to do the same thing over and over again. JBJ is a gd example.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>We have to face the fact. How many low morale personnel (with their families) could run away b4 the first shell landed on Singapore?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Good question, I won't know how many people would have fled before the first shell land in Singapore. Indeed if one left with no choice but to fight, they will fight but question is, how bravely? A highly moraled platoon would definitely do better than one without or with low morale, is that not agreeable?<br><br>You mean you have a better radar to detect shell before it was fired? Pls inform DSO, we will regard you as our savior. Low moraled man still have to fight for their survival.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Should we say that every individual has their own 'cut'. If you're meant to work in SAF only, you have to accept that fact. We are responsible for the choice we make.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>We are responsible for the choices we make, indeed that is true, however, if you are the kind who can work in SAF, they still are our countrymen, is their salary justified? It is a national issue, not just ourselves.<br><br>They can quit, don't they? (asking myself again and again).<br><br>Lastly.
