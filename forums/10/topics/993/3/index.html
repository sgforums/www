            <div class='col-md body'>It's rather interesting to read all the posting in this topic. Several people are rather aggressive while some are rather sincere in expressing their views. I have to say that none is totally wrong, but nobody is completely right either.<br><br>National Service (NS) is a very important aspect of national defence. Here, we call it Total Defence (TD) which consists of five equally important realms. These five realms constitutes activities collectively helping the nation to progress and propel beyond its present state. None of them should be seen as less important than any other. Nation building is a never-ending process. Rome was not built in a day. People need to be mobilised to render their service to build a better society.<br><br>NS is part of military defence. It is statutory that all Singaporeans have a duty to protect the nation. All physically fit persons are legally binded to serve NS.<br><br>Because of our small population, each individual is an important asset to the country. Most people need to take up multiple roles in our society.<br><br>First, we have to go through NS, which is followed by reservist to the age of 50 and 40, for officers and other ranks respectively. Here, we see men coming together for a common objective: to protect our land, our home.<br><br>Second, the reservists, which form the main body of our armed forces, are also professionals and workers, each armed with knowledge and skills, and making contributions to the society in another way, economic defence. These people, who can be seen packing buses and MRT trains every morning and evening, work for the development of the nation. Their diligent work contributes to our strong economic growth. Without them, there is no talk for a national fiber/coaxial network providing cable television and making singapore an intelligent island. There is no talk for a second terminal at Changi Airport, let alone a third. There won't be even talk for SAF scholarships and fast promotions of SAF regulars which usually accompany large pay increments.<br><br>Third, many individuals are also contributing, on their own accord, through social services. Volunteers in hospitals, old folk's homes, and even neighbourhood police posts. Social defence, is what we call it.<br><br>Fourth, there are people doing charity and welfare work. Some may also be parting some of their income for charity. These people hope to bring help and hope to the less fortunate people in our society.<br><br>The list is nevertheless not exhaustive. What we need to understand here is that at different time, we play different roles. In Singapore, everyone has enough burden to take care of himself, his family, the society and nation. We, as fellow citizens, have responsibilities towards ourselves and the society. We need mutual SUPPORT of each other, in all aspects of TD. To acheive it, we must have mutual RESPECT for each other.<br><br>In peace,<br>Frankie.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All the torture nd "tekhan"? It's actually part and parcel of BMT. You going SISPEC or OCS lah gee worst.<br><br>But after you post to unit, life's pretty much better. Unit sergeants and officers are more friendly and most won't "tekhan" you. Some are even "ar kah liao" with you or will go chiong with you went book out. These are the commanders that you'll be fighting with during a war. (Unless you kanna those weird saddist that play "BMT" then dun say lah.)<br><br>As I read maybe some got bad experience in NS then what can I say...so big organization you cannot satisfy everyone.<br><br>I got some friend hate NS like hell cause it disrupt their personal life or they got tekhan. Some of my friend don't find NS  as bad. I also fall under this catergory.<br><br>Yah lah I also got up and down in NS, tekhan, stress and stuff. But after you ORD you think back you will miss those guys you slept with, joking with, play with, chiong with, chao keng with, and kanna tekhan together by saddist.<br><br>Up to now I still hate MY CSM and ex-PC but I had many good times with the rest. Dun think I must be from LOBO unit, frigging shiong Armour Unit lah. everyday chiong and going Australia 2 time some more. Barrack like shit and dusty. service M113 until siao! But it's the pple that make NS life interesting. You go LOBO unit but no sense of belonging maybe will feel even worst and hate NS even more. (Dunno lah I guess one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br><br>---------------------------<br><br>I read from some where got one say he rather say with his family to fight off the enemy if got war. Oi! You oi Tah Han Leh? See you parents killed and you sibling rape and torture. F3$K man, if me I WON'T even let them touch them!! I WON'T even let them see my family!!!! I WON'T even let them land in singapore!!!<br><br>NS got give you gun leh!!! It may just be a simple M16S1 or SAR21, all the IA, but these weapons are still better than your kitchen chopper or other stuff lah!<br><br>You imagine you stay in your house then you heard alot of shooting and people scream. Not just scream leh...is like those yells you heard in stadium, except that it's all crieds and women screams. You can tah Han leh!<br><br>I saw a HK movie about some Japanese Naking Rape, the whole show echo with women's scream.......disturbing and this make you think alot.....what if one day s'pore like that? except all te scream is from your parents/friends/girlfriend/wife/kids/etc.....<br><br>okay I talk to much ;p Hope I'm talk sense.<br><br>BTW: I not a pro PAP.....dun mix up the govt and the defence of S'pore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we are having so many positive comment for NS. why don we make NS voluntary? Then those who like NS can serve the SAF for as long as they want. I am sure people like LittleMan, LittleMan Supporter, Altrex, Altrex Supporter etc etc will join the NS for another round. They can do as many push up, run over many mountain and still feel proud of themselve being fit while those anti-SAF personnel can go on to contribute to the economic of singapore instead wasting their time around. Economic defence is also very important or else where do we get all the $$$ for the SAF suck on? And wouldn't resource be spent on advance weapon and training regular army more effective than forcing low morale NSmen to do NS hindering our economic?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can't imagine what our 'enemies' would do if we don't serve NS due to low morale. Could Singapore be another Kuwait? Likely. Perhaps men from Commandos, Guards, Armour and Arty understand the needs of NS better. These units are constantly brifed on the lastest development especially threats from Malaysia or Indonesia. My ex-OC gived us a good ex. of the pre-u girl who got raped by five Malaysian in Changi. Imagine that happening to your gf or sister. Btw boys and men are not safe too, sodomizing is the trend of Malaysian. These maggots must be warned of our abilities of defending ourselves,  ensuring a safe place for investment. I can't see how our economy can flourish let only with thousands of 'anti-SAF' personnel on the streets looking for jobs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by hardware:<br>I can't see how our economy can flourish let only with thousands of 'anti-SAF' personnel on the streets looking for jobs.[/B]</blockquote>why are we getting so many foreigner to work in singapore? why should our youth be indulged in NS taking away 2.5 years of their precious time? We have malaysian youth already building their career in singapore while our youth is still running over mountain. How do you feel when employer ask you whether you need to go back to reservist training.<br><br>Yes, the maximum number of days the SAF can call us back for ICT/reservist training is only 40 days. However, compared this to the normal 14 days of leave that a employee in singapore can take, the company will suffer loss. How would the company feel for a SINGAPOREAN employee who have to be frequently called up for ICT/reservist for 40 days leaving more urgent and important jobs undone. No wonder, some employers have to question singaporean whether they need to go back for reservist during job interview. And no wonder, more and more foreigner or PR are being employed while the singaporean are left out in the cold. If i am the employer, i will defintely employ an equally skilled PR rather than a singaporean who need to leave a project frequently for training for the company's sake. Maybe we should be asking ourselves question "Why be a singaporean?" refer to article from <a href="http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Ds/220201d.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Ds/220201d.html</a>  Why are we subjected to so much disadvantage?<br><br>Below is an interesting article that you might want to take note <a href="http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Ds/190101.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Ds/190101.html</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 13 March 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think with only 35000 of SAF regulars and police could deter the aggression shown to us by Malaysia and Indonesia. High tech equipment and weaponary need people to operate. As a matter of fact most high tech equipments are manned by regulars. eg. RSAF and RSN. The Army need NSmen to fill the gap of need in infantry, armour, signal, combat engineer and so on. SAF is the most well organised and trained armed force in this region. All Nsman had contributed and sacrified to a certain extend. Will trained (low morale) Nsmen just sit on their ass waiting to be bombed? Or will they rather return shell for shell. These low moraled men will still fight for their lifes atleast they know how thanks to SAF. Our neighbours are hungry and jealous of our wealth. Only SAF could stand in their way.<br><br>2.5 yrs is just nice for commanders to finish their courses in the first yr and led their man in units for 1.5yrs.<br><br>Have more babies, thats a solution for your corcern  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I agreed that the allowance is too low. Well, I'm a half paid commando for 2.5yrs. What to do? Can the govt. afford to pay us regulars salary?<br><br>Female enlistees, never... girls will protest.<br></div>

I don't wish to see my kid who might be send to NS to waste his 2.5 years rendering cheap labour for SAF which i had gone through. that's defintely not my wish. he could had already gotten a degree or master by then, building his career path in the real world instead of stepping out into real world 2.5 years late. Whether is it eye opening or not, it will still be useless in the real world when you step out late. late entrance to real world, late career, late marriage all these are related to NS.<br><br>if you like your kids to go through that wasted 2.5 years of time to do cheap labour for SAF, go ahead. that's why i suggest NS should be voluntary.<br><br>*we all have different point of view and different hope, its understandable of course. but primary to all our hope and wishes, there is a fundamental desire, that is to see that our children grow up in peace, prosperity, progress and free. since only SAF can provide that, i can only say your desire to see a strong SAF is equal to mine, unless you wish to see your children blown up by mines and air raids like in vietnam and cambodia. but then, maybe its better to see your sons and daughters or even GF get blown to pieces, eat rotten food, being bullied by enemy soldier or die before your eyes then waste 2.5 years of your precious freedom. i wonder if the worst nightmare comes, will your love ones, sons, daughters, wifes and parents thank you for their suffering or will they lament about some good for nothing dickhead who is so selfish that he rather see everyone suffer then going through NS.</div>

Use some common sense. Let me elaborate. If the ministers' salaries are reduced and used it to pay NSmen using the amount reduced. Would it not be better? As I have stated my stance, if we need to bribe our ministers so that they will not join the private sector or so that they will not be bribed, does it makes sense that they are really trying to serve the nation?

I'm no fan of tekaning, especially if it's senseless and some superiors actually get a kick out of doing that.<br><br>However, the new batches of officers "not as hard and unbending"? i venture to think they are total softies! But as with changing times and trainers, subsequent batches will always fall short of the expectations of previous batches: less tekaning, training standards drop, more revised TSR that ultimately makes it a pretty safe.<br><br>I think some changes should be revised inside the school training standards and actions during field trainings should not be "going through the motion".
