            <div class='col-md body'>It's a scary thing, to br sure. Believe me, I was there and it wasn't even WORTH debating if you were there too. Every day, I woke up, asking myself the same question: Why the hell am I still alive? What am I doing here? WHY? WHY? WHYWHYWHY? I am a strong believer of real peace--not the peace all governments promote by setting up Armies to threaten each other. THAT is merely a "keep at bay by means of violence" method. I do not believe in it. I don't have to go into the topic of the utilisation of time since, although we all know that politics leave no questions for the free mind, we can sure use the 2-2and a half years for self-enrichment, working etc.. The one thing I can't understand is that--why do we have to be treated like that? We are living, breathing, thinking individuals like all of the officers and sergeants. Why must we be at their mercy, at their beck and call, and be punished for the slightest things? Why camn't we go through a more Humane training in the course of BMT? The officers are almost allways sadistic. They see pain in our eyes and they can actually smile and torture us relentlessly. Imagine running down 4-storeys with 50+ sweating, flustered men in 20seconds. Undo-able? Precisely. They use that as an excuse to extend their authority and power. The sight of the sadistic joy and the childish gleam of the joy of abusing power I see in their eyes sickens me to the core. I don't relish serving NS. Indeed, I think most don't. But the sgts. amd officers can opt to vent their anger on us. We, unlike them, are like playthings. When you go through the process, your mind stops. It stops to think, because it knows that there is no amswer to the problem. I know. I spent 2 months forgetting the nightmare and another 1 month getting my brains to work. Even today I still get nightmares of the ordeal. No one can TELL you the process and expect anyone to understand. But at least, respect us as humans, PLEASE!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm thinking that little man is either a higher ranking NSman or not even enlisted. The punishment given is never "Welfare". What you call welfare, I call torture. If that's the kind of treatment you'll give to humans, think of it given to YOU daily, if you were a "MAN" like us. I ask you--WHAT in this world is more precious than human life? You wanna talk about political ideals? I have my own ideals--do I ask people to die for what I believe in? No. But hte govt does--because they've got the authority. ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY. That is the basic principle. Singapore isn't a democratic state--it's communist! The people have no power--can't you see? It's only the illusion of power that keeps people from revolting. THAT, and the punishment system. Look what happened to the "banished" guy. I'm thinking no one would be accusing the PAP in a looooooong time, because of that. It's like the Jap occupation--cut people's head off and hang outside the house to serve as reminder and disincentive. More simply, it's to scare you off. Boo! I'll tell you about war. Politicains make their own ideas, call people of their country to die for them,a nd they fly off to miami sucking on coconut drinks, whilst we stay in the country, screaming "CHARGE~~~~~!!!" and rush on bravely, and stop not even when you see a comrade or even a relative you know being impaled by bayonets and bullets. Think they enemy is to blame? Think again. THEY too, are fighting for their beliefs. They, too, are fighting for someone else's beliefs. They , too, are dying for the beliefs. Don't you have any of your own ideals, little man? Don't you wish it'd all go away? I do not wish to see my brother die beside me. I do not want to be tortured by the very people who not be in the battles I fight. The worst torturers are the worst cowards. Think for yourself, and ACT for yourself. All the crap about loyalty to the country was formed by politicians like Hitler and likes to call upon people to die for their cause. It's enough to make me sick.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree to Littleman's comments, well most of it actually, no single officer in the armed forces will actually ask someone to die, that would be ridiculous, but I'm sure that is not what he meant.<br>Anyway, all these talks about torture, what are you all referring to as torture? Waking up 5am in the morning? Route marches? Section or jungle training? Stand-bys? Footdrills? or even the 20 push-ups which seem never ending?</div>

No officer is stupid enuff to do that without any reasons.

            <div class='col-md body'>c'mon Adrian, u're not enlisted yet unless I'm wrong so what do you know of the interesting NS punishments? Stories? nothing beats doing the real thing as i'm sure others will agree.<br><br>and yes yuu_kajima, what do u mean by torture? running down 4 storeys and doing it again and again cos u failed to make the timing? c'mon, can anyone out there who has served before tell me if they haven't done that and actually think that's a torture?<br><br>if u're still in BMT, i can safely tell u that u're at the very tip of the iceberg and generally BMT instructors are VERY nice. Most instructors in any training sch (by now), will train you hard, but in a reasonable manner.<br><br>do u know that in my BMT, there was a famous incident just after parent's visiting that resulted in the OC being charged (at least he was rumoured to be charged). in any case, he was removed from his post. this is the result when u "torture" recruits. pls...with all you soft complain kings, who dares to "torture" any of you now?<br><br>Littleman is right. Basically u need DISCLIPLINE. the hallmark of a armed forces. and adrian, the govt cannot tell you to go and die, that much is true. the constitution can. when u finally get enlisted, pls pay more attention to the words in the SAF pledge and if u ever make OCS, study yr military law a bit more. u'll find that yr officers have every single right to ask u to charge and possibly die simply because the nation demands it and the President gives yr officer the right to order it.<br><br>and yes, yuu_kajima, war is a tough thing. probably the worse part is what it does to you psychologically. there are tons of Vietnam war stories abt new conscipts unable to take the mental pressure and the psychological demands. if you can't even handle a little pressure of making a fall-in timing, i despair for you.<br><br>try to buck up. 2.5 yrs is a short time, u'll realise when u leave the service, but it can be very long too, if you have poor attitude. same advice to adrian<br><br>generally, the new batches of officers and specs are not as hard and unbending as last time. are you in any way a lesser man than the rest of us? i'm sure u're not. if you can't take a bit of hardness, u'll learn that you won't be able to achieve anything in this world, even outside the military context.</div>

In peace time, we can sit down and discuss, we have plenty of time, in war times, we don't !

If the reforcement is 1 minute late, your buddies may have all been killed before you arrive.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Think for yourself, and ACT for yourself.<br></strong></blockquote>this really worries me, if every individual has such mentality, we are doomed.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>All the crap about loyalty to the country was formed by politicians like Hitler and likes to call upon people to die for their cause.<br></strong></blockquote>so you are marking all war-times heros as idiots. Now, I seldom call people names in this forum, but i shall let you be an exception -- you are hideous.<br><br>You put your self-interest above everything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>encore LittleMan! I salute you.<br><br>Indeed, when you leave the service, many guys are bonded through common experience.<br><br>I have a few close friends whom I've only spent a mere 10 weeks in NS with. We went through bad times, encouraging each other, and made it through by supporting each other. I know that in bad times, they will always support me and we will go through thick and thin together. Besides willing to die with them, I know that in the crunch they will not willingly let me down.<br><br>It's the trust. Forged through common experience.<br><br>Yuu_kajima, if you're still in BMT, u had better pray that u don't go to units like 1 Guards or 3 Guards. Many of the OCs there are tough Guards officers. They wouldn't like your kind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not all training in BMT are siong, violence and inhuman. If you are lucky to get into some welfare company in BMTC School, or any whitehorse in your company. You can start to enjoy your BMT to fullest. Believe me, the welfare can be super welfare. I am one of those lucky batch to enlist in the most welfare company in BMTC School 2 few years ago. During that time, every company in BMTC School 2 knows how welfare my company is. Now the company had moved to Tekong, I do not know their welfare standard now.<br><br>Of course I also saw some company who little welfare is given to recuit, tekan them everyday. Get scolding everyday. Not treated like human at all.<br><br>It all depend on your luck. Which type of company you posted to.<br>Wish good luck to all who have not enlist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one more thing, yuu_kajima, yr officers have been through probably every single thing they asked u to do and a lot more.<br><br>so have the PTIs if u're crying abt them. PTIs do FBO SOC. once, i met this bunch of PTI trainees doing FBO SOC training in Pasir Laba Camp. looking at them, i really wonder how they could take it. they have my respect coz they earned it. i never looked at PTIs the same way again since that day.<br><br>by the way, yr officers are trained to do whatever they can to keep you alive. they have a responsibility to yr parents, gf, whatever, for yr welfare (REAL welfare, not "how to be a soft kid")<br><br>they answer for yr training, morale and discipline. pls respect them a bit more</div>

Waking up 5am in the morning? Route marches? Section or jungle training? Stand-bys? Footdrills? or even the 20 push-ups which seem never ending?</div></blockquote>Well, 20? More like 100 or more, yes. All that, and the danger of going to OCS and SPEC even if you don't wanna go. Well, at least, to me, it is tough, because I'm not the sort to exercise regularly, although I'm a school player. The life, though, takes quite a while to adapt to. I had many guys suffering nervous breakdowns in the first week of PTP. Did you go for PTP? Our total BMT was 4 months because of that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LittleMan:</div><div class="quote_body"> "Asking you to die" is an analogy. No officer is stupid enuff to do that without any reasons. But if your officer commands you to carry explosives on your body and charge into a enemy territory so that you can blast them to death (and at the same time die together), you will have to do it. No questions asked.<br><br>In the Army, command is everything.<br><br>In times of war, what is law ? The military command is law. You think you will be charged for spitting and littering during war times ?<br><br>Didn't you heard of the saying "Jun(1) Ling(4) Ru(2) Shan(1)" ?<br><br></div></blockquote>I-Don't-think-any officer would command like that. But, remember the officers are only the pawns in the military chessboard, like us. They recieve commands from higher authority. So, like I said, the training and dying is all fine, But WHY? Tell me honestly--WHY? Do you think it's worth dying for a piece of land? I'd much rather be beside my family, fighting away intruders, so that even if I die, at least I die with my family, in my home.</div>

But somehow I don't think the commandos and guards and MPs want sympathy. But I give it to them, not sympathy, but respect. It takes a lot to go through all that and still stay sane and same as before they went in. But self-questionning--that is the biggest barrier any soldier has to go through. That's what's happening here. Most people can't kill a living person without feeling guilty--it's part of it. And that brings to mind--if you can't kill, why go through training to kill?</div>
