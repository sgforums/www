              				gov't butt of jokes after prison escape</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Terrorism
              				is usually no laughing matter, especially not in
              				security-conscious Singapore, but the escape from custody of a
              				limping Islamist extremist suspect has led to scorn on the
              				Internet.<br><br>Barbed jokes and irreverent spoofs have sprouted
              				up on websites five days after Mas Selamat bin Kastari, the
              				alleged Singapore chief of regional terror group Jemaah
              				Islamiyah, escaped with apparent ease from a detention
              				centre.<br><br>"Toilet Break, based on a true story starring
              				Mas Selamat Kastari," read a mock post on one wesbite by a
              				blogger inspired by the hit US television drama "Prison
              				Break".<br><br>Blogger Philip Chua wrote: "Singapore
              				has now dropped the ball big time and really is an international
              				laughing stock."<br><br>"You don't see prisoners
              				escaping from terrorist detention centres in the West or
              				Guantanamo. More so a leader of the terrorist network in the
              				country next to you!"<br><br>Kastari, who was arrested in
              				neighbouring Indonesia in 2006 and turned over to Singapore,
              				remained at large Monday and officials said he was likely to be
              				still hiding in this multiracial island republic of 4.7 million
              				people.<br><br>Accused of plotting to hijack a plane in order to
              				crash it into Singapore's Changi airport in 2001, Kastari managed
              				to escape after asking to go to the toilet during a family visit,
              				security officials said.<br><br>Direct criticism of the
              				government is rare in the mainstream media, forcing dissatisfied
              				Singaporeans to resort to the Internet to express their
              				views.<br><br>Teoh Khengze, a Singapore-based author and
              				journalist, wrote on his blog that the circumstances of what he
              				called "The Great Singapore Escape" were "as
              				incredulous as the escape is audacious."<br><br>Talkingcock.com,
              				a popular satirical site, said Kastari's escape underlined the
              				need to give cabinet ministers another salary hike even though
              				they were already among the highest-paid in the world.<br><br>"We
              				need to equip our Mini-stars with everything they can to deal
              				with this crisis... and as we know in Singapore, public service
              				and legislative influence are all not sufficient incentives,"
              				it said.<br><br>"Only the highest salaries in the world will
              				do," the humour site said.<br><br>It showed 13 doctored
              				photographs of Kastari in various possible disguises - in a
              				blonde woman's wig, a 1960s-style Afro hairdo and aviator
              				sunglasses, a handlebar moustache and a beard and turban in Osama
              				bin Laden style.<br><br>A popular Singaporean blogger who has
              				previously irked the government with attacks on high living costs
              				said the city-state need not worry about losing cabinet
              				ministers.<br><br>"They won't be asked to resign or even
              				take a pay cut," wrote the blogger known as Mr. Brown.<br><br>"We
              				are not like those free-wheeling and chaotic governments from
              				Western democracies that make their leaders accountable for every
              				little thing.</p>
