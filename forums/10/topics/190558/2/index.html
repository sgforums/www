            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia I see is progressing despite being slow . They do take care of their non muslim citizens but just not as well as Singapore is. Several years back , I met a few malaysian scholars who are non muslim - their ambassador actually MAKES THE TIME TO  see them get prizes in one of the group 8 Australian Universities for being in the top rank- ours did not even bother despite the major takers were Singaporeans - NOT EVEN A SINGLE OFFICIAL FROM SINGAPOREAN EMBASSY . Despite that , the malaysian representative told us singaporeans maybe our ambassador was busy but they are always proud to see Singaporeans do well too because we are all neighbours. They never said a single thing about how great Malaysia is ...they said we are happy you are doing well too . This impressed me alot more than a bunch of Singaporeans laughing arrogantly at our neighbour.<br><br>Singapore is stuck and outsourcing jobs to foreigners.<br><br>Which is worse? First world no progress or developing nation with a progressive move towards the right direction? Make fun of Malaysia if you must but I think malaysia is progressing very well and Singapore is stagnant .</div>

However, they must relook at their development planning so that they wouldn't waste public money on unnecessary infrastructures.<br><br>I would even advise them to consider paying their civil servants handsomely so that they will be like us.  Besides that, the home breeded talents will have to considered contributing to their nation development if they really love their nation.<br><br>Currently, I am seeing many short-slighted talents who left their country in search of better personal interest only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Malaysia government will definitely wanted to think again whether they wanted to breed these group of talent whose wasted their effort for so many years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> This will help to encourage those who loved their nation to give more when asked for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it'd take 50+ years for them.<br><br>and i definitely hope not to use money as a lure for their leaders.<br><br>or they will end up like us, and malaysia being so big.. is not a pretty sight when things go wrong.. and their problems will definitely spill over since we are so closely related.</div>
