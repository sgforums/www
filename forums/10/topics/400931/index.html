              <h1 class="Headline">Coca-Cola's murderous record of anti-union activity
               in Colombia exposed</h1>
              <p>Saturday, May 22, 2010 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028844_Coca-Cola_Colombia.html">http://www.naturalnews.com/028844_Coca-Cola_Colombia.html</a></p>
              <p>(NaturalNews) Coca-Cola: to many, it is simply the all-American cola 
              that everyone grew up drinking. Originally created in the late 1800s as a
               medicine, Coca-Cola eventually evolved into one of the world's most 
              popular soft drinks. Besides being a very unhealthy beverage, Coca-Cola 
              has another dirty secret for which few people are aware; the Coca-Cola 
              Company has been involved in a series of kidnappings involving union 
              leaders and organizers at its Colombia bottling facilities. Many of 
              those kidnapped have been severely tortured and even murdered by company
               thugs.<br><br>As shocking and unbelievable as all of this sounds, there
               is a trail of documented evidence against Coca-Cola for its crimes 
              against union officials. In fact, back in 2001, the United Steelworkers 
              of America and the International Labor Rights Fund, filed a joint 
              lawsuit on behalf of SINALTRAINAL to address the problems in Colombia.<br><br>Javier
               Correa, President of the National Union of Food Industry Workers, and 
              William Mendoza, President of the Barrancabermeja location in Colombia, 
              have joined together with Ray Rogers, Director of the Campaign to Stop 
              Killer Coke, to bring light to the issue and push for an end to the 
              atrocities.<br><br><strong>How did it all start?</strong><br>Most
               people recognize that unions are formed to protect workers from unfair 
              treatment and abuse by employers. Though some do not operate as 
              intended, the general idea of unions is to ensure that workers are 
              receiving fair pay for their labor and that they are not being grossly 
              extorted by those for whom they work.<br><br>U.S. laws have been 
              designed to protect American workers who form labor unions from being 
              threatened or silenced by the companies for whom they work, and while 
              they are not perfect, their intent was for the best interests of 
              American workers.<br><br>When workers at Coca-Cola bottling plants in 
              Colombia began to step up and organize unions, the Coca-Cola Company 
              allegedly began to contract with paramilitary security forces to deal 
              with leaders and organizers, something they would not legally be able to
               do in the U.S. Even today, these forces are using extreme tactics to 
              silence anyone who would dare attempt to organize workers to form a 
              union. These tactics include violent detention efforts, torture and even
               murder.<br><br>Internal Pentagon records that were eventually required 
              to be made public revealed that Colombian troops connected with 
              Coca-Cola's paramilitary forces were also being trained at the U.S. 
              Army's School of the Americas (SOA) in Fort Benning, Georgia, to torture
               and murder those who conduct "union organizing and recruiting", 
              distribute "propaganda in favor of workers", and "sympathize with 
              demonstrators or strikes."<br><br><strong>Is this an isolated incident?</strong><br>This
               is not the first time, or the first country, in which Coca-Cola has 
              been responsible for severe human rights abuses. Back in the 1970s and 
              1980s, the company was responsible for similar behavior in Guatemala, 
              where eight workers in Guatemala City were murdered or otherwise killed 
              for trying to keep their union alive.<br><br>Thanks to massive 
              international protests against Coca-Cola following campaigns that 
              brought the truth to light, the multi-national giant was forced to 
              concede and the Guatemalan union survived. But at the time, even the 
              government of Guatemala was unwilling to address the issue; it took the 
              efforts of concerned citizens around the world to win the battle against
               Coca-Cola and achieve some sort of justice.<br><br>The Coca-Cola 
              Company has also been accused of similar human rights abuses in other 
              countries today, including in developing countries like India and China 
              where it has plants. Because the company is so large and powerful, it 
              exerts considerable sway on governments worldwide that turn a blind eye 
              to its abuses.<br><br><strong>What is being done to stop Coca-Cola?</strong><br>The
               Campaign to Stop Killer Coke has been working for years to bring 
              awareness of these atrocities to light, but unfortunately not much has 
              been resolved in Colombia. And the fact that certain sensitive documents
               reveal that the U.S. government is playing a  role in protecting 
              Coca-Cola adds fuel to the fire. Fortunately, the campaign has been able
               to successfully initiate some positive steps towards ending Coca-Cola's
               Colombian tyranny.<br><br>In 2006, the University of Michigan, New York
               University, and a handful of other colleges and universities in North 
              American and Europe cut ties with Coca-Cola because the company would 
              not agree to an independent, third-party audit of its human rights, 
              labor and environmental abuses in both Colombia and India.<br><br>Also 
              in 2006, as the World Cup was coming to London with Coca-Cola as one of 
              its primary sponsors, "War on Want" issued a report detailing some of 
              Coca-Cola's abuses around the world. These included:<br><br>-Massive 
              drilling efforts in India that exhausted local water supplies and wells,
               leaving Indian farmers with no water to irrigate their crops.<br><br>-Ecosystem
               contamination in El Salvador and India due to plant waste discharge.<br><br>-The
               human rights abuses taking place in Colombia, as well as in Pakistan, 
              Turkey, Russia, Peru, Chile, Guatemala and Nicaragua.<br><br>Demonstrators
               obstructed the torch relay at the 2006 winter Olympics, exposing many 
              to the truth about Coca-Cola, and held protests at the 2010 winter 
              Olympics in Vancouver as well. Since Coca-Cola is the exclusive 
              non-alcoholic beverage provider to the Olympic Games through 2020, the 
              Games are a primary target for demonstrators.<br><br><strong>The 
              Coca-Cola Case, a new documentary</strong><br>A new documentary 
              called <em>The Coca-Cola Case</em>, which highlights the human rights 
              abuses of the Coca-Cola company, was recently screened in a few Canadian
               theaters. Hundreds of people, including many students, viewed the movie
               which, hopefully will make its way into the U.S.<br><br>Directed by 
              German Gutierrez and Carmen Garcia, the film tracks labor-rights lawyers
               Daniel Kovalik and Terry Collingworth, as well as Ray Rogers from the 
              Campaign to Stop Killer Coke, in their efforts to hold the Coca-Cola 
              company accountable for its atrocities. Part of the film highlights the 
              2001 lawsuit hinged upon the Alien Tort Claims Act, which allows 
              foreigners to sue American companies in American courts for violating 
              "the law of nations or a treaty of the United States."<br><br>This film 
              has the potential to ignite a firestorm of pressure against the 
              Coca-Cola Company and force the company to change its ways.<br><br><strong>The
               Campaign to Stop Killer Coke resources</strong><br>The Campaign
               to Stop Killer Coke also has a variety of useful resources on its 
              website, including informational flyers, articles and special reports. 
              The group also issues a periodic newsletter to keep interested parties 
              aware of current events that pertain to campaign efforts.<br><br>The 
              Campaign's offensive tactics against Coca-Cola are having an impact. 
              Considering that Coca-Cola is one of the most powerful multi-national 
              corporations in the world, it is impressive that numerous institutions 
              of higher learning have already banned Coca-Cola products, and many more
               are taking steps to ban them as well. As awareness continues to 
              increase, a point of critical mass will be achieved for which Coca-Cola 
              will have to acknowledge and address the issue.<br><br>It is also 
              important to note that the Coca-Cola Company owns <a href="http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/brands/product_list_y.html">numerous
               other beverage brands</a>, including the healthy juice brand, Odwalla.<br><br>To

              <p>I am not sure if you can compared Unions in the States vs Singapore....</p>
              <p>I think Union in Singapore do too little and completely useless in advancing labors right, work place discrimination, safety and wages....</p>
              <p>but i also think union member in the US had over stretched and over reach that their pay to be considering advancing labors right. Example the American Railroad workers, Longshore Union workers and Auto union workers.</p>
              <p>That get paid decently well and i mean "WELL" Longshore union workers get paid as high as  80,000 a year including overtime.</p>

              <p>So we should get rid of every Jew on the planet?</p>
              <p>Just as with every race, there are rich and powerful people able to unfluence global events, there are also those at the bottom of the social hierarchy. It is too shallow to blame all the world's woes on a race. Hitler tried that.</p>
              <p>Even if rich Jews controlled the direction of our society, do you think their poorer and worse-off counterparts are in it too?</p>
