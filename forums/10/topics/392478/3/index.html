              <p>PAP MPs attack Low Thia Kiang for his call on govt to scrap foreign worker levy</p>
              <p><strong>TR</strong></p>
              <p>Workers’ MP Low Thia Kiang shed his inhibition and went for the juggernaut during a parliamentary session yesterday with harsh criticisms of the ruling party’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies which have brought untold hardships and sufferings among ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Contrary to what was said by Finance Minister Tharman in his Budget speech earlier that the wages of Singapore workers have grown over the last few years, Mr Low felt that the low-wage earners are left behind:</p>
              <p><em>“When the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) has to be revised upward and the qualifying monthly income limit increased to $1,700 to ensure low-wage earners are not left behind in our foreigner-dependent economy, doesn’t that raise an alarm in the Government about the meagre salary our low-wage workers are getting? ‘The growth strategy… for the past 10 years has definitely not made these Singaporean workers feel any sense of progress with the nation,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>He blamed the government for opening the floodgates to foreign workers which provides few incentives for companies to boost their productivity:</p>
              <p><em>“It is easy to blame our local workforce for low productivity but who opened the gates to allow foreign workers to flood the labour market in the first place? Easy access to cheap foreign labour offers little incentive for companies to up their productivity… The Government has to assume some responsibility for the low productivity in the last decade”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal, the relentless influx of foreign workers has depressed the wages of Singapore workers, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now made up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 percent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>Mr Low also urged the PAP to take ‘bold step’ to scrap the foreign workers levy completely and use the dependency ratio to manage the growth of foreign workers in Singapore.</p>
              <p><em>“Based on reports that there are about 856,000 work permit holders in Singapore as at December – excluding the 196,000 domestic helpers -  a $10 to $30 monthly increase in levy would bring in an additional $79 million to $238 million per year for the Government. And using the low end of the work permit levy, which is $150 a month, the Government is taking in about $1.2 billion a year from this payment,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Low opined that the hike in foreign worker levy will not affect large companies and “‘this whole exercise could just end up fattening the Government’s coffer with little results to show in controlling the ever-expanding foreign workforce.”</p>
              <p>As expected, Mr Low’s comments brought a barrage of criticisms from the PAP MPs who dominate parliament.</p>
              <p>Ms Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) claimed that foreign workers will be cheaper without the levies:</p>
              <p><em>“Without the levies, foreign workers are even cheaper and even more attractive to businesses. And some of these businesses will find loopholes to get round the quotas, to get more of the cheaper foreign workers,”</em> she said.</p>
              <p>However, she ignored the fact that Mr Low had already suggested refining the dependency ratio to control the inflow of foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Ms Irene Ng (Tampines GRC) added that “any move to tighten the dependency ratio as a way to raise workers’ wages could also lead to higher cost of living for consumers.”</p>
              <p>She forgot that there is a limit to which companies can raise the prices without losing their clients. At the end of the day, the onus is on them to find ways to boost productivity while keeping prices low at the same time.</p>
              <p>It is evident that the PAP’s growth strategy for the past few years has disastrous consequences for the low income earners in Singapore whose wages had remained stagnant. In fact, Singapore now has the largest income gap between the rich and the poor among the thirty most developed economies after Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>With no opposition in parliament to check on the PAP, Singaporeans will have little choice but to be led by them through the noses like a flock of “sheep”.</p>

              <p><strong>SM Goh promised to increase Singaporeans’ income by 3
              per cent when his own salary is expected to grow by 8.8 per cent in
              2010</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong made a bold promise to
              Singaporeans that their income are expected to grow for the next
              ten years if the government is successful in “transforming”
              Singapore’s economy via the measures as outlined in the Budget.</p>
              <p><em>“If we can transform the economy through the measures in
              this Budget, the income which you have today can continue to
              increase 2 to 3 per cent per year over the next 10 years. This is
              where the Budget helps you, even though you don’t see it,”</em> he
              claimed without substantiating them.</p>
              <p>SM Goh was talking to a crowd of about 100 people during a
              dialogue session at Marine Parade who appeared to be disinterested
              in an earlier presentation by an official from the Finance
              Ministry.</p>
              <p>This year’s Budget offered few goodies to Singaporeans with its
              emphasis on boosting Singapore’s productivity rates and reducing
              its perennial dependence on foreign workers.</p>
              <p><em>“When I read comments that the Bud-get has got nothing for
              me as a person, rather than a few of the allowances and so on, they
              are wrong. This Budget is for you. This is about how we can
              increase productivity of the economy as a whole – you as workers,
              the company as a production institution, management as people in
              charge,”</em> SM Goh was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>His stance echoed that of DPM Teo Chee Hean who said a few days
              ago that Singapore needs to renew and re-double its efforts in
              productivity to move the economy forward and to create “good jobs”
              for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s productivity rate has plummeted consecutively for
              the last three years due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration
              and pro-foreigner labor policies:</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/laborft585.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="350"></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Kojakbt, 3in1kopitiam forum
              moderator]</strong></p>
              <p>This coincided with the beginning of Prime Minister Lee Hsien
              Loong’s tenure when he announced his ambitious plan to increase
              Singapore’s population to 6.5 million people by 2030 via
              immigration.</p>
              <p>According to a press release by the Reform Party last week,
              Singapore’s labor productivity lags far behind that of other
              advanced economies:</p>
              <p><em>“In manufacturing alone our productivity grew by an average
              of 0.7% p.a. over the period 2000-08 whereas South Korea, Taiwan,
              Sweden and the US managed 7.4%, 5.2%, 4.8% and 4.6% respectively
              over the same period. Out of a group of 17 economies we were second
              from bottom.”</em></p>
              <p>[Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/2010/02/26/reform-party-a-complacent-budget/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Reform
              Party</span></a>]</p>
              <p>SM Goh also added that “Singapore can no longer grow simply on
              the basis of adding foreign workers to the labor force” which seems
              to contradict his earlier statement that there is no “sudden
              U-turn” in the ruling party’s policies and that the number of
              foreigners may still increase in the next few years.</p>
              <p>The ruling party is appearing to lose its cool lately and has
              been pussyfooting and backtracking on a number of their policies to
              placate angry voters ahead of the next general election which they
              are expected to lose a few more seats including GRCs.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should take the latest “promise” by SM Goh with a
              heavy dose of salt. The median salary of Singaporeans has remained
              stagnant at $2,600 for the last 10 years and the income gap between
              the rich and poor has widen considerably during the same period
              thanks to the relentless influx of foreigners who help depressed
              the wages of local workers.</p>
              <p>During his tenure as Singapore’s Prime Minister in the 1990s, SM
              Goh promised Singaporeans that they would enjoy “Swiss standard of
              living” in a decade’s time. According to a UBS report last year,
              Singaporeans have a standard of living comparable to Russia than
              Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Even before we know if SM Goh’s “forecast” will come true, his
              own astronomical salary in excess of $3 million dollars a year is
              expected to be increased by a massive 8.8 per cent this year. With
              Singapore’s GDP growing again, the PAP leaders can expect “more
              good years” ahead of them.</p>

              <p>"Ms Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) claimed that foreign
                                                  workers will be cheaper without the levies:</p>
              <p><em>“Without the levies, foreign workers are even cheaper and
                                                  even more attractive to businesses. And some of these businesses
                                                  will find loopholes to get round the quotas, to get more of the
                                                  cheaper foreign workers,”</em> she said.</p>
              <p>However, she ignored the fact that Mr Low had already suggested
                                                  refining the dependency ratio to control the inflow of foreign
                                                  workers.</p>
              <p>Ms Irene Ng (Tampines GRC) added that “any move to tighten the
                                                  dependency ratio as a way to raise workers’ wages could also lead
                                                  to higher cost of living for consumers.”</p>
              <p>She forgot that there is a limit to which companies can raise
                                                  the prices without losing their clients. At the end of the day, the
                                                  onus is on them to find ways to boost productivity while keeping
                                                  prices low at the same time."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Tsk tsk tsk.... so ashamed by these two ladies. Bunch of airheads.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Ms Josephine Teo, guilty of selective listening. Donno how to look at big pictures. What narrow mindedness....very disappointed in her.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Ms Irene Ng, guilty of ELITISM. Ya lah.. higher cost of living .. so their big salary cannot buy more GUCCI bags lah.. But the lower income already NO JOB NO MONEY... CURRENT cos of living already headache liao......tell her to go eat her own sai is CHEAPER.</span></p>

              <p>I do not know what you guys think, but here's my view of a realistic Singapore in the future some 30 years ahead (and not some beautiful view as painted by the PAP).</p>
              <p>My view is based on the fact that I do not have much faith on my fellow countrymen to have the guts to take out the PAP, or have been brainwashed so much so that they sing the praises of the PAP while still suffering.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Wages will continue to remain stagnant, or might even deflate, largely due to the continuous influx of foreign labour</li>
              <li>Singaporeans will go out of jobs at an earlier age (possibly by 40, you should plan that you have retirement funds) due to the widespread availability of cheap labour</li>
              <li>Singapore's economy will slow down. The past few years of growth are fuelled largely by the short-term strategy of pumping cheap labour into the economy in order to keep the engine running. As all will know, using cheap petrol for your engine for a short period of time is fine. However prolonged usage of cheap petrol will cause the engine to break down and start having long-term problems</li>
              <li>That the IR will not succeed, largely because from historical learnings, a large part of the casino has to depend on the local population. That (1) locals have to pay $100 to get into the casino, and (2) we do not have a local population that is affluent enough in the 1st place, will increase the probability of the failures of the IRs.</li>
              <li>That when the IRs fail, the PAP will abolish the $100 entry fee in its desperate bid to keep the IRs alive, which will in turn cause serious consequences to our society on a whole</li>
              <li>That in general, 30 years from now, there will be much more old folks that cannot afford the cost of living in Singapore. Given suppressed wages, locals will have little to fall on when they retire (or forced to retire (View Pt 2)). Most of us will fall into that category.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Because of the above, I have decided to bite the bullet and come out into the global arena, to relocate into USA, to have a better life. My view was, if they don't treat us well in Singapore, then come out to the world and become an expat instead. Other countries value Singapore talent better than the country itself (how ironic is that?) </p>
              <p>It is never easy to relocate. There is a lot of mental stress and emotional pain of leaving one's own country. I, for one, love my country, but I know that if I continue to stay in Singapore, one day, I might just become one of the old folks who have to find a way to survive.</p>
              <p>It is still early days to determine if I am right or wrong (and I mostly wish that I am wrong), but my views of Singapore's future are bleak (esp for locals who are trapped in the vicious cycle of suppressed wages, low savings). That 30 years into the future, there will be huge consequences to what the PAP is doing to our country now, and that's when we will have to go through a painful transformation to bring the country back to where it was once proudly.</p>

              <h1>Give adequate wages to low income workers</h1>
              <div id="entry">
              <p><a href="http://tankinlian.blogspot.com"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #336699;">Tan Kin Lian</span></span></a><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #336699;"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/TOC%20Team/outb350.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="150"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">For many years, the Government has advocated a pro-business environment in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">. This is aimed at attracting foreign investors to set up businesses here and create more jobs for Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">This strategy has been successful. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> has received many international awards for being a competitive economy and a world class workforce.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A hard working, well educated, productive and co-operative workforce is an important contributor to this pro-business environment. This strategy has also benefited many Singaporeans. They have the opportunity to get good jobs at high wages. Many multi-national companies set up their operations in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> to serve the Asian region. The demand for talent and for professions in accounting, legal, marketing, business development and other services have contributed to this happy situation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">To cope with the shortage of talent, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> has an open door policy to attract professionals and foreign talents to work in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Depressed Wages</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The open door cannot be restricted only for the talents that are scarce in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">. In any case, this type of people has not been defined clearly. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In practice, the open door policy has also been applied to other sectors of the labour force. The demand for workers willing to work for competitive wages extends down the skill ladder.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Although there are controls to ensure a balance of local and foreign workers, they have been difficult to apply in practice. As a consequence, we have an abundance of low wage workers in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">. The actual number has not been published. If we look at the people who do not speak like Singaporeans working in the heartlands and in the factories, one can conclude that there must be a large number.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">One unfortunate consequence of this influx of foreign workers is the large number of local “mature” workers above 40 years who are unemployed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Choosy Workers</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A common explanation for the large number of unemployed workers is that they are “choosy”. They are not willing to do certain types of outdoor work, especially if they are risky or dirty. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I suspect that it is a question of adequate wages. If the jobs now shunned by Singaporeans pay adequate wages, I believe that many Singaporeans will be willing to do the work.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I have spoken to many taxi drivers who are willing to work 12 hours a day just to earn $2,000 to feed a family. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">There are many older Singaporeans who earn less than $800 a month as cleaners or security guards. They have no choice. They have to work or face starvation. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> does not provide any welfare.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I do not consider Singaporeans to be “choosy”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Foreign workers</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Employers will prefer to bring in foreign workers, as they are willing to accept any job and work for a low wage, so long as they earn enough to feed a family in their home country, where the cost of living is much lower than </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">’s. They are usually provided with accommodation near their place of work and can save on the high accommodation and commuting cost.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In contrast, a Singaporean has to earn enough to feed a family in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, with its high cost and standard of living. He has a family and social life in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, he cannot live in a dormitory near his place of work. He has to incur high accommodation and travel costs. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Outsourcing</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">For many years, the public sector has been a source of employment for many lower educated workers in our society.<span> </span>They work as cleaners and provide a wide range of services in our hospitals, airports and other public services. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">They earn a low wage, but it is adequate to feed a family. They are represented by the public sector’s trade unions, which look after their interests.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In recent years, many of these jobs have been outsourced to the private sector. Instead of employing the direct workers, the government agencies have reorganised the work and retrenched the direct workers.<span> </span>They outsource the work to private contractors, to reduce their cost of operation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A contractor has to submit a low price to win the tender on a contract. The contractors re-employ the retrenched workers at lower wages, to do the same work that they did previously as direct workers. If the local workers are “choosy”, the contractor can find foreign workers willing to work for less. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The contract is for a term of two or three years. On the renewal of the contract, the contract price is likely to reduce further, due to competition. This means even lower wages for the local contract workers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Adequate salaries</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I believe that local workers deserve to have an adequate salary for a hard day’s work. This salary has to be commensurate with the cost of living. It should be adequate for a worker to feed a family, at least in a frugal way. The worker should not be expected to work for 12 hours a day, and still not earn enough for the family.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In some countries, this is achieved through a “minimum wage”. Even </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">America</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, which is the strongest proponent of a free market economy and a flexible labour force, finds it necessary to have a minimum wage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Business has to be competitive</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">It has been argued that competitive wages and a flexible labour market are necessary for business to remain competitive and to stay in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">.<span> </span>This argument has been pushed too hard by our leaders. Many Singaporeans accept this argument quite blindly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Does it really help the country much for the public sector to save a few million<span> </span>dollars a year, by depressing the earnings of the contract workers who were previously the direct workers of the agencies?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If businesses have to pay a more adequate wage to the low income workers, will the businesses become non-viable? I do not think so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">These businesses can reduce the exorbitant earnings of their top directors and managers, or spend less on lavish offices or other business expenses. These businesses may earn less for shareholders, but will probably still find it quite attractive to remain in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Pride to be a Singaporean</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I believe that more people will be proud to be Singaporean, if they find that the nation looks after their interests and is willing to give them a fair standard of living for a hard day’s work.<span> </span>I hope that the wages of the lower income workers can be increased. This is even more pressing in 2008, due to the high inflation rate.</span></p>

              <p><br>Basically the focus of the current political leader is to maintain the power of Pap in holding government as such policies are directed more towards Rent Seeking Economy to substain the government...rather than creating new entrench business and enterprised thru innovation in the economy.</p>
              <p>The one aspect that was briefly mention in the budget of protecting of IP. I think SG govt is too small to have any decent impact on lnternational litigation and IP protection. The Giant China will clone most of innovation.</p>
              <p>As for IR....I think the entire investment was too large to recover thru visitor. The $100 rent seeked policies will be refunded back to IR due to pressured.  It is too early to predict if The 3rd wheeler will take off.....currently they task Sg tourist promotion board to do sales internationally to host conference in the IR.....</p>
              <p>I think if global economies recovered there might be some increase in tourist revenue. But spill over benefit is still marginal in part because SG does not have a minimum wage and not to mention they hired foreigners to work. </p>
              <p>You are right from the current on set the future looks bleaks Sg will still continue to use the geographic location to maintain trade position and maybe depend on Indonesia to wake up.....</p>

              <p>Pay is said to be structured in a way of your worthy, but in Singapore, it is more toward competition, as they said, if you peanut, you get monkeys. In another words, if private sector do not match the govt sector paid, they will get monkey like you. On the other hand, govt sectors, who used to follow the NWC recommendation which is also their own Wage council, are wary of overpaying those fat guys, gays and gals in the civil servant servicing jobs, because they dun wan to put burden on the private sector, who can pack up and move to somewhere else.</p>

              <p>I do not know what you guys think, but here's my view of a
              realistic Singapore in the future some 30 years ahead (and not some
              beautiful view as painted by the PAP).</p>
              <p>My view is based on the fact that I do not have much faith on my
              fellow countrymen to have the guts to take out the PAP, or have
              been brainwashed so much so that they sing the praises of the PAP
              while still suffering.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Wages will continue to remain stagnant, or might even deflate,
              largely due to the continuous influx of foreign labour</li>
              <li>Singaporeans will go out of jobs at an earlier age (possibly by
              40, you should plan that you have retirement funds) due to the
              widespread availability of cheap labour</li>
              <li>Singapore's economy will slow down. The past few years of
              growth are fuelled largely by the short-term strategy of pumping
              cheap labour into the economy in order to keep the engine running.
              As all will know, using cheap petrol for your engine for a short
              period of time is fine. However prolonged usage of cheap petrol
              will cause the engine to break down and start having long-term
              problems</li>
              <li>That the IR will not succeed, largely because from historical
              learnings, a large part of the casino has to depend on the local
              population. That (1) locals have to pay $100 to get into the
              casino, and (2) we do not have a local population that is affluent
              enough in the 1st place, will increase the probability of the
              failures of the IRs.</li>
              <li>That when the IRs fail, the PAP will abolish the $100 entry fee
              in its desperate bid to keep the IRs alive, which will in turn
              cause serious consequences to our society on a whole</li>
              <li>That in general, 30 years from now, there will be much more old
              folks that cannot afford the cost of living in Singapore. Given
              suppressed wages, locals will have little to fall on when they
              retire (or forced to retire (View Pt 2)). Most of us will fall into
              that category.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Because of the above, I have decided to bite the bullet and come
              out into the global arena, to relocate into USA, to have a better
              life. My view was, if they don't treat us well in Singapore, then
              come out to the world and become an expat instead. Other countries
              value Singapore talent better than the country itself (how
              ironic is that?) </p>
              <p>It is never easy to relocate. There is a lot of mental stress

              <p>Ms Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) claimed that foreign
              workers will be cheaper without the levies:</p>
              <p><em>“Without the levies, foreign workers are even cheaper and
              even more attractive to businesses. And some of these businesses
              will find loopholes to get round the quotas, to get more of the
              cheaper foreign workers,”</em> she said.</p>
              <p>However, she ignored the fact that Mr Low had already suggested
              refining the dependency ratio to control the inflow of foreign
              workers.</p>
              <p>Ms Irene Ng (Tampines GRC) added that “any move to tighten the
              dependency ratio as a way to raise workers’ wages could also lead
              to higher cost of living for consumers.”</p>
              <p>She forgot that there is a limit to which companies can raise
              the prices without losing their clients. At the end of the day, the
              onus is on them to find ways to boost productivity while keeping
              prices low at the same time.</p>
              <p>It is evident that the PAP’s growth strategy for the past few
              years has disastrous consequences for the low income earners in
              Singapore whose wages had remained stagnant. In fact, Singapore now
              has the largest income gap between the rich and the poor among the
              thirty most developed economies after Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>With no opposition in parliament to check on the PAP,
              Singaporeans will have little choice but to be led by them through
              the noses like a flock of “sheep”.</p>

              <p>1: Sorry, but I agree on Ms Josephine Teo on her <em>will find loopholes to get round the quotas.</em> Singaporeans seemed to be forgetful huh. This is because it seemed like there was a few cases where employers uses names of Singaporean as a worker who do not work at all, and just receive a "small payment" (Cant remember was it one time or what, but i think only contribute CPF or even not due to extreme low wages?) so that they can employ foreginers.</p>

              <p>2: On Irene's side, I feel that the limit of the price can go seriously is deemed by the demand, seriously, if the price of MRT / Bus is going like minimum $1.20 or sort of, do you think that everyone will stop taking public transport and the company lose passengers? Of course, unless there are more competition. Otherwise, the price actually has no cap of increasing without losing client (Look at Microsoft's expensive but not the best software, there is limited to no competition, this is why.)</p>
