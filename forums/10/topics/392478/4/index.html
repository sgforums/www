              <p>your income is high enough already. why need more income?</p>
              <p>is not the chance given to you to serve already more than reward you?</p>

              <p>If you say until like that, I wonder how other countries value their talent in the first place (Based on your statement <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Other countries value Singapore talent better than the country itself</strong></em></span> )<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><br></strong></em></span></p>

              <p>They value their own talent as well, but also give equal treatment to overseas talent. Note that, by saying talent, I do not use the term, talent, like our govt shamelessly. Talent are those who are in the higher positions, such as high-level consultants or management.</p>
              <p>USA has many very good universities, Stanford, Harvard, Chicago, MIT, etc. NUS is ranked in their opinion at an equal standard amongst the top 30 universities.</p>
              <p>Therefore you stand an equal chance with their top university candidates.</p>
