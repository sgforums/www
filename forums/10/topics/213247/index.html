            <div class='col-md body'>Did anyone watched the fortnightly show Crimewatch?<br><br>Did u see the segment where this girl got raped by 2 illegal indian workers in the void deck's rubbish dump.<br><br>Now, my thoughts are, here is a girl screaming at the top of her voice crying for help in the middle of a heartland. And ONLY ONE malay housewife decided to call the police.<br><br>My rant is WHY IS A GIRL GETTING GANG RAPED BY 2 INDIAN ILLEGAL WORKERS PLEAING and no one bother to find out?<br><br>U might give me the reason that people living in HDB might not hear her.. but please lah...i can even hear the boy living on the 10th floor playing piano while i live on the 15th floor.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Imagine, getting rape is bad enough...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Getting rape by illegal Indian is worser<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How about getting gang raped by 2 illegal indians workers?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Getting raped and screaming and no one helped.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Suffer raped in a stinky rubbish chute even worst<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Having your soil panties taken back to the lab and letting authorities examine the semem is embaressing enough<br><br>Sigh.... what infuriate me the most is the police actually "commended" the watchfull citizen that reported police.<br><br>PLEASE!!! SHE HAS BEEN GANGRAPED BY 2 INDIANS, THAT TAKES 15MINS AND ONLY 1 MALAY HOUSEWIFE CALLED THE POLICE!<br><br>AND SINGAPORE POLICE SAID THAT SINGAPOREANS ARE WATCHFUL RESIDENTS AND BOAST ABOUT THEIR THOROUGH INVESTIGATION<br><br>My dissappointment is how the Singapore police force actually made something so disgraceful to the Force and made it like as though they are so vigilant.<br><br>WHERE ARE ALL THE "WATCHFUL", "VIGILANT" SINGAPOREANS? it disgust me that Singaporeans have such a can't be bothered attitude. If u hear a scream nearby ur flat, will u even bother to look out? or would u saw the incident and dun bother to reach out to help.<br><br>Secondly, raped by ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS!! I thought our tax payers money would be enuff for u to buy HIGH TECH gadgets to stop the crime from happening right?<br><br>Why spend so much police force and man power on something so unneccessary like Chee Soon Juan or IMF? but when a real incident occur, u police and singaporeans can actually made a re-enactment on Crimewatch and said it was the good effort or watchful singaporeans and viligant police force that made a swift capture of the illegal foreign indian worker rapists.<br><br>PLEASE STOP GLORIFYING UR BAD ACTS AND SCREENING IT ON TV, TWISTING FACTS<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't understand why girls must get drunk. Nowadays girls always do mstupid things at their own risk just to prove they are better than their peers and better than the boys.  Sg people takes their safety for granted that they will not be harmed. I always wonder if anyone ever think about the good "image" and reality of the situation. we have more low-class FT in our mist, would that translate to higher security or more violent crimes. Lots of violent crimes by FTs are not reported and people think they are safe.<br><br>Anyways, there was a previous story I read from a mag about a guy who babysit for his neighbour's girl. She was very young and he was a father of a girl and boy himself. For many months, he raped the little girl until he was found out - if not it would have gone on forever.<br><br>I think men are disgusting beasts. Never trust them even if they are family. Much less strangers.<br><br></div>

In my neighbourhood, some girls like to hang out with guys late at night in one group and they are forever screaming at the top of their voices...<br><br>But if i'm at home and hear all those noises, I would probably just feel irrtated by it even...<br><br>When noise is a norm, you don't hear it as an alarm anymore...<br><br>BUT if one SAW it, and ignore, then he's horrendous...<br><br>I feel sorry for the girl though... The thought of what took place disgusts me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>Agree wif ya... My neighbourhood also got lotsa noises so if a girl screem like that no one's gonna take notice... Think the only way to get noticed is wif a clear "HELLLLLPPPPPP!!!!!!!" or visual confirmation...<br></div>
