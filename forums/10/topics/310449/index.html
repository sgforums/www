                      				This is because the Minister is abusing his powers yet again. The
                      				reasons he has given is, to put it mildly, disingenuous, and it

                      				placards, and made speeches at the exact spot that the SDP has

                      				is Mr Wong trying to kid? In the first place, other activities

                      				Human Rights, Burmese nationals, and international students, etc.

                      				disrespect for the people's intelligence.<br><br>Secondly, where
                      				in the Constitution does it say that the Executive can ban a
                      				certain class of groups, much less opposition political parties,
                      				from exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly
                      				as laid out in Article 14?<br><br>Article 12(1) distinctly states
                      				that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the
                      				equal protection of the law. The Government cannot show favour to
                      				CASE and discriminate against the SDP. <br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-;"><strong>c.

                      				this is the case, then Mr Wong should also ban all football
                      				matches, New Years' Eve countdown celebrations, and Swing
                      				Singapore parties because the potential for public disorder is
                      				always there. <br><br>In fact, there were many incidents that
                      				male revellers were groping and molesting women during such
                      				celebrations. Fights and gang violence occur at many gatherings
                      				that are open to the public. Why not ban all these as well?   
                      				<br><br>Even PAP meet-the-people sessions should be disallowed
                      				because members of the public can cause disorder and disruption.
                      				It was at such a session where PAP MP, Seng Han Thong, was
                      				assaulted by one of his constituents.<br><br>And why is it that
                      				there is not a potential for public disorder in CASE's
                      				event<br><br>Singaporeans can see through Mr Wong Kan Seng's lame
                      				excuses in rejecting SDP's application. It is plain that the
                      				Minister is abusing his powers to suppress any demonstration of
                      				public anger at the ruling party. <br><br>Such abuse must be
                      				stopped. <br><br>In view of this the Singapore Democrats will
                      				proceed with the planned rally this Saturday at 2 pm at the
                      				concourse between Parliament House and the Singapore River. <br><br>The
                      				protest is targeted at the recent spate of price hikes that have
                      				caused inflation to rise to an unprecedented high. This has
                      				severely affected the middle- and lower-income
                      				Singaporeans.<br><br>Much of the problem stems from the
                      				Government's economic policies. And yet, the Ministers think
                      				nothing of increasing their own salaries to $3 million a year -
                      				up by 85 percent in one year!<br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-;">We
                      				ask all Singaporeans who cannot stomach PAP's bullying anymore to
                      				join us this Saturday. More details will be announced over the
                      				next few days.</span></span></p>

              Why would Singaporeans want to throw rotten eggs at SDP members?
              
              Yes, I have met many who are afraid to attend the forums and protests. And some who have no idea what's going on. BUT, I have never met a Singaporean who actually hates the SDP. Fear of the PAP prevents Singaporeans from openly supporting the SDP, but that's very far away from hating the SDP.
              
              Are you even a Singaporean, Mr Daddy? The SDP are going to be there this Saturday to speak up for Singaporeans' rights and spread awareness of our plight. For us, and not themselves. 
              
              As a Singaporean, I am grateful. But if you are some 'FT' hired by your PAP masters to attack pro-democracy messages on the internet, I can understand your fear. If public support for the SDP grows, the PAP might consider spending money on internet propagandists to be a useless gambit.

              <p>Since confrontational methods doesn't work in Singapore due to the nature of our political system, like you've mentioned, then why still use it after so many years?</p>
              <p>Perhaps to some people, this may seem brave and garang. But to me, one might as well try to break a stone by hurling eggs. Totally tactless.</p>
              <p>Thus, while some criticise certain opposition parties for being too 'soft' on the ruling party, I rather see it as a better strategy than the confrontational method. If you can't deal with the enemy head-on, then infiltrate it and change/weaken it from the inside.</p>
              <p>Don't fight a losing battle.</p>
