              <p>from this perspective, ivy league universities reflect what is going on in their society.  the rich are super rich and the poor are super poor.   the quality of their top universities is very high and most of the rest for the population is less than average.</p>

              SINGAPORE police on Saturday</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE police on Saturday arrested 10 people for holding a rally
              without a permit to protest against rising living costs, witnesses
              said.</p>
              <p>Leading pro-democracy activist Chee Soon Juan was among the group
              who were bundled into police vans after plainclothes officers stopped
              them in front of a shopping mall in the business district, an AFP
              reporter and photographer said.</p>
              <p>Chee is the leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, one of
              a handful of opposition parties in the city-state, which has been ruled
              by the People's Action Party since 1959.</p>
              <p>About 18 protesters, including children, had earlier gathered
              outside parliament where they symbolically laid groceries on a
              sidewalk.</p>
              <p>The police then stopped them just minutes after setting off
              for the Orchard Road shopping area, where they had planned another
              protest.</p>
              <p>They wore red t-shirts with the words 'we cannot take it anymore' while others carried placards denouncing rising prices.</p>
              <p> The 10 were arrested after ignoring police calls to disperse and lay
              down their placards, the witnesses said. Chee's activist sister was
              also apprehended.</p>
              <p>Singapore, scarred by racial riots in the 1960s, has strict
              laws against public assembly, which require a police permit for a
              gathering of five or more people. -- AFP</p>

              <p>From what I read, it seems that there is a price increase in many commodities throughout the world.....oil prices, food prices, and so on...</p>
              <p>Im not sure that this is something specific to Singapore, or something that is specifically caused by some government policy in Singapore....</p>

              <p>So....I dont know if SDP in this case has chosen the wrong topic, or should I say, not really relevant, to target their demonstration to the government of Singapore, as if the government has the ability or the power to fix it.......if it did, I think the government would have done it already....</p>
              <p>I think in terms of economic issue...some other things maybe are relevant and related to government policy...for instace, asking for greater transparency on the Temasek, or CPF, or GIC, and so on.</p>
              <p>But protesting on higher commodity prices....Im not sure this is something relevant....it's not like the government is controlling it. It's the market mechanism, right?</p>
