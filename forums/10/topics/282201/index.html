            <div class='col-md body'>Gang Case:<br><br>"TECHNICIAN Zainal Nek was outside a convenience store in Central Square with his girlfriend when he was set upon by a group of nine men armed with knives.<br><br>Outnumbered, the unarmed 46-year-old fled down Havelock Road but was eventually hacked to death near the Central Expressway exit, near the Subordinate Courts.<br><br>He died shortly after in hospital. An autopsy later listed 78 injuries on him from that September 2006 attack.<br><br>In the High Court yesterday, six men who had taken part in what prosecutors described as one of the most horrific gang-related killings here, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Four of them - Norezam Mohsin, 28; Abdul Shahed Akbal Ali, 27; Abdul Razak Abdul Hamid, 23; and Mohamad Rizal Mohamed Amin, 23 - were each jailed for 10 years and ordered to be caned 12 times.<br><br>The fifth, Mohamed Hishamadi Rahmat, 34, who had led the attack, was also given 10 years but he will take 18 strokes of the cane, said Justice Choo Han Teck, for his 'more deadly' role.<br><br>The sixth man, Khairul Iskandar Khamsani, 21, the only one who gave himself up to police, heaved a sigh of relief when he was handed down seven years and six strokes.<br><br>The remaining three assailants are still at large.<br><br>The six sentenced yesterday, all part of a motorcycle gang, portrayed themselves as mere foot soldiers.<br><br>They fingered one Nur Rizal Mohamed Zainul, 27, as the mastermind who orchestrated the action while away from the scene. He is also at large.<br><br>The gang had gathered in Kelantan Lane after midnight on Sept 16 for a showdown with a rival gang. But when no one from the other side showed up, someone suggested seeking them out at their hangout in Central Square.<br><br>When they spotted Mr Zainal, known for his links to the rival gang, Mohamed Hishamadi went up to him and began slashing. Mr Zainal stumbled away, but was surrounded by the gang members, who went at him until he collapsed.<br><br>Yesterday, defence lawyers downplayed their clients' roles, arguing that they were pawns or had gone along under peer pressure. Some said their clients wanted to apologise to Mr Zainal's family, others said he was no angel himself.<br><br>But Deputy Public Prosecutor Francis Ng, saying the victim had done nothing to provoke the group, pressed for a deterrent sentence.<br><br>He said: 'It does not take much to imagine the terrifying spectacle of nine armed men pursuing their wounded and bleeding quarry through the streets, before eventually surrounding and cutting down their hapless prey.'"<br><br>This is some malay motor siao gang, better be careful when walking alone late at night. Gang related activities still very strong here in Singapore.</div>
