"This kind of borrowing means America is no longer free. We owe, and our children will owe ... And they won't owe Uncle Sam.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">SINGAPORE (AFP) - The alleged leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant network in <span id="lw_1204184035_0" class="yshortcuts" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Singapore</span> escaped Wednesday from custody, the Ministry of Home Affairs said.</span></span></p>
              <div class="lrec">
              
              </div>
              <p>Mas Selamat bin Kastari escaped from a local detention centre at 4:05 PM (0805 GMT), the ministry said in a news release.</p>
              <p>"Mas Selamat was the leader of the Singapore JI network. He walks with a limp and is presently at large," it said, adding he was not known to be armed. "Extensive police resources have been deployed to track him down."</p>
              <p>Kastari was accused of planning to hijack a plane and crash it into <span id="lw_1204184035_1" class="yshortcuts" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Changi Airport</span> in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dozens of paramilitary <span id="lw_1204184035_2" class="yshortcuts" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Nepalese Gurkhas</span> from a special Singapore Police contingent were deployed every few metres along roads surrounding the detention centre near the upscale Raffles Town Club. Large vans from the Police Special Operations Command patrolled the area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A police spokesman told AFP late Wednesday that they had not caught the suspect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ministry announced in June 2006 that Kastari and four other JI members had been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for detention without trial.</p>
              <p>Kastari was arrested by Indonesian authorities in East Java in January that year before being handed over to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore, a staunch US ally, has said it remains a top target for extremists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Officials have said extremists planned to attack a bus carrying Americans to a subway station in 2001, but authorities foiled the attack by arresting 15 people including members of JI.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Authorities have blamed JI for a string of regional attacks, including the 2002 bombings in the Indonesian resort island of <span id="lw_1204184035_3" class="yshortcuts" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Bali</span>, which killed 202 people.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng has cited a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lapse in security at the Whitley Detention Centre on Wednesday as the cause for the escape of JI member Mas Selamat Kastari.<br></span><br>He told MPS who had raised the matter in Parliament, that Mas Selamat had been taken from his cell to another part of the detention centre for a visit from his family. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He then asked to be allowed to visit the toilet,where he escaped.</span><br><br>"This should have never have happened. I am sorry that it has" said Mr Wong in an update to the House, adding that an independent investigation is underway.<br><br>The Home Affairs Minister went on to say that security at the centre has been stepped up and there should not be any speculation on what and how the escape happened.<br><br>Mr Wong described Mas Selamat as a security threat, which is why he was placed under preventive detention. But added that officials are not taking any chances even though there is no information that Mas Selamat has any plans that threaten public security.<br><br>As to why the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">public was informed of the escape only some four hours after it happened</span>, Mr Wong said the focus was to lock down the detention centre before starting a systematic operation to search for the fugitive and arrest him. That was because the security assessment was that the escape posed no imminent danger to the public.<br><br>Mr Wong said the arrest of Mas Selamat remains a priority and there will be no effort spared in tracking him down. Security at all land, sea and air checkpoints have been tightened, including areas where there's possibility of slipping out of Singapore.<br><br>In the meantime, Mr Wong has urged the public to stay calm and to report any suspicious sighting to the police, reminding that any help given to Mas Selamat is a serious crime. </span></p>
