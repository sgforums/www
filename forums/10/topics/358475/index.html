              <p><strong>Do not be  Freak of Nature</strong></p>
              <p>A natural order exists in the world. Democracy processes are part of it. Trying to suppress it, or tweak the system with strange polices and processes will produce what we call freaks of nature. As we now know, These are likely to suffer from problems that are not part of the natural order. Dabbling in ERP, progress packages, education segregation and dividing the class of society wil bring about the problems that we are facing to day. It has been proven true in the natural world where unnatural human intervention had caused mass extinction of plant and animal species, disruptions in ecology and climate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Do not do unto others what u do not want on yourself</strong></p>
              <p>A system of retribution existss in the world. What goes  around comes around. Part of the  nautral cycle of the world. An age old concept that when u offend or help others, they will do the same in return. The incident where the the MP was doused in fire by a mentally unstable man.</p>
              <p><strong>Do not Preach what u dont practice</strong></p>
              <p>An important aspect of life. When u preach democracy, do it well. if u want to turn it into a suppressive regime, and preach what u dont practice, people lose the confidence in u. A loss of confidence means the arrival of mistrust and paranoia. Trust is what drives relationships. It has been proven true in the business world.</p>
              <p><strong>Do not take things for granted </strong></p>
              <p>There will be a time that things will not go as one predicted. Citizens will no longer tolerate the mess that is brought about now due to complacent decisions on investment, unnecessary waste of tax payers monies and the negelct of local conscripts efforts to contribute to national security.One day the citizens will wake up and the question rises - Do u have a contigency plan?</p>
              <p><strong>Do not be Selfish</strong></p>
              <p>Keep  everything with u and u are not safe. Share them with others, the poor and under priviledged and u earn their protection  and respect. In life the strongest person is not the one with riches but the one that has earned character.</p>

              <p>They don't give a damn in the welfare of the people anymore. They will build more roads, expressways because they are money spinners; but forsake the thing of utmost impotant to life : natural water. We have billions to throw and save foreign banks but not to spare a bit  to built more reservoirs. Not that there isn't enough space for it but just plain greedy to grab more as recycle water they can charge more. These are not a good clean water.</p>

              <p>I think Singapore is now basically a two clas society with elites at the top and the non elites.</p>
              <p>We can say that Singapore society has developed into the final stage before the crisis comes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As this process goes on, you get certain other things. I've hinted
              at a number of them. One is misplacement of satisfactions. You find
              your satisfactions--your emotional satisfaction, your social
              satisfaction-- not in moment to moment relationships with nature or
              other people, but with power, or with wealth, or even with organized
              force--sadism, in some cases: Go out and murder a lot of people in a
              war, a just war, naturally.</p>
              <p>The second thing that occurs as this goes on is increasing
              remoteness of desires from needs. I've mentioned this. The next thing
              is an increasing confusion between means and ends. The ends are the
              human needs, but if I asked people what these needs are, they can
              hardly tell me. Instead they want the means they have been brainwashed
              to accept, that they think will satisfy their needs. But it's perfectly
              obvious that the methods that we have been using are not working. Never
              was any society in human history as rich and as powerful as Western
              Civilization and the United States, and it is not a happy society. Just
              this week, I looked at a book called "The Joyless Economy", by an
              economist, Tibor Scitovsky, who diagrammed some of these things.</p>
              <p>In the final aspect of this process, controls on behaviour shift
              from the intermediate levels of human experience--social, emotional and
              religious--to the lower, military and political, or to the upper,
              ideological. They become the externalized controls of a mature society:
              weapons, bureaucracies, material rewards, or ideology. Customary
              conformity is replaced by conscious decision-making, and this usually
              implies a shift from your own conformity to someone else's decision.</p>
              <p>In
              its final stages, the civilization becomes a dualism of almost
              totalitarian imperial power and an amorphous mass culture of atomized
              individuals.</p>

              But it's perfectly obvious that the methods that we have been using
              are not working. Never was any society in human history as rich and
              as powerful as Western Civilization and the United States, and it
              is not a happy society. Just this week, I looked at a book called
              "The Joyless Economy", by an economist, Tibor Scitovsky, who
              diagrammed some of these things.</p>
              <p>In the final aspect of this process, controls on behaviour shift
              from the intermediate levels of human experience--social, emotional
              and religious--to the lower, military and political, or to the
              upper, ideological. They become the externalized controls of a
              mature society: weapons, bureaucracies, material rewards, or
              ideology. Customary conformity is replaced by conscious
              decision-making, and this usually implies a shift from your own
              conformity to someone else's decision.</p>
              <p>In its final stages, the civilization becomes a dualism of
              almost totalitarian imperial power and an amorphous mass culture of
              atomized individuals.</p>
