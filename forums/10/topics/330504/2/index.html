              <p>You teach them how to tread carefully on the right path...See the mistakes other countries has made and don't repeat it... See the success of other country and follow it... Repeating the mistakes of other country is the one of the stupidest thing you can do... Think thoroughly before making the next step...</p>

              <p>Let's assume that it's true. Protests that threaten 'territorial unity' of China are illegal, even if they are peaceful...and China is effectively a single-party state.</p>

              <p>Worst case scenerio... yes...a major riot like the 1992 LA riot can spread out through the entire of Singapore from Boon Lay to Changi... remember, we only have less than 30,000 Police officers in Singapore and only a fraction of them are under SOC trying to control what possibly 100,000 maybe 500,000 rioters... Damages can go up to tenths of billions... faith in Singapore security system shaken among the MNCs...</p>
              <p>These has happend to cities b4 but because they are a big country, one city on riot can be repaired by the other cities the country have... but we only have one city... that's it, nothing more... you gamble with it and its lost...</p>
              <p>Maybe I've over exageratted that it will cause the end of Singapore... but can you imagine the amount of suffering the riot and post riot going to bring to Singapore...?</p>

              <p>Singapore where got 100,000 people go around rioting one? Unless <em>you</em> hire them lah. Stop boasting over those un-substantiate anticipation of yours la.

              <p>this i agree. if people really want to solve this hike issue, go and file for petition. get 200,000 singaporeans and ask them to sign a petition; file it to the Prime Minister's office, send a copy to Straits Times or even overseas newspaper. make it a big "news" and see where it leads to.</p>
              <p>i don't believe SBS will not "hear" your petition if you have 200,000 strong support. if 200,000 not enough, get 1,000,000. we have 4.5 million population here.</p>
