            <div class='col-md body'>There are a couple of ways to help jet fighters take off with short runways. One of the most common method is the rocket assisted takeoff where rockets are stripped onto the fusalage of the aircraft and ignite during take off. This was  common with the F104 StarFighter.  Other common methods including using of ramps (like the ramps used for some aircraft carriers today. With some sort of portable, quick install catapult systems, an jet can take off less than 400m. Aircrafts of the size of the F5s and Vipers should be able to take off shorter than 400m if they can be launch from some sort of land based catapult system.<br><br>While in terms of having the jets to take off if the runways in Paya Lebar, Tengah and Changi are taken out, the roads systems are the quickest means. There are also a couple of alternatives including, using large fields (usually more suited for Russian made jets because they come with mud flaps and the intake have special shields as in the case of Mig29, to prevent FOD objects from being sucked into the engines).<br><br>Singapore could also have underground runways or tunnels where part of the runways are sunk underground and only about 200m above ground, thus allowing the fighters roll some 400m or more protected and the last 200m for final take off. Once again, these tunnels have to be relatively straight and wide enuff, plus they also must have real good exhaust fans too... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lastly, RSAF would have also invested in acquiring runway repair vehicles where they could quickly cover bombed out holes, level and compact the filled-in holes and temporary tarmac it within a very short period of time.<br></div>
