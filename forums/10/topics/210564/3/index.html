Late into the week, only after strong representation and complains made by Mr Wolfowitz, the Singapore Government then - without any reason - to approve 22 of the original 27 members to enter into Singapore. This can be seen as an insincere and deliberate move to deflate the high expectation of a challenge to the established no-nonsense image of Singapore Authorities.<br><br>Having slammed the door in the face of the 27 accredited participants at the airport immigration counter, and deporting all 27 out of Singapore, did  the Singapore Government expect these groups to fork out another sum and the time to fly back to Singapore again ? ( I had mentioned this before the approval was reconsidered ).<br><br>These 27 CSO activists are already accreditted participants, and not any riotious hooligans known in the Police Files, which surely would not have been accreditted by the World Bank.<br><br>Now that only 22 out of the 27 originally deported were approved, it is only correct that they stay out in protest that the other 5 were purposefully prevented from participating.<br><br>This is typical Singapore Government politics in dealing with <span style="font-style: italic;">'dissidents'</span>, by taking the wind out of the expected bellicose on the issues of public interests; and then destabilising the opposite camps with manpower shortage, as well as depleting their resources and energy.<br></span><br></div>
