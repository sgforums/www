            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore relents over ban on activists<br>John Burton<br>Financial Times<br>16 Sep 06<br><br>Singapore bowed to international pressure on Friday and agreed to allow 22 of 27 banned activists to attend the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank, after Paul Wolfowitz, World Bank president, said the bar on their entry was Â“unacceptableÂ”.<br><br>The move was meant to deflect mounting controversy that had threatened to become a public relations disaster for Singapore as it hosted its biggest-ever conference. But its refusal to admit five activists could keep the issue alive.<br><br>Mr Wolfowitz said Singapore had suffered Â“enormous damageÂ” to its reputation Â– which was Â“self-inflictedÂ” Â– by refusing to honour an agreement to allow the activists to attend the meeting.<br><br>Â“This could have been an opportunity to showcase to the world [SingaporeÂ’s] development process,Â” he said, though he added: Â“I would argue whether it has to be as authoritarian as it has been.Â”<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s concession represents a rare policy reversal for a government that takes pride in refusing to back down on its decisions. SingaporeÂ’s initial decision to bar the 27 activists was Â“a violation of the understanding that we had drawn upÂ” with the government, said Mr Wolfowitz. Â“IÂ’ve read the language and it seems very clear to me.Â”<br><br>The city-state had promised to faciliate the entry of invited participants to the meeting. But it said this week that its decision to prevent some activists from coming also fulfilled its obligation under the agreement to protect the personal security of delegates.<br><br>Singapore alleged that those blacklisted posed a security threat. Â“While we cannot disclose specific details about the individuals, we can affirm that the decision was carefully considered,Â” it said. However, Rodrigo Rato, the IMF managing director, said the activists invited were well known to the organisations, which had no doubts they would act responsibly. He warned that Singapore Â“would be making a mistakeÂ” if it did not reverse its decision.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s actions have provoked anger among non-governmental organisations, which have questioned the IMF/World BankÂ’s commitment to encourage their participation. More than 160 non-governmental organisations, many of which had been invited, called for a boycott of the meeting.<br><br>More than 20 activists who attended a dialogue session with the IMF and World Bank heads walked out in protest, demanding that a harder line be taken with the Singaporean authorities.<br><br>Â“This has serious implications for future meetings of international organisations. If the Singapore decision is allowed to stand, it means other governments can ban invited delegates,Â” said Roberto Bissio, co-ordinator of the NGO network Social Watch. Singapore said it would consider admitting the remaining five activists, but would make a decision only once they arrived in the country.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan, a Singapore opposition leader who is planning a protest march today, said the authorities wanted to crack down on the foreign activists because Â“they donÂ’t want local groups to pick up bad habits that would encourage Singaporeans to protestÂ”.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ban on troublemakers: No apology needed</strong><br><br>WORLD Bank managing director Juan Jose Daboub said the fact that the Singapore Government is extremely concerned about terrorist acts is 'something we cannot corroborate'.<br>'They said they are concerned with terrorist acts,' said Mr Daboub, one of the bank's two managing directors.<br><br>'They are concerned about the security for the 4,000, 5,000 people that will come to the meetings and for the Singapore people.'<br><br>The car burning, window smashing and the violence that took place in Seattle and Hong Kong seemed completely lost on Mr Daboub.<br><br>World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz told the BBC that Singapore's decision to block accredited activists, who had been invited, was a 'bad' one.<br><br>One would have expected men of such stature to be more circumspect in what they say.<br><br>I wonder if Mr Daboub and Mr Wolfowitz would still say the same thing if they had been injured in skirmishes caused by demonstrators.<br><br>The press, too, had a field day mocking Singapore. You could almost feel The Financial Times gloating when it wrote that 'the IMF and the World Bank issued an unprecedented rebuke to Singapore over a ban on accredited activists invited to attend the annual meetings of the two financial institutions.'<br><br>It added: 'Although the authorities are hoping to use the meetings as a showcase to promote Singapore as a tourist-friendly destination and business centre, visitors may come away with the impression of a well-functioning police state.'<br><br>Singapore owes no apology to anyone for blocking known troublemakers or for our obsession with security.<br><br>Dr Michael Loh Toon Seng<br><br>(Straits Times, Sep 14)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saturday September 16, 10:53 AM<br>Singapore's climbdown on activists too late: NGOs<br><br>Singapore acted too late in finally agreeing to admit 22 activists whose accreditation for World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings it had opposed, non-governmental organizations say.<br><br>The city-state's partial climbdown late Friday followed stinging criticism from the World Bank in a controversy which activists say reinforces the city-state's image as a restrictive society, despite its economic success.<br><br>Singapore had said there were security concerns about 27 of the hundreds of activists accredited by the Bank and Fund as part of a long-standing dialogue between the financial institutions and their critics.<br><br>But it partially reversed its stand after Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said the issue had damaged the reputation of the city-state, which prides itself on its image as an efficiently-run regional commercial hub.<br><br>Singapore said 22 of the 27 activists would now be allowed entry.<br><br>The Bank welcomed Singapore's move but said it wants all 27 admitted "without delay" in line with a memorandum of understanding with the Singapore government.<br><br>"This gesture is, quite simply, too little too late. Expensive travel plans have already been undone, and many civil society organizations are unable to fly to Singapore on a moment's notice," said Romilly Greenhill, of the relief agency ActionAid International.<br><br>Lidy Nacpil, of the non-governmental organization (NGO) Jubilee South, agreed.<br><br>"Also, why only 22 of the 27?" she said on the Indonesian island of Batam, near Singapore, where more than 160 NGOs on Friday declared a boycott of the meetings in Singapore to protest the clampdown on free speech and banning of activists.<br><br>Wolfowitz said at a meeting with NGOs in Singapore on Friday that "enormous damage has been done ... A lot of that damage has been to Singapore and it's self-inflicted."<br><br>A few hours later, Singapore announced its climbdown.<br><br>"Singapore apparently has realised that their image has been tarnished, to say the least," Nacpil said.<br><br>It was a rare reversal by the city-state which generally stands firm in the face of criticisms. Last year Singapore hanged an Australian drug trafficker despite a high-level diplomatic campaign to save the man's life.<br><br>The city-state's hard line against the NGOs "has underlined how cut off Singapore is from a world where free speech, free association and democratic choice are established norms of political association,"; said Walden Bello, executive director of Focus on the Global South, another NGO.<br><br>Singapore is "out of step with the times," Bello said.<br><br>Political stability has been the bedrock of the economic success of the city-state, which grew from a Third World country to become one of Asia's wealthiest nations.<br><br>Critics say this came at a price, in the form of restrictions on freedom of speech and political activity.<br><br>Sinapan Samydorai, president of local human rights group Think Centre, said the controversy over the activists "just strengthened that view that it's a very closed society when it comes to political rights."<br><br>He said Singapore should have been "more mature" and allowed the foreign protesters to make their point against the financial institutions.<br><br>Despite appeals from the Bank that accredited protesters be allowed to hold outdoor demonstrations, Singapore has refused to waive a long-standing ban on public protests.<br><br>Police have said tough security measures were necessary because the country is a high-profile "terrorist" target.<br><br>But NGOs said the measures -- enforced by 10,000 security personnel -- were directed toward local activists, not outsiders.<br><br>Bello said Singapore "fears the effect that civil society organisations criticising and debating the IMF and World Bank might have on the citizens of Singapore."<br><br>A local opposition politician, Chee Soon Juan, was set to break the ban on outdoor protests Saturday.<br><br>He said the international community has begun to see the nature of Singapore's system.<br><br>"How do you expect to become a financial centre, a global hub... and yet be so repressive?" he said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is known the world over for our strict laws and religious devotion to order and public safety. The sort of violent and unruly protests in past WTO/IMF/World Bank meetings in Seattle, Cancun and Hong Kong cost the organizers millions of dollars in damages. They may be dismissed as 'a little messiness' by some, but most Singaporeans will not accept that in our society.<br><br>To protesters and activists who intend to introduce such western-style anarchy to the streets of Singapore, the message must be, "Don't mess around with us!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Had we let the CSOs in from the start, we would have been able to avoid the accusations of heavy-handedness. In the event that they did riot, Singapore's position would have been vindicated and we would have our excuse to crack down hard on them.<br><br>At this stage, lifting the ban shows our weakness rather than openess to the world. Those CSO fags won't come knowing that their outdoor demonstration crap won't be tolerated here. So they'll stay in Batam, wayang about big bad Singapore,  making us look bad from the safety of their resort hostels.<br><br>Worst of all is the IMF and World Bank. They have made us their scapegoat. By fingering Singapore as the one responsible for barring those activists they have deflected the blame away from themselves. Most infuriating of all is, they are secretly enjoying the security and peace afforded by our ban, while criticising Singapore in public. Such gratitude.<br><br>I hope we learn a lesson from this.</div>
