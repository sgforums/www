            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Every sovereign nation has the right to refuse entry to any individuals deemed to be undesirable. The authorities has bowed to pressure to allow 22 of the 27 in but I am sure they will have a whole continent of police shadowing them if they should come. </div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Yes, <span style="font-style: italic;">'every sovereign nation has the right to refuse entry to any individuals deemed to be undesirable'</span>, unfortunately for Singapore - the 27 who were banned were already acreditted by the World Bank to be participants in the current WB-IMF convention in Singapore.<br><br>More importantly, the Singapore Government had <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>contracturally  agreed in writing</strong></span> to allow all acreditted Civil Society Activists to participate.<br><br>In the first place, it is only 27 activists that surely can be easily <span style="font-style: italic;">'shepherded'</span> with the large contingent of Gurkhas, SPF Riot Squad, SPF Swat Team, the regular uniformed Police, the secretive plain clothed ISD and Detectives ?<br><br>Even the resources of SingTel and StarHubs have been mobilised to monitor the telephone and text messages of these Activists - so as to eavesdrop on any plans for any ratching up of demonstrative public protests.<br><br>Why would the brilliant Elite lead Singapore into such an embarrassing situation, if not to use this as an exercise to reinforce the PAP's no-nonsense image in even daring to challenge the World Bank and IMF community - all for the sake of local political consumption, and to cow an already submissive population ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Along with many Singaporeans, I understand and support the government's reluctance to allow in activists who have been involved in violent protests. Many of these NGOs adopt a dual policy of having accredited activists voicing their protests in the convention halls whilst other members put up violent protests in the streets outside. That is one reason why Singapore will not allow public protests outdoors. Their leaders put on a suit as an accredited CSO participant indoors whilst coordinating the hooligans smashing windows outside. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">You have confirmed what I had written before that there are two groups of activists - one group that formally participate, and the other being the more vocally and physically demonstrative informal group.<br><br>After so many incidents at all the past venues of meetings conducted by the World Bank, IMF and the WTO, surely the Police Forces of every country will already be sharing the files and dossiers of every activists - passive and pro-active members ?<br><br>Why would the Singapore Government banned and then rescind the ban on 22 out of the 27 activists - if they had access to such help from the close assistance that our <span style="font-style: italic;">'supposedly reputable'</span> Police Force would have with the Police Forces of other countries ?<br><br>The decision to rectify the entire fiasco was placed with a low level S2006 Committee - who was tasked to plan and prepare for this WB-IMF Meeting in Singapore. The Straits Times reported that the S2006 Committee reviewed the application of the activists, and rescinded the ban on the 22 activists.<br><br>This begs the question as to - why was <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>the buck passed</strong></span> to a low level Committee that was initially tasked to prepare the infrastructure for the successful outcome of this Meet ?</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>The authorities have intelligence as to known troublemakers (the blacklisted activitsts form a very small proportion of the whole) and are fully justified in attempting to block them from entering the nation. If they are allowed in, the police should take all measures necessary, including lethal force,  to prevent a recurrence of the riots in Hong Kong and Seattle.</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">If the intelligent authorities had the intelligence, why did they ban all the 27 activists in the first place, and subsequently relented on 22 out of the 27 persons ?<br><br>This entire fiasco could have been avoided, but instead it left behind a bad taste after the sparkling preparations that scored high points with the leaders and their supporting staff from the World Bank and the IMF.<br><br>These WB-IMF-WTO leading figures are personalities that have left the rough world of Politics, and wield political powers - with a lighter touch but no less in weight - in their quiet chambers, with the leisure of time to deliberate on matters, and to listen to all alternative views.<br><br>They speak in soft, deliberate and measured tones, with words carefully chosen without the political bluster, and are prepared to engage those who will offer reasons, facts, and principles.<br><br>Can our Elites in the Singapore Government do the same, instead of walling themselves and Singaporeans with their imagined bellicose ghosts of the 1960s ?<br><br>The entire exercise is nothing more than <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'political brinkmanship'</strong></span>, pushing the PAP's views concerning <span style="font-style: italic;">'Public Demonstrations'</span>, and climbing down once the message has been put across for the consumption by interested Singaporeans.<br><br>Is this kind of <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Politiking</strong></span> not similar to the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'political brinkmanship'</strong></span> often seen from North Korean President Kim Jong Il - in his insistence on exercising his rights to political and national sovereignty despite all previously contracted agreements ?<br><br>What can we expect from a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Closed Society</strong></span> led by self-assuming Elites, who are paranoid of losing the political ground ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>

The internet forums and blogs reaches less than 0.01 percent of the population. Do you think people like Archie Ong who was sued by T.T. Durai had a better chance at blog? He would he been sued and silenced anyway because Singapore does not protect whistle blowers and the sheer cost of lawsuit would have scared any ordinary citizen away. Do you think Chiam See Tong could have reverse PAP tatics awarding upgrading based on party suppoer by posting on forum?<br><br>Thats when protest and demostration change things.
