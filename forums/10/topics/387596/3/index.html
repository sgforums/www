              <p>First of all, property price hike is a stimulation to churn the economy, imagine a recession without any stimulationat all in a downturn market, i think would had been much much worst, they need stimulate something, and properties was choosen to be the catalyst for churning the economy mechanism. And to do that, they, the govt, reduced interest rate, leading to peoples thinking twice about parking their money in fix deposit, and will be more willing to buy property with borrowing at lower interest rate. Secondly, rise the cost of daily essential living needs also lead to people diverting their money into property, which is said to be a growing asset, rather than cars, fashions, gadgets or others. Thirdly, by giving PR and citizenship status to more foreigners that enable them to purchase houses, will further enhance the property market prices.</p>
              <p>And fourthly, as saying goes, if you want to con people, do it big, you need bite a big piece out of it, otherwise, dun waste your effort, and property is the only market that they, the govt can bite you deep without even you knowing it, that is the glee of it, so people end up happily paying $500,000 + 7%Gst and other taxes for a 4 to 5 rooms HDB flat, which only took $20,000 to built it. A net profit of $480,000 + 7%. Can you imagine that???</p>
              <p>Well, if peoples are willing to pay and hope for the best, why bother. If you dun want to buy or got no money to buy....just shut up and as usual, go for your morning toilet with a peaceful mind ya.</p>

              <p><br>No lah, I am pro to nothing, my big 3 Samsonite language bags is alway ready to leave this country and head back to my sweet cool lakeside resort home in taichong, just worry about another landslide.</p>
              <p>To me, i think for the citizens more than the govt, whoever is the govt is not that important, the important is citizens must have foods, a peaceful n harmony living conditions, because i believe under such conditions, any society will excel to it very best.</p>
              <p>So far, Hougang and potong pasir, which is opposition wards, had did nothing to prove their worth, more or less, they are sailing alongside PAP and the rest of the oppositions are also not that outspoken and always talk about themselves against PAP, their historical leader under detention and their policies rather than advocate more on the citizens need of today.</p>
              <p>So, in a sensible way, tho PAP is not perfect, (as there is never a perfect govt in this world) they did instill peace and harmony to this society, and that is one reason why Singapore go up so fast and better than other within a short span of time. Yes, govt may have gone overboard on cost of living and their pay scale, the good is that i can walk on a street at midnite without much problem, i can also choose my life, i can also get better educated and i can happily make frens here without much problem.</p>
              <p>Having said that, as a mere citizen, what else do you want? do you want to explore the unknown?? do you want to give up all these peace and harmony condition?? Is there really a need to change our govt??? for better or worst?? and finally, do you have a thot for the citizens of Singapore before you advocate yourself to the opposition. You can't be that selfish ya.</p>
