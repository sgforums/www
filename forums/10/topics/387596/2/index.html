              <p>True again....And the PAP ministers rely heavily on the so-called "Ang Moh" to help them run their corporates n GLC,which in many cases,the Ang Moh also lose alot of investment money n many a times,they are only sit down there doing nothing n take high pays.</p>
              <p>I can tell u all,those PAP ministers are a bunch of fools who get toyed around by these Ang Moh.</p>
              <p>P.S.I am not racist,but there are really some scumbags from foreign countries who simply come here n cheat money.Generally speaking,i am still feeling friendly with those foreigners(be it Chinamen,Filipinos or westerners) who work here.</p>
