HAHHAHHHAHA<br>Macham like donkey pushing the cart .<br><br>Not many will leave their comfort zone . In fact very few unless they have to in order to survive or in search of a better life.<br><br>Having said that , Singapore has a good education system if you have been schooled in the gifted program all your life - wait not good....EXCELLENT education system. As for me , I am not gifted but I learn an important lesson in life - if your daddy is very rich or have connections and make huge donations - you go to the best class in primary one , become a prefect from primary 3 onwards . Now if your daddy is really really filthy rich, you become head prefect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> benefit of being in a school like that , except my daddy is not that rich and not connected at all.<br><br>Crime happens everywhere . Low crime doesn't mean no crime. And you don't know when or WHETHER you will get hit . My mother got robbed in Singapore twice , once with me as a little kid . Of course Singapore is safer than Australia in terms of statistics.<br><br>Bribery ....so far never experienced bribery in Singapore or Australia at all.<br><br></div>

Singapore is a success, but success comes at the expense of the people, where the poor are marginalised. Singapore has a stable and peaceful environment, but it's not exclusive to Singapore, don't make it sound as if it's the only country in the world which has a stable environment.<br><br>Everybody in a decent country will be able to eimgrate, it's not only exclusive to Singaporeans. Even the mainland Chinese are able to emigrate and Singapore is grabbing them by the hordes.<br><br>What is corruption? The accepting of monetary rewards for favours by using one's position? You accept the payment of $1 million to $2 million to "help" perform some deed by abusing your authority. What Singapore has done is, pay off the $1 millon to $2 million to the person who is in a position to commit corruption. What does this tell us about the person in question, he does not have any principles, the extra payment is to stop him from accepting bribes from others.<br><br>To accept bribe and commit corruption in economic terms is a question of risk and rewards. What is the bribe and what are the consequences if you are caught. A person robbing someone of $10,000 in country A is sentenced to 1 week jail, while another person robbing someone of $10,000 in country B is sentence to 10 years jail. Which is a stronger deterrent? What the ruling party has done is, they are giving the $10,000 to the robber and telling the robber not to rob, the robber gets away with the reward without any risk at all.<br><br>You want a safer country at the expense of civil liberties? Why not try Democratic People's Republic of Korea? I heard it has very low crime rates too. If you want lower crime rates, just have public execution for thefts, rapes, robbery, pickpockets, embezzelment, kidnapping (oops, I think we already have death sentence of this crime) by our Gurkha firing squad. I am sure crime rates will drop lower.<br><br><a href="http://www.canadiancontent.net/profiles/North-Korea.html" rel="nofollow">Most "Canadian visitors to the DPRK do not experience problems. The crime rate is low. Petty crime occurs, especially at the airport in Pyongyang and in public markets."</a><br><br><a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA240032000" rel="nofollow">"In 1997, Amnesty International gathered detailed eyewitness accounts from independent and unconnected sources of at least 23 people, including one woman, who were publicly executed in several locations in North Korea between 1970 and 1992. The organization reported that the death penalty is handed down to those convicted of a wide ranges of crimes, from theft, to assault and rape, and murder.(22)" </a><br><br>Anyway, what gives another person to take another persons life? Who gave the government to take away the life of another person, life in itself is sacred. If a person has committed a heinous crime and is a danger to the population, shouldn't that person be isolated from the rest of the population, like in a penitentiary, instead of taking his/her life. If a person does not have the right to take his own life (committing suicide), what right has the government to take this person's life? Life is only worth living if you live in liberty, given a choice of living in a prison cell for 10 years and living in liberty for a year. Which would you choose?<br><br>"Emotionally bully"? I think you are distorting the picture, nobody is intimidating anybody into emigrating. We were just providing another perspective to another country's way of life. Unless you call the provision of information to forumers an emotional intimidation. It's always good to look at things from a wide range of perspectives instead of just looking at it from one direction (which is so typical of PAP supporters). Do you look at just the front view of a design, or do you look at the front view, side view and top view?</div>

Even the mainland Chinese are able to emigrate and Singapore is grabbing them by the hordes.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Not really, a lot of people are unable to emigrate because they don't have enough talent or cash. Most countries such as Australia and New Zealand only accepts emigrants with cash or ability. Most China Chinese are able to migrate because of cash, that's because they are the richer people within their society. Most Singaporeans that migrate are also able to do so either because they are rich enough or educated enough.

You accept the payment of $1 million to $2 million to "help" perform some deed by abusing your authority. What Singapore has done is, pay off the $1 millon to $2 million to the person who is in a position to commit corruption. What does this tell us about the person in question, he does not have any principles, the extra payment is to stop him from accepting bribes from others.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Not exactly, corruption in chinese is Tan Wu which mean "greed and dirty". A person being paid highy is not enough to justify him/her being corrupt, he or she has to take the money tru illegal or means which otherwise betrays the trust places upon him/her. </span><br><br>To accept bribe and commit corruption in economic terms is a question of risk and rewards. What is the bribe and what are the consequences if you are caught. A person robbing someone of $10,000 in country A is sentenced to 1 week jail, while another person robbing someone of $10,000 in country B is sentence to 10 years jail. Which is a stronger deterrent? What the ruling party has done is, they are giving the $10,000 to the robber and telling the robber not to rob, the robber gets away with the reward without any risk at all.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">A robber is not born as one, but forced into one by circumstance, cause robbing does involve risk and generally, if a robber is able to earn his keep, he will not rob. Thus a job is given to a person so he/she can earn his own keep</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I understand that the above answers with regards to corruption are not of satisfactory standard, but I do not wish to hijack another pple's thread. If you wishes to discuss more on corruption, we can do so by starting our own thread.</span><br><br>You want a safer country at the expense of civil liberties? Why not try Democratic People's Republic of Korea? I heard it has very low crime rates too. If you want lower crime rates, just have public execution for thefts, rapes, robbery, pickpockets, embezzelment, kidnapping (oops, I think we already have death sentence of this crime) by our Gurkha firing squad. I am sure crime rates will drop lower.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Everything has a price, and I think for Singapore's safety, our civil liberties were restricted by minimum amount. I mean, most of us can live in Singapore without having to worry about crossing the line very often. If the "expense of civil liberties" refers to restriction on freedom of expression, then yes, I'm sure we are not of the US's standard. But personally I'm not very impressed by US's freedom of speech which often encourages "borking" and irresponsible journalism. (Again, if you want to debate on balance of civil liberties vs security and such, let's do so in depth in a thread of our own.)</span><br><br><a href="http://www.canadiancontent.net/profiles/North-Korea.html" rel="nofollow">Most "Canadian visitors to the DPRK do not experience problems. The crime rate is low. Petty crime occurs, especially at the airport in Pyongyang and in public markets."</a><br><br><a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA240032000" rel="nofollow">"In 1997, Amnesty International gathered detailed eyewitness accounts from independent and unconnected sources of at least 23 people, including one woman, who were publicly executed in several locations in North Korea between 1970 and 1992. The organization reported that the death penalty is handed down to those convicted of a wide ranges of crimes, from theft, to assault and rape, and murder.(22)" </a><br><br>Anyway, what gives another person to take another persons life? Who gave the government to take away the life of another person, life in itself is sacred. If a person has committed a heinous crime and is a danger to the population, shouldn't that person be isolated from the rest of the population, like in a penitentiary, instead of taking his/her life. If a person does not have the right to take his own life (committing suicide), what right has the government to take this person's life? Life is only worth living if you live in liberty, given a choice of living in a prison cell for 10 years and living in liberty for a year. Which would you choose?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Ah yes, philosophical questions. I like.<br>What gives another person (the right) to take another person's life? The questions assumes that all men are born civilised and that life are somehow sacred by nature. But if we were to adopt Hobbes' assumption of bellum omnium contra omnes (war of all against all) in the state of nature, the question would have to be rephrase to be "What prevents another person from taking another person's life?" After all, if you were the size of Arnold, and I'm the size of kenny, and I'm filthy rich while you are dirt poor and there's no law to prevent you from taking what is mine. You might need little persuasion to simply walk over me and take what is mine to be yours. Afterall, who said that life is sacred? And if someone did, what is the basis of so?<br><br>Sure we can isolate a person from the society, but why must the society pay for it? If a law abiding but poor citizen has to starve and shiver on the streets, why should the society pay to provide for a murderer to live in relative comfort in a cell? If we were to choose to an economical mean of isolation which is like exiling the convict to some deserted island with no resources whatsoever and let him eventually suffer a slow lonely death of starvation, isn't more cruel than hanging him?<br><br>Yes, we can often hope to correct the convicts and help them integrate back into the society, but we must also not neglect the deterant factor of law. While I do not agree to some of the death sentences that our judicial has passed, I also do not think that we should go to the other extreme and remove death sentence altogether.<br><br>Life is only worth living in liberty? What is liberty then? If Singapore is to you but a cell, is the world not just a bigger cell for all of us? Are we humans anything but prisoner to our own abilities, are our bodies not the prison for our soul?</span><br><br>"Emotionally bully"? I think you are distorting the picture, nobody is intimidating anybody into emigrating. We were just providing another perspective to another country's way of life. Unless you call the provision of information to forumers an emotional intimidation. It's always good to look at things from a wide range of perspectives instead of just looking at it from one direction (which is so typical of PAP supporters). Do you look at just the front view of a design, or do you look at the front view, side view and top view?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I am of the view that the use of the word "Sillyporean" by the Coquitlam suggests that people who stayed on in Singapore are silly and that the only mean of not being silly is to migrate from Singapore. I'm also of the view that the sentence that suggests the migrants to laugh at "Sillyporeans" when "Sillypore" crashes to be of taunting nature and consist of emotional bullying element. However, it is a subjective feeling and I can understand if we do not share the same feeling, given our different stand.</span><br></div></blockquote></div>
