            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wisefool83:</div><div class="quote_body">As I answer 13 earlier, yes, it is legal, but immoral. So it means, you are greedy and prob plays a dirty hand, but legally speaking, it's not illegal. A proper legal system would therefore prevent this from happening. Why PAP ministers are able to give themselves great payrise but not get into serious trouble yet is because of the amount that they take.<br><br>Consider this, a pay of 2 million per annum per minister is going to cost a Singaporean less than 50cent per year. Even if we have a hundred of such minister, it's going to be $50 per annum, which amounts to about $4 per month. Wide spread corruption across the serivices however, as we are observing on the Traffic polices and custom officers in our neighbours however, are more costly on the individuals who run into them. In media, one very very angry voice is louder than thousands of not so very angry voice.<br><br>At the same time, highly paid ministers do not deter business investments, as investors do not foot the bill directly and since all taxes are transparent, the costs of investment are foreseeable. Which is more than I can say for lower level corruptions. Businesses are important to the average people as they are the ones, not the govt, who would be directly money to the masses.  (hmmm.... I've digress, but hey, if you can take all my hard earn money in your own world, I guess it's only fair I say all I want in my own thread)</div></blockquote>I find your point laughable, for the very reason it attempts to be very pragmatic without going the whole way.<br><br>So what you are saying in other words is that our government has no choice but to be corrupt if they are being paid any less then they are currently?<br><br>I seriously doubt that. We didn't pay our ministers peanuts before the pay rise, and the whole justification of controlling corruption is flawed to begin with- it is an excuse, not a real reason.<br><br>The bottom line is, if we can tolerate such legal immorality in our top ranks of government, which is supposed to consist of our "most upstanding" examples anyway, then there is no saying what else that will be tolerated in the name of "legality".<br><br>What this means is that instead of relying on the proper ways of curbing corruption, and that is to raise our people and soceity with proper moral values and character, we have opted to think that the alternative is acceptable, and that is to assume that morals are irrelevant and simply legalize and control corruption by making some forms of it legal.<br><br>There is something seriously wrong with this approach.<br><br>No soceity can be built on pragmatism alone, and if we take such a pragmatic approach towards corruption within our government, then there is no reason for the common Singaporean to bother with any idealism when it comes to anything else with Singapore.<br><br>Why serve NS when you are paid crumbs and face a 2-year disadvantage when you finally get out? Why defend a nation that exists soley on pragmatic values? Why put your life on the line for something that regards your rights as a sentient being as expendable in the interest of national survival?<br><br>The more we try to run our nation like a company, the less it becomes like a nation to its people.<br><br>The truth is, we can still be transparent and FAR cheaper to our own citizens and investors. The bogeyman of corruption is being used to jack up legal costs higher and higher when the real threat here is really GREED.<br><br>And frankly could you bother to think of a good point before you post?</div>
