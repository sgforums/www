Even if you go to Mong Kok where in most movies are the dens of gangsters, you don't see what the starter of the thread described. How do you classify a gangland?<br>There are many prostitutes in Singapore, many in geyland, KS street, ...Sometimes police find Thai prostitues operating from bushes in Mandai, and then got china prostitues soliciting old chi ko pek in HDB area. It is like prostitutes are everywhere leh, but we cannot say singapore is a prostitute land.<br>Many Singaporeans living in HK are unanimous in the feeling that HK is as safe as singapore, especially if you stay in HK island. Of course if you want drugs and things like that, you will find the triads very easily. Most triads operate in Macau, and I will call Macau a gangland because there the triads really clash with the police often, and among themselves more often. Reasons? the whole place is full of prostitutes, gambling dens, casino and the head shaking pills (don't what in english.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true that we learn as we grow. Then why do we need education? It's to diversify us in many ways such as manners, civilised character and etc. Imagine a place where there are not so much "hooligans" ( i do not call them ah bengs or etc. ) i think life would be much easier for the teachers to conduct lessons and everything. If we let them learn it through life experiences, there are already death cases or life time imprisonments that i've seen entering into the Jail. What's there to learn then? Stay in the jail, yes, a better person, can you get a chance to come out?<br><br>Experiences are well sought after by many. Why do we allow them to learn in the negative way and suffer?<br><br>A certain extent that i agree with Sky Foo that we should actually arrest them if suspected of cases of "Gangsterism". Gangsterism is personal perceived by individual, as for me, it's acts of against the law by youngster and usually in a mass.<br><br>They may have a black mark in their life. This can be changed. Probation has been given to kids who has broken the law. We have to learn to be flexible, police's arrest doesn't everytime require to need to leave a mark on a person's life. We can talk to time, send them to consultation and etc. (Which is really happening in real life)<br><br>A short period of intensive suffering such as rehabilitation is better than long period of running in fear and etc.<br><br>I've friends who have sold VCDs and have been expelled from schools. Are this kids given a chance to further pursue their studies even if they repent? No. Maybe they can go into night classes, but seldom they do.<br><br>That may not be the real life experience that anyone would seek in their lifes.</div>

Arrest them on what ground? selling pirated VCD? you sell anything without permit you can also be arrested. illegal assembly? few friends getting together illegal? have you seen them hiding weapons somewhere? How do you prove that they are from any secret society? Would you leave your name behind so that those who are wrongly arrested can take redress action?
