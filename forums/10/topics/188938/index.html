            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singaporeans not getting the opportunities they deserve: SDA's Steve Chia </strong><br><br>Talented Singaporeans are not getting the opportunities they deserve, says Steve Chia of the Singapore Democratic Alliance.<br><br>The party's candidate for Chua Chu Kang Single Member Constituency also paid a former People's Action Party MP an unexpected compliment.<br><br>Mr Chia said: "Is it true that there are no talents in Singapore? No, it's only true that many of us Singaporeans do not get the opportunity. So if you emphasise a Singaporeans first policy than more people will get the opportunity to get good jobs, meaningful jobs, jobs that you like and you enjoy.<br><br>"I will conclude by quoting a PAP MP. This MP is my idol. You know who is he? Tan Soo Khoon. It's sad that he is no longer inside(Parliament) because he dares to speak. He said one thing during the transport fare hike debate. After the 2001 election, everything goes up - public transport fares go up, refuse collection fees goes up, carpark charges goes up. He said: remember the people will not forget."<br><br>Speaking at a rally on Wednesday, SDA chief Chiam See Tong says that it is the PAP's fault that lifts do not stop on every floor in HDB blocks.<br><br>Residents, he says, are paying for that mistake now.<br><br>Mr Chiam said: "Given the chance to build those flats, I'll make sure that lifts stop at every floor. Do you know now they're talking about upgrading so that lifts stop at every floor. In the first place, it is the government's mistake. 20 to 30 years ago when they build those flats, they could not foresee that residents will get old, cannot walk. So, it is they who are wrong...they build flats with lifts that do not stop at every floor."<br><br>He also rebutted PAP leaders' claims that the Potong Pasir Town Council does not have the funds for lift upgrading.<br><br>He said: "Our statement of account (shows) we've a profit of about $8 million...they say now the rules have been changed to make it very strict, to make it very difficult for opposition. If you want to upgrade the flats for your residents, you can only take 10 percent of the sinking funds, or about $800,000."<br><br>"In Lorong 8, Toa Payoh, we built 29 lifts for only $2 million. When we reported our upgrading of flats to the HDB, they say impossible, you can't build with $2 million, at least $4 million needed. You see HDB, PAP prices are very high. So from our estimates, we can build lifts for 8 blocks of flats, instead of for four."<br><br>The SDA has also accused the PAP government of not delivering on its promises.<br><br>SDA candidate Yip Yew Weng, who is contesting Yio Chu Kang SMC, asked if the PAP had delivered its promises why were Singaporeans not enjoying a Swiss standard of living.<br><br>He said: "Do you want to live under a one-party system with no checks and balances, ask yourself... Do you want to live with high costs of living. Or do you want to live with uncertainty, in terms of job prospects?<br><br>"PM Lee Hsien Loong has recently said that the PAP has delivered most of the promises made. If that's the case, we would have been enjoying a life with the so-call Swiss living standard but it's not. If that's the case, we would have been enjoying a life without fear, without worrying whether we'll have to face all sorts of unemployment problems."<br><br>Speaking at a rally in Yio Chu Kang on Wednesday, SDA candidate for Jalan Besar, Dr Vincent Yeo, zoomed in on the needs of disabled children, saying the government can do more for the disabled.<br><br>He said: "But some of these children are suffering from a syndrome - autism, autistic kids. They need help. There's only one place. A place called Pathlight - a school for autistic kids. The only place they have. Now children with learning disabilities, the treatment at private clinics and hospitals are very expensive because you need a speech therapist like occupational therapist, they charge a $100 an hour. What I am trying to tell you is that there're not enough resources in there." - CNA/ch<br><br></div>
