            <div class='col-md body'>the malaysians never ceases to amze me. wasn't that pathetic offer of joint patrols really distasteful and inappropriate? it was clearly obvious to the casual observor that they were trying vainly to draw attention to their weak assertions that pedra branca is theirs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i kind of like tony tan reply to the offer of joint patrol.....he said that that is spore waters and the accident happened in spore water...... also the way he said it is to me quite casual, but if we read behind the lines, that demostrates the govt resolve and resilence in this issue........ although the accident is unfortunate, but this accident have somewhat strenghten our resolve in claiming the rock, lives have been lost while ensuring that no intruder actually steps into our soil..... and lets hope that the lives the 3 heroines were not lost in vain......we will keep the rock...let no one question it.</div>

They failed to understand that it is our soil, oops eh...Our water to protect. If he can take our soldiers patrolling at his house garden, then why not accept his offer. hehehehehe...
