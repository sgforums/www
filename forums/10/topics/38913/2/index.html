However, Seoul looks very peaceful at that. There has never been any peace between the capitalist South and the socialist North. The treaty of 1953 stipulated the cease-fire, although Koreas never managed to sign anything pertaining to the cessation of the state of war. That is why, South Korea has been living under the constant threat of a military incursion from the North for decades already. The worldÂ’s largest artillery group, thousands of soldiers and tanks are located tens of kilometers off Seoul. Relations between South and North have improved lately, so the issue of a military incursion is not as actual as it was ten years ago. Yet, the potential danger is still there.<br><br>North Korean military men have never made a secret of who they are going to wage war with. As it is known, the war started in June of 1950, but it ended up with no result. Virtually, there are no military actions nowadays, disregarding short skirmishes and raids at the border. However, it does not mean that the two Koreas get ready to wage war on each other.<br><br>North Korean Armed Forces were established at USSRÂ’s active mediation. The USSR delivered defense technology, provided advisors, organized training for North Korean officers. N.KoreaÂ’s first military charters were simply translations of adequate instructions of the Soviet Union. N.Korean military units were organized like a copy of Soviet ones. Even first army plans were first written in Russian and then translated into Korean. It is worth mentioning that the Chinese influence was considerable as well. The command of the Korean National Army of 1940s-1950s consisted of ethnic Koreans of China. At first, they participated in the Chinese revolutionary movement, but then were sent to Korea to render the international assistance to the young Korean state. The situation started changing after 1960, when the relations between Pyongyang, Moscow and Beijing worsened a lot. That was caused with the growing conflict between the two communist superpowers, first and foremost. The N.Korean administration was not willing to participate in exacerbating relations between the USSR and China. Probably, that was a correct position for North Korea to take, although both the Soviet and the Chinese help decreased considerably. On the other hand, the N.Korean economy was rather fine back in those years, so the country managed to set up its own production of weapons Â– artillery systems, tanks, submarines and even tactic missiles.<br><br>To all appearances, North Korean military men planned to invade the South. Their prime goal was to unite the country. The Soviet leadership was very well aware of Pyongyang dreamersÂ’ wishes, so the USSR feared, that such a military intrigue might lead to lamentable consequences both for N.Korea and for the whole world. That was one of the reasons why the Soviet Union did not hurry to arm North Korea at that period of time. Nevertheless, both Moscow and Beijing continued rendering military assistance to Pyongyang.<br><br>The situation changed a lot after the year 1990. The USSR stopped its existence, while China lost its interest in the former ally. As a result, North Korea experienced an incredible economic crisis. The Gross Domestic Product of the country dropped two or three times, the country was gripped with hunger, hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of that.<br><br>The North Korean government has always emphasized the armed forces role. The highest official position in North Korea is not the position of the president, but of the chairman of the defense council. The N.Korean army does not suffer from hunger, for a hungry army is dangerous. There are no doubts that North Korea still plans new strikes on Seoul nowadays too, although it is more of a mechanical matter now. Anyway, it is not excluded that the isolated North Korean regime might stake it all and launch the new war. This apprehension is probably groundless, although this is exactly what a lot of Western countries think.<br><br>As it is considered, in case if the new Korean war is launched, North Korea will deploy thousands of commandos on the southern territory of the Korean peninsula. They will perform explosions of roads, bridges, tunnels, power lines, airdromes and airbases and so on. They will also be ordered to destroy American military men, or those, who look like them. N.Korean generals believe that the up-to-date American society is very sensitive to human losses. They believe, if there are a lot of victims, Americans might agree for a truce on the conditions that will be good for Pyongyang. In addition to that, the activity of thousands of commandos will cause chaos in the rear it will and minimize South KoreaÂ’s military and technical predominance. Battle planes will be absolutely useless, if the majority of pilots are killed. Tanks will be useless too, if all bridges are blown up.<br><br>North Korea has been developing weapons of mass destruction since 1970s. At first they developed the cheap chemical weapon, and then they started dealing with the nuclear one. The information on that transpired in the world press at the end of the 1980s. In 1994 there was a document signed, pertaining to which the activity of N.Korean nuclear centers was put under the international control. The USA, South Korea and Japan agreed to build a nuclear power plant in North Korea and to deliver liquid fuel in return. However, there is no certainty nowadays that North Korea does not have its own nuclear weapons.<br><br>The production of missiles started in North Korea in the 1970s, on the base of Chinese and Soviet examples. N.Korea possessed 500 kilometers range missiles by the end of the 1980s. The country was able to hit targets on the entire territory of South Korea. Better missiles appeared in the beginning of the 1990s. To crown it all, in August of 1998, North Korea performed the first launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. The launch was not really successful, but the world was very nervous about it. Anyway, that was the prime goal to achieve Â– to intimidate the world. Both nuclear weapons and missiles solve double problems. They are supposed to cause irreparable damage to the enemy and to make the USA withdraw its troops from Korea. That would be perfect for the N.Korean leadership. The availability of missiles and nuclear weapons without any war plays the role of Â“export goods.Â” When N.Korean diplomats conduct negotiations with the West, they agree to suspend the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, asking for a lot of money in return (as a compensation for their refusal to use nuclear power or for theeir refusal to make very profitable deals with Iran and Libya). Official treaties prove that the USA, Japan and South Korea are ready to pay off the nuclear menace.<br><br>However, the N.Korean army is basically a low-technology army. North Korea has undemanding soldiers that are ready to eat one cup of rice a day, to walk 40 kilometers a day, and to sleep on the ground. The North has a lot of such soldiers. There are one million two hundred thousand people in the N.Korean Army. One million and thirty thousand of them serve in the infantry. North Korean men serve for five or seven years. Needless to mention that such a huge army became an unbearable burden for the country against the background of a very serious economic crisis. The N.Korean government wants to make its army self-sufficient, using soldiers for agricultural and construction works. There are 176 divisions and brigade in the Korean National Army. The army is armed with almost four thousand tanks, 2300 armored vehicles. The N.Korean artillery counts 13.800 pieces of ordnance. The artillery group of North Korea is considered to be the most powerful group in the whole world. The Air Force of North Korea counts 1690 planes and choppers. However, the majority of all those machines are very old and out of date. No one doubts that the North Korean aviation will not create serious problems on the Korean peninsula in case of a war. South Korean and American forces will take a greater advantage at once. The same can be said about the North Korean navy too. North Korean submarines are rather primitive. Yet, they are capable of causing considerable damage to the South Korean shipping. S.Korea depends a lot on the sea trade, that is why North Korea paid so much attention to the navy. About two-third of the N.Korean army is concentrated close to the possible front line.<br><br>The geography of the Korean peninsula allows to guess the direction of S.KoreanÂ’s strikes. Mountains exclude any army movement on the border between the North and the South. A large-scale offensive is possible either on the eastern or on the western coastlines. The second direction is a lot more preferable, for Seoul is only 30-40 kilometers far from the front line. The North Korean Army is concentrated on that area.<br><br>Anyway, there is a hope that the plans of the North Korean General Headquarters will remain just plans. It seems that recent events give a reason to believe that, although one should not relax. The Korean peninsula is still one of the most dangerous areas of the planet.<br><br>Andrey Lankov<br>Seoul Herald<br><br>PRAVDA.Ru<br><br>21:00 2003-03-24<br><br></div>

It accuses Washington of inciting the dispute over its suspected nuclear weapons programs to create an excuse for invasion.<br><br>"No-one can vouch that the US will not spark the second Iraqi crisis on the Korean Peninsula," North Korea's state-run Minju Joson newspaper said.<br><br>North Korea will "increase its national defence power on its own without the slightest vacillation no matter what others may say", the paper said.<br><br>Pyongyang said yesterday that Washington is using the war against Iraq as a test for military action against the North.<br><br>advertisement<br><br>advertisement<br><br>South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun yesterday dismissed the allegation as "inaccurate and groundless". He said US officials have repeatedly pledged to resolve the issue peacefully.<br><br>Early this month, Bush said he believed the standoff could be resolved diplomatically, but noted that it could be resolved militarily if diplomacy fails.<br><br>South Korea is a strong ally of the United States, which has 37,000 troops based in the South.<br><br>Tensions between the two Koreas have been mounting over the nuclear crisis.<br><br>The North suspended a meeting with South Korea this week after Seoul put its military on heightened alert amid fear that North Korea might use the distraction of war in Iraq to attempt provocations. It said the South Korean move pushed the situation to "the brink of war".<br><br>In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called North Korea's cancellation of this week's bilateral meeting "regrettable".<br><br>"We have always supported North-South dialogue," Boucher said. "We think it's important to resolve the bilateral issues. And it's a good channel to make clear to the North Koreans that they must end their nuclear arms program."<br><br>With the United States focused on Iraq, experts fear North Korea might use the opportunity to test a long-range missile or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. That would be viewed as an attempt to force Washington into direct negotiations. The United States only wants talks with the North in a multilateral setting.<br><br>The standoff flared in October when US officials said Pyongyang admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 pact.<br><br>Washington and its allies suspended oil shipments, promised under that agreement, and Pyongyang retaliated by taking steps to reactivate a nuclear facility capable of producing several bombs within months and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<br><br>- AP<br><br></div>

Gen. James A. Coggin, interviewed on a hilltop overlooking the exercises. "This is part of our continuous training. It takes place every year and was planned long ago. It is normal, routine."<br><br>But a dispute over North Korea's nuclear weapons program has made the region tense. North Korea has taken steps that could lead to production of nuclear weapons material, expelled U.N. weapons monitors and abandoned past agreements to limit its nuclear ambitions. The North Korean government has fired short-range rockets into the Sea of Japan and appeared to prepare for a test of a longer-range ballistic missile. This month, its MiG fighters approached a U.S. military reconnaissance plane the Pentagon said was in international airspace.<br><br>In reply to provocations, Washington has stepped up aerial and naval surveillance of North Korea, moved bombers within range and warned that a "military option" is always available.<br><br>"Our soldiers read the papers. They listen to the media and get on the Internet," said Coggin, one of the top officers overseeing the exercises.<br><br>"I think [the North Korean situation] creates a certain maturity in them. It requires them to recognize in a sobering way that this is a real world with real threats."<br><br>Maj. Gen. George A. Higgins, the operations officer for U.S. forces in South Korea, said in an interview in Seoul that the exercises were not intended to inflame North Korea.<br><br>"Very deliberately, we take pains not to operate in a provocative manner," he said. On Wednesday, the U.S.-led U.N. Command delivered a message to North Korean officers at the Panmunjom meeting place in the Demilitarized Zone, explaining the exercises were not offensive.

The headquarters of U.S. ground forces is located in Yongsan, in the heart of Seoul.<br><br>Their locations are up for review and they are likely to be relocated southward.<br><br>The presidential advisor said Seoul has not received any reassurances from the United States. ``Both sides understand that they will consult each other before making any decision,Â¡Â¯Â¡Â¯ he said.<br><br>Richard Lawless, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, is scheduled to visit Seoul next month for the first official round of consultations.<br><br>Regarding speculation that North Korea, which U.S. President Bush called a part of an ``axis of evil,Â¡Â¯Â¡Â¯ together with Iraq and Iran, will be the next U.S. target, Kim quoted Gen. Leon LaPorte, American commander of ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command, as saying that the North is different from Iraq and Washington doesnÂ¡Â¯t have any intention to attack the Stalinist country.<br><br>``Gen.

            <div class='col-md body'>U.S. - South Korea War Simulation Turns Really Ugly: US looks over its shoulder at North Korea<br><br>F.T. Times, FT.com<br><br>March 27, 2003<br><br>It was defeat on a scale not experienced by the US military since the Vietnam war.<br><br>One by one, the UStanks streaming down the wooded hillside were struck by enemy fire from the valley below until nearly all 50 were eliminated.<br><br>"That was ugly," said a US commander watching the debacle from a safe distance, as smoke billowed across the muddy battlefield.<br><br>Fortunately for the US, the location was not Iraq and it was not real conflict. Instead, it was a training exercise yesterday morning in the mountains of South Korea, where the US keeps 37,000 troops to defend the country against the communist North.<br><br>On this occasion, the enemy was South Korean forces, using laser beams to simulate live fire. But, if war breaks out between the US and North Korea, as some think it might, yesterday's grisly game would be for real.<br><br>Many in north-east Asia fear that once Iraq is dealt with, North Korea, a fellow member of US President George W. Bush's "axis of evil", could be the next target of Washington's drive against rogue states seeking weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>Washington insists it has no plans to invade North Korea but refuses to rule out air strikes against the state's nuclear facilities if Pyongyang starts to produce plutonium for use in nuclear weapons.<br><br>However, yesterday's drill - part of an annual exercise to test the readiness of US and South Korean forces - brought a reminder that war in Korea would be a more serious undertaking than the campaign under way in Iraq.<br><br>"Unlike Iraq, this is very complex, mountainous terrain," said Jim Coggin, brigadier general of the US second infantry division, involved in yesterday's exercise. "Precision munitions fired from high altitude or long distance would be less effective in Korea than Iraq. War here would be up close and personal and very brutal."<br><br>According to US estimates, 50,000 US servicemen and 1m South Koreans, mostly civilians, would die in the first month of conflict. The North's 1m-strong army would engage in bloody hand-to-hand combat, while its thousands of artillery systems and tanks would rain fire, including chemical weapons, across the border. In addition to human costs, the South Korean economy, Asia's third-largest, would be thrown into chaos.<br><br>For these reasons and others - including almost certain opposition to war from Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing - most analysts think a pre-emptive US strike against North Korea is unlikely.<br><br>North Korea has escalated tensions on the peninsula in recent months with a series of provocative military gestures, calculating that the US is even less likely to attack while preoccupied with Iraq. Analysts say Pyongyang's threatening behaviour is designed to extract the security guarantees and economic assistance it needs from the US to preserve its crumbling regime.<br><br>Washington has resisted North Korea's demands, insisting it will not submit to "blackmail", but the US administration is divided over how to resolve the crisis. Hawkish officials favour a hardline approach, such as economic sanctions or military action, while more dovish elements would prefer to negotiate. "The Bush administration is in a state of paralysis over North Korea," said one former US government official.<br><br>Yoon Young-kwan, South Korea's foreign minister, travelled to Washington yesterday for talks aimed at breaking the deadlock and narrowing policy differences between the US and South Korea, which advocates dialogue with the North.<br><br>Maurice Strong, the United Nations envoy to North Korea, warned earlier this week that the longer the stand-off between Pyongyang and Washington continued, the greater the chance that the crisis could spiral out of control.<br><br>Dan Bolger, a US army colonel observing yesterday's exercise 20km south of the border with North Korea, gave a frank assessment of the risk. "There's been fighting before, right here where we're standing, and there could be fighting here again," he said. "The message to North Korea is: 'If you want to test us, we're ready'.<br><br>"America has shown in Iraq it has the will to back up its words with action. They cannot assume we will not do anything."<br><br>However, US troops involved in yesterday morning's ill-fated exercise are unlikely to relish conflict. They repeated the drill in the afternoon to rectify their mistakes.<br><br>In war, there would be no second chance<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>N. Korean Nuke Dispute Looms in Iraq War<br>Thu Mar 27, 1:52 AM ET<br><br>By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer<br><br>SEOUL, South Korea - If the United States ever threatens to bomb North Korea (news - web sites)'s nuclear facilities, one South Korean activist says he would try to send so-called "human shields" of civilians to protect the site from attack.<br><br>It's a whimsical idea: getting permission to enter North Korea is tough, even for its few sympathizers, and the Yongbyon nuclear complex is one of the most restricted military areas in a nation where travel is circumscribed.<br><br>Still, activist Ko Young-dae's improbable plan is an example of how some Koreans are beginning to think about Â— and brace for Â— a conflict in their region once the war in Iraq (news - web sites) ends and the United States focuses on North Korea's suspected efforts to develop nuclear weapons.<br><br>"Our human shield plan is a way to stop a war from breaking out on the Korean Peninsula," Ko said.<br><br>The United States seeks a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute, but has not ruled out a military option. U.S. officials say they consult closely with South Korea (news - web sites), an ally that fiercely opposes military action against the North because of the threat of widespread destruction.<br><br>"There will be no war on the Korean Peninsula as long as we do not want a war," South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said Wednesday. He was quoted by his office.<br><br>Some analysts believe the standoff with North Korea is essentially on hold now that the Iraq conflict is underway. The North had staged a series of military maneuvers that were seen as attempts to goad the United States into talks, but has been quiet since U.S.-led forces attacked Iraq last week.<br><br>"North Korea had hurried to try to bring the United States to talks before the Iraq war. They missed the timing, and are now just observing the situation," said Koh Yu-hwan, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.<br><br>"North Korea believes that no matter what it does, the United States does not have time to pay attention," he said. "It also fears the international community would turn its back on it if it crossed the red line now."<br><br>The so-called "red line" is widely perceived as a possible decision to start reprocessing spent fuel rods at Yongbyon that could yield enough plutonium to make several nuclear bombs within months. North Korea earlier reactivated a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor, but U.S. officials say any tampering with the fuel rods is a more immediate threat.<br><br>For now, North Korea appears to be hunkering down, announcing on Wednesday that it was pulling out of weekly military meetings with the U.S.-led U.N. Command at the border village of Panmunjom. It also canceled a round of economic talks with South Korea that were scheduled for this week.<br><br>North Korea has complained bitterly about U.S.-South Korean exercises now underway in the South, saying they are a preparation for war. But one analyst said the drills may have deterred further Northern military actions like the March 2 interception of a U.S. military surveillance plane.<br><br>"The timing of the exercise here, coinciding with the start of the (Iraq) war, has probably helped to reinforce the message that the U.S. really wants to focus on the situation in Iraq, but that it's also prepared for other contingencies," said Scott Snyder, head of the Asia Foundation office in Seoul.<br><br>Chung Jong-wook, former national security adviser to the presidential Blue House in the 1990s, said North Korea could try to develop nuclear weapons rather than wait for the United States to come to the negotiating table. Washington believes North Korea already has one or two atomic bombs.<br><br>"Perhaps we are in for a more serious situation," said Chung, comparing the confrontation to a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear site. "North Korea may be moving very fast to make it fait accompli before the end of the war in Iraq."<br><br>That depends on how long the war lasts, and whether North Korea is technically capable and politically willing to push ahead rapidly with nuclear weapons development. But the fear that it could do so remains constant, however much the world is focused on Iraq.<br><br>Ko, the activist, says he will urge U.S., European and Japanese activists to try to go to Pyongyang if war looms. But he's fuzzy on the details of who will go, and when, and how.<br><br>"Our plan will materialize more clearly after the U.S. war on Iraq ends," he said.<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=516&amp;ncid=731&amp;e=5&amp;u=/ap/20030327/ap_on_re_as/koreas_after_iraq" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=516&amp;ncid=731&amp;e=5&amp;u=/ap/20030327/ap_on_re_as/koreas_after_iraq</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>N. Korea's inactivity puzzles South, U.S.<br>Julie Chao - Cox International Correspondent<br>Thursday, March 27, 2003<br><br>Seoul, South Korea --- Officials here and in Washington had expected that as soon as the war in Iraq started, North Korea would commit yet another provocative act to increase the pressure on the United States.<br><br>Instead, the unpredictable regime has vexed observers yet again by doing next to nothing.<br><br>On Wednesday, North Korea severed the only regular military contact it had with the U.S.-led United Nations command that monitors the Korea War armistice. Cutting off the regular meetings at the DMZ, or demilitarized zone, further isolates Pyongyang.<br><br>''It is meaningless for us to discuss something with them when the U.S. forces continue to be arrogant,'' the North's official news agency, KCNA, quoted the North Korean phone message to the U.N. command as saying.<br><br>Still, North Korea has been relatively quiet compared to its aggressive acts over the past several months, including test-firing missiles and sending fighter jets to intercept an American reconnaissance plane.<br><br>Experts say North Korea is nervously watching the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and wondering if it will be the next target. Its next move will depend largely on whether the United States achieves quick victory or gets bogged down.<br><br>''North Korea is pretty nervous now,'' said Koh Byung-chul, director of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. ''They think they might be next. Right now they seem to be relieved the war is not going well for the United States.''<br><br>The Bush administration hopes to make clear to Pyongyang that it should not take advantage of the war in Iraq.<br><br>A State Department official asked Han Park, director of the University of Georgia's Center for the Study of Global Issues, to deliver a message to Pyongyang while he is there this week for an academic conference.<br><br>The official "said it's a mistake for North Korea to assume the United States is preoccupied with Iraq,'' Park, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, said in an interview in Seoul before his departure.<br><br>To be sure, North Korea continues to churn out anti-American propaganda. And minor incidents have occurred, such as North Korean fishing boats straying into South Korean waters Tuesday. Last week, North Korea postponed economic talks it was scheduled to have with South Korea.<br><br>Park Joun-young, professor of political science at Ewha Womens University, said North Korea is taking a ''wait and see'' approach. If the Iraq war is over quickly, North Korea will likely act more cautiously.<br><br>However, ''if the American attack drags on, then North Korea might think about taking some more provocative actions,'' Park said.<br><br>Experts do not discount the possibility of another missile test, this time of a longer-range ballistic missile capable of reaching Japan.<br><br>North Korea has denounced the war in Iraq and said it has been compelled to prepare a ''justified self-defense'' against a possible U.S. attack. It has warned of a ''second Iraqi crisis on the Korean Peninsula.''<br><br><a href="http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/epaper/editions/thursday/news_e3284a984157a1fa10c1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/epaper/editions/thursday/news_e3284a984157a1fa10c1.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Civilian Evacuation Practiced in S. Korea<br>Fri Mar 28, 5:01 AM ET<br><br>By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer<br><br>UIJONGBU, South Korea - Army wives put on bar-coded bracelets, picked up free Bibles and climbed into a helicopter to escape a fictional attack as the U.S. troops practiced evacuating civilians in the event of war with North Korea (news - web sites).<br><br>The biannual exercise, meant to simulate the sudden flight of tens of thousands of foreigners, began this week amid heightened tensions over North Korea's suspected efforts to build nuclear weapons. Troops registered families of U.S. soldiers at makeshift processing centers, then ferried some by plane and boat all the way to "safety" in Japan.<br><br>"Our job is to get them out of harm's way," said Sgt. 1st Class Michael Robinson of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a coordinator of the operation at Camp Red Cloud, a U.S. military base in Uijongbu near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.<br><br>Officials said the regular exercise is not a response to the recent nuclear dispute. Tension, as well as armed clashes, have ebbed and spiked on the peninsula ever since the 1950-53 Korean War.<br><br>The U.S. Embassy says there are 65,000 to 75,000 U.S. civilians in South Korea (news - web sites), and that efforts would be made to evacuate all if war looms. At least 14,000 are family members of the 37,000 U.S. troops deployed in the South. The United States might also make arrangements with other countries to evacuate some of their nationals.<br><br>An evacuation would start at a place like Camp Red Cloud, where soldiers logged names, blood types and social security (news - web sites) numbers in computers on Thursday. Civilians were issued paper bracelets with bar codes that allow them to be tracked at each stage of the evacuation.<br><br>A U.S Army chaplain handed out copies of the Bible, the Quran, the Jewish Bible and Buddhist teachings. Military paralegals were available to advise on powers of attorney, and writing a will.<br><br>A dozen exercise volunteers Â— all wives of military personnel Â— then boarded a U.S. Army CH-47D Chinook helicopter for a 50-minute flight to Camp Humphreys, south of Seoul.<br><br>On Friday, they boarded a train for a four-hour ride to the southern port of Busan. Then they transferred to a U.S. military C-130 transport plane for a three-hour trip to Iwakuni Air Base in Japan.<br><br>The U.S. military believes American bases in Japan could be a target of North Korean missiles, and the final destination for evacuees would be the United States. But the mood of the volunteer "evacuees" hardly matched the panic and chaos that the real thing might entail.<br><br>They joked about the bumpy helicopter ride, drank a few bottles of red wine at an Italian restaurant at Camp Humphreys, and chatted about shopping plans in Japan before their return to South Korea on Sunday.<br><br>"I don't really feel the threat," said Paula Willis, a Denison, Texas native who worked on similar evacuation exercises in Germany before she ended her own career as a soldier.<br><br>"North Korea wants South Korea, they want the country itself," she said. "I wouldn't do damage to something I wanted."<br><br>U.S. military planners and South Koreans who lived through the Korean War might disagree, citing the North Korean invasion in 1950 that triggered war and devastation across the divided peninsula.<br><br>Today, the North Korean military is a much weaker force when measured against the South Korean and American armies, and political and economic contacts with the South are more frequent than during the Cold War years.<br><br>Still, tension over the North's nuclear programs persists despite diplomatic efforts to solve the problem. Large concentrations of firepower and battle-ready troops remain arrayed on both sides of the Korean border.<br><br>South Korea has one of the world's biggest economies and a highly developed transport infrastructure. But it sits on the southern tip of a peninsula, so civilians would have to get out by sea or air.<br><br>Evacuees would be asked to bring a three-day supply of food and water, and are allowed two bags weighing up to 66 pounds. The allotment can include a pet that weighs no more than 25 pounds. Animals left behind would be kept in makeshift kennels.<br><br>Robinson, the coordinator at Camp Red Cloud, said an ideal evacuation would take place before a war breaks out, presumably while tensions are building up to conflict.<br><br>"The plan is to be proactive," he said. "By the time we start to be reactive, it's already too late. The roads of escape will no longer be there."<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=516&amp;ncid=731&amp;e=4&amp;u=/ap/20030328/ap_on_re_as/koreas_evacuation_drill" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=516&amp;ncid=731&amp;e=4&amp;u=/ap/20030328/ap_on_re_as/koreas_evacuation_drill</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>North Korea says it will be next once U.S. beats Iraq<br>Fri Mar 28, 6:40 AM ET<br><br>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea (news - web sites) said on Friday that U.S.-South Korean military exercises this month were a "test nuclear war" that showed the United States was getting ready to attack the communist state after the war in Iraq (news - web sites).<br><br>"It is becoming certain that, in case the U.S. imperialists' invasion of Iraq is 'successful', they will wage a new war of aggression on the Korean peninsula at the same time or move the stage of 'anti-terrorist war' to the Korean peninsula in high spirits to invade the DPRK (North Korea) after occupying Iraq," North Korea's ruling party newspaper said.<br><br>In a spate of commentaries on Friday that attacked the United States, the Rodong Sinmun daily took aim at the annual U.S.-South Korean war games, which wind up on April 2.<br><br>"We cannot but take a serious view of the large-scale frantic test nuclear war, a preliminary war against the DPRK staged by the U.S. on the sidelines of the Iraqi war," the daily said.<br><br>On Wednesday, North Korea pulled out of border liaison talks, the only channel for military talks with the United States, saying the war games meant it was meaningless for its officers to meet Americans.<br><br>This raised tensions that are already high over the North's suspected nuclear ambitions and the U.S.-led war in Iraq.<br><br>The United States had invited North Korea to observe and discuss the exercises, which Seoul and Washington say are annual and defensive. North Korea turned down an offer to hold talks between generals to discuss the drills.<br><br>President George W. Bush (news - web sites) has said Iraq, Iran and North Korea are part of the same "axis of evil".<br><br>The Rodong Sinmun said after the first two acts of U.S. military strategy under the Bush government, in Afghanistan (news - web sites) and Iraq, "there is no doubt that they will open its third act on the Korean peninsula".<br><br>"But they should clearly understand it. The DPRK is not Afghanistan nor Iraq," the daily said.<br><br>North Korea has taken a series of steps to ratchet up pressure on the United States since Washington's announcement in October that Pyongyang had admitted to pursuing a covert programme to enrich uranium for weapons.<br><br>North Korea denies having a nuclear weapons programme, although it defends its right to build such weapons.<br><br>In December, the North expelled U.N. nuclear inspectors and it pulled out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in January.<br><br>North Korea test-fired two cruise missiles into the Sea of Japan in late February and early March, and North Korean fighters buzzed a U.S. spy plane in international airspace on March 2.<br><br>Some analysts have said North Korea might make provocative moves such as a ballistic missile test to draw Washington's attention during the Iraq conflict.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Events in Iraq Give Pyongyang New Confidence<br>Stratfor Intelligence<br><br>Mar 27, 2003<br><br>Summary<br><br>As Japan prepares for its first spy satellite launch March 28, it is stepping up observation of North Korea over concerns that Pyongyang might test a ballistic missile around the same time. And North Korea may well be preparing another missile test, particularly as U.S. forces get ready to encounter Iraqi forces around Baghdad. North Korea has been studying the war on Iraq and has taken some hope from the Iraqi strategy thus far ...<br><br>Analysis<br><br>Japan will launch its first two indigenous spy satellites March 28, four and a half years after being taken by surprise when a North Korean Taepo Dong-I flew over Hokkaido in Pyongyang's first attempted satellite launch. Tokyo is stepping up its watchfulness of its neighbor over concerns that Pyongyang might take this opportunity to test another long-range ballistic missile.<br><br>And North Korea's leaders, who convened the sixth session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly on March 26, might well be considering another missile launch soon, particularly as they watch the U.S. military action in Iraq. From Pyongyang's viewpoint, the fighting there offers new insights into U.S. readiness and war-fighting capability...<br><br>North Korea was slow to react to the onset of military action in Iraq, but when it did, it strongly condemned the action as a "grave encroachment upon sovereignty." A Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement cautioning that "this high-handed action of the U.S. against Iraq and the war preparations now being made by the U.S. and its followers in the Korean Peninsula compel the DPRK to do all it can to defend itself."<br><br>Pyongyang is carefully studying the war in Iraq, as it represents a test case of U.S. will and ability to disarm and "liberate" a member of Washington's so-called "axis of evil." But far from the expectations so widely touted in international media, the Iraqi people have not risen up against their government, the military has not deserted en masse and the regime has not collapsed. Instead, irregular forces have carried out harassment attacks against rear-area positions while regular forces have established a ring of defenses around Baghdad. And despite some limited signs of popular revolt, the military campaign seems if anything to be strengthening the resolve of the Iraqi people to resist -- or at least not directly support -- the U.S. campaign.<br><br>From Pyongyang's view, the lesson of Iraq thus far is that, although the United States has a technologically superior military, it is not suited to a war where the stated aim is disarmament and liberating the citizens of a nation from their own government. If North Korea launched an attack on South Korea, officials in Pyongyang know that the technological might of the U.S. military would triumph. However, if Washington decided to disarm North Korea pre-emptively, its own rules of engagement would hinder it from fully using its superior firepower and force projection -- leaving U.S. forces vulnerable to irregular and asymmetrical warfare from the North Koreans.<br><br>Pyongyang is taking hope from this assessment of U.S. military actions in Iraq. If North Korea refrains from striking first, the United States will be tied by a set of combat constraints that significantly narrows the technology gap between the U.S. and North Korean forces. And even if Washington eventually wins in Iraq, the message already will have been delivered: Unilateral attempts at disarmament and regime change are no cakewalk. Since Pyongyang has little interest in instigating a full-scale war with the United States, the regime now feels more confident in its ability to withstand a U.S. assault under the aegis of "liberating" the North Korean people from their own leadership or "disarming" a rogue nation.<br><br>That said, in order to gain maximum leverage against the United States, leaders in Pyongyang feel they must move now to take advantage of the military situation in Iraq. Thus, the North Korean regime has withdrawn from military liaison talks with the United States, warned that "no one can vouch that the U.S. will not spark the second Iraqi crisis on the Korean Peninsula," and moved vehicles around its nuclear and missile facilities -- in plain view of U.S. satellites. Pyongyang also has delayed talks with Seoul and threatened that the upcoming Japanese satellite launch will only ensure Japan's destruction.<br><br>Rhetoric will not be enough to press home the dire nature of the situation in North Korea to Washington, Pyongyang has seen, and North Korea may well be preparing two more concrete steps to up the ante: firing up the nuclear reprocessing facilities and launching another long-range ballistic missile. Both moves would trigger an outcry from South Korea and Japan, thus pressuring the United States to address the situation immediately. And in North Korea's calculations, Washington has only two choices in such circumstances: either launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korean facilities or accede to bilateral talks aimed at ending the nuclear standoff and formulating a non-aggression pact with the North.<br><br>The spring session of the Supreme People's Assembly is currently under way. With that complete, and with U.S. military forces nearing Baghdad, Pyongyang will see its window of opportunity to act opening over the next few weeks.<br><br>The regime continues to monitor the tactical situation in Iraq carefully, seeking to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. military, and it is growing ever more confident that self-imposed combat restrictions on U.S. forces significantly degrade any advantage the U.S. military would have over North Korea. Bolstered by this new insight, Pyongyang is surer that the United States actually can be coerced into bilateral negotiations and -- should that assumption prove incorrect -- that the North Korean military does indeed have a fighting chance against a U.S. attack.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Powell Rejects South Korean Proposal<br>2 hours, 59 minutes ago<br><br>By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer<br><br>WASHINGTON - President Nixon's dramatic opening to China three decades ago could serve as a model for a similar initiative by the Bush administration with North Korea (news - web sites), South Korea (news - web sites)'s top diplomat said Friday.<br><br>Secretary of State Colin Powell (news - web sites) rejected the proposal and insisted that North Korea must make a number of moves toward disarmament before the United States would consider serious engagement.<br><br>Powell spent 75 minutes conferring with Foreign Minister Yoon Young-kahn, who took office last month with the installation of President Roh Moo-hyun. Roh is expected to visit Washington in May to meet with President Bush (news - web sites).<br><br>Powell believes that any substantive contact with North Korea should involve a number of countries from the Asian and Pacific region, including the United States, the two Koreas, Japan, China and Russia, among others.<br><br>"We are hard at work on it," Powell said. "Some suggest that we are distracted because of Iraq (news - web sites), but that is not the case. We are spending a great deal of time pursuing this."<br><br>Yoon, speaking at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, urged direct U.S.-North Korean talks, using as a precedent Nixon's groundbreaking visit to China in 1972.<br><br>Nixon's initiative ended more than 20 years of U.S. estrangement from China. Yoon said the opening helped produce positive change in China and suggested it is worth trying again.<br><br>"Such an approach can be applied to North Korea," Yoon said.<br><br>Asked about the proposal after his meeting with Yoon, Powell said the United States had been prepared to move ahead with a bold initiative last year but withdrew it after learning that the North had violated international commitments to forswear nuclear weapons.<br><br>That initiative can be put back on the table once the North curbs its nuclear ambitions and trims its sizable conventional forces, Powell said.<br><br>Two weeks ago, Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly told a Senate committee that North Korea also must deal with U.S. objections on such issues as missile development, human rights and terrorism before serious negotiations with Pyongyang can begin.<br><br>Powell said that once U.S. conditions are met, the United States "could help North Korea with its economic problems, with problems of starvation and other difficulties they are having within their society."<br><br>One apparent drawback to Yoon's idea of a Nixon-style approach to Pyongyang is that the dynamic between the United States and China of 30 years ago was far different from the current U.S.-North Korean impasse.<br><br>Washington and Beijing were able to overcome ideological differences because they both considered it necessary to contain their common rival, the Soviet Union.<br><br>There is no issue with North Korea in which there is a comparable convergence of interest.<br><br>Beyond that, Powell has said he rejects a bilateral approach because of the U.S. experience in 1994 with one-on-one talks. The North promised that year not to develop nuclear weapons at its Yongbyon facility, only to renege and start a new program in secret later on, Powell has said<br><br>During his talks with Powell, Yoon presented what Powell called a road map for dealing with North Korea. Powell said he will examine the plan but gave no details.<br><br>___<br><br>On the Net: State Department's North Korea page: http://www.state.gov/p/eap/ci/kn/<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=516&amp;ncid=731&amp;e=4&amp;u=/ap/20030328/ap_on_re_as/us_south_korea" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=516&amp;ncid=731&amp;e=4&amp;u=/ap/20030328/ap_on_re_as/us_south_korea</a></div>
