Strong was visiting Pyongyang as part of U.N. efforts to mediate the North's nuclear crisis with the United States.<br><br>South Korea (news - web sites) put its military on heightened alert this week, and on Saturday the North retaliated by canceling economic talks scheduled for next week. That could mean it will also suspend more important inter-Korean talks next month aimed at easing nuclear tensions.<br><br>The United States says it wants a peaceful settlement to the dispute. But the U.S. war in Iraq is getting intense study from North Korean officials, Strong told reporters.<br><br>"They are watching it very carefully and with deep concern, and questioning what this means in terms of the U.S. ultimate intentions toward them," Strong said.<br><br>Asked whether North Korean leaders feared they would be the next target of U.S. military action after Iraq, Strong said, "Fear I do not believe is in their vocabulary. Concern, yes, real determination to seek a peaceful settlement. At the same time, preparation for war, if necessary."<br><br>Strong did not say specify how he knew about the military preparations, and gave no details.<br><br>He said officials expressed "deep concern for the threats that they perceive to their own security, and a determination to defend their security and their integrity."<br><br>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have been high since Washington said in October that the North had admitted starting a nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 agreement.<br><br>Strong said he met with "very senior people," but wouldn't give their names or other details.

This means that it is going to "mount a preemptive attack on nuclear facilities in the DPRK and take it as an opportunity of escalating the war."<br><br>As the US strategy of mobilizing international pressure failed to work on the DPRK, it is turning to military means, the commentary pointed out.<br><br>The United States has turned down the DPRK's proposal for a non-aggression treaty and staged the largest ever military exercises directed against the DPRK. The exercises drive the military situation on the Korean Peninsula to the "brink of a nuclear war", it said.<br><br>The DPRK will increase its self-defense capacity and eliminateany aggressors at a single stroke, the KCNA warned.<br><br></div>

US Secretary of State Colin Powell warned Pyongyang on Tuesday, March 18, that provocation during the coming war would be a mistake.<br><br>"It should be clear to North Koreans right now that while we look at these provocations with concern they are not going to provoke us into a bad policy choice and the world should be united on this one," he said in Washington.<br><br>North Korea sees matters differently, and what Washington views as provocation, Pyongyang sees as a bargaining tool.<br><br>"Expect a lot more bellicose talk and more efforts to raise tension," said Yu Suk-Ryul, of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, affiliated to the South Korean Foreign Ministry.<br><br>On the day Bush gave Saddam 48 hours to quit Baghdad or face war, Pyongyang called on South Koreans to join with the North to launch a "vigorous struggle" to expel US troops from South Korea.<br><br>Tension has been building on the Korean peninsula since last October when the United States accused North Korea of running a secret nuclear-weapons program based on enriched uranium in contravention of a 1994 agreement.<br><br>The Pyongyang government has demanded face-to-face talks with the United States to defuse the crisis, but Washington insists the stand-off can be solved only in multilateral talks.<br><br>North Korea has ramped up pressure on Washington to come to the negotiating table by expelling UN inspectors, firing up a reactor at its mothballed Yongbyon nuclear plant, withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and firing missiles into the Sea of Japan.<br><br>North Korean fighters intercepted a US spy plane in international waters off the North Korean coast in another escalation of the crisis.<br><br>Seeking the highest price from the United States in the form of concessions for scrapping its weapons drive, North Korea will watch the unfolding Iraq conflict ready to seize any chance to drive a harder bargain, according to a South Korean government analyst.<br><br>"North Korea has a few more cards to play. And the remaining cards are more serious than the ones used before," says the analyst, who would not be named.<br><br>He says North Korea will quickly choose one of a number of options: test-firing a ballistic missile, starting to reprocess plutonium from spent fuel rods, launching a border skirmish, or even carrying out a nuclear test.<br><br>Professor Yu says the longer the war lasts, the better for Pyongyang.<br><br>"Maybe they will start reprocessing spent fuel to produce nuclear weapons.<br><br>That is a big card for North Korea, and I am convinced they are going to use it,'' Professor Yu said.

Korea likely to exploit war in Iraq, analysts warn</strong><br><br>By Michael Zielenziger<br>Knight Ridder Newspapers<br>March 21, 2003<br><br>SEOUL, South Korea -- The U.S.-led war against Iraq is likely to speed North Korea's efforts to develop nuclear warheads or launch another provocative act to force Washington to the bargaining table, analysts here warned Thursday.<br><br>Reflecting the government's consensus, a senior foreign ministry official, who asked not to be named, said: "Some sort of brinkmanship to induce negotiations" is likely from secretive North Korea leader Kim Jong Il now that American missiles are targeting Saddam Hussein. "They want to accelerate the pace of dialogue."<br><br>The remarks underscored a widespread fear that by focusing U.S. military and diplomatic efforts on Iraq, the Bush administration is ignoring a far more dangerous threat to U.S. security. Bush so far has refused to engage North Korea in direct negotiations.<br><br>Analysts predict that the North Koreans might even set off an underground nuclear test to step up the pressure on the United States and make clear to the world that it possesses nuclear weapons and must be taken seriously.<br><br>Whatever the tactic, North Korea is expected to exploit the situation in Iraq.<br><br>"For the time being, the North Koreans, while threatening to test-fire missiles, will wait and see, gleefully gloating over the sight of the Bush administration becoming an odd man out in the Western camp," said Kim Myong-cho, a Tokyo-based researcher with close ties to Pyongyang. "The end of the Iraq war will find the North Korean nuclear arsenal expanding," while U.S. support is draining away, he predicted.<br><br>"There's a lot we don't know about North Korea and what it might do," cautioned Robert Gallucci, the former State Department official who negotiated the 1994 Agreed Framework with Pyongyang under which it stopped developing plutonium for nuclear warheads.<br><br></div>

Believing that deterrence is the best weapon against the United States, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, is believed to be in a sprint for a nuclear arsenal.<br><br>But North Korea's talk may prove scarier than its technology. In the last two weeks, North Korea tested land-to-sea missiles that failed to hit their targets. Now, American intelligence analysts believe that North Korea is having trouble kick-starting a nuclear-reprocessing installation that was closed under international controls for almost a decade. One American nuclear expert said that the North Koreans are working with 1950's technology, vacuum tubes and all.<br><br>Then, when four MIG jet fighters intercepted an American reconnaissance plane, the American pilot ignored their signals to land in North Korea and flew home.<br><br>The mercurial Mr. Kim apparently wants to use Washington's preoccupation with Iraq to make a power play that would force the United States into talks, or that would force the world to recognize North Korea as a nuclear power.<br><br>He knows he is working against a deadline. Last month, with the invasion of Iraq still a question mark, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain came under hostile questioning in Parliament. Asked what country would be next for regime change after Iraq, he snapped, "North Korea."<br><br></div>

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.<br>Referring to the U.S. motive, the article says:<br>Through the second nuclear crisis the U.S. sought, above all, to bedevil the improved relations between the north and the south of Korea and between the DPRK and Japan and strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to keep the U.S. Forces in South Korea for an indefinite period.<br>The U.S. caused the second nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula with an eye to find a pretext for scrapping the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and evade its responsibility for the delayed LWR construction.<br>The strategic aim sought by the U.S. in the crisis is to invade the DPRK by force under the pretext of its "nuclear issue" and destroy man-centred Korean-style socialism as it encourages the world progressives.<br>The U.S. has escalated the DPRK-targeted war moves, while talking about "dialogue" and "peace". The U.S. belligerent forces are making endless war outcries after taking military measures, crying out for a sort of "attack" on the DPRK.<br>Timed to coincide with this, the U.S. imperialists launched together with the South Korean military north-targeted adventurous Foal Eagle war exercise which is going on in combination with Rsoi from March 19.<br>The final objective of the U.S. criminal moves is to provoke the second Korean war. There must be a train to ignite the war.<br>The second nuclear crisis is just to serve this purpose.<br>The U.S. is creating the impression that it is exerting "efforts" to render "assistance" to the DPRK. But this is nothing but a political gimmick to build up public opinion in favor of the U.S. before launching a war.<br>The DPRK and the U.S. are technically at war. This situation is inching close to an explosive phase.<br>The U.S. aggressive nature and its ambition to invade Korea remain unchanged.<br>A war may break out in Korea any moment as its danger is becoming real.<br>As no U.S. method would work on the DPRK, Washington seems to opt for starting the second Korean war.<br>The army and the people of the DPRK are heightening their vigilance and keeping themselves fully ready to cope with the U.S. belligerent forces' reckless nuclear showdown aimed to carry out its strategy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. It is the unshakable principled stand of the DPRK to reciprocate the good faith and react to the hard-line with the toughest stand.<br>Invariable is the DPRK's principled stand to conclude a non-aggression treaty through direct talks with the U.S. on the principle of impartiality, equality and confidence and peacefully settle the second nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. The DPRK has no place to step back and nothing to concede to the U.S. The DPRK does not avoid any showdown with the U.S.<br>It is fully ready to counter any military actions of the U.S. against the DPRK.<br>The DPRK has the army-based policy, the most treasured sword, single-hearted unity more powerful than any nuclear weapon and strong self-defensive power. They are our life and soul and a master key to all our victories.<br></div>
