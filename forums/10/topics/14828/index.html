            <div class='col-md body'>Dr.M had settled some of the issues with Singapore written on his toilet wall durinng the Asian currency crisis, mainly the CLOB issue. Now that times are bad, money again is an issue,ie water, the pricing of water. When the economy was good in Asia, you don't have all these problems. They have no time for all these, they talk about all the mega projects..... the tallest buildings in the world, they want to build the longest bridge in the world across Malacca Straits, they boast about Multimedia super corridor....<br><br>Domestically, you don't hear any problems about the tudung issue as most if not all Singaporeans Malays enjoying full employment. Now that more Singaporeans Malays are retrenched in the manufacturing sectors, they shouted that they are being discriminated and retrenched, they shouted loud and clear to PM that they are going to judge whether the govt is discriminating.... but they are blind to realise that they are more Chinese and Indian Singaporeans who are retrenched in other sectors. Tudung was not an issue as all Malay family abide by all school rules during boom time. Why there are some black sheeps trying to rupture the racial harmony now? Are they acting heroes trying to champion their community's grivances or are they fanatics out to create troubles?<br><br>The JI arrests already created some waves in this multiracial republic, it may be foolish for anyone of the same kind trying to add salt to its wounds!<br><br>If all Malays both in Singapore and Malaysia know how to manage their finance prudently and pragmatically, they might not reveal their weaknesses or shortcomings openly and inadvertently!As the Chinese saying goes, it's easier to move a mountain than to change one's attitude, it may be ages before the weather changes its wind direction, so be prepare to live with it in the tumultous days ahead!</div>
