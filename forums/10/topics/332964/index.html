              <p>If any of you got any news of new hikes to come, please share with this thread.</p>
              <p>I think hikes may stop for a while before 2011, for reasons i cannot explain.</p>
              <p>I suspect some more hikes to come due to domino effect.</p>
              <p>oil price dropped recently, transport fare increased.</p>
              <p>oil price dropped recently, telepon go up.</p>
              <p>if electricity rates go up, all businesses affected. Does this not mean all prices of all products requiring electricity as direct or indirect cost justify to hike their prices?</p>
              <p>businesses telepon also hiked. Can they use this reason to justify some more hikes after the hike using electricity hike as reason?</p>
              <p>businesses use transport to bring their goods from point  to point. Can they use this reason to justify more hikes ? u use your brain lar, students. study must use brain also. </p>
              <p>oh the Financial Meltdown. guess what that will trigger ? who shall pay and pay?</p>
              <p>no need transparency. u know why ? i tell you why - people can enticipate your next moves. so, i support the idea that no companies need to be transparent as their competitors can enticipate their next moves and then everyone kenna no job ah!!!! if 50% transparent, might as well don't waste money being transparent? then why can businesses not be 49% transparent? how about being 10% transparent? also transparent what. better just be 1% transparent. save money on expensive accountants. If competitors enticipate their next moves, you the slogger worker job-mati if you companies cannot compete ah!!!!!  bombastic reason or not?  </p>

              <p><br>Yes, the ecology helps balance the ying and yang to a certain extent.</p>
              <p>some bad and rich people get to taste what it is like to take the bus or ride a bicycle instead of driving a lambo or being driven in a maybach. I hope they don't cannot take it and jump from tallest building in town.</p>
              <p>rich bosses enjoyed low wage slogging workers work for their wealth. Now, maybe they get the rare chance to become a worker once again and enjoy lower wages and intense competition. I just hope they learn out of this lesson.</p>

              <p>some bad and rich people get to taste what it is like to take the bus or ride a bicycle instead of driving a lambo or being driven in a maybach. I hope they don't cannot take it and jump from tallest building in town.</p>
              <p>rich bosses enjoyed low wage slogging workers work for their wealth. Now, maybe they get the rare chance to become a worker once again and enjoy lower wages and intense competition. I just hope they learn out of this lesson.</p>

              <p><br>Yes you are right!  With all that money and no Holes to dig? oh my goodness!!</p>
              <p>That is perverse!</p>
              <p>and rich cannot just go into a geylang brothel you know. They get spotted and their reputation gone. Of course they go for high class. With Casino coming, they may come more also. I mean come to casino with high class pros from abroad or even local undergrads like Japanese students doing part time on way to school on the bullet train ?</p>
              <p>All that money and they should know they are also gonna die usually in their 80's (optimistically) based on statistics.</p>
              <p>You say the more rich the more they wolly? I doubt so. I have solid evidence of a Tyranosaur which refuse to let go despite pulpitating problems. some many people will continue to suffer until this tyranosaur heart give way. Being rich can prolong own life. But then again it also does not know when it will die.</p>
              <p>The Biological Ecology helps the weak get rid of trash. No matter how big the tyranosaur, it cannot defy ecology. Each day, he moves closer to meet his pace maker.</p>
