( In order to start earning money, education , courses, upgrading of oneself had to be invested ). Then, we start to go fishing in a Reservoir. (Singapore MArket). We walked past the edge of the reservoir with our fishing tools and was delighted to see big fishes swimming around. We decided on a spot and try to throw our line when a ranger (Gahment policy) come to you and tell you that you cannot fish here. He point to you a fishing spot for people to fish. You pack up your tools and headed to the spot only to find the short strip for fishing crowded. But nonetheless, you hook up your live worms and was about to throw into the water when the ranger points out that you cannot use live bait.( A fine will be imposed) ( Hey, everyone knows that live bait attract fishes much better ).

You cast the lure (artificial bait) for whole day and not a single fish on hook.<br><br>From just the above fishing experience, that's how our society is functioning. Too many restriction by the gahment. ( Unfair restriction ) So what if we know how to fish? Are we allow to fish freely?

From the breakdown of USSR to China's opening up, the only "real" communist state that exist now is N.Korea (who lives like a LEECH of China, relying, from food to eletricity, on China).
