              <p>The last orchard road flooded was also in June, so I think our govt should make another holiday, the flooding day, a holiday to mark the flooding and also to make people wary of the flood coming.</p>
              <p>Flood means water, and water to chinese business and our govt, means $$, orchard with the GSS is generating lots of money, could be all thanks to the water and flooding, and flooding by itself also churn the economy, create more jobs like further digging and drilling, selling of more flood protective equipment like pumps and water proof gates, therefore if you look at it, it is generating $$ and jobs, otherwise, Singapore can be boring.</p>
              <p>As for solution, singapore, especially orchard road is so congested both on land and below land ie underground, any wrong civil works can open up a hole in MRT tunnel or some underground wire and canals, we, as my lecturer once said, are living in a honey combed underground,  full of tunnels, wires, pipes, canals etc etc, any shake or heavy flood causing soil erosion, we may sink altogether. So, i am thinking of writing a novel called "The Sinking Of Sinkapore"</p>
