              <p>ah...you have that bumiputra mentality...born of a royal family
                  doesn't make you a queen....and if you think you are, that is when
                  they need to sing "God saves the queen".</p>
              <p>birth country simply means you were born here, nothing else.
                  What does this country mean to you if you do not contribute to it
                  and you are not proud of it. you just took advantage of the
                  convenience of the land, and when you got feather you just spread
                  your wing and enjoy the freedom.</p>
              <p>You pay income tax in the country you stay but try to tell your
                  birth country how to look after the poor and the old. You don't
                  serve NS and stay in a big country to avoid trouble in the little
                  red dot, and you tell us how to run our lives. Obviously being so
                  far away you can't join any community services to help the
                  underpriviledged, but you think your loud voice would do wonder.
                  don't be a hypocrite....</p>
              <p>holding to Singapore passport just because you may need to come
                  here when it gets tougher there. Now you PR where you stay because
                  find comfort there, just like the PR in Singapore, and you think
                  you are on moral high ground.</p>

              <p>Perhaps now I understand why our govt wants to flood SG with so many people from third world countries.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have higher standards, that's why we expect more from our million dollar ministers. We demand better and expect better. We want every penny worth of what we pay our ministers.</p>
              <p>These third world " New Singaporeans" came from places with low standards, so they have low standards.</p>
              <p>They expect less , so they are easier to please.</p>
              <p>Our govt no need work so hard to please people with low standards. Just give them a bit more than they usually get..and notice how happy they are already.</p>
              <p>While it makes life easier for our govt, it is also a hinderance to our nation progress  from 2nd world to 1st world.</p>
              <p>A nation with 2nd world mentality govt will never become first world. We are better than 3rd world but can't seem to get beyond 2nd world.</p>
              <p>If we allow these kind of constant self-consolation and low standards , with so many of these "third world New Singaporeans" how can we progress as a nation ?</p>
