              <p>sisters studying in taiwan, she travelled to taiwan &amp; australia alot according to her and she is only 20. parents probably not the typical singapore aunty type.</p>
              <p>her accent has australian influence but isn't australian. i wud think more american aussie + singapore.</p>
              <p>in her utube account her name is not stephanie koh but steph mycale....parents or one of them might have filipinno blood in them. stab in the dark rly but thats my guess.</p>

              <p>No pride does not mean shame. There's humility. Speaking out against out own undesirable behavior is being aware of our own short comings so we may better ourselves. </p>

              <p>I think the point (and i could be wrong) that jojo is trying to bring across is to be subjective.</p>
              <p>It isn't a case of "staying in Singapore should be proud of Singapore."</p>
              <p>Singapore has points it should be proud of. However it does have points it is lacking. This is of course all a matter of opinion. However it becomes apparent that some will defend the country just for the sake of it.</p>
              <p>I think this is what jojo is trying to bring across drawing comparisons with "Pinoy Pride" I've never heard of this term but I read the link she posted and incidentally I'll say her comparison is pretty accurate.</p>
              <p>The problem with blind pride is that there leaves little room for improvement. I think jojo is trying to bring this across as well (albeit sarcastically) when she says</p>
              <p>"we r number one.</p>
              <p>we are perfect country. othercountry will never be close to
                  perfect like singapore.</p>
              <p>our people are most well mannered with superior
                  intelligence. "</p>
              <p>I believe its good to be open to criticism. It also shows graciousness and maturity. Debate about the points Steph said that's all good. But seriously "staying in Singapore should be proud of Singapore" really is not being subjective. Cause if that's the case then everyone in the world would have no reason not to be proud unless they were born in international waters.</p>

              <p>you think she is popular, because she has been to korea, taiwan or australia? the other news I read about this girl is how she quarrelled with her aunt, that adds to her popularity.</p>

              <p>When I watch that on youtube, I realized the little girl was
              ranting, listened for a while, hmmm....some Singaporean boys must
              have dumped her, or she didn't get the kind of attention she
              thought she deserved here.....I switched off. and you take her rant
              as lessons for Singaporean? lol....</p>
              <p>I don't know her, and I don't make any judgement on her quarrel
              with her aunt, that is their family issue. She is related to
              you?</p>
              <p>" OOooohh,... nice neh neh.... uhh.." that is your expression
              every morning when you look at the mirror?</p>

              <p>Just because you speak like us, live among us..doesn't make you Singaporean. Thank you for trying anyway. </p>

              <p>hahaha...you are right, let it go. don't let your hatred scotch your mind, your displeasure blind your eyes. You have found a place you like, stay there.</p>
              <p>Everybody is entitled to his or her opinion in Singapore, but if you start to make uncalled for remarks, criticism about others, they have the right to response.</p>
              <p>Read my posts, I never responded to the remarks by the little girl. Nothing in her or about her arouse me...you know her so well, you related to her?</p>
