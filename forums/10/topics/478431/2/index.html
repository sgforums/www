              <p>When I watch that on youtube, I realized the little girl was

                  have dumped her, or she didn't get the kind of attention she

              <ul>
              </ul>
              <p>A. Because you cannot take her criticism and think subjectively? Blind Pride or "Pinoy Pride" (first i've heard of this)</p>
              <ul>

              <p>I think the point (and i could be wrong) that jojo is trying to
                  bring across is to be subjective.</p>
              <p>It isn't a case of "staying in Singapore should be proud of
                  Singapore."</p>
              <p>Singapore has points it should be proud of. However it does have
                  points it is lacking. This is of course all a matter of opinion.
                  <strong>However it becomes apparent that some will defend the country just
                  for the sake of it.</strong></p>

              <p>Well unlike you sir. I am a Singaporean. I never abandoned my birth country like you did to yours.My passport is still Singapore, my birth country is Singapore.</p>
              <p>No one chased me away.. I come and go as I please. And I call many places my home.</p>
              <p>So you really have no place telling us about being proud of our country. You turned your back on yours.</p>
              <p>Again.. sir.. you really need to sock it.</p>

              <p>ah...you have that bumiputra mentality...born of a royal family doesn't make you a queen....and if you think you are, that is when they need to sing "God saves the queen".</p>
              <p>birth country simply means you were born here, nothing else. What does this country mean to you if you do not contribute to it and you are not proud of it. you just took advantage of the convenience of the land, and when you got feather you just spread your wing and enjoy the freedom.</p>
              <p>You pay income tax in the country you stay but try to tell your birth country how to look after the poor and the old. You don't serve NS and stay in a big country to avoid trouble in the little red dot, and you tell us how to run our lives. Obviously being so far away you can't join any community services to help the underpriviledged, but you think your loud voice would do wonder. don't be a hypocrite....</p>
              <p>holding to Singapore passport just because you may need to come here when it gets tougher there. Now you PR where you stay because find comfort there, just like the PR in Singapore, and you think you are on moral high ground.</p>
              <p>you proud of Singapore?</p>
