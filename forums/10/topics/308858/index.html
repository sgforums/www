              <p>Alot of the PAP fans like me last time, who support the PAP for quite sometimes and then change our vote to Opposition.</p>
              <p>A few of my friends and relatives had also seen through the real colour of the PAP heart.Most of them are already voting against the PAP.</p>
              <p>PAP fans, please don't tell me all those craps of how great Lee Kuan Yew is and how PAP had transform Singapore from 3rd world to 1st world.And, how we must be grateful to them or else we will be like Indonesia or Burma.He had done something great in the past that is the past my PAP fans friends.What important is what he had done now!And recently i came across this article and i think it's really reflect afew of my feelings against the PAP.Below is the link!Hopefully, more PAP fans will change their mindset like me and my relatives and friends!</p>

              <p><strong>Durai the super culprit is overseas enjoying life with his S$600K / month salary. Why hold the monk's passport?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>This isn't the only joke on PAP's thug law. Nor is this the biggest part of NKF scandal.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Durai is definitely politically well connected. Monk at most is connected to Buddha or Kuan Yin instead of Lee Kuan Yew.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>CSJ who mentioned NKF scandal in his news paper already sued bankrupt and went to jail several times for the NKF news papers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>But Durai is still traveling world!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>CSJ not allowed to travel!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>This clearly shows the world how CORRUPTED is Lee Kuan Yew's thug law. This is not just mafia but childish and it is insulting world community's intelligence. Who are these bastards trying to fool?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>This is called law &amp; justice?</strong></p>

              If you have really followed the NKF case closely, you will notice that TT Durai did not commit any crime.
              What he did was within the powers allowed a director according to the Companies Act.
              We are disgusted with him because the money is from peoples' charity. We are disgusted with him, that was all.
              TT Durai was charged for fradulently giving his friend $20,000. The case against him was proven as he cannot explain certain discrepancies in the document regarding that payment.
              After extensive investigation, that was all they could find.
              And if you think further, the auditors involved were a few private companies, with hundreds of staff involved in the search. With so many people involved, do you think the government can cover up any crime and keep it quiet?
              
              CSJ is a different case. He did deliberately broke the law, and he himself know it. And he is also deliberately "playing around with the law".
