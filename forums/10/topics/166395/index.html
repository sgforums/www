But I think she realizes that this is something she has to come to terms with," said Lasry.<br><br>The family has made no public comments in the past few weeks.<br><br>Asked whether Nguyen would be donating his organs for medical use, Lasry said: "I am confident there won't be any donation."    Continued ...<br><br>On Monday, executioner Darshan Singh told Reuters convicts on death row can chose whether or not to donate their organs.<br><br>Death by hanging does not damage vital organs, unlike execution by lethal injection, Singh said.<br><br>It is not clear who will execute Nguyen after Singh said on Sunday he had been sacked and would not be required for further executions after speaking to the Australian media.<br><br>Nguyen will be executed by "long-drop hanging", an execution method inherited from British colonial days.<br><br>Long-drop hanging was introduced in the late 19th century as a more humane form of hanging compared to the short-drop hangings that are still practiced in some countries. Convicts drop several feet and die when the spinal cord snaps, not by asphyxiation.<br><br>The Amnesty report said that about 420 people had been hanged in Singapore since 1991, mostly for drug trafficking, giving the city-state of 4.4 million people the highest execution rate in the world relative to population.<br><br>The Australian government has made repeated appeals for clemency, with Prime Minister John Howard talking to his Singaporean counterpart five times.<br><br>But Singapore has stood firm, saying Nguyen was caught with a large amount of heroin and that the government would not allow Singapore to be used as a transit for illicit drugs.<br><br>Â© Reuters 2005.
