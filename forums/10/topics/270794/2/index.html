The higher taxation paid by the Swiss to Singaporeans? Mind you, if you had noticed I mentioned the Cost of Living and not the Standard of Living.<br><br><strong>London is the most expensive city in the world<br>while Swiss cities are home to highest earners<br>A report by UBS</strong><br><br>The worldÂ’s richest cities in 2006<br>In UBS' international comparison, North American workers earn the highest wages, with workers in Western Europe close at their heels. In general, however, European net earnings are significantly below the disposable incomes levels enjoyed by Americans, due to higher taxes and social security contributions. One noteworthy exception to this trend is Ireland, which has relatively low payroll taxes. Less surprising is the fact that South Americans and Africans receive comparatively low compensation on average for the work they perform; pay in developing and emerging market countries is only a fraction of that in the industrialized nations.<br><br>The highest gross wages are paid in Scandinavia Â– Copenhagen and Oslo Â– followed by Switzerland, whose citizens also enjoy lower payroll tax deductions. <strong>Nowhere in the world do workers get more from their pay than in Zurich after mandatory deductions</strong>. But a net salary is not necessarily fully available for private consumption: there may be further Â“hiddenÂ” costs in our cities that are not covered by basic taxes and social contributions.<br><br>Within Europe alone there are dramatic differences in wage and salary levels. In Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, wages are similar to those paid in India or Kenya. Wage inequalities between Eastern and Western Europe are a double-edged concern: workers from the East are moving to the West in search of higher pay, while new manufacturing capacity is being added in the East to take advantage of the much lower wages there.<br><br>Compared with the survey taken three years ago, little has changed among the top-ranked cities in terms of highest gross pay, except for the inclusion now of London among the world's Top Ten. The lowest average wages can still be found in Manila, Delhi, Mumbai, Jakarta and Bangkok.

London is in second position, climbing three places since 2006. Seoul moves down one place in the ranking to take third place, followed by Tokyo. Asuncion in Paraguay remains the least expensive city in a survey published annually by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. With New York as the base city scoring 100 points, Moscow scores 134.4, London 126.3 and Seoul 122.4.</strong><br><br>Mercer's survey covers 143 cities across six continents and measures the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. It is the world's most comprehensive cost-of-living survey and is used to help multinational companies and governments determine compensation allowances for their expatriate employees.<br><br>Â“There have been some significant changes in the rankings since last year. These are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations - in particular, the weakening of the US Dollar and strengthening of the Euro,Â” said Rebecca Powers, a principal and senior consultant at Mercer.<br><br>Europe, Middle East and Africa<br>Moscow is the most expensive city in Europe and in the rest of the world, for the second year running, with a score of 134.4 (compared with 123.9 in 2006). Â“The appreciation of the Rouble against the US Dollar, combined with ever-increasing accommodation charges, has driven up costs for expatriates in Moscow,Â” said Yvonne Traber, research manager and senior associate at Mercer.<br><br>London has climbed three positions to second place in the ranking (score 126.3). Â“Steep property rental costs, together with the strengthening of the British Pound compared to the US Dollar, have contributed to the cityÂ’s high ranking,Â” commented Ms Yvonne Traber.<br><br>Other costly European cities include Copenhagen in 6th place (110.2), Geneva in 7th (109.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and Zurich in 9th (107.6). Oslo remains in 10th place with a score of 105.8 while Milan climbs two places to position 11 (104.4). Sofia in Bulgaria is EuropeÂ’s least expensive city in 108th place with a score of 72.5.<br><br>The strengthening of the Euro has resulted in a number of European cities moving significantly up the ranking this year. For example, Stockholm has moved up from 36th position to reach 23rd place (score 93.1) while Amsterdam has climbed from 41st position to 25th (92.2). Cities in Spain, Greece, Germany and the UK also rank notably higher this year.<br><br>Ms Yvonne Traber commented: Â“The relative strength of the Euro and other European currencies, including the Swiss Franc and the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian Krone, has pushed up the living costs faced by expatriates in many European countries.Â”<br><br>Tel Aviv is the costliest city in the Middle East. The Israeli city ranks in 17th place and scores 97.7. Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates have moved down in the ranking this year. The main reason for this drop is that the UAE Dirham is pegged to the US Dollar. The majority of African cities covered by the survey come in the bottom half of the ranking.<br><br>The Americas<br>New York remains the most expensive city in North America but drops five places to position 15 (score 100). Other North American cities have dropped more steeply and only New York and Los Angeles (position 42, score 87.1) rank in the top 50 cities.<br><br>Â“The decline of most US cities in the ranking can be attributed to the depreciation of the US dollar against the Euro and other major currencies worldwide. The change reflects a reversal of the situation experienced this time last year, when the majority of US cities climbed the ranking due to the strength of the dollar,Â” said Ms Powers.<br><br>Toronto, the most expensive city in Canada, has dropped 35 places to position 82 (score 78.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Calgary and Vancouver have also tumbled down the rankings, sliding from 71st place to 92nd and 56th to 89th respectively. Ottawa remains the cheapest Canadian city in 109th position scoring 72.3. Canadian cities have traditionally rated favourably in the worldwide ranking. The new scores reflect a low rate of inflation and stable housing prices. In addition, while it has appreciated slightly against the US Dollar, the Canadian Dollar has depreciated nearly 13% against the Euro since last yearÂ’s survey.<br><br>Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have dropped significantly in the ranking, but remain the most expensive cities in Latin America. Sao Paulo is now placed 62nd, compared with 34th in 2006, and is followed by Rio de Janeiro in 64th place (position 40 in 2006). Although the Brazilian Real has remained stable against the US Dollar over the last 12 months, the Brazilian cities surveyed have been pushed down the ranking as they give way to European cities that are ascending due to the buoyancy of the Euro.<br><br>Globally, the least costly city is Asuncion in Paraguay for the fifth consecutive year (score 50). Other low-ranking cities include Karachi, Quito and Montevideo in 142nd (score 56.1), 141st (56.3) and 140th place (58.4) respectively.<br><br>Asia<br>Four of the worldÂ’s top 10 costliest cities for expatriates are in Asia. Seoul ranks in 3rd place (score 122.4), Tokyo in 4th (122.1) and Hong Kong in 5th (119.4) Â– all have been pushed down one place this year.<br><br>Chinese cities have moved down the ranking this year. Beijing ranks 20th and scores 95.9, while Shanghai is in 26th place with a score of 92.1. Over the past 12 months, the value of the Chinese Yuan has decreased by around 6% against the Euro. This factor, together with a low inflation rate and stable property rental prices, has kept the major Chinese cities from moving up the ranking. Accommodation costs have not escalated because, while demand is increasing, the availability of high-quality rentals in these cities is also good.<br><br>In contrast, elsewhere in Asia, the cost of international-standard accommodation has pushed some cities up the ranking. For example, sharp increases in house prices have contributed to Singapore climbing from 17th to 14th position. Rising property prices have also caused Indian cities to move up the ranking Â– for example, Mumbai has jumped from position 68 to 52 (score 84.9).<br><br>Australasia<br>Wellington is the least costly city in this region in 111th place with a score of 71.8. Auckland climbs one place to rank 99th (score 73.9). Expatriates in Australia continue to face higher living costs than their counterparts in New Zealand. Sydney remains the most expensive city in Australia at position 21 with a score of 94.9. Melbourne occupies position 60, up 14 places from last year, and scores 82.5. Adelaide is in 96th place (score 74.7).<br><br>The world's 50 most expensive big cities<br>(The index is based on cost of living expressed in US dollars.

The choice of cities surveyed is based on the demand for corresponding data from companies and governmental organizations. Exchange rates used in attached table of cost comparisons: 1 GBP = 1.944390 USD; 1 GBP = 1.476181 EUR.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>London is the most expensive city in the world<br>while Swiss cities are home to highest earners<br>A report by UBS<br>10 August 2006: London, New York, Oslo, Tokyo and Zurich are the worldÂ’s most expensive cities. A study by Swiss bank UBS shows that life is particularly expensive in London and New York if the cost of housing is included. The basket of goods and services costs the least in Manila, Delhi and Kuala Lumpur. European cities dominate the earnings tables, with the highest net incomes achieved in Zurich, Geneva, Oslo and Dublin. New York is in 5th place. The lowest earnings are recorded in Jakarta, Manila and Delhi.</strong><br><br>Highest wages in Scandinavia, Switzerland and the US<br>In the cities of Western Europe and North America, workers in 14 representative professions earn a gross hourly wage averaging US$18; in the Eastern European and Asian cities examined, the figure was only US$4 to 5. The highest gross wages are paid in Copenhagen, Oslo, Zurich, Geneva, New York and London. In a comparison of net wages, the Scandinavian and German cities lose ground due to their high tax rates and social security payments. The shooting star in the international comparison of wages is English-speaking Europe, with Dublin and London new in the top ten. Table<br><br>Buying a Big Mac<br>Wages only become meaningful in relation to prices, i.e., what can be bought with the money earned. A globally available product like a Big Mac can make the relationship between wages and prices much clearer. On a global average, 35 minutes of work buys a Big Mac. But the disparities are huge: In Nairobi, one and a half hoursÂ’ work is needed to buy the burger with the average net hourly wage there. In the US cities of Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Miami, a maximum of 13 minutes' labor is needed.<strong> Although the comprehensive comparison of purchasing power and gross wages puts them at the top of the table, higher production costs mean that workers in Swiss and Scandinavian cities need 15 to 20 minutes for their Big Macs. After buying the study's basic basket of goods and services, earners in Zurich, Geneva, Dublin, Los Angeles and Luxembourg retain the highest portion of their net wages for discretionary spending like vacations, luxury items or savings. </strong>Table<br><br><strong>Working hours<br>Asian employees can at least partially compensate for low hourly wages through longer hours spent at work. With a mean annual working time of 2088 hours, people work longest in the Asian cities. Based on a 42-hour work week, Asian workers labor about 50 days a year more than their peers in Paris, where a working year is just 1480 hours, or Berlin, where a years' work equals 1610 hours</strong>.<br><br>An analysis of the historical data produced by the UBS Study of Prices and Earnings, shows that <strong>Europeans have reduced their working hours in the last 30 years in favor of more leisure time. Americans and Asians, on the other hand, have a higher regard for earned income, it seems. Wage levels and leisure time determine prosperity </strong>Â– but more leisure time leads to greater prosperity only when wages reach an adequate level.<br><br>The Americas<br>A dollar earned in Los Angeles, after deducting taxes and social security contributions, is worth more than in Chicago, New York, Miami, Toronto and Montreal. Although the highest wages are paid in New York, it also has the highest cost of living anywhere in the Americas. Thanks to their much higher wages, after buying the basic basket of goods and services, workers in North American cities have far more left over for vacations, luxury items or savings than their counterparts in Latin America. The average purchasing power in Central and South America is just a third of the level in the North American cities.<br><br>The biggest upward jumps compared to the previous issue of Â“Prices and EarningsÂ” were recorded by SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Santiago de Chile. Economic growth and currency appreciation have reduced both the price and the wage gaps in relation to the North American cities. However, prices have risen more steeply than wages, so that the North-South divide in the distribution of purchasing power remains.<br><br>Asia Pacific<br>In no other region is the price spread between the most expensive and the cheapest city greater than in Asia. While Tokyo lands in fifth place among the worldÂ’s most expensive cities, the region is also home to the cities at the other end of scale, including Delhi, Mumbai and Kuala Lumpur. Singapore and Taipei, as well as the two Pacific Rim cities Sydney and Auckland, occupy the midfield in the comparison of prices and wages. The highest wages in Asia are paid in Tokyo, although the Japanese capital has fallen seven places since UBS's last survey in 2003. The reasons for this are the devaluation of the yen against the euro and a deflationary price cycle that only ended recently. <strong>The highest level of purchasing power in Asia is enjoyed by workers in Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul. Sydney and Auckland have even made it into the top ten worldwide.</strong><br>Europe<br>Narrowing price differences for comparable goods and services are an important indicator of market integration. Based on historical price data, the newest UBS study of Prices and Earnings notes significant price convergence within the EU internal market. The creation of a common market and the launch of the euro as a common currency have contributed to reducing price differences. The mean relative price spread among the cities of the EU-15 in the survey has dropped by around a third since 1985. Having said that, the harmonization of price levels is not a linear process. Rather, it is subject to frequent bumps in the road to price parity. Market integration is furthest advanced in the Eurozone. The recent addition of ten new member states has again widened the spread of prices within the European Union.<br><br><strong>Switzerland<br>In the comparison of purchasing power, the Swiss cities of Zurich and Geneva remain at the top</strong>. Public sector wages largely support this result, since, in contrast to many emerging countries where teachers and bus drivers earn far less than comparable professions in the private sector, these jobs are comparatively well paid in Switzerland (and in Scandinavia). In terms of prices, too, the Swiss cities are at the fore. Food prices in particular confirm the countryÂ’s image as a high-priced zone Â– only Tokyo is marginally pricier. Price differences between Geneva and Zurich are narrower for tradable goods than for services, which are some ten percent cheaper in Geneva.<br><br></div>
