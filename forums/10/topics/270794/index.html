If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from the any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed... If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security, should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to right, and what it must know to be right... "<br><br><strong>Lee Kuan Yew Legislative Assembly Debates Sept 21, 1955</strong><br><br>"If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we must be prepared, in principle, to concede to our enemies - even those who do not subscribe to our views - as much(sic)constitutional rights as you concede yourself."<br><br><strong>Opposition leader Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Oct 4, 1956</strong><br><br>" Repression, Sir is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict."<br><br><strong>Opposition leader Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Oct 4, 1956</strong><br><br>"If we say that we believe in democracy, if we say that the fabric of a democratic society is one which allows for the free play of idea...then, in the name of all the gods, give that free play a chance to work within the constitutional framework."<br><br><strong>Opposition leader Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times, May 5, 1959</strong><br><br>"Repression can only go up to a point. When it becomes too acute, the instruments of repression, namely the army and the police, have been proved time and time again in history to have turned their guns on their masters."<br><br><strong>Complaining about the Straits Times in 1959</strong><br><br>"I pointed to an article with bold headlines reporting that the police had refused to allow the PAP to hold a rally at Empress Place, and <span style="font-style: italic;">then to the last paragraph where in small type it added the meeting would take place where we were now. I compared this with a prominent report about an SPA rally</span>. <strong>This was flagrant bias</strong>."<br><br><strong>Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates</strong><br><br>"Let us get down to fundamentals. <strong>Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy?</strong><br><br>That is the first question we asked ourselves. <strong>I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views.</strong><br><br>I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We never run away from the open encounter</span></strong>.</span><br><br><strong>If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last</strong>. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion...<br><br>Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, <strong>because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds</strong>...<br><br><strong>But let me make this point: that <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5 million</span> adult minds</span> in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority.

That is the X factor in development."<br><br><strong>Lee Kuan Yew in 1982</strong><br><br>"Let us not deceive ourselves: our talent profile is nowhere near that of, say, the Jews or the Japanese in America. The exceptional number of Nobel Prize winners who are Jews is no accident. It is also no accident that a high percentage, sometimes 50%, of faculty members in the top American universities on both the east and west coasts are Jews. And the number of high calibre Japanese academics, professionals, and business executives is out of all proportion to the percentage of Japanese in the total American population."<br><br><strong>Lee Kuan Yew in 1983 National Day Rally</strong><br><br>"If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society...So what happens?

Asians score more ... the Bell curve authors put it at least 10 points higher. These are realities that, if you do not accept, will lead to frustration because you will be spending money on wrong assumptions and the results cannot follow."<br><br>Â•	"I started off believing all men were equal. I now know that's the most unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of years have passed over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this earth, been isolated from each other, developed independently, had different intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils... I didn't start off with that knowledge. But by observation, reading, watching, arguing, asking, that is the conclusion I've come to."<br><br><strong>SM Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times, September 19, 1999 on Malays in the Singapore Armed Forces</strong><br><br>"If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine gun unit, that's a very tricky business.
