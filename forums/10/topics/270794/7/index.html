Hey all of you, get back on to the topic?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, our CPF is very similar to the 401k in USA. Your employer contributes  an additional 13% of your pay to CPF so doesn't it mean your actual pay is more? Isn't it great? Why gripe that you have so less take home pay when this is a very good way to build your nestegg for retirement? On top of being tax free and interest earning, you can also use it to pay to purchase your home. Other countries like Malaysia and Hong Kong tried to copy our very successful CPF system but they are not successful as alot of private companies are not willing to contribute extra on top of the staff existing pay!! In Singapore, it is mandatory.<br>But one thing is for sure, housing in Singapore has become very expensive even for a first hand HDB which is supposed to be subsidised. So alot of lower middle income family (combine income of S$5,000 - 8,000) are stuck with very high mortgage and if one should lose a job, it is very dangerous as they might not have the savings level to maintain the house and expenses. Yes, even as we compare to some countries like HK and Japan, it seems that our property is cheaper, but HK has no GST and they have one of the lowest personal taxes in the world and also their executive pay is 30-40% higher than Singapore.<br>I think the biggest worry is now Singapore is no longer a country of savers but rather of spenders. Roll over charges are high and credit cards are too easily attained.<br>Singapore come out tops for safety. Just to cross the border and it is like a different world, where you can get beaten, kidnapped, robbed and raped in broad daylight. The Malaysian government can't feel offended as it is true and they know it. Just not so nice when your next door neighbour say it.<br>Thus, in every country there is good and bad. It is very difficult to achieve Utopia.</div>
