              <p>Looking at this international piece on "spider"-Mas's escape, i can't help but sense a bit of bewilderment and bemusement on the journalists' part even though it was nicely factual and balanced. A.K.A no clear desperate attempts to defend the system and agencies involved, like what we see on lcoal media.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2143332720080421?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0">http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2143332720080421?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0</a></p>
              <p>Like what MP Mr Low says, many of us still have a sore sticking point with our high civil service pay. And he has a point that assessment of performance should reflect the corporate world. It has always been made a point that each minister is like a CEO anyway. I have seen ppl being fired for less over the years. 2007, Jap's defence Minister made a sensitive comment that the Atomic bomb served to them was justified, and its sayonara to him. Just this month, UBS's chairman Mr Marcel Ospel, resigned after years of distinguised service, taking responsibility for his company's poor performance this year. Anyway....the list goes on. The point here Mr PM, is not whether ppl earned enough credits in the past to justify the most current gross mistake/negligence/judgement error. The point is accountability. And also just to give an analogy, Mr Ospel that i mentioned above, he did not fire all the bank tellers and focus the blame on them did he? He took responsibility. When u are a leader, thats what you do. If you want to have a bigger pie when things are going well, u need to eat the shit too when it hits the fan you know. Or maybe....this issue is not really serious? SpiderMas is only the leader of a regional terrorist network that can possibly kill ...oh only a few thousand innocent ppl. Baaaahhh....</p>
              <p>I am for Killing the chicken to scare the monkey, for the rest of the Civil service to know that S'poreans can afford to pay for a solid civil service but they better be worth it, and assessement is like the private sector which you are benchmarked against anyway (i.e not sentimental, and you are only as good as your last mistake). By the way, it would be a politically wise move to appear strong and decisive here Mr PM. We don't want what we see happening over the causeway to happen here do we?(public opinion here is that Mr AB is indecisive, soft and weak)</p>
              <p>AND 1 LAST THING!!! Its speculative that SpiderMas jumped over the double layered barb wired fence right? 2m gap, V-shaped barb wire obstacle on top, and he can't have much of a running start before jumping i suppose ? Anyway, since the CCTV watching that spot wasn't working....lets just assume he escaped that way first lah. You mentioned a simulation for that 49sec escape...can we see it? And i assume you got a 47yr old limping short fart to try it?</p>
              <p>Com'on we just want to know the truth. Don't think that the current generation can't think.</p>

              <p>hippo must be one of the garment pp, thats why so supportive of them..lol</p>
              <p>anyway, jokes aside. Seriously, i dont think pushing the blame to WKS will solve any issue, even though in the rpt, so much was said, yet nothing was said. Of course he should take responsible for this saga, but whether to resign or not, should not be up to us to decide. If a man makes a mistake and stood up, i am sure we will all be applauding for the action. But i dont think he mentioned anything abt him taking responsibility right? (correct me if i m wrong) Rather, those other officers will kana badly.</p>
              <p>In short, i dont care who is going for the axe. But rather, i hope the ISA step up their act, while the home affairs team will prevent anything happening to our country/citizens in case if Mas decided for some revenge. Capture him asap is the best solution to all this.</p>

              <p><br>It is not that Singaporeans cannot be forgiving - as Singaporeans have been generous even to JBJ despite his many years of getting into trouble with the POWER of ONE - by constantly putting his foot into his mouth most of the time.</p>
              <p>Yet, JBJ has endeared himself despite his political failures, simply because of his own good natured sincerity, and never believing himself to be infallibly superior.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the opposite is true in the POWER of ONE - who beleive <em>himself / themselves</em> as infallible supreme talents, promoting <em>himself / themselves</em> as the ''<span class="hw"><strong><em>crème de la crème''</em></strong></span> from a society that only <em>he / they</em> claimed is already limited in talent.</p>
              <p>It hurts the ears to listen to LHL excusing his own breed by comparing his own to ''ordinary people can make mistake''.</p>
              <p>The longer ''SpiderMAS'' stay out-of-sight - {whether he actually escaped, or the escape is a good cover for losing his dead body} - it will make this bunch of self-glorified super talents look stupid.</p>
              <p>''SpiderMAS'' typify the low income, low educated, problematic ethnic Malay Singaporean kid grown into adulthood.</p>
              <p>For him to be able to beat a ''super security system'' put in place by Super Talented Goons - he will surely soon become a legendary folklore amongst his own; and possibly even win the respect of those who fell out with the Law - irregardless of ethnicity.</p>
