            <div class='col-md body'>I think people needs to open up more to organ donation. What's the point of keeping your organs with you in death? Why not let others have a new lease in life with your inevitable death, and organs?<br><br>By the way, people who are going to opt out should be made aware of the fact that it goes in TWO-WAYS. By opting out, you will be made last in priority list (or you won't be there at all) for organ transplant should you need it one day. You can say it's harsh, but it is FAIR at the end of the day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like alot of things in life, this is kind of a calculated gamble.<br><br>Most of us have no trouble accepting that we are on the priority list of organ transplants, but grow indignant at the prospect that our organs may be harvested.<br><br>You can't have it both ways. It's a zero sum game. organs in = organs out.<br><br>Still, studies have shown that opt in volunteers are usually about 3 times less than opt out ones, which is why the HOTA act was passed through. Most of it is based on inertia, like my personal one i described a few posts back.<br><br>Frankly, I think that in this case, the doctor's only mistake was to grant the first 24 hours. They weren't bound to do that, and by doing so, much valuable time was wasted. The only thing the first 24 hour gift accomplished was to convince the family members that more time was always available, which led to the cries of injustice when they found it wasn't so.<br><br>While i sympathise with the family involved, there IS a reason why judgement should always be passed by an impartial party. This is a classic example of it. The rational choice would be to harvest, and it is this rationality that has allowed us to advance to where we are today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see your point. But decisions  made by people of sound mind should not be undermined by those who may be emotionally distressed and incapable of objective reasoning. The law is very clear on this point. If the deceased is not of sound mind, the authorisation of the legal guardian is required prior to removal. Now, if the deceased is of sound mind and had consented by not opting out, how can those who are  badly affected emotionally by the passing be allowed to overturn the lawful decision made by the deceased?<br></div>
