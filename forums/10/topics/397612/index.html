              <p> I am getting sick and tired of some forumers here with their whining day after day. So what if 4500 quitters choose to leave for NZ? I suggest the whinners here leave as well! Singapore does not need people like you. We can easily replace you with more foreign talents from China and India who are grateful to be here, while contributing to the economy here, and certainly contributing more to it than a lot of you here.</p>
              <p>You are behaving like employees who never stop complaining about your boss, without realising that nobody is indispensable in a company (Singapore Inc) and your boss can easily hire someone else (younger/better skilled/more experienced/better work ethics) to do your job. It’s pretty obvious that there are just too many of you here with a sense of entitlement that is far bigger than what you have ever done for Singapore. If you think that since 4500 screwed up people queuing to migrate is the gospel truth about life in Singapore, if you think NZ is a better place for you, please go. By all means, give up your pink NATIONAL REGISTRATION IDENTITY CARD.</p>
              <p>I certainly agree that ministers’ salaries are way too high, and I too wish they will – and I underline wish – change the formula they use to determine their salaries soon. But until you can come up with something constructive, your whining and displays of self-pity are getting you nowhere. Get that. If you believe in it, then ask yourselves if ministers are living what you think is a “good life” (as some of you seem to so naively think by measuring a good life in terms of a person’s pay packet) because of their karma? And speaking of karma, it’s clear from the way you people speak (or write) that you’ve got the stench of a foul mouth brought forward from a bad karma in your previous life, and Singapore was whoa! so bloody unlucky to be the place you are borned into. I’d be eternally grateful to you if you remove yourself from your place of birth, where you seem so unhappy. There are many foreign talents who will be more than happy to replace you man. There are foreigners willing to work in construction sites and there are foreigners who can do a better job than you in the offices of big corporations anytime of the day.</p>
              <p>If you think you are a sore thumb in your country of birth, blame it on how your parents brought you up. You are. It was only a generation ago when I heard countless mothers calling out to “boy boy, girl girl” Today, boy boy and girl girl have sadly grown up, soft and unable to compete in the wider scheme of things. You see them right here in Asiaone forum pages after pages, and when they are not whining here, they are crying themselves to sleep.</p>
              <p>Listen. Do not for a moment think that 3 million Singaporeans are the best that can be found on earth where there are 7 and a half billion people out there for the picking. Singapore has yet to earn its place as a country which produces geniuses after geniuses, and I have yet to find one in any forum. Already, it’s proven that children of foreigners have done better than your children in your schools, polytechnics and universities. And they will do better than you in life.</p>
              <p>Stop griping and getting your panties in a twist, and for god’s sake, go do something about yourself, starting with a good wash to your face and looking into the mirror. When you can can clearly see yourself for what you are worth, I hope you proactively do something to improve your situation. The government has various schemes to help you do that, but if you think NZ is paradise, my short and simple reply is: Go and don’t come back. Thank you for removing your bad vibes and stench from this clean and green city which PAP had built, with the help of foreign talents of course.</p>

Singapore's legal system, the joke of the century.</a></h3>
              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>If Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore government and their Law Society are keen to cheer us up with some entrainment in these gloomy times with the world beset with wars and financial upheavals, they are succeeding very well indeed. <br><br>And after reading what I am about to say, if anyone had even any lingering doubts that the Singapore Legal System is rotten to the core, as stridently declared by the International Bar Association's 75 page report on Singapore, then that person cannot possibly have a straight face. <br><br>I have just received in my office in Fremont, California, USA, from the Law Society of Singapore, represented by Colin Ng and Partners, the firm who are prosecuting me, a huge box of papers, files and documents which presumably they are going to rely on to disbar me. <br><br>Since the issues in my case are very simple, such as, did I "insult" Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean, a Singapore judge in my blog and should that result in my disbarment; I fail to see how all that paper, several thousand pages perhaps, almost entirely irrelevant, should have anything to do with my case, but in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore anything is possible and why should I complain if that is what they do. <br><br>It is simply a huge waste, not only of the Singapore taxpayers money not to mention the harm done to the timber resources of the world in that wasted reams upon reams of paper. <br><br>It contains large chunks if not all of my testimony in the Singapore courts which went on for several long days in Singapore in 2008, with numerous witnesses and numerous copies of the blog posts in this blog. An utter waste of the Singapore tax payers time and money. <br><br>In addition to that box, I have also received by Courier Mail a letter from this law firm that a hearing has been fixed to be heard at the Disciplinary Conference Room Singapore on Friday April 30, 2010 at 11.00 am <strong>which I am required to attend</strong>. <br><br>Seperately, with reference to the same hearing date in Singapore on April 30, 2010 in Singapore, I had received a letter from the Disciplinary Committee of Singapore in my office in California, USA on April 19, 2010 via fax and Email, also stating that "<strong>the Disciplinary Tribunal has directed the parties (including me) to attend the hearing of the Summons application.....on April 30, 2010 at 11 am" in Singapore</strong>. <br><br>Now you will recall that on Nov 26, 2008, when I was deported from Singapore after having spent 2 months in jail there for having made some unflattering remarks about Lee Kuan Yew's judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean in this blog, I was deported from Singapore, prohibited from ever returning to Singapore unless I had the written permission of the Singapore government. In fact if I ever came to Singapore without permission, I stand to be arrested and sent to jail up to 2 years. <br><br>A deportation order was stamped in my American passport and a seperate similar order was handed to me prohibiting me from ever entering Singapore, before I left Singapore at the Immigration and Customs Authority office. <br><br>Can anyone with a head on his shoulders take the trouble to tell me how in Heavens can I come to Singapore from California USA on April 30th 2010 to appear at the Conference Room of the Disciplinary Tribunal in Singapore at 11 am, when I don't have any permission to do so, and what is worse, I will be arrested on sight if I ever landed there and thrown in jail!<br><br>You will recall from my earlier posts here, that I had written on numerous occasions not only to Lee Kuan Yew's immigration authorities but also to the Disciplinary Tribunal asking for permission to enter Singapore for my trial which is to be held from May 17, 2010 to May 21, 2010. <br><br>Except for an Email from Ng-Goh Siew Lee (Mrs) of the Singapore Immigration department dated Nov 13, 2009, acknowledging receipt of my letter, I have not received any permission to travel to Singapore at all! <br><br>Even though it remains the primary responsibility of Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore Disciplinary Tribunal, to arrange this so as to ensure that I can attend their hearings, they have told me not to bother them anymore and whatever I needed has to be directed to the Singapore Immigration authorities. <br><br>So as the matter now stands, I have been ordered to travel from California, USA to Singapore to appear before a Tribunal there on the 30th of April 2010 at 11am, even though they themselves have ordered me never to set foot in Singapore and if I did, sent to jail for 2 years!<br><br>And not just this. Up till April 19, 2010, I had never been informed by anyone of a hearing date of April 30, 2010. If they seriously expected me to appear at their hearing date in Singapore on April 30, 2010, should they not have informed me of this earlier, since I would have to purchase an airline ticket for travel before that date and a mere 10 days notice is surely not enough for someone to make arrangements to travel half way around the globe to Singapore! Which makes me think that perhaps they would prefer not to see me in Singapore at all!<br><br>Don't you think there is something wrong with this whole thing! How do you order someone to attend a hearing in Singapore while at the same time you refuse to give him permission to do it and what is more, you threaten to send him to jail if he ever came!<br><br>Is this what Lee Kuan Yew and his Tamil side kick, the Minister for Law K Shanmugam means as an example of their "best legal system in the world" and their "rule of law".<br><br>Is this a joke or do they really mean it? <br><br>We have had numerous examples of Singaporean "justice" to keep us entertained for some time. <br><br>Recently we have had the Kangaroo T Shirt case where Lee Kuan Yew's judge Judith Prakash sends 3 young men to jail merely for wearing T shirts engraved with pictures of kangaroos in judicial robes. Sending them to jail was bad enough but what was even worse was the fact that they were not within any courtroom at all! <br><br>Then we had my case when I was sent to jail for 2 months for criticizing Lee Kuan Yew's judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean for abusing the law to please her master, Lee Kuan Yew. <br><br>Then we had Dr. Chee Soon Juan being sent to jail numerous times for "speaking" in public because in that island, you need a permit to engage in the God given right to speak publicly! <br><br>Only a few days ago we had the case of 3 men from the Singapore Democratic Party sent to jail for merely walking along the road, which they term "a procession" and which in Lee Kuan Yew's island, a permit again is required. Only in Singapore would someone need a government permit to walk along the street in groups!<br><br>Even earlier we had the case of the same judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean allowing Lee Kuan Yew to win a defamation suit agsisnt Dr. Chee Soon Juan when the trial itself was conducted in her private office under closed doors with the Defendant prevented from calling any witnesses and when he objected and walked out of her office in protest, the judge and Lee Kuan Yew's lawyer privately had a meeting of sorts (Singaporean trial) and awarded the case to her boss (Lee Kuan Yew) after a few minutes!<br><br>But none of these legal procedures, amusing as they are, in Lee Kuan Yew's "rule of law" island can beat what they are doing to me. <br><br>In my case, they are in effect ordering me to enter Singapore on April 30, 2010 to attend a court hearing there, when they had previously ordered me never to enter their country and I will be arrested and sent to jail if I did!<br><br>Can anyone tell me a more interesting legal system that what that island of Singapore has, which not even Alice in Wonderland can beat? <br><br>Not wanting to spend any additional time sending them separate Emails to ask them what sort of joke are they trying to pull here, let me send this Blog post as an Email to all the relevant members of Lee Kuan Yew's rather entertaining group of people:<br><br>1)Ng-Goh Siew (Mrs), Immigration and checkpoint authority: ica_feedback@ica.gov.sg<br>2)Angela Chopard, Singapore Disciplinary Tribunal: angela_chopard@supcourt.gov.sg<br>3)Yogeswari d/o N Vadivellu, Singapore Disciplinary Tribunal: yogeswari_n_vadivellu@supcourt.gov.sg<br>4) Peter Low (aka Peter Cuthbert Low) of Colin Ng and Partners, Lee Kuan Yew's lawyer deployed to argue for the Singaporean Law Society to have me disbarred: peterlow@cnplaw.com <br><br><em>Gopalan Nair<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, CA 94538, USA<br>Tel: 510 657 6107<br>Fax: 510 657 6914<br>Email: nair.gopalan@yahoo.com<br>Blog: http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/</em></div>
