              <p>And when the banks agreed to fund you base on a long or short term contractual basis, you are on, go US, sign up with Carl Snr, they will help you to start up with all equipment and training. Then you are on...if the contractual with the banks is 5 years, you do it like working for the banks for 5 years, and later the whole business is yours, then you look for another franchises, and this time, because you are successful, instead of asking the banks, the banks will be knocking at your door to venture or loan you money ya.</p>

              <p>It's interesting to see how you pple let angel7030 derail the thread. Hasn't it been established that she's a troll? So shall we observe forum netiquette and refrain from engaging trolls. They will die a death as natural as their deliberate birth.</p>
