              <p>*shrugs* I am who I am. A true blue Singaporean who has made it successfully overseas. I am not interested to pretend to be a Westerner (and not interested to be sensitive to toads who have seen little of the world), but am instead proud to showcase my talents in USA.</p>
              <p>Those who scream and swear at me are merely toads in a well, who have not seen much of the world. It doesn't take a person with some degree of basic intelligence to understand the difference between (1) recognizing that Singapore is not the best place to live in and still being proud of our country, and (2) being not proud of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Only mature people are able to acknowledge the imperfections of Singapore and yet love it as a country.</p>
              <p>I love Singapore, but I do not condone actions of others who make it sound like it's the best place to be. It is NOT, at least not to everybody. There are some who sincerely believe it to be the best, but it is at most their opinion, just as it's my opinion that things are much better over here.</p>
              <p>Yes, I admit I am a little homesick, but yet, there is this whole new lifestyle here that has given me all the freedom I could only dream of in the past. I guess, those of us overseas, will just have to manage that homesickness, because at least for a period of time, that is a necessary price to pay for living life to the fullest.</p>
              <p>At least, we have the chance to be homesick, unlike the toads that have seen little, and are just jealous of those that are overseas.</p>

              <p>Racism is minimal especially in cosmopolitan cities, where Americans have already grown used to seeing people from all over the world. After all, USA attracts the best from all over the world to it.</p>
              <p>Crime rate is never lower than Singapore's, which is understandable given that it is a huge country. Just avoid areas which you should not go, and you are pretty safe.</p>
              <p>Not sure about USPS drivers, but yes, the pay is generally higher over here. Years back, when I took up a high-level consultant job in a US company in Singapore, I was paid in the top 15% bracket in Singapore, but yet, I found out that I replaced a similar consultant that did my job in the USA who is earning at least 2x more than I do.</p>

              <p>1. Every country, everywhere has its set of pros and cons, you win some you lose some. So it is up to you to see which set of pros and cons that suits you better.</p>
              <p>2. Everyone has different background, character and expectations and aspirations. So its pointless to compare lifestyles.</p>
              <p>3. Personally, I do love SG but I am concern about the future and didnt like what I see, esp for average Singaporean like myself. Hence now I am in OZ trying to build an alternate future. I cannot tell you that going overseas will be the "cure all". Who knows I might not like it in OZ and go back to SG after all.</p>
              <p>So, if one is not happy with his or her situation, dont just lament but work hard and grab those opportunities that will change your life for the better. Even better still if you can CREATE that opportunity for yourself.</p>

              <p>I love sg very much too.......I love the way we speak singlish, the way I was brought up.....but I lament very much at the corporatized way this country is run, esp in recent years.

              <p>I stay in Indonesia now. And I intend to buy a few properties within the next 5 years, all paid up within another 5 years. I can own a simple honda jazz 2nd hand for SGD$15k, paid up in 2 years. When I have kids of my own, I will buy them a car for them to move around when they go to school. Over the weekends, I can go see the various volcanoes and historical sites around indo. I can hire a worker and pay him or her just SGD$60 a month. I can hire the maid to come 3 times a week and I pay her SGD$60 a month. And these people...they do not live in poverty and they get by happily.</p>
              <p>And I can retire comfortably, travel the world when I'm old, all this without any "world class schemes" like HDBs and CPF. Come work and stay overseas like some of us here! The world is out there.</p>

              <p>1. Every country, everywhere has its set of pros and cons,

                  pros and cons that suits you better.</p>

              <p>3. Personally, I do love SG but I am concern about the future
                  and didnt like what I see, esp for average Singaporean like myself.

              <p>I do not gloat on others, but I run those who talk talk talk down, because all they do is lament and grumble, but they do nothing. These are the toads I am talking about. I am disappointed with the category of Singaporeans who does nothing but grumble, and in the end, still vote the PAP. Idiots who live the life of deliberate ignorance. If they choose the road of Death, what else can you say? Not to mention they bring the entire nation towards that path of no return.</p>
              <p>And please do not talk about fortune. It takes guts and abilities to grasp opportunities that come your way, and make those tough decisions.</p>
              <p>I hardly think I am 'fortunate' to be here. Rather, I am proud that I defeated the international competition to secure the job. Fortune played some part, but never a huge part in my life. I believe in getting what I want through my own efforts. God is busy enough. I should take care of myself and let Him go and help those that are really in need.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, given the pressure cooker conditions, you hardly get to enjoy the $$$ that you earn. Take my brother for instance, a CEO who earns a very high pay (much higher than mine), but works late nights, sometimes as late as midnight. I don't know about him, but I believe in living life to the fullest. Working hard is for the purpose of enjoying life. I don't believe in the elders saying that we should not keep thinking of enjoyment. If we don't enjoy now, then when?</p>

              <p>I think I have said clearly, that I am a true blue Singaporean, and I am proud of it. Therefore, I do not agree with how the Govt runs down our own people. I am flying the Singapore flag high here</p>
              <p>I do not blame the country, I think the road ahead for Singapore looks bleak, if we continue the current route that the PAP is advocating.</p>

              <p><br>Understand that there are rises and falls of every superpowers and dynasties or kingdoms since the dawn of mankind, even PAP leader knows that they will fall one of these days, but as long as they can hold power and strive on in making true blue singaporeans believing in them, why not? The ability to attract peoples to vote for them should be taken as a run down, but rather a skill and mastery of it profession.</p>
              <p>As nothing last forever, and nothing is permanent, with no doubt, PAP will fall one of these day, same as the British empire who was once said to be an empire that had it flag rising all the time to greet the rising sun. Nobody in the right will think that the Brit will fall?? And the Soviet too, and i hv no doubt that one of these day US of A will also fall, in fact, they are showing sign of it, that is why the white allow a Black to hold president status, so that he takes all the blame now.</p>
              <p>There are true blue people in this universe, you can see them in the Planet of Pandora...the blue people of Avatar  </p>
