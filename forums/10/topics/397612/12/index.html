              <p>Yes, interesting you brought up Indonesia as a comparison. It seems we are moving the opposite direction (income inequality) when all countries are trying to move toward more equality.</p>
              <p>One more thing, focusing too much on cost kills innovation. By focusing only on getting the cheapest labour, businesses in Singapore are immature and are only focusing on short-term. A reason why we do not have many brands in the global market.</p>

              <p>Yup thats exactly my picture for SG in time if it continues.</p>
              <p>It will be the heaven for the affluent ONLY, not unlike a mega luxury hotel where the rich come and enjoy and do business then pat pat backside go home, while the people (Singaporeans) provide the manpower to run this hotel cheaply so that the management (govt) earn big bucks.</p>
