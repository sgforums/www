              <p>It is a fact everywhere is about money...if you got money everything can be done for you easily.</p>
              <p>Ozies do alot DIYs instead of buying or hiring people, ie like paint their own houses, build their own fences and even some of their own furnitures, etc</p>
              <p>So in a way there is some form of alternative other then just paying, esp if you are poor or dont want to spend money to do something. They also have superstores like Bunnings to support such DIY way of life.</p>
              <p>However, in SG you dont really see yourself building something out of a some planks of timber say even a simple wooden shoe rack or a cupboard.</p>

But you hv the right to do your own design and planning, unlike Oz, we paid less tax and is able to get the obrigines to help us to build house, houses are cheap in taiwan, good for human to live in, but not for domestic animals like cats and dogs, if next time u go taiwan, you can see their front gate got a small door for stray dog to enter, once entered, the dog cannot come out and at nite, the taiwanese will have dog meat steamboat or we call it Hua Kwo hot pot with Hong cau niang or Ni Er hong.

              <p>Sorry, I dont mean you are gloat or you are successful due to luck. I am sure there's a lot of hardwork involved. Also, I share your view about the future of sg is not too bright if she is going down the current course.</p>
              <p>No offense, but I would suggest the tone of your posts be a little more positive then negative.</p>
              <p>I just think that many people are trapped in a vicious cycle which they cannot get out like family commitments, financial situations as well as personality traits (ie too scare to try). I was in such state until I decided to make a break for it.</p>
              <p>So all the more we, who have the opportunity to go beyond SG to see the world, should offer our experience and support to those who would like to do so.</p>
              <p>Also I would like to take this chance to thank Genie99a and Honeymouse for their valuable advice, support to help me settle down in oz.</p>

              <p>My apologies to you as well. I am actually raising the point that people who make it out of Singapore is not due to luck, but due to determination, just as you yourself are doing. For a person who is envious of those that are outside in the big world and think that it's pure luck for someone to get those opportunities, I can only say that such a person is a sorry piece of life.</p>
              <p>Life is all about being determined and working towards your goal. To know what you want, and work towards that. That's how I got here.</p>
              <p>I am also not being negative, but being realistic about the average Singaporean. How many elections have gone by, when you hear so much complaints, but when it comes to voting time, so many lost the guts to vote against the PAP? It makes me wonder if the result of the next election would be the same old result. If we continue to allow the PAP to hold so much power, then I must say we are truly idiots.</p>
              <p>I have never seen a country where leaders are not servants to their people, but lording over their people, except for Singapore. I have never seen a country where leaders can belittle their people, and get away with it at each election, except for Singapore.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, whose fault it is that we are saddled with high debt, low wages, and lots of overseas 'friends'? US. Each and every Singaporean who does not know how to walk out of the fiasco, and continue to whine but do nothing about it.</p>
              <p>By the way, just to humour myself a little to respond to an immature kid who is asking if I have a green card, I am holding a special status that is way above a green card. Something pretty close to a diplomat visa. And that's about it. Don't need to respond any further to the immature kid.</p>

              <p>It is a fact everywhere is about money...if you got money everything can be done for you easily.</p>
              <p>Ozies do alot DIYs instead of buying or hiring people, ie like paint their own houses, build their own fences and even some of their own furnitures, etc</p>
              <p>So in a way there is some form of alternative other then just paying, esp if you are poor or dont want to spend money to do something. They also have superstores like Bunnings to support such DIY way of life.</p>
              <p>However, in SG you dont really see yourself building something out of a some planks of timber say even a simple wooden shoe rack or a cupboard.</p>

              <p><br>Actually I do a lot of DIYs here in the USA too. It's not about the $$$, but it's part of the fun to build your own stuff, and becoming sort of self-reliant rather than always depending on others. I just had fun putting up my own pool table not long back :p</p>
              <p>In fact, USA isn't much different from Australia, in terms of DIY. Lots of people DIY. It's not a matter of $$$, but rather a way of life. We have Home Depot, Lowes, just to name a few, where you can get almost everything you need for DIY-ing.</p>
              <p>My boss, who owns several townhomes and a large bungalow where he needs to drive a machine to mow due to the size of his yard, still DIYs coz it's part of the way of life.</p>
              <p>My parents are very proud that I have matured from a bookworm, to a successful person in life, who is all rounded in terms of being able to DIY, being able to cook pretty well, being physically fit and active in sports, etc.</p>
