              <p><br>just for yr info, alots of hkees and taiwanese are looking into singapore as a potential breeding ground for business, more so in SME like what my dad did here, highly successful. Reason being, Singaporeans lack the entrepreneur and business skill both in OECD and Asian markets, and also their own local markets. Because as somone had rightly put it, you education creates smart nerd to be ministers or CEO only, not business men, you can hv nos 1 in maths, in languages, in science, but in business, most are nothing except hawker centre bosses.</p>
