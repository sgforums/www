            <div class='col-md body'>We have as a people over the past 42 years been led by the nose with one-sided government policies and actions based on so-called pragmatism or leadership which covered up all the problems suffered in silence.<br><br>The elected MPs and ministers in theory are supposed to represent peopleÂ’s views and aspirations and work towards them. In reality, they are too highly controlled by million-dollar rewards and concerned with their own benefits and career advancement to sacrifice for the people.<br><br>People are therefore not being served in such a materialistic capitalist system which in name like meritocracy or leadership sounds very good but in reality people are continuously being short-changed.<br><br>Therefore we need to develop a culture of questioning one-sided policies, views and information presented by whoever is running the government starting with questioning malpractices in NKF, Shin Corp, and lately refusal of police to grant anniversary celebration permit to WP while its own Ypap is allowed to do so.<br><br>The first criterion of a good and successful government is the quality of the people.<br><br>To all forumers, I urge them to speak fearlessly on what is wrong and uphold what is right.<br><br>It is therefore critical to develop such an active discussions of peopleÂ’s views and aspirations as a culture among online citizens otherwise they will lose their CPF retirements to some hogwashed policy which only served to excuse governing leaders of their own CPF fiasco.<br><br>People should no longer tolerate being taken for granted by its own overpaid non-elected walk-over leaders who are still trying to impose their own the conceptual top-down self-serving agendas like happening in NKF on the people.<br><br>People should get the government to change such a narrow-minded governing system to one which is for the greatest benefit of the greatest number which is far from happening even with all the so-called help schemes being talked about.<br><br>I would urge all forumers not to lose the above-stated perspective while disagreeing among themselves on minor issues in order to keep up questioning of wrongful policies and actions as a culture.</div>
