            <div class='col-md body'>Whether GIC or Temasek is exercising their right independently of the government to make their own organizational investment decisions over their portfolios or not is a secondary issue.<br><br>Of course the government can say that many of its GLCs too can also do the same making their own investments decisions without any interventions by the government.<br><br>The main issue here is : are such monies held by GIC or Temasek or GLCs public monies belonging to the public citizens?<br><br>If they are not, by all means go ahead and let them invest according to their own policies or wishes and it is true the government should not intervene in such matter.<br><br>On the other hand if the monies held by GIC or Temasek are public monies then the respective organizations holding these funds are only trustees and as trustees the general law should require them to invest such trust funds only according to certain criteria or principles.<br><br>The government has no legal or constitutional right to splash public funds on some citibank or UBS especially where our ministers also are rightly or wrongly their fiduciary advisors involving them in potential conflicts of interest.</div>

I make the decision so I do not blame her for my mistake. It would be stupid of me to just give her the money and not know what she does with if. It's absurd to even think that questioning her would be violating her professionalism.<br><br>But.. if the money is not mine, it's a never-ending stream of cash and I'm just making money from the transaction, that's a different story. I wouldn't give a damn if she looses two billion as long as I still make money regardless if it is a wise or stupid decision.<br><br>Oh I forgot to add... I would even second decision even if it is stupid simply because the she is my boss' wife.</div>

Black can be white and white black now. So power has taken a life of its own and has now become absolute.<br><br>With absolute power, it is easy to pretend to be caring and concerned but in actual fact the power will continue to govern to suit its own hidden agendas. Examples include the NKF problems people complained about for years yet there is no solution. Ministers do not need more monies to be retained as none of them are resigning to join private sector for higher pays and they privately know it is immoral and wrong to write their own pay cheques. Yet what do we see - another and another rounds of non-stops increases or taking of their own rewards. The same thing is happening to the investments of people's surpluses in the banks connected to them as they like. They know it is public trust monies and they should invest such monies only within the laws but they don't care and continue to talk with hypocrisy or looking the other way and not listening to complaints.<br><br>Because the power that be has tasted power and is fully prepared to deny all problems and challenge any one who criticise ' we have the mandate you are just a vocal minority". Power = all problems solved"<br><br>Practically, there is no point for people to try to reason or rationalize with despots.<br><br>The frequent excuse given to deny any problem is to quote worse-case scenarios saying how lucky we are as compared with others like Indonesians or Philippinos or Thais.<br><br>The second most common excuse is to claim with elections totally manipulated to perpetuate themselves "take us on if you can"<br><br>People are wasting their time attending forums, giving feedbacks and writing to newspapers.<br><br>Mr. Khaw is aware that the government is not subsidizing the medical servies because the total taxes collected are far in excess of expenditures yet he is not admitting this as an error or negligence in responsibility to serve the people.<br><br>But he will still insist on his means test to charge more fees so that the tax monies (only less than 4% of taxes as compared with a probable original allocation of 8%) will continue to be hoarded for surpluses to serve government other hidden agendas.<br><br>With a total tax revenue of more than S$6 billion per year there is no reason why government cannot provide basic medical class "C' services but Mr. Khaw does not care now because he too has now tasted power.</div>
