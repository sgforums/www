              <h1>Israel takes control of more West Bank land</h1>
              <p>By  KARIN LAUB  –  <span class="hn-date">5 days ago</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD96CLP4O1?awr=fkl;sw">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD96CLP4O1?awr=fkl;sw</a></p>
              <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has taken control of a large chunk of land
              near a prominent West Bank settlement, paving the way for the possible
              construction of 2,500 settlement homes, officials said Monday, in a new
              challenge to Mideast peacemaking.</p>
              <p>Successive Israeli governments
              have broken promises to the United States to halt settlement expansion,
              defined by Washington as an obstacle to peace. Ongoing expansion is
              likely to create friction not only with the Palestinians, but with
              President Barack Obama, whose Mideast envoy, George Mitchell, has long
              pushed for a settlement freeze. Obama has said he'd get involved
              quickly in Mideast peace efforts.</p>
              <p>The composition of Israel's
              next government is not clear yet following inconclusive elections last
              week. However, right-wing parties are given a better chance to form a
              ruling coalition, with hardline leader Benjamin Netanyahu at the helm.</p>
              <p>Netanyahu
              supports settlement expansion and has derided peace talks with the
              Palestinians as a waste of time, saying he would focus instead of
              trying to improve the Palestinian economy. Palestinian President
              Mahmoud Abbas has dismissed Netanyahu's approach as a non-starter, and
              his aides said recently that peace talks can only resume after a
              settlement freeze.</p>
              <p>At the center of the latest expansion plans is Efrat, a settlement of about 1,600 families south of Jerusalem.</p>
              <p>The
              mayor of Efrat, Oded Revivi, said the Israeli military designated 425
              acres (172 hectares) near Efrat as so-called state land two weeks ago
              at the end of a lengthy appeals process. He said nine appeals were
              filed by Palestinian landowners, adding that eight were rejected and
              one was upheld.</p>
              <p>Revivi said Efrat plans to build 2,500 homes on
              that land, but that several steps of government approval would still be
              needed before construction could begin — a process that could take
              years. Eventually, Efrat is to grow to a city of 30,000 people, he said.</p>
              <p>The
              settlement is situated in one of the three major settlement blocs that
              Israel expects to hold on to in any final peace deal. Palestinian
              reaction to the latest development was not immediately available.</p>
              <p>Palestinian
              President Mahmoud Abbas, Israel's peace partner, warned that continued
              settlement expansion would cripple peace talks.</p>
              <p>"We oppose
              settlement activity in principle and if the settlement activity doesn't
              stop, any meetings (with the Israelis) will be worthless," Abbas said.</p>
              <p>Nearly
              290,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements today, or 95,000 more
              than in May 2001 when Mitchell first called for a settlement freeze. At
              the time, he led a fact-finding mission to Israel and the Palestinian
              territories to find a way to end months of violence and resume peace
              talks.</p>
              <p>Mitchell called on the Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis and demanded that Israel halt construction in settlements.</p>
              <p>In
              other developments Monday, Palestinian rockets exploded in southern
              Israel and Israeli jets bombed the Egypt-Gaza border as talks dragged
              on over a long-term truce that would bring quiet to the coastal
              territory.</p>
              <p>Israel has been battling Gaza's Hamas rulers, while
              simultaneously pursuing a peace agreement with Abbas' rival government
              in the West Bank.</p>
              <p>In Monday's violence, two rockets fired from
              Gaza landed in Israel, the Israeli military said, a near-daily
              occurrence even after the devastating three-week Israeli offensive that
              was meant to bring a halt to the fire. No one was injured, the military
              said.</p>
              <p>Several hours later, Israeli jets bombed an area of
              smuggling tunnels in the frontier town of Rafah, according residents
              and Hamas security officials. Israel's military said the strike
              targeted a tunnel used to smuggle weapons in from Egypt and was
              retaliation for the rocket fire.</p>
              <p>Israel ended its military
              offensive in Gaza on Jan. 18, and the territory's Islamic Hamas rulers
              declared a cease-fire the same day. But sporadic violence has continued
              as Egypt tries to mediate a long-term truce.</p>
              <p>Hamas is demanding
              that Israel open Gaza's blockaded border crossings, but Israel says it
              will fully open the crossings only after Hamas releases Sgt. Gilad
              Schalit, an Israeli tank crewman captured in June 2006. Israel is
              allowing in only humanitarian aid, and on Monday was to allow some 200
              aid trucks and fuel for Gaza's power plant to enter the territory, the
              military said.</p>
              <p>Hamas wants Israel to release hundreds of
              prisoners in return for Schalit, including high-ranking militants and
              the masterminds of deadly suicide bombings.</p>
              <p>Israel's top leadership is scheduled to meet this week to formulate a response to Hamas' demands.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Israel is a Terrorist State by Definition: Chomsky</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Following
              is an excerpt of Professor Chomsky’s interview with Christiana Voniati,
              who is head of International News Department POLITIS Newspaper,
              Nicosia, Cyprus.<br> <br> By Christiana Voniati<br> <br> February 21, 2009 "</strong><a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/voniati160209.htm"><strong>Countercurrents</strong></a><strong>" -- Voniati: </strong>The
              international public opinion and especially the Muslim world seem to
              have great expectations from the historic election of Obama. Can we, in
              your opinion, expect any real change regarding the US approach to the
              Israeli-Palestinian conflict?</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky:</strong> Not much. Quite the contrary: it may be harsher than before. In the
              case of Gaza, Obama maintained silence, he didn’t say a word. He said
              well there’s only one president so I can’t talk about it. Of course he
              was talking about a lot of other things but he chose not to talk about
              this. His campaign did repeat a statement that he had made while
              visiting Israel six months earlier –he had visited Sderot where the
              rockets hit- and he said “if this where happening to my daughters, I
              wouldn’t think of any reaction as legitimate”, but he couldn’t say
              anything about Palestinian children. Now, the attack on Gaza was at
              time so that it ended right before the inauguration, which is what I
              expected. I presume that the point was so that they could make sure
              that Obama didn’t have to say something, so he didn’t. And then he gave
              his first foreign policy declaration, it was a couple of days later
              when he appointed George Mitchell as his emissary, and he said nothing
              about Gaza except that “our paramount interest is preserving the
              security of Israel”. Palestine apparently doesn’t have any requirement
              of security. And then in his declaration he said of course we are not
              going to deal with Hamas -the elected government the US immediately, as
              soon as the government was elected in a free election the US and Israel
              with the help of European Union immediately started severely punishing
              the Palestinian population for voting in the “wrong way” in a free
              election and that’s what we mean by democracy. The only substantive
              comment he made in the declaration was to say that the arab peace plan
              had constructive elements, because it called for a normalization of
              relations with Israel and he urged the arab states to proceed with the
              normalization of relations. Now, he is an intelligent person, he knows
              that that was not what the arab peace plan said. The arab peace plan
              called for a two state settlement on the international border that is
              in accord with the long standing international consensus that the US
              has blocked for over 30 years and in that context of the two state
              settlement we should even proceed further and move towards a
              normalization of relations with Israel. Well, Obama carefully excluded
              the main content about the two state settlement and just talked about
              the corollary, for which a two state settlement is a precondition. Now
              that’s not an oversight, it can’t be. That’s a careful wording, sending
              the message that we are not going to change their (Israel’s)
              rejectionist policy. We ‘ll continue to be opposed to the international
              consensus on this issue, and everything else he said accords with it.
              We will continue in other words to support Israel’s settlement
              policies- those policies are undermining any possible opportunity or
              hope for a viable Palestinian entity of some kind. And it’s a continued
              reliance on force in both parts of occupied Palestine. That’s the only
              conclusion you could draw.</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Voniati</strong>:
              Let us talk about the timing of the assault on the Gaza Strip. Was it
              accidental or did it purposefully happen in a vacuum of power? To
              explain myself, the global financial crisis has challenged the almost
              absolute US global hegemony. Furthermore, the attack on Gaza was
              launched during the presidential change of guard. So, did this vacuum
              of power benefit the Israeli assault on Gaza?</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky:</strong> Well, the timing was certainly convenient since attention was focused
              elsewhere. There was no strong pressure on the president or other high
              officials of the US to say anything about it. I mean Bush was on his
              way out, and Obama could hide behind the pretext that he’s not yet in.
              And pretty much the same was in Europe, so that they could just say,
              well we can’t talk about it now, it’s too difficult a time. The assault
              was well chosen in that respect. It was well chosen in other respects
              too: the bombing began shortly after Hamas had offered a return to the
              2005 agreement, which in fact was supported by the US. They said, ok,
              let’s go back to the 2005 agreement that was before Hamas was elected.
              That means no violence and open the borders. Closing the borders is a
              siege, it’s an act of war……… not very harmful but it’s an act of war.
              Israel of all countries insists on that. I mean Israel went to war
              twice in 1956 and 1967 on the grounds, it claimed, that its access to
              the outside world was being hampered. It wasn’t a siege, its access
              through the Gulf of Aqaba was being hampered. Well if that is an act of
              war then certainly a siege is, and so it’s understood. </span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So
              Khaled Mashaal asked for an end of the state of the war, which would
              include opening the borders. Well, a couple of days later, when Israel
              didn’t react to that, Israel attacked. The attack was timed for
              Saturday morning – the Sabbath day in Israel – at about 11:30, which
              happens to be the moment when children are leaving school and crowds
              are miling in the streets of this very heavily crowded city… The
              explicit target was police cadets… Now, there are civilians, in fact we
              now know that for several months the legal department of the Israeli
              army had been arguing against this plan because it said it was a direct
              attack against civilians. And of course, plenty civilians will be
              killed if you bomb a crowded city, especially at a time like that. But
              finally the legal department was sort of bludgeoned into silence by the
              military so they said alright. So that’s when they opened –on a Sabbath
              morning. Now two weeks later, Israel – on Saturday as well- blocked the
              humanitarian aid because they didn’t want to disgrace Sabbath. Well,
              that’s interesting too. But the main point about the timing was that
              there was an effort to undercut the efforts for a peaceful settlement
              and it was terminated just in time to prevent pressure on Obama to say
              something about it. It’s hard to believe that this isn’t conscious. We
              know that it was very meticulously planned for many months beforehand.</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Voniati</strong>: In a recent interview with LBC, you said that the policies of Hamas are more conducive to peace than the US’s or Israel’s. </span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky</strong>: Oh yes, that’s clear.</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Voniati:</strong> Also, that the policies of Hamas are closer to international consensus
              on a political peaceful settlement than those of Israel and the US. Can
              you explain your stance?</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky:</strong> Well for several years Hamas has been very clear and explicit,
              repeatedly, that they favor a two state settlement on the international
              border. They said they would not recognize Israel but they would accept
              a two state settlement and a prolonged truce, maybe decades, maybe 50
              years. Now, that’s not exactly the international consensus but it’s
              pretty close to it. On the other hand, the United States and Israel
              flatly reject it. They reject it in deeds, that’s why they are building
              all the construction development activities in the West Bank, not only
              in violation of international laws, US and Israel know that the illegal
              constructions are designed explicitly to convert the West Bank into
              what the architect of the policy, Arial Sharon, called bantustan.
              Israel takes over what it wants, break up Palestine into unviable
              fragments. That’s undermining a political settlement. So in deeds, yes
              of course they are undermining it, but also in words: that goes back to
              1976 when the US vetoed the Security Council resolution put forward by
              the arab states which called for a two state settlement and it goes
              around until today. In December, last December, at the meetings of the
              UN’s General Assembly there were many resolutions passed. One of them
              was a resolution calling for recognition of the right of
              self-determination of the Palestinian people. It didn’t call for a
              state, just the right of self-determination. It passed with 173 to 5.
              The 5 were the US, Israel and a few small pacific islands. Of course
              that can’t be reported in the US. So they are rejecting it even in
              words, as well as –more significantly- in acts. On the other hand,
              Hamas comes pretty close to accepting it. Now, the demand which Obama
              repeated on Hamas is that they must meet three conditions: they must
              recognize Israel’s right to exist, they must renounce violence and they
              must accept past agreements, and in particular the Road Map. Well, what
              about the US and Israel? I mean, obviously they don’t renounce
              violence, they reject the Road Map – technically they accepted it but
              Israel immediately entered 14 reservations (which weren’t reported
              here) which completely eliminated its content, and the US went along.
              So the US and Israel completely violate those two conditions, and of
              course they violate the first, they don’t recognize Palestine. So sure,
              there’s a lot to criticize about Hamas, but on these matters they seem
              to be much closer to –not only international opinion- but even to a
              just settlement than the US and Israel are. </span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Voniati: </strong>On
              the other hand, Hamas has been accused of using human shields to hide
              and protect itself. Israel insists that the war was a matter of
              defense. Is Hamas a terrorist organization, as it is accused to be? Is
              Israel a terrorist state?</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky:</strong> Well, Hamas is accused of using human shields, rightly or wrongly. But
              we know that Israel does it all the time. Is Israel a terrorist state?
              Well yes according to official definitions. I mean, one of the main
              things holding up cease fire right now is that Israel insists that it
              will not allow a cease fire until Hamas returns a captured Israeli
              soldier Gilad Shalit - he’s very famous in the West everybody knows he
              was captured. Well, one day before Gilad Shalit was captured, Israeli
              forces went into Gaza City and kidnapped two Palestinian civilians (the
              Muamar Brothers) and brought them across the border to Israel in
              violation of international law and hid them somewhere in the huge
              Israeli prisons. Nobody knows what happened to them since. I mean,
              kidnapping civilians is a much worse crime than capturing a soldier of
              an attacking army. And furthermore this has been regular Israeli
              practice for decades. They’ve been kidnapping civilians in Lebanon or
              on the high seas…They take them to Israel, put them into prisons,
              sometimes keeping them as hostages for long periods. So you know, if
              the capturing of Gilad Shalit is a terrorist act, well, then israel’s
              regular practice supported by the US is incomparably worse. And that’s
              quite apart from repeated aggression and other crimes. I don’t like
              Hamas by any means, there is plenty to criticize about them, but if you
              compare their actions with US and Israel, they are minor criminals. </span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Voniati</strong>: Though of Jewish decent, you have been repeatedly accused of anti-Semitism. How do you respond? </span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky</strong>:
              The most important comment about that was made by the distinguished
              statesman Abba Eban, maybe 35 years ago, in an address to the American
              people. He said that there are two kinds of criticism of Zionism (by
              Zionism I mean the policies of the state of Israel). One is criticism
              by anti-Semites and the other is criticism by neurotic self-hating
              Jews. That eliminates 100% of possible criticism. The neurotic
              self-hating Jews, he actually mentioned two, I was one and I.F. Stone,
              a well-known writer was another). I mean that’s the kind of thing that
              would come out of a communist party in its worst days. But you see, I
              can’t really be called anti-semite because I’m jewish so I must be a
              neurotic self-hating Jew, by definition. The assumption is that the
              policies of the state of Israel are perfect, so therefore any kind of
              criticism must be illegitimate. And that’s from Abba Eban, one of the
              most distinguished figures in Israel, the most westernised … praised,
              considered a dove. </span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Voniati: </strong>How do you comment on the Davos incident concerning Erdogan’s verbal attack against Peres?</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky</strong>:
              It was impolite. You are not supposed to behave like that at Davos. But
              the idea that Peres was given 25 minutes to justify major atrocities
              and aggression, that’s what’s shocking. Why have that at Davos? I mean,
              do you allow Saddam Husein in such a gathering to justify the invasion
              of Kuwait? So Erdogan reacted, in my view, not in accord with the
              gentile atmosphere of the collection of the people who but basically
              appropriate under the circumstances.</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Voniati:</strong> Have you, by any chance, been informed about the Cypriot-flagged vessel
              "Monchegorsk" that is docked in Limassol and seems to have been
              carrying weapons to the Hamas-run Gaza Strip? Israel and the United
              States requested that the vessel be stopped...</span></p>
              <p class="style3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Chomsky:</strong> I don’t know about the Iranian vessel but I do know that right in the
              middle of the Gaza attack, Dignity was blocked in international waters
              and attacked by the Israeli navy and almost sunk. Now, that’s a major
              crime. That’s much worse than piracy off the coast of Somalia for
              example. If the Iranian vessel was stopped in international waters,
              that’s completely illegitimate. Israel has no authority to do anything
              in international waters. And the talk about not sending arms to Gaza …I
              mean, do they stop sending arms to Israel? I mean right in the middle
              of the Gaza war, the pentagon announced that it was sending a huge
              shipman of armaments to Israel. Did anybody stop that? They should say
              that those armaments are not intended for use by the Israeli army. The
              pentagon also announced that they are being prepositioned, that is,
              that they re being placed in Israel for the use of the US army In other
              words what they re saying is –and it’s been true for a long time- is
              that the US regards Israel as an offshore military base of its own,
              which they can use for their aggressive acts throughout the region.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the above 2 articles.  It is expected Israel will grab more land especially the recent election result with PM in the waiting of Netanyahu.  The new PM is known for his hawkish policy towards the palestinian land grabbing and other tough military actions. Netanyahu also knows that past and present US presidents had and will support Israel while the rest of the world leaders cannot do anything except nod in agreement.</div>
