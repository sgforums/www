            <div class='col-md body'>Came across this post in http://forums.keeptouch.net/showthread.php?t=96435. The command of English is REALLY BAD!!! It really made me wonder how can people who "had" such high education in SG yet can even have the cheek to post their comments in a forum which is read by almost everyone and anyone... Shame and such disgrace to us... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Here it goes... "Enjoy~"<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Me post this behalf of my sis.<br>juz wan to warn ppl who wanna try this restaurant.<br><br>Below is her comments( She has been working in service line for more den 5years)<br><br>My sis wrote:<br><br>I had a very bad dinning experience at the restaurant Giraffe today. It is my 1st time eating in the restaurant and will be my last time there. I always wanted to eat at this place wherever I walk pass Plaza Singapura.<br><br>Therefore my friends planned an outing there on 7 Sep. We had a group of 6. My friends and I arrived at the restaurant 1st. We informed the host we need a table for 6 and were informed that the seats on level 2 canÂ’t take 6 paxs. This is the 1st time we eat in the restaurant so we assumed that it is some fine dining restaurant that most of the table is in 2 or 4 paxs (from the look of the restaurant it look classic).<br><br>We were offered the table at level 1 which is near the Bar. The ambience at the bar is nice but is definitely not meant for eating as there is no lightings. Only a small candle. We have to take the menu near the candle to read, very pathetic. We had a default menu with all the same item of each page, is that a joke?<br><br>The place was also very warm, hot. When I ask the staff to turn on the fan, he told me it spoiled. (What?! A restaurant?). Therefore I ask for ice water and they say they donÂ’t provide! When we reconfirm with the next staff is Â“there really not space for 6 paxsÂ” then they inform us that theyÂ’re full, all seat are taken. Ask if we would like to wait for a table. CanÂ’t they just inform us there are seats but are all taken up instead of just let us act as a fool at the bar.<br><br>When we finally reach the table at level 2, we order out food. I order a dessert and my friend order pasta. When the food arrived, the staff didnÂ’t change our table setting for cutlery. I have to eat my dessert with the dinner fork and my friend my dinner fork and knife for pasta, very funny right? Who eat pasta using knife? When the drink was served, the drink is so full that the waiter spilled the drink before it even touch the table!<br><br>My friend order a cocktail and when served she commented that the drink donÂ’t have any alcohol taste, she even pass around the drink for all of us. We require for redo. But when the new cocktail arrived, we feel insulted. The bar man (I assume) ask my friend have she drink the cocktail before. He though we are kids, never drink before meh so angry, looks down on us!<br><br>When weÂ’re only half way done, the waiter informs us for last serving. We was shocked, we ask what rime the restaurant close and he reply 1 p.m. The time then is only 10 p.m. We will like to have some bar snack and he reply it also last order. What type of restaurant closes at 1 and last order at 10 even for bar snack? So guest for 10 to 1 only drink donÂ’t eat la?<br><br>We were force to order Nacho(menu said it serve wif the green sauce, something i look forward to.) and calamari early. We require the staff to keep our food warm and serve when we finish our meal but think the staff forget and service it soon after hai!<br><br>The calamari.was not fresh at all. Nacho din come wif the green sauce tat is stated in the menu. Ask the waiter come n explain, menu was not up to date n blar blar blar. manager came also din really do any damage control at all. Din even change another plate of calamari.<br><br>I left e place early, my fren settled e bill..<br>I can't find e offical webbie to write a complain letter to them. haiz.<br>__________________<br></div>

Which idiotic moron will open it's kitchen till 1am when it's a restaurant &amp; bar?? If so, might as well call it a restaurant instead.

It's not about a restaurant, @ least not so much of it.. It just unbearable when people just simply love to complain and complain. Not knowing what actually went on yet the way they complain is so unreadable... Anyways, it's a Friday; normally any restaurant will be full house. She didn't mention that she had a reservation of any sort. Just walked in like that and expected to have a table ready for 6pax??? It's kinda ridiculous and ironical when she mentioned that the restaurant seems to be a fine dining restaurant. Pardon my ignorance but just my 2cents worth, as far as I know, any restaurant will need a reservation for diners whether they're 2 or more; especially during weekends. And she also mentioned she is in service line for more than 5yrs. It really makes me ponder what kinda service industry she is in. Everywhere we go, it's first come, first served. Isn't it?<br>Why be such a pain in the ...?? It isn't about how much $$ being spent but the basic etiquette that a diner should have. Just simply feel that just by spending sme $$$, can criticise till the cows come home??? Simply cannot stand people as such...</div>

Who are you talking about on not making sense at all in his post?<br>And just as you know, that restaurant mentioned; had been around since last year hence it isn't new anymore.<br><br>Exactly my point, singaporean love to complain and it's in our blood. That's what I am doing now, isn't it? Nonetheless, if the complaint somewhat make sense, it's still understandable but this one doesn't and with the added bad command of english; just made us look like some uneducated fools blabbing about our bad experience. We spent almost three quarter of our life, indulging in studies whether we like it or not. It is to upgrade ourselves. The level of education we are getting here is unlike our neighbouring countries. And that I supposed; to you, my construction of english is like your primary school standard. Unfortunately, I'm from the 70s; where marbles playing and bell bottoms existed, etc. Thus the education I received, wasn't up to your standard. My sincere apologies for that. But the post which got me started this thread; is from someone of your generation or younger; Yes, I may have assumed your age. My apology if my assumption is wrong. So what are we missing here? Singaporeans who love to complain or just have no sense of responsibilities in their own action of words?<br><br>Have you ever wonder why is the service industries has been getting from bad to worse? Guess it's pretty much due to the fact that most singaporeans think that way -Customer is king. Just by spending some money, does that mean they are kings? And everyone else are their slaves? How are we going to improve our service and be able to provide good service our citizens whenever such happens? It's an issue we refused to acknowledge, refused to admit. Or is that just the way we are? If so, guess it's about time we REFLECT and make amendments to that mentality.<br><br>I clearly understand your point. Judge not or be judged. You can use three or more fingers or even toes to point at me. I am perfectly fine with that. Likewise, there maybe more pointing at you as we speak. There is ALWAYS a higher mountain out there. It doesn't bother me that bit. Though I used short forms and some of my sentences do not make any sense to you but the least they are from the humble 70s' standard.(Not making excuses but the standard wasn't that high as currently) It is a laughing stock and great mockery to see those from the later generations writting such post with such bad command of english, yet can be posted in two forums?! Self-reflection or self-denial of our actions and speech?<br><br>PS: I would appreciate if you have the least courtesy to find out my humble name rather than addressing me as TS. Thank you.</div>

Not knowing what actually went on yet the way they complain is so unreadable... Anyways, it's a Friday; normally any restaurant will be full house. She didn't mention that she had a reservation of any sort. Just walked in like that and expected to have a table ready for 6pax??? It's kinda ridiculous and ironical when she mentioned that the restaurant seems to be a fine dining restaurant. Pardon my ignorance but just my 2cents worth, as far as I know, any restaurant will need a reservation for diners whether they're 2 or more; especially during weekends. And she also mentioned she is in service line for more than 5yrs. It really makes me ponder what kinda service industry she is in. Everywhere we go, it's first come, first served. Isn't it?<br>Why be such a pain in the ...?? It isn't about how much $$ being spent but the basic etiquette that a diner should have. Just simply feel that just by spending sme $$$, can criticise till the cows come home??? Simply cannot stand people as such...</blockquote>....so you are complaining because<br>1. people are fond of complaining, or<br>2. that you are not happy with the standard of English that Singaporeans have???<br>3. or that maybe, you worked at Giraffe?????<br><br>because I am quite sure that you fall into categories 1 and 2.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
