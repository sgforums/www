Otherwise, it's much worst than Restaurant Industry.<br><br>Anyway, i am out of track.  Karen, what i wanna say to u is..It's not easy being in F &amp; B line.  Cos it concern abt interpersonal skill.  It is abt how u r goin to deal with insatisfied customers using limited resources from the company.  It is a challenge every day.  A challenge to control our short temper cos certain customer is being difficult, dealing wif kitchen staff as well as our co-workers.<br>But it is really satisfyin when u hav seen another smiling face walk out of ur restaurant, or even a alittle thank you along the way from them.<br><br>For tat smile, Karen, I hav challenge myself to see more of those smiling faces everyday.

We, being in service line, can totally understand how a fellow F &amp; B staff feels..But we cant really expect the rest to understand, moreover, sad to say, thy r not oblige to.  If u intend to carry on in tis line, challenge urself.  Im sure the staff at Giraffe knows how to cope with this emotional + mental challenge, in fact those who stay in tis line do.

Am i bad not to tip when there are no service charges ?</blockquote><span style="color: red;">Kramnave, you super regular where?? Actually just for your info, place who claim no service charges; are all bull cause they already mark-up the prices in their menus. Maybe that explains why it is so expensive. But service charges do not go to the staffs but the companies though. And for some, even credit card tippings go to the companies. Not a cent will go to the staffs at all... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </span></div>

Cos in some company, they combined all tips for the mths and share by havin a meal somewhere or watever, instead of givin out to the staff..It's not a fair deal.  Esp to the one who provide excellent service &amp; yet b treated as the fair performance staff.</div>

I started when very young, tried a few other industries but still much prefer F&amp;B service. Yourself isn't far either, 10 years huh. Keep it going. I've moved to training team from the front service already. I don't think nor feel everyone should know how it is like to be in our shoes but just strongly think and feel that we should treat everyone with RESPECT, whether they are maids, cleaners, service staffs &amp; etc. We are; afterall, human, made of flesh &amp; blood, with feelings and given birth by our parents, not some low down trash or freaks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </span></div>
