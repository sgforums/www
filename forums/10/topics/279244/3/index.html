Scrap the service charge, bring back tipping and service staff will naturally have more incentive to provide professional service too.  </div></blockquote><span style="color: red;">My heartfelt appreciation for your opinion, I can't agree more. By the way, as far as I know, service charge is not given to service staffs either, it just go to the company.<br><br>What's worse is that they looked at the service staffs there(at Giraffe) by rolling their eyes up and down then further insulted the place they are working at. Saying "This kind of place still need to make reservation one meh?? Full house meh?? Sure or not?? We got money to spend k.." They ordered a cocktail and complained that it wasn't "alcoholic" enough, the service staff apologised and changed it immediately. One of them said "Wei... Where got like that say one, what not alcoholic enough? Don't anyhow form sentence leh.." The rest simply replied "Aiya, nevermind lah. Those waiters also don't understand chim chim english. Like they very educated like that. If educated then won't be waiters liao what! Waste time only!"<br><br>I heard every single word and witnessed the whole scene as I was there; seated just next to their table with 6 of my friends. Then later saw that post in two separate forums, really saddening...</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, some people think that waiters and waitresses are like maids, people who are beneath them. They simply forgot that these people are just like them, humans.<br><br>Indeed, it is rather sad that those people made those comments at the waiters at the restaurant. While indeed customers are the ones that help to keep the restaurant going by spending there, it is quite another thing to make unreasonable demands again and again and even to laugh at the waiters.<br><br>Maybe its time some people learn that if you want great service, please respect the one providing the service first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Karen,<br><br>I hav been in F &amp; B industry (restaurant) for abt 10 yrs .  I totally understand how u feel.<br><br>F &amp; B industry has always been the industry tat <span style="font-style: italic;">most</span> Singaporeans (no offense to Sg'reans) wld think twice abt working.  Cos in the mindset of <span style="font-style: italic;">most</span> Sg'reans, being in service = being look down upon.  Thy will think that if thy are to work in F &amp; B line, it HAS to be in Hotel Industry, at least it sounds better, more high-class.  Actually there is not much differences, Hotel Industry is ONLY <strong>looking good</strong> if u r in higher managements.  Otherwise, it's much worst than Restaurant Industry.<br><br>Anyway, i am out of track.  Karen, what i wanna say to u is..It's not easy being in F &amp; B line.  Cos it concern abt interpersonal skill.  It is abt how u r goin to deal with insatisfied customers using limited resources from the company.  It is a challenge every day.  A challenge to control our short temper cos certain customer is being difficult, dealing wif kitchen staff as well as our co-workers.<br>But it is really satisfyin when u hav seen another smiling face walk out of ur restaurant, or even a alittle thank you along the way from them.<br><br>For tat smile, Karen, I hav challenge myself to see more of those smiling faces everyday.  Be it from my satisfying customers or my co-workers, it makes my day when i see them smile.<br><br>Karen, tis is not an easy task tat can be built along the way.  We, being in service line, can totally understand how a fellow F &amp; B staff feels..But we cant really expect the rest to understand, moreover, sad to say, thy r not oblige to.  If u intend to carry on in tis line, challenge urself.  Im sure the staff at Giraffe knows how to cope with this emotional + mental challenge, in fact those who stay in tis line do.  So, ask urself, issit neccessary to get angry over such thing &amp; insult them back?  Isnt tat make u the same as them too??<br><br>Think abt it &amp; challenge urself.  U wll b amazed at the results.<br><br>Get it over &amp; done with.  Cheerz!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
