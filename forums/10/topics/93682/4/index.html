Just like most China citizen doesn't know there are people kill in 64 incident.<br><br>BTW, I am not a representative of Malaysian and I don't plan to act like one. I just trying to answer questions here based on my knowledge and experience. The stories I heard about Malaysian workers in Singapore is thru my relative who work in Singapore and some friend's friend who work in Singapore. They comment that Singaporean are not friendly, they think that they are higher class people compare to Malaysian.<br><br>You know what? I experienced something similiar here when some of you start posting how rich Singaporean are compare to Malaysian, where by most of you can buy expensive bangalow here in JB.<br>[/b]</blockquote>If you are talking about some arrogant singaporean, I agree with you.<br>There are one million foreigners working in singapore, from professional pass holders to construction labours. How is it that it is the Malaysian who are suffering?<br>From your post, your friends commented that Singaprorean are not friendly, so your friends suffer!! Have your friends been friendly themselves? How did your friends suffer?? so much that you expect the rest of singapore to know?</div>
