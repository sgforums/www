            <div class='col-md body'>Burntan<br><br>There are no NEP-style affirmative programmes which favour one race over another in Singapore.<br>The success of the Singaporean Malay over his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">counterparts in the region </span> is evident, whether you look at it from education, occupation, wealth, integration with the rest of Singaporeans (of other races) etc. This was pointed out by Singapore a few years ago, and the published statistics caused a diplomatic fracas with Malaysia.<br>Perhaps it may strike you as uncommon if you have lived in Malaysia for a long time, but by and large, no one actually gives much thought to the other person's skin colour in our daily lives. We compete for the same jobs, attend the same schools, go to the same food courts.<br>In fact, I am meeting a group of friends later for dinner, one of whom is Malay Muslim. We intend to eat at the same table (gasp!) but we have not decided on which film to catch yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

It's too drastic a generalisation for me, although I will not explain my opinion on this subject here.<br><br>Of course the arrest of JI members, and the war in Iraq are different issues ultimately. But as I pointed out earlier, matters of defence, foreign policy and security are really incompatible with public feedback sessions. Both issues (JI and Iraq) belong to one (or all) of the categories. No country conducts a national referendum or consultation session before deciding to take military action. That would eliminate the element of surprise, so crucial in military strategy besides being politically and socially untenable.</div>

Similarly more is done to help the race that needs it. Education is free but they have to in the effort to study. Being better educated will enable them to help themselves.
