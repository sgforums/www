            <div class='col-md body'>Why 80%??? Well, my figures are not cast in stone. I think a government website can provide a more accurate figure. Probably 75% +-5%. The rest can afford condominium or private estates.<br>I am sure you've been to Singapore before, so when you get pass the Causeway you will see some highrise, they are the first blocks of HDB flats you encounter. Those are the Woodlands checkpoint are not that new.<br>HDB came about because LKY had to tackle the housing issue quickly. It was an affordable way to give the masses a roof over their heads. As it evolves, the housing provided by HDB are categoriesed by 2 rooms (1 bedroom, 1 hall, the kitchen and toilets are obvious). 3 rooms, 4 rooms, 5 rooms (4 and 5 comes with dining room), Executive (4 bedrooms, hall, dining room, maybe balcony) and lastly Maisonette (as executive but two stories). Beyond this, is HUDC, which is a HDB-developed condominum project.<br>All else for housing are private developments, condos will have tennis courts, swimming pools etc.<br>Here's not to say that people living in HDB flats cannot afford condos, it is just a matter of choice. My HDB unit is cost more than a condo, but with at least twice the floor space of a similarly priced unit.<br><br>Thanks for your clarification on the business situation in Malaysia. Strange that it is different from the views held by my friends and customers.<br><br>I think Badawi is fully aware of the corruption along the highways, also strange that you've not heard about it.<br><br>Let me state clearly that I enjoy visiting JB and KL. It just that between the corrupt cops and the thugs on the road, sometimes it can be a high risk journey.</div>

It should be interesting. I work in a company that has a major part of the assembly line workers coming in from JB  each day. It seems that they are enjoying their job immensely. I also have one colleague who is a high level engineer that commutes from JB each morning. He's always being made fun of because he makes Sing dollars and live in the JB economy.<br><br>The Singapore press (I admit that no press is totally objective) reports on all kinds of abuses Singapore employer makes on their Filipino maids, it would be strange that these newspaper ignores any legitimate claims a Malaysian worker may have about his Singapore employer. One would also imagine that if such abuses are wild spread and genuine, Malaysian workers will be thinking twice about crossing the causeway each day in their motorcycles in rain, sun, dust and jam to work here. One only need to be at the Bukit Timah express each morning and evening to see the number of Malaysian workers working in Singapore.</div>

I did intentionally bribe the cop so I actually paid less than what I would have to pay if I accept the fine.</div>

The government build many HDB flats for those who want them. It so happens that 80% of the population want to live there. The rest live in house, condos, apartments... Mind you, HDB is not like those Malaysian subsidised flats. Many HDB flats are better renovated than condos!! What is important to note is that a very high majority, may be like 75% own the flats we live in.<br><br>Where did you get the news on "how Malaysian workers suffer in Singaporean Company." is that your preassumption or this was published in malaysian papers??
