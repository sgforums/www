            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Burntan<br><br>I am not Malay but I'll contribute my two cents' worth:<br><br>You are mistaken when you say there are no Malay government ministers.<br>In fact there is 1 Malay Cabinet Minister and 12 other Malay Members-of-Parliament (MPs) out of 84 MPs. That means Malay MPs have 15.5% of the seats in a population where they make up 14%.<br><br>If you take Indian/Tamil cabinet ministers and MPs into consideration, they hold 9 seats in parliament (or 10.7%) in a population where they make up 8%.<br><br>My figures are from www.gov.sg<br><br>Overall, ethnic minorities actually have a slightly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">higher</span> representation in parliament.<br><br>I concur with Incredible in his observation: unlike Malaysia where the <span style="font-style: italic;">bumiputra</span> policy is applied (especially in politics and civil service) and the BN coalition government led by UMNO allocates cabinet seats based on race/political party, Singapore allocates them based on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">capability</span>, regardless of race, religion or gender.<br><br>As for them being poorly treated, and having 'no status' (whatever that means), Singaporean Malays are (1)  much wealthier than their Malaysian counterparts statistically, (2) can be found in all occupations, and all management levels, (3) have made great strides in education right up to university. In addition, they (4) also speak English unlike their Malaysian counterparts where more than 90% of Malay graduates have difficulty finding jobs due to their university majors, and their lack of fluency in English (according to The New Straits Times and The Star). My observations are also that Singaporeans of all races integrate socially far better than Malaysians.

And it will take time, education, and a stronger Singaporean identity before this diminishes. Like all countries in the world especially multiracial/multicultural ones, Singapore cannot claim to have eradicted racism or ethnic tension <span style="text-decoration: underline;">completely</span>. This is why the government manages ethnic relations very carefully, and topics on race and religion are handled sensitively.<br><br>With the exception of the race riots in 1969 (a blot on Singapore's national history), we are certainly not plagued by (1) violent acts of racism (burning of Chinese restaurants and destruction of Jewish property in Perth, or white policemen beating up black Americans in the US or targetting of Chinese Indonesians during the Asian financial crisis), (2) racial politics (Pauline Hanson and One Nation in Australia), or (3) racial tension (white cops making formal complaints that non-whites are being promoted because of their race in the UK). These are just a few race stories regularly reported in the international and local media e.g. UK's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Guardian</span> newspaper.<br><br>Are Singaporean or Malaysian Malays in a better position? Well that depends on individual perspective ultimately. Malaysian Malays certainly get more opportunities in universities (even though racial quotas no longer apply) and civil service jobs by virtue of their race....while the Singaporean Malay has to compete with everyone else.<br><br>An interesting story was published in the <span style="font-style: italic;"> The New Paper</span> two/three days ago: a Singaporean Malay family was attacked by nine men with metal rods in their car in Johor without provocation. The bunch of criminals told the Singaporean family in Malay:<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Jangan besar kepala. Ini Malaysia bukannya Singapore (Do not be arrogant. This is Malaysia, not Singapore)."</span><br><br>I guess there is resentment even among Malays of different nationalities in this instance too. (The criminals are now wanted by the Johor police.) I leave you to reach your own conclusions on the matter.<br><br>I hope this helps.

Issues like foreign policy and defence are <strong>not</strong>. Were any other ethnic groups consulted for that matter? Besides, the SAF's involvement was not in direct combat.<br><br>Terrorist issues in the past few years have demonstrated that Singapore is more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pragmatic</span> than anything else. Sensitivity is essential of course, but sometimes, one is left with little choice in <span style="font-style: italic;">realpolitik</span>.<br><br>I am not a supporter of the invasion and occupation by the way.

Granted Singapore Malays do enjoy at least one special concession in terms of education. I believe Malay students pay less than the counterparts from the other races (if I am wrong here, please correct me).<br><br>Other than that, there are no special concessions. No one (except for some really bigotted individuals) treat the other races unfairly.<br><br>To reverse the questions, <strong>do you think Malaysian Chinese are more unfairly treated when compared to Malaysian Malays</strong>? As I understand (again I may be wrong) each retail shop has to employ at least one Malay staff, if this isn't a unfair method to ensure work among those who prefer a more relak lifestyle, I don't know what it is. I have also heard from my Malaysian Chinese customers that in order for them to do business, the need support from the Bumiputras.<br><br>I can tell you for a fact that most Malays in Singapore owning HDB flats has renovation done to the flats that will put a Chinese family to shame. While many Malays have selected a more frugal lifestyle (which to me is wise), they will unabashely spend on a lavish home and smart clothing.<br><br>So good ole Dr M need to explain what "poorly treated" means. If he means that Singapore do not treat our Malays better than the Chinese, than he is right. We treat each other fairly and equally.</div>

Correct me if I am wrong.[/b]</blockquote>As someone had stated in an earlier note, has got to do with some historical event. Could also be at one point, the Malays were seen to be financially needy, therefore the school fee is lower. Why is it not changed? Probably a sensitive issue. May also be a way to remember the fact that Malays are seen to be the original race of Singapura.<br>There will always be those living below the poverty line, not just Malays. Some Malay homes I've been to looked like palaces.</div>
