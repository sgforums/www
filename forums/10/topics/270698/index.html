In the United Kingdom, Temasek has just further increased its biggest holding, in Standard Chartered, to 16.3 per cent from 15.3 per cent.<br>.<br>A few weeks ago, Temasek surprised the world by taking a 2-per-cent stake in Barclays as part of the UK bank's increased bid for ABN Amro. There is also speculation that Temasek might deploy some of its mighty reserves to snap up a significant chunk of the 31-per-cent stake held by Nasdaq in the London Stock Exchange.<br>.<br>"We may or may not be interested," said Mr Israel.<br>.<br>Temasek is also in a delicate situation over its strategic holdings in British banks, with Barclays' shares having fallen Â— about 15.6 per cent, as of Wednesday's price Â— since it tabled its new offer for ABN on July 23.<br>.<br>Mr Israel noted that Temasek has suffered a "paper" loss but said: "All the banks are reflecting uncertainty in the market. Barclays is no exception. We have not changed our view on Barclays."<br>.<br>If Barclays is to have a hope of closing the gap on a rival higher bid from a consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, it will have to pull another rabbit out of its hat. Could that be a further cash infusion from Temasek? If the bank's chief executive John Varley were to suggest it, Mr Israel signalled he would consider it.<br>.<br>Or, if the ABN takeover fails, some believe Temasek could be in a position to suggest a deal between Barclays Â— which wants to ramp up its exposure to the fast-growing Asian economies Â— and smaller rival Standard Chartered, which focuses on Asia, Africa and the Middle East.<br>.<br>Mr Israel, 54, was keen to emphasise both banks are attractive simply as investments. Standard Chartered is a particular favourite of Temasek, because it taps the soaring demand for banking services from Asia's burgeoning middle class.<br>.<br>In Barclays' case, the opportunity lies in the fact that Temasek can provide contacts and act as an adviser in its push into Asia. The Barclays stake also fits with the strategy Temasek outlined in 2002 to grow its holdings in Western companies.<br>.<br>However, Temasek has, in the past, used its holdings to suggest companies get together, and Mr Israel will not rule out such a scenario in the case of Barclays and Standard Chartered.<br>.<br>"We are patient investors, not passive ones," he said. "We think about the optionality around our portfolio."<br>.<br>Mr Israel joined Singapore's investment company in July last year after three decades in Asia, including running America's Sara Lee and France's Danone in the region.<br>.<br>His appointment as executive director was part of a drive by Temasek to become more open to the outside world, as its ambitions to flex its muscles on the international stage also grew.<br>.<br>One of the messages Temasek is trying to convey is that it operates separately from the government. Said Mr Israel: "The idea that Temasek is an instrument of the Singaporean Government could not be further from the truth."<br>.<br>All investment decisions have been made by Temasek's board, Mr Israel maintained. The Government receives a 7 per cent dividend, and gets an annual update on performance Â— and that is it, he said.<br>.<br>One sticking point for outsiders is that Temasek's chief executive Ho Ching is the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br>.<br>Said Mr Israel: "When the outside world looks at it, I can understand why there is an issue of perception." But "those who know Ho Ching well will tell you she's very much her own person".<br>.<br>Having become accustomed to being one of only a handful of government-financed funds that invest in assets, Temasek is now finding the space increasingly crowded -- with China, Indonesia and Japan considering establishing new sovereign funds.<br>.<br>"Temasek is highly differentiated," Mr Israel argued, saying Temasek stands apart because of its separation from politics, its historical performance -- it has delivered 18 per cent annual growth -- and its publication of an annual report, which contains its revenues and profits, and a full list of its holdings.<br>.<br>But Mr Israel also spoke up for the emerging class of sovereign funds against the backdrop of threats by countries such as Germany to block them from investing in strategic sectors like banking and telecoms.<br>.<br>"People say sovereign funds will go from about $2,500 billion today to $12,500 billion by 2015, which sounds plausible. The world is struggling to come to terms with exactly what that is going to mean. I hope they take time to think carefully before leaping and legislating," he said.<br>.<br>Temasek may be facing more competition, but the future looks bright for the tightly-run company. More Western companies want to invest in Asia, and Temasek, with its deep roots in Asia and connections with the region's most powerful companies and families, is in a strong position to help them.<br>.<br>If the debt markets dry up further and leave private equity funds impotent, Temasek and its deep-pocketed rivals should also be able to pounce on more assets around the world.<br>.<br>"I tend to look at life as the glass being half-full," said Mr Israel. "The large capital inflows (from sovereign funds) could be good - who's to say it is going to be bad?" -- The Telegraph</blockquote><img src="http://store.eiu.com/graphics/common/logos/newlogo.gif"><br><br>2.Assume return is 5 %,the yield can cover capital and operational<br>expenditures.I am looking forward ALL Singaporeans will<br>have a<strong> Tax Free Year</strong> when SG reach 50th birthday!!</div>
