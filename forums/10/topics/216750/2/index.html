Cause if i'm really guilty of killing the girl, You kill me in Malaysia I also don't want to come back lo. How would I listen to the father and surrender myself to the police.<br><br>And as a mother, I would never leave my daughter alone in Singapore to go back China. And even if she had urgent matters and had to go, as a mother i<br>would find someone trustworthy like a female friend to take care of her and stay at her house instead letting her wander at the place where i work when i'm not around isn't it?<br><br>It doesn't makes any sense in the mother's doing in any way.</div>
