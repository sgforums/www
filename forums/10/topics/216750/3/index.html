Was it really so much of a fair trade to have her own child brutally murdered and hope to profit from it? (there was no certainty anyway - unless she purchsed insurance)<br><br>It was more likely she milked on the profits since she cannot bring her daughter back to life anymore.

Even if you keep Took alive can he prove that huang na's mother was aslo involved? I bet Took himeself was too blur to see that either. Anyway if we can't hang them all its better than not to hang one first.</div>
