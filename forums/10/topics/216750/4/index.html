You cannot wish them all away.<br></div></blockquote>There will always be people who disagree with the outcome of a trial. The fact is that due process was followed and Took had been given a fair trial. Justice <strong>has been seen to be done</strong>. If justice means everyone in the country must agree with a verdict, there will never be justice. It is precisely because disagreements are expected to occur that the constitution of the Appeal Court is always an odd number of judges, so that there will always be a majority verdict.<br><br><blockquote>You sound very confident and have full faith in the judgement passed, I cannot do so. however due to the lack of visible justice in my eyes that has been carried out. What has happened is a conviction passed down based on circumstantial evidence which is not solely limited to accused's actions. </blockquote>You are entitled to your opinion. Many others hold a different opinion. In fact, some forumners feel that the legal process had been 'too generous' to him, allowing his defence team to suddenly bring in evidence of a psychiatric illness late in the trial.<br><br><blockquote>Forensics show the evidence of physical harm, it does not reveal the motive nor prove beyond reasonable doubt that Took was the sole accused, or whether he was merely present. </blockquote>Not only did the DNA evidence prove Took's presence at the crime scene, <strong>he left his fingerprints on the tape used to tie Huang Na up</strong>. The forensic evidence is overwhelming. Took murdered Huang Na and deserved to hang many times over.<br><br><blockquote>I do not know all the facts admittedly, but if we are to look into the motive of the whole case, the mother is very much suspect in her behavior and I am still of the opinion that Took must not be hanged until Huang Na's mother's innocence is proven openly in a convincing manner. </blockquote>Huang Na's mother is certainly no saint but she did not murder Huang Na. Took Ah Hao did and that's clear as crystal. It will be a travesty of justice to ignore the overwhelming forensic evidence and deny Huang Na the justice she deserves.</div>

Some people here almost have a fetish for China-bashing, no matter what the topic is.

Not only China, but bangalas also get bashed too. The thing is, it is becoming more and more common these days to open ur newspaper, read that a crime has been committed, and more often than not, it is people from a certain country. So, u cannot blame them for being wary. Singapore is an multi-cultural society. We can live with all types of people, but if their culture clashes with ours, or they continue their bad habits here (such as spitting everywhere and anywhere), then some of us here goes to war against them</div>
