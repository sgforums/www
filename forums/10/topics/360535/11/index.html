              <blockquote>
              <p>Liberty for womanhood and enfranchisement from slavery are noble aims that perpetrate humanity and the human race. Your fight has nothing noble and will only doom mankind with your lifestyle choice.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In the past, there r people arguing tat woman right should be controlled and slavery should not be aborted. And some of them uses religious scriptures as justification</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Smoking had been with us for ages. No one knew of its bad effects, but with the advance of science, we realized it this century and had sought to eradicate it. It causes cancer later in one's life and as well as the financial savings for medical cure, not to mention the unnecessary loss of one precious life to societies.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Did homosexual reduce the mortality rate or age of homosexuals ? No. So why link smoking with homosexual ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>So in the event if everyone or half becomes monks/priests - who will work the fields and manage trade? Such an economic order do not exists and have never before in the history of mankind. Simply because even our cavemen ancestors understood such concepts.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U say it is noble because of hindsight. As said there is no harm caused by homosexual. The harm is as bad as priest or monks who chose not to reproduce. There is no time where half of the population become priest or monks but there is not a time where half or more of the population become homosexual either. Extrapolating vividly into the future is really... a BIG IF.</p>
              <p>And strictly speaking, a lot of thai male chose to be monks in their life time. The scenario where a large bulk of people become religious and not reproduce is higher than a society become full of homosexual and not reproduce. Going by your concern, we should ban religion first</p>
              <p>And talking about economy on issues such as religion or homosexual is really... humorous. Don't tell me if a person wanna be a priest or monk, he will not do so because he feel there is too little farmers out there ? Will the church ban people from becoming father if there r little farmers ? Then why bring out such a strange reason ?</p>
              <p>Talking about "work" and how to sustain the economy, frankly speaking religious people often do not face problems of poverty. The catholic church, tibet buddhism, islamic etc often have much more money than the peasants could afford. In fact when people have become very poor in the past, it is common for them to throw the babies at the steps of religious organisation in the hope tat they be taken care by them. And in time of grave poverty, it is not uncommon to see monks become part time farmers after their daily prayers. So your concern about economy is really... flawed..</p>

              <p>Homosexual and Heterosexual proponents need to learn to live with each other in a non conflictual manner.  Sometimes, the minority needs to recognise that as a minority, they cannot push too hard on certain issues that would inflame the majority.  Majorities also have to learn to be gracious to minorities, giving them space to grow and a contribute to the society as a whole.  If Singaporeans can adopt the same gracious and considerate mindset that we have gained from living in disproportionately multi-racial society, we can also adopt that same mindset to live peacefully a Singaporean multi-sexual-orientation society.</p>

              <p>Actually wat u have written so far is not wrong. Nobody here want to replace a heterosexual family unit to become a homosexual one. The pro gays people just want less discrimination, more education and less "religious taking over secular" events.</p>

              <p>To create a conflictual situation with mainstream heterosexual section of society is counter-productive to their goal of "existing alongside." they want to coexist with heterosexual society with acceptance, then they should be working to create cohesion and not division within the society itself?  Does that not sound rational?</p>
              <p>On a side note, it seems that there is a popular belief that its only the Christians that do not see eye to eye with homosexuality.  Many religions in fact do not, eg Islam.  The conservative views towards homosexuality may have religious influence, but religious components are not the sole "opponents" to it.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Firstly, I believe it is the christians tat dealt the first blow. They banned homosexual literally and taking over a secular organisation because they educate neutrally about homosexual. They r working to create division within the society</p>
              <p>Secondly, there r some religions or other segments of society tat do not see eye to eye with homosexual but the one being the most vocal now r christians. If talking about proportion wise on the anti homosexual topics, I guess it appears to be 80% christians, 20% the rest. It is therefore natural people (such as me) r associating to a certain extent anti gays as christians.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr. Tan Ah Kow,</p>
              <p>I understand your predicament and share your feelings on your employment, for these are not the best of times and for many others too in our world, not just Singapore, are suffering similarly as well, working extremely hard, and smart, to get out of the crisis created not of our doing, but by a few international greedy men.</p>
              <p>However, there are bigger issues such as the homosexual agenda set by this group on hand that may have a longer lasting impact on our lives, affecting us even after the crisis had been overcomed, and must be dealt with, with care and careful deliberation.</p>
              <p>It's not about favouring who is the bigger group or the smaller group.<br>It's not about who is the loudest or most vocal or the silent ones.<br>It's not about who threatens who.</p>
              <p>We can remain silent and let the loudest and most vocal set the policy.<br>We can remain silent and be cowled or bullied by militant threats to allow the bullies to set the policy.<br>We can allow the smaller group to set the policy, small only because it is limited by choices made by others, allowing them to set the policy even if it makes no sense for the majority to go down on their knees to please them.</p>
              <p>It is how you and your future generations will be able to live with the consequences of any policy set.</p>
              <p>Some just talk nonsense,  or arguing for the sake of arguing and not worth responding, while some others talk sense.</p>
              <p>Thing is, for any policy to exist, it must be based on the most RATIONAL course of action after deliberation, that can protect not only you, but society that makes up your family, your children, your relatives and friends as well as mine</p>
              <p>You matter, for without you and your resiliant courageous forefathers, regardless if a roadsweeper or the chief cabinet officer, in our equal society, regardless of race, language or religion as in our constitution, there can be no Singapore.</p>
              <p>Alone we are only individuals, but collectively, we represent a nation on Earth, with protection and strengths to help one another progress and prosper, if not for ourselves, at least for our next generations within our precious independant society.</p>
              <p>By the power of your sacred vote and the representation you make to your elected MP representatives, you and others collectively determine the direction of our society and its future. So choose wisely, and rationally.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>it is again a group of religious people tat caused 377A to

              <p>To me it is a sign tat the gov wanted to appease all parties in
              the incident by giving a step in. Previoulsy the program is already
              approved by MOE to be appropriate to be educated</p>
              <p>Wat r u suggesting as "minority religion" ? R u saying

              <p>To your first point, I have to admit I am also not clear behind the history of 377A.  To my understanding, most Singapore laws are actually similar to English laws due to our colonial heritage.  The original law was English, and introduced by the English to India, and then applied to all her colonies.  England was a very "Christian" country, and that you somewhat correct, but unclear.  </p>
              <p>Whether it is a sign or not, it seems that MOE indeed will be tightening control over the message that is to be carried forward by sex education programs. </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/430857/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/430857/1/.html</a></p>
              <p>What the MOE has instituted, are clearer guidelines of mainstream conservative views towards homosexuality, and not otherwise.  I think we really need to understand that, contending views such as homosexuality where a general "middle point" is hard to reach due to the polarity of views and principles are very sensitive and require both parties to act with restraint, tact and grace.  The stronger one side tries to push an agenda, the stronger the other side will resist... At the end, it really benefits no one.</p>
              <p>I was referring to Christianity as a minority religion in Singapore. They thus cannot fully be said to be the only ones who disagree with homosexuality since the majority of Singaporean society also disagree.  I think they just happen to be more vocal. </p>

              <p>I don't quite understand what you mean by they banned
              homosexuality literally.  Their religion has always viewed
              homosexuality to be wrong, hence I'm not sure if they "banned"
              anything. I am not clear to what was in the sex education program,
              but I only know that it has caused MOE to review and introduce
              changes to it.  To me, that does imply that there was some
              level of inappropriacy to how homosexuality was being educated.
               </p>
              <p>Christians around the world have always been a vocal lot in
              politics and raising alarms about contradictions to "moral fiber."
               However, I do feel that to assume a minority religion in
              Singapore to represent the interest of the majority mainstream
              heterosexual society is a little "under-representing" of
              heterosexual interest.  =)</p>

              <p>Honestly, heterosexuals needs little-to-no representation. They have all the rights they need, and are not discriminated against by other straight people or gay people.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, gay people need to speak out to gain their rights. You can't possibly believe that only one group (hetereosexuals/homosexuals) can have all of their rights. Again, homosexuality does not in any way a) make straight people gay or b) negatively affect heterosexuality. Therefore, gay and straight people can realistically coexist happily in the same environment. The only problem are the homophobic straight people who want to stay away from gay people because they think it's a contagious disease.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr. Tan Ah Kow,</p>
              <p>I understand your predicament and share your feelings on your employment, for these are not the best of times and for many others too in our world, not just Singapore, are suffering similarly as well, working extremely hard, and smart, to get out of the crisis created not of our doing, but by a few international greedy men.</p>
              <p>However, there are bigger issues such as the homosexual agenda set by this group on hand that may have a longer lasting impact on our lives, affecting us even after the crisis had been overcomed, and must be dealt with, with care and careful deliberation.</p>
              <p>It's not about favouring who is the bigger group or the smaller group.<br>It's not about who is the loudest or most vocal or the silent ones.<br>It's not about who threatens who.</p>
              <p>We can remain silent and let the loudest and most vocal set the policy.<br>We can remain silent and be cowled or bullied by militant threats to allow the bullies to set the policy.<br>We can allow the smaller group to set the policy, small only because it is limited by choices made by others, allowing them to set the policy even if it makes no sense for the majority to go down on their knees to please them.</p>
              <p>It is how you and your future generations will be able to live with the consequences of any policy set.</p>
              <p>Some just talk nonsense,  or arguing for the sake of arguing and not worth responding, while some others talk sense.</p>
              <p>Thing is, for any policy to exist, it must be based on the most RATIONAL course of action after deliberation, that can protect not only you, but society that makes up your family, your children, your relatives and friends as well as mine</p>
              <p>You matter, for without you and your resiliant courageous forefathers, regardless if a roadsweeper or the chief cabinet officer, in our equal society, regardless of race, language or religion as in our constitution, there can be no Singapore.</p>
              <p>Alone we are only individuals, but collectively, we represent a nation on Earth, with protection and strengths to help one another progress and prosper, if not for ourselves, at least for our next generations within our precious independant society.</p>
              <p>By the power of your sacred vote and the representation you make to your elected MP representatives, you and others collectively determine the direction of our society and its future. So choose wisely, and rationally.</p>
