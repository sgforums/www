              <p>I agree with what part of what you have said, that being anti-discrimination goes both ways. That is why I find it sad that adoption centres with Christian and Catholic patronage in the UK have to close or change names because of the new anti-discriminatory laws. It's not as if gay couples and single parents have other adoption centres to go to there.</p>
              <p>However, it is difficult to support the segment of the anti-alternative lifestyle lobby that only says, "It's disgusting/unnatural/a slippery slope/etc" without reasoned dialogue. Unfortunately, they are the most vocal of the bunch too. It could also be that the tides are changing, just as we now condemn any views that support racism, deny the Holocaust or detest mixed marriages.</p>

              <p><br>What kind of 'reasoned dialogue' are you demanding for? Do you have the scientific or social empirical data that gayism is only a phase, that it hinders not the birth progression of humanity?</p>
              <p>I dont have such data too, but should we just stupidly, despite all that we had been painstakingly taught in diverse academic fields, simply sit back, and watch how it pans out 3 generations later?</p>
              <p>How sure can you be that sexual freedom promulgated by the loud gay minority lobby that it will not lead to beastility? After all, what is  sexual freedom and liberty of love, if it is not absolute and total perogative, priviledge and liberty to indulge in love and sex of any kind, beginning with the unnatural sexual union of similar sex species? </p>
              <p>Again, are rational men, out of fear of being seen as 'suppressive' or 'discriminatory', stand back and watch the perverted destruction of families and civilisation as we know it?</p>
              <p>Be a liberal by all means, but be aware that there is a cost to pay for freedom. You and I may escape paying it, but it may be our next generations or the following ones who will have to pay for our fear to speak out today.</p>

              <p>Have you questioned your definition of 'natural'? Homosexuality occurs to a minority of people, and that is why the human race isn't going to die out. Why are you pushing so hard to protect the conservative definition of family when it is just a construct of history, and certainly not the only model that exists? And freedom to engage in any kind of sexual activity isn't what is being asked for.</p>

              <p>Have you questioned your definition of 'natural'? Homosexuality occurs to a minority of people, and that is why the human race isn't going to die out. Why are you pushing so hard to protect the conservative definition of family when it is just a construct of history, and certainly not the only model that exists? And freedom to engage in any kind of sexual activity isn't what is being asked for.</p>

              <p>Homosexuality may occurs with a minority of people, but like the swine virus, it will spread if not contained, espacially when they become more vocal and demanding in our liberal age. Are we to just stand back and let them grow destroy the family and thus civilisation itself?</p>
