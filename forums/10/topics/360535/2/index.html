              <p>Words from a godless atheist? Someone who reject God, His creations and civilisation attempts? Believes only in himself, a law unto himself?</p>
              <p>Atheist, you are fortunate to live in a secular society such as Singapore, for in our openess, we as a society still believe each must obey laws otherwise we will only tear at each other and destroy our society and civilisation.</p>
              <p>A man of God will be held accountable for his beliefs, to be upraised or demoted if he proves hypocrite, condemn by his own beliefs.</p>
              <p>An atheist believes only himself and makes rules that pleases himself as he goes along and accountable only to himself. Thus we need secular laws as well to keep your kind accountable even when you dont believe or responsible to a higher being.</p>
              <p>But already you had shown contempt for 377a - a simple lined law in our constitution, how more can our society trust you any further?</p>
              <p>Who is the twisted one here?</p>
              <p>Had I condemn any gay except those who were mentioned in the press? Had I deny their right to live? It is only when they attempt to cause friction in our society, testing its boundaries with their promotion of their disgusting lifestyle which our society had already allowed them to do so behind close doors and cause no complaints to be raised, that they must be stopped and reprimanded to respect the law.</p>
              <p>I have no son but our young, regardless if they are our own or others must be protected as any civlised society would lay claim so. Only perhaps an atheist like you would have total disregard for children or adults, for you and your kind are a law unto yourself. </p>
              <p>So save your arguments and defend your lifestyle against society's acceptance of 337a instead, as best as you can which many will ensure you will not win as long as you attempt to corrupt our young and social fabric.</p>

              <p>We live not by ourselves or are an island unto ourselves but

                      There is no imposition if we as a society AGREED to such laws. So
                      keep your moral compass or the lack of it in your own american
                      society.</p>
              <p>Gays know they have limited choice in choosing partners of their
                      like lifestyle and preferences amongst society concious adults.
                      Therefore it is only innocent and naive children - boys for

              <p>I highly doubt gay marriage will be legalize in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Gay couples are minority.</p>
              <p>In our society where majority rules, minority rights will not likely be recognized.</p>
              <p>In actuality.. legalizing or not is not an issue.. rather.. we should not persecute gay couples.</p>
              <p>Like I said.. legalizing it is just a matter of documentation.. it does not change a gay partnership in anyway other than just adding "legal rights".</p>
              <p>Making it illegal doesn't mean people will no longer be gay.</p>
              <p>You can't beat a gay out of a person .. get what I mean?</p>
              <p>While we do not encourage it. because majority are against it. We also should not fan hatred against them.</p>

              <p>Words from a godless atheist? Someone who reject God, His
                                      creations and civilisation attempts? Believes only in himself, a
                                      law unto himself?</p>
              <p>Atheist, you are fortunate to live in a secular society such as
                                      Singapore, for in our openess, we as a society still believe each
                                      must obey laws otherwise we will only tear at each other and
                                      destroy our society and civilisation.</p>
              <p>A man of God will be held accountable for his beliefs, to be
                                      upraised or demoted if he proves hypocrite, condemn by his own
                                      beliefs.</p>
              <p>An atheist believes only himself and makes rules that pleases
                                      himself as he goes along and accountable only to himself. Thus we
                                      need secular laws as well to keep your kind accountable
                                      even when you dont believe or responsible to a higher being.</p>

              <p>U have a problem with people outside your beliefs ? The way u describe it seems u have a strong contempt for them. U r not the center of the world</p>
              <p>As stated many times, which u clearly shown to ignore, 377A is not enforceable, it is not a decison by majority, gays r welcome, they can commit their acts privately without fear in singapore and most of the world do not have such a law. However u just keep ignoring other points and harp on the law which fundamentalist christians play tyrany and force it to exist</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Had I condemn any gay except those who were mentioned in the
                                      press? Had I deny their right to live? It is only when they
                                      attempt to cause friction in our society, testing its boundaries
                                      with their promotion of their disgusting lifestyle which our
                                      society had already allowed them to do so behind close doors and
                                      cause no complaints to be raised, that they must be stopped and
                                      reprimanded to respect the law.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U mean u describe them as anti humanity, degenerative, tansvestite, sick, paedophiles and u r not condemning them ? Wat a joke. The whole issue started because some group of people wanna overtake a secular organisation and change it into some christian belief group. Who r the one propagading their lifestyle ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I have no son but our young, regardless if they are our own or
                                      others must be protected as any civlised society would lay claim
                                      so. Only perhaps an atheist like you would have total disregard for
                                      children or adults, for you and your kind are a law unto
                                      yourself.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat am I promoting ? Tolerance, live and let live, non stereotype, respect for other's choice and life style. Wat r u promoting ? Hate, intolerance, bigotry, religious fundametalism, steroreotype, demeaning words. Is tat how u teach your young ? Who is really poisoning the minds of the people ?</p>
