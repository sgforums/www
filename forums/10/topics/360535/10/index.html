              <p>Sigh...spare me the hints, my dear Kuali. I have no wish to dominate the thread like some others. But for your sake, i had posted one on the other thread. If you want, i can repost it here, but i rather not.</p>
              <p>I am sure i am not the only one that has a voice. Many more out there, except that they may not express it well or as vocal as the gay lobby. Make no mistakes, it is not the most vocal that wins, it is reason and logic, and fortunately, our educated society today has more such people around that needs not fear militancy or radicalism, at the legislative level.</p>

              <p>In response to da-vid :</p>
              <p>I had sought to avoid such topics, but i guess one can't hide from it, more so with so much ignorance being trump up, churning my stomach to the depths!</p>
              <p> You had desecrated and profaned nobles ideals by aligning your filthy lifestyle choice with it. I will attempt forwith to be as gracious as possible, since it is what I would have expect others to do similarly so.</p>
              <p>Liberty for womanhood and enfranchisement from slavery are noble aims that perpetrate humanity and the human race. Your fight has nothing noble and will only doom mankind with your lifestyle choice.</p>
              <p>As with parellalisms, you and many others foolishly chosed nobles ones, which are far from the ideals of which your group set to achieve. Allow me to show you a parallelsim that is more closer to your lifestyle choice.</p>
              <p>Smoking had been with us for ages. No one knew of its bad effects, but with the advance of science, we realized it this century and had sought to eradicate it. It causes cancer later in one's life and as well as the financial savings for medical cure, not to mention the unnecessary loss of one precious life to societies.</p>
              <p>But did we ban smoking? No, we didnt, because many are stuck on this habit. Societies understood the hazards of smoking as well as the difficulty to cure it, thus it needs time to fully eradicate smoking.</p>
              <p>As such, smokers still had the right to smoke, but only in specific areas. And they must not influence others to join them in their LIFESTYLE choice, espacially the young. Is this an infringement to their rights? Should smokers form a lobby and demand they be allowed to smoke as they please, or others to be tolerant of them, or let them influence the young to join their crusade to continue to smoke, knowing full well it is a destructive habit to oneself and society?</p>
              <p>While homosexuality will not cause cancer, it does even worse - destroy the family, societies and civilisation.</p>
              <p>But you homosexuals, have a right to exist as humans, just don't attempt to promote your 'values' to others, and stay away from decent families, the way smokers do.</p>
              <p>Another foolish and absurb concept to support the homosexual way of life as correct is to compare themselves to celibate monks and priests.</p>
              <p>Their understanding of economics is sorely limited, but cannot be blamed for not everyone is educated on that subject. However, simple logic will dictate their theory invalidated because a society can only support x numbers of monks/priests.</p>
              <p>So in the event if everyone or half becomes monks/priests - who will work the fields and manage trade? Such an economic order do not exists and have never before in the history of mankind. Simply because even our cavemen ancestors understood such concepts.</p>
              <p>But can half the world be made up of heterosexuals and homosexuals? Most definately in this liberat day and age, because  sexual conduct do not inhibits work performances. The dammage will only come later, when heterosexuals adults die out, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their children</span>  will end up supporting half the society's population made of old and aged homosexuals.</p>
              <p>Worse if the entire society becomes homosexual. The end cannot be too far away. Think, my fellow human, whom I still respect as a human, before you press your lifestyle choice upon us all and espacially insidiously, to our naive and innocent children .</p>
              <p>Truth ultimately is sacred and pure, beyond all base human emotions such as bigotry. Accept the facts, painful as it may be.</p>

              <p>We do it one bigot at a time. Our failure to convince you is not through flaws in our arguments but your stubborness to address your assumptions and move out of your critical comfort zone. That's why we've long moved on from the discourse and hit out at you instead.</p>
              <p>You cunningly tell us to address someone else with rational arguments because you don't have any of your own. You may not even know what you believe in, or you're attempting to hide it from us.</p>

              <p>I think there's no homogenous Singaporean stance on homosexuality at all.  It will continue to be a subject of discourse since there will be different portions of society that will rightfully have their own opinion on the matter.</p>
              <p>What is important to realise is that, there is no "overnight" change over norms of society.  Norms, practices and views can change but it takes a lot of time.  Attempting to expedite it often result in excessive conflict and in some case, violence.  </p>
              <p>This current generation of mainstream Singapore society is still conservative and do not agree with homosexuality.  Given the "deep rootedness" of heterosexual norms, homosexual norms are not likely to reach the "critical mass" of adoption in the near future.  Attempting to push new norms faster than what society is ready to accept is potentially dangerous and disruptive.  I believe this AWARE saga has highlighted this as well in the form of "death threats" that manifested from this dramatic conflict.</p>
              <p>I believe as of yet, no country/society in the world has adopted homosexuality as a mainstream norm over heterosexuality.  It seems that heterosexuality is here to stay as an age old accepted norm.  </p>
              <p>True, there are countries that are more tolerant if not accepting towards minority homosexuality norms.  These countries are liberal countries that enshrine the individual's right to choose their own lifestyle and speak freely about it; liberal values that create an atmosphere that does not promote conflict between hetero and homosexuals.  </p>
              <p>However, even as liberal as these countries can get, there is only "acceptance" for homosexuals and its norms, they do not promote homosexuality as a mainstream sexual culture.  </p>
              <p>Homosexual and Heterosexual proponents need to learn to live with each other in a non conflictual manner.  Sometimes, the minority needs to recognise that as a minority, they cannot push too hard on certain issues that would inflame the majority.  Majorities also have to learn to be gracious to minorities, giving them space to grow and a contribute to the society as a whole.  If Singaporeans can adopt the same gracious and considerate mindset that we have gained from living in disproportionately multi-racial society, we can also adopt that same mindset to live peacefully a Singaporean multi-sexual-orientation society.</p>

              <p>lol! Kuali, scolding me or whatever is no use. It is not me you
              need to convince, just as i tried stupidly to convince you. We both
              kinda agree to disagree i guess.</p>
              <p>More critical is for you to convince others with rational
              arguments and let it stand on its own merit. Shooting breezes, loud
              vocal activism or condemning me like some of the
              others aint gonna move your cause one bit.</p>
              <p>And heaven forbid if you resort to militancy, which i seriously
              hope you dont or ever be part of. It aint the way.</p>

              <p>Ofcors.. 911 changed a lot of that laid back beliefs in US now.</p>

                  <p>I don't believe the intention was to promote homosexuality to become a mainstream norm since to promote in such of a manner would require some kind of unnatural conversion which many of the homosexuals themselves abhor.  However, even their push to gain acceptance, if pursued with too much fervor can cause mainstream conservative heterosexual sections of society to feel threatened as they see it as an act of "promotion" of homosexuality.  Hence, as a minority view, they need to responsibly exercise restraint in the promotion of the agenda so as not to offend mainstream beliefs, creating divisions and drawing battle lines.</p>
                  <p>Fact is, homosexuals and heterosexuals have existed together in many civilizations for ages.  Today, homosexuals are not "witch-hunted" and Singapore is also slowly liberalizing and opening up towards them.  To create a conflictual situation with mainstream heterosexual section of society is counter-productive to their goal of "existing alongside." If they want to coexist with heterosexual society with acceptance, then they should be working to create cohesion and not division within the society itself?  Does that not sound rational?</p>
                  <p>On a side note, it seems that there is a popular belief that its only the Christians that do not see eye to eye with homosexuality.  Many religions in fact do not, eg Islam.  The conservative views towards homosexuality may have religious influence, but religious components are not the sole "opponents" to it.  </p>
                  <p>We really need to becareful to prevent the debate from taking on a religious nature. Religious "opposition" is only one aspect, and Christianity is only one of the many religions.</p>

              <p>Gay or no gay, we are all humans, not just because there is no toilet mend of gay, we have to look gay on a different perspective, gay also got parents, and all parents do not wish to see their child becoming a gay, but what choice do they have, we have to respect our own human race.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And frankly speaking, to me, i find gays, no matter male or female, are very friendly and helpful, as long as you respect them, they can be a good friend. They tends to go to the extreme to help you and feel very happy when we honored their helps. Together with my gal frens, some are back stabber, some are trying to lure my bf away, some are thrifty who like to use other people things, some are even borrowing money but never return to me. Damn!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course walking with a tomboy or girly guy looks awkward to me, but then, why care so much, a fren should not be bother by their action when the inner self produce that trust. Anyway, i had lot of fun with gay frens, they are a jovial lots and can stand jokes anytime.</p>
