              <p><br>That depends! Do you fantasize about it even when you're not looking at it?</p>
              <p>But personally i think i define homosexuality as only being able to be attracted to someone of the same sex (meaning, capable of loving).</p>
              <p>Having only sex but no emotional attachment doesn't really classify as homosexuality to me. I mean, then every man who has been to prison would have been a homosexual.</p>

              <p>hmm. i think most ppl in sg here don't agree with their

              <p>what i define as condemning gays, would be like rednecks driving
              their truck and taking pot shots at gays with their shotguns just
              to show their hate.</p>
              <p>and also, idiots who wave around banners saying "God hates
              gays", which is totally bullshit.</p>
              <p>i don't see that in singapore. rather, i just see that ppl in
              singapore disagree with their lifestyle, and do not encourage it.
              that's all. nobody's hunting down anyone.</p>

              <p>I agree with what part of what you have said, that being anti-discrimination goes both ways. That is why I find it sad that adoption centres with Christian and Catholic patronage in the UK have to close or change names because of the new anti-discriminatory laws. It's not as if gay couples and single parents have other adoption centres to go to there.</p>
              <p>However, it is difficult to support the segment of the anti-alternative lifestyle lobby that only says, "It's disgusting/unnatural/a slippery slope/etc" without reasoned dialogue. Unfortunately, they are the most vocal of the bunch too. It could also be that the tides are changing, just as we now condemn any views that support racism, deny the Holocaust or detest mixed marriages.</p>
