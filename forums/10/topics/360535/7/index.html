              <p>What had been the bedrock of stability for our civlisation of
              6000 years to grow? If you are unaware, it had been the family, the
              union of a male and female with their progeny to tap, cultivate and
              enhance the meaning of gift of life that had been bestowed upon us
              on this beautiful planet, either by a higher being of the religious
              minded or products of the big bang theory suscribed by
              evolutionists.</p>
              <p>It had lead to the evolution of our species, the masters of
              Earth, and more critically the continuity of mankind, despite its
              flaws but had come with joys you and I can experience today.</p>
              <p>Therefore, what is the defination of natural? It can only be
              that which had kept mankind and civilisation alive, although higher
              intellectuals will still argue with more definations. To simple
              people like you and me, it can only mean traditions that had kept
              us forward in life instead of regression.</p>
              <p>Homosexuality may occurs with a minority of people, but like the
              swine virus, it will spread if not contained, espacially when they
              become more vocal and demanding in our liberal age. Are we to just
              stand back and let them grow destroy the family and thus
              civilisation itself?</p>
              <p>Be a homosexual by all means, they too are humans,
              with a right to live, but they must not be encouraged nor
              supported, no matter how liberal we may become, or we will be
              the ones staring at our eventual demise as a
              civilisation.</p>

              <p>If you're not even queer in the first place, you won't "catch" homosexuality like some disease, get it? Other models of the family have existed (and did not die natural deaths), and you would be mistaken to think that the model which involves monogamous heterosexual parents is that old.</p>
              <p>Going by your token, physical disabilities and genetic mutations, although naturally-occuring, are not normal and have a more realistic chance of killing of the human species. Therefore, the deaf, blind and dyslexic should be denied the right to marry too. Heck, why not extend it to Huntington's patients and even people predisposed to cancer. Singapore already forbids people with Down's Syndrome from having children, so what's stopping us?</p>
              <p>No, wait. I'm sorry, why should the human race even continue to multiply when it is already using up food and energy resources at an unsustainable rate and causing irreversible damage to the natural environment? It has outlasted its usefulness, if it ever was useful in the first place, because it promoted its own advancement at the expense of nature.</p>

              <p>There are no other models of family, in the past or present. No matter how one tries, there is no way to reproduce another human other than the natural way through reproduction cycles, with the love, care and concern that a mother and a father can provide, even with adoption or kibbutz centres.</p>
              <p>Current attempts may change it, such as invitro fertilisation and even cloning, but still at its infancy and subjected to much societal ethical debate.</p>
              <p>Physical disabilities are as natural as the sun in the sky. It occurs in every generation throughout the course of human history. There is nothing unnatural about human defects, and it will be our advancements in science that we can bring about solutions to rectify them, so that the blind may see, the deaf may hear, etc.</p>
              <p>It is only lifestyle choices, which are man-made that conflicts with our evolution, traditions and progress that is unnatural.</p>
              <p>How much are we aware that defects are hereditary? Geneticism is still in its infancy and for someone to qoute that genes influenced our behaviour is unscientific. At best they are still theoratical and not fully subscribed proofs of scientific evidence.</p>
              <p>Had we used up ALL our resources? Had the fields gone fallow, the water sources dried up, mankind squeezing shoulder to shoulder?</p>
              <p>What are resources if it is not meant to be used for us mankind? Is the tree more important than the life of a child?</p>

              <p> It is the silent readers that you must convince if you want them to consider your points intelligently or take to your side, but what you had offered bears little recognition of such, and would only insult the more rationally discerning.</p>
