              <p>Sorry to disappoint your presumptous and inane theory about me,
              jojobeach. No, I had not been abused by gays before or at any other
              time.</p>
              <p><br> I have nothing against humans who turned homosexual, so long as
              they KEEP TO THEMSELVES AND NOT PROMOTE THEIR LIFESTYLES OR FORCE
              THEIR VALUES ON US. But like all men of science, I believe that one
              should challenge the status quo of any vital theory, to source
              every viewpoint from both sides so as to be able to make an
              informed decision. More so with decisions that affect our
              society.</p>
              <p><br> Thank you luce for your confidence in me, but personally, if that
              is a discrimination, then i believe more time should be given to
              consider it from all angles and more importantly, how it would
              affect our society as a whole, not just the few gays who insist on
              getting married. Once laws are made, revision will be difficult if
              not impossible, when errors and misjudgement surfaced. Lives may be
              lost in the meanwhile</p>
              <p><br> Who I am or what I think personally is of no consequence, for alone
              I am insignificant. But more critical is what our society thinks
              and operates upon. In order to make a wise choice, it is only fair
              that they be given enough data to do so, without fear or favour,
              given coldly, clinically without the baggages of personal
              distaste for individual debater and
              with  rationally or at least full honest personal
              beliefs, no matter which side one is on.</p>
              <p><br> It may be too much to hope for, but we have to start somewhere,
              beginning with you and me, if we indeed do have care and concern
              for our society, thus the attempt with Kuali to see her side of
              view and hopefully more rationalities from both sides.</p>
              <p><br> Will our society one day encourage homosexuality the way we
              encourage heterosexual unions, but like the perceptive TS had
              spoken, it may happen or it may not. But regardless its whichever
              eventuality, such decisions must be made upon a wise and majority
              based platform that only a society can make, of which i, an
              individual, am subject to respect just as everyone else.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Dear dear stop saying you are insignificant and ergo, your views must be too. Granted you are one individual but society is made up of individuals is it not? Our society currently operates from a black box thinking that gays = social evil = breakdown of family unit = bad for Singapore. We tackling the fundamental assumption of the family unit. This monogamous heterosexual family unit may seem normal now, but it appears normal in sofar as it has been the standard as long as human memory can remember. Let's not deny that there have been a myriad of other family forms as others have mentioned here, the kibbutz, the onyi kty (spelling?) in Russia, and of course polygamous family units in some countries. What we see as normal is only because we have been conditioned to view it as thus. </p>
              <p>I mean, it was only less than 50 years ago when Jim Crow laws were still in place and less than 100 years ago when women were denied the right to vote, education, owning property etc. If they had not "imposed their values" upon their society then, would change have come about? So what's all this about gradualism? I say, justice delayed is justice denied. Women having education certainly was not normal back in 1900 but today it sure is and for good reason. Societal expectations of normality have changed and will changed.</p>
              <p>Parallelisms aside, regarding gay marriage -  I forsee the argument that allowing gays a civil union or marriage would be tantamount to condoning it. And ah, our young impressionable green minds of our next generation would be taught to see that gay marriage is normal. Well, learning to be tolerant and to embrace others? Heaven forbid! More children will be encouraged to be gay. Well, I care not whether homosexuality is a lifestyle choice or whether one is born with it - I don't even believe that gayness is a discrete category one finds himself or herself in. Homosexuality is a spectrum upon which we all lie and exhibit varying degrees of. Our society draws the line between heterosexuality and homosexuality at whether man has sex with other men or women. But as someone rightly mentioned, even heterosexuals resort to sodomy under desperate conditions. So what really is homosexuality and heterosexuality? They are fluid identies, subject to flux.</p>
              <p>There really is no right way out of this pickle. Just maybe live and let live and try to embrace diversity. Is it really so hard?</p>
              <p>Yes I know I know, the family unit argument again.........</p>

              <p>Dear dear stop saying you are insignificant and ergo, your views must be too. Granted you are one individual but society is made up of individuals is it not? Our society currently operates from a black box thinking that gays = social evil = breakdown of family unit = bad for Singapore. We tackling the fundamental assumption of the family unit. This monogamous heterosexual family unit may seem normal now, but it appears normal in sofar as it has been the standard as long as human memory can remember. Let's not deny that there have been a myriad of other family forms as others have mentioned here, the kibbutz, the onyi kty (spelling?) in Russia, and of course polygamous family units in some countries. What we see as normal is only because we have been conditioned to view it as thus. </p>
              <p>I mean, it was only less than 50 years ago when Jim Crow laws were still in place and less than 100 years ago when women were denied the right to vote, education, owning property etc. If they had not "imposed their values" upon their society then, would change have come about? So what's all this about gradualism? I say, justice delayed is justice denied. Women having education certainly was not normal back in 1900 but today it sure is and for good reason. Societal expectations of normality have changed and will changed.</p>
              <p>Parallelisms aside, regarding gay marriage -  I forsee the argument that allowing gays a civil union or marriage would be tantamount to condoning it. And ah, our young impressionable green minds of our next generation would be taught to see that gay marriage is normal. Well, learning to be tolerant and to embrace others? Heaven forbid! More children will be encouraged to be gay. Well, I care not whether homosexuality is a lifestyle choice or whether one is born with it - I don't even believe that gayness is a discrete category one finds himself or herself in. Homosexuality is a spectrum upon which we all lie and exhibit varying degrees of. Our society draws the line between heterosexuality and homosexuality at whether man has sex with other men or women. But as someone rightly mentioned, even heterosexuals resort to sodomy under desperate conditions. So what really is homosexuality and heterosexuality? They are fluid identies, subject to flux.</p>
              <p>There really is no right way out of this pickle. Just maybe live and let live and try to embrace diversity. Is it really so hard?</p>
              <p>Yes I know I know, the family unit argument again.........</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thank you for your valid views which may help more to
              comprehend.</p>
              <p>1. As mentioned already to boring lengths, I am insignificant
              and so is what is offensive to my eyes. It is what is offensive to
              society that is critical. And you must readily admit Singapore is
              still a conservative society and are not ready to accept
              homosexuality.</p>
              <p>The day may come that it will change, or it may not, but till
              then, to perform homosexual acts and actions in public is
              definately forcing our society - you, me, our families and friends
              to accept such values we may not be ready or prepared accept -
              without a more comprehensive and rational perception given by the
              pro-gay groups instead of mere and militant death threats.</p>
              <p>2. How should they promote their lifestyle then? I trust
              and have faith in human ingenuity. If they could somehow prove
              without force that they are of no immediate threat to society
              and civilisation, then perceptions may change.</p>
              <p>It may be an uphill battle, but if that is what it takes in
              their love and belief for such lifestyle, then it is a effort
              worth engaging in to them.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">However, on the flip
              side, perhaps homosexuality is only a pyschological disorder and
              can be rectified thru counselling and help we as a society can
              offer?</span></p>
              <p>3. We adults are already set in our ways thus it will be
              difficult to impose their homosexual values to us. It is OUR
              YOUNG  that the penetrations ( pardon the pun) will be made,
              for our young are still naive and innocent. </p>
              <p>How much time can we afford to overlook the affairs of our young
              while we are busy daily working to ensure we bring home the bacon?
              It's an excuse, but still the fact exists.</p>
              <p>Are we to allow our young be subjected to such family
              destructive lifestyle? Are we responsible when the child spends at
              least 8 hrs in academic subjects and projects a day away from
              home, taught by flawed human teachers just as we are equally
              flawed humans? Or question the friends that they spent a
              significant portion of time they have to provide counter-
              counselling?</p>
              <p>I know not the answer to my own points raised, but then it is my
              hope that whatever society has decided upon, it should be respected
              by all from both sides to maintain the status quo. Life already is
              as difficult as it is without the added threats from rising
              homosexual impositions and militancy. It must and need not be the
              way to go for a lifestyle to be included.</p>
              <p>With this, I would like to make an exit, for I had express my
              views far more than I wish and know that it bores many. But I hope
              more may come out and share their honest views from both
              sides, without the ridicule heaped upon messengers/debaters.</p>

              <p>Change and acceptance doesn't happen spontaneously. One day,
              totally out of the blue, people aren't going to decide that they
              want to accept gay people.</p>
              <p>Change happens through rallies, protests, campaigns, etc.
              Discrimination against Black people in the United States only
              lessened after many (sometimes bloody) protests and demonstrations
              in the streets. Not that I want any violence, but my point is that
              change doesn't happen spontaneously, and you can't just depend on
              the next person to make it happen. Sometimes enlightening just one
              ignorant, homophobic fool helps.</p>

              <p>Sigh...spare me the hints, my dear Kuali. I have no wish to dominate the thread like some others. But for your sake, i had posted one on the other thread. If you want, i can repost it here, but i rather not.</p>
              <p>I am sure i am not the only one that has a voice. Many more out there, except that they may not express it well or as vocal as the gay lobby. Make no mistakes, it is not the most vocal that wins, it is reason and logic, and fortunately, our educated society today has more such people around that needs not fear militancy or radicalism, at the legislative level.</p>
