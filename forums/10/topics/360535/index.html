              <p>govt say we are heterosexual society,</p>
              <p>gay lobby says its ok to be lesbian, bisexual, gay and transexual,</p>
              <p>they have a peaceful lobby at hong lim park with perfomance from malay cultural group</p>
              <p>parents says we should not influenced teenagers mind with messages that will bias them towards choosing alternative sexual preferences</p>
              <p>some citizens say we are still conservative society....</p>

              <p>Personally.... I am okay with gays and lesbian people and they coming out at hong lim park... this kind of acitivites will surely increased singapore alternative sexual preferences ... but i am okay with that....</p>

              <p>it will also lead to some problems like lower birth rates but we will solve it not by tackling gays and lesbian activities...</p>

              <p>is sexual preferences now a personal choice.... because the truth is that  man does have the tendency to choose his preferences at times... that means to say sometimes he may be tempted to like guys</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>or is it also a choice that involve considering your parents feelings, the society views and govt stance.. and your religion stances...</p>

Dun alway think mei mei gong gong, try to think out of the box hor. U think govt really like chow ah gua ar??? no choice, they need the votes</p>

              <p>No need for confusion. Gays have the right to live so long as they don't promote their filthy lifestyle. They can keep their disgusting activities behind close doors.</p>
              <p>Be glad 377A is not repealed. Gay sex is banned. Otherwise, what next ?  - screwing horses, pigs, ducks? Marry animals as well? Afterall, 'love whatever the sexual orientation' as promoted by the gays is correct as they presumed, lilberal and secular.</p>

              <p>can you imagine if gay lifestyle becomes a norm, and hetrosexuals becomes a minority? And that marriage must be guy-guy, or gal-gal? Will those we are hetro have the courage to form a group and voice out our rights?</p>
              <p>Well, hetro lifestyle and that marriage is guy-gal is norm and nature. That should not be changed. But we must be careful that gays are slowly penetrating (not sexually!!!) the society... we must stand up for nature, and need to voice out to prevent further deterioration of social fabric.</p>

              <p>Yeah right, 'sexual preference'. Horses, dogs, cats, pigs, ducks, etc have sexual organs as well. So its ok to you to have 'sexual preference' with them as well?</p>
              <p>Please don't besmirch the good name of love. Gay love is not about love. It's  all about your contemptible 'sexual preference' and effete practices with your perverted lovers!</p>
              <p>Go on and screw whatever you can lay your hands on behind closed doors, BUT STAY AWAY FROM DECENT FAMILIES AND YOUNG BOYS!!!!</p>

              <p>Ya right... god's love make gays homosexual as well as the thousands of species of animals and then make christians hate them.</p>
              <p>Nobody is fighting for animal sex here... why bring them into the picture ? Why not bring religious extremism into the picture as well ? If we do nto ban religion then wat is next ? Religious self bombers. Bringing is animal sex into homosexual discussion is as bad as bringing religious extremism into a religious discussion</p>
