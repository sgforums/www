            <div class='col-md body'>If the police says it wants to give you a warning, you can choose to<br><br>1) Accept the warning OR<br>2) Dispute the warning (which means, claim trial in court)<br><br>If you accept the warning, it means you have admitted to the offence and yes, you will have a record with the CID. However, this is not a so-called 'criminal record' in the true sense of the word, as you have not been convicted in a court of law.<br><br>This issue came out a few months back in the papers when someone got rejected when applying for a job because of this record of warning. He disputed it, saying he never committed the offence and that he had accepted the police warning out of convenience. The papers then interviewed a few lawyers who gave the advice that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one should never accept a police warning if he has never committed the offence as accused</span>.<br><br>Perhaps you can seek the help from forumnites working in the police force?<br>They might be in a better position to clarify your doubts.<br><a href="http://policeforce.sgforums.com" rel="nofollow">http://policeforce.sgforums.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I too think that what I did was grave and probably did not deserve just a warning but the fact is, 2 out of 10 that were involved was let off with just a warning.<br>It is probably because the 2 weren't as "active" as the others during the robbery and both of us were involved in only one case while all the others were involved in one or two other seperate case.<br>Furthermore, the victim wasn't some old lady or housewife, it was a "gangster". I know it dosen't matter much as a robbery is still robbery but I feel that if the victim was an old lady, I will most probably end up in RTC.<br><br>And please do not label me as some "criminal", please trust our Police Force, if they think I deserve a warning then so be it. In other words, DON'T SABO ME. Give me a chance la.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether or not, you admit/reveal your police records to a prospective employer depends on the nature of work you are applying for. Sometimes employers do run a check on applicant's background for criminal convictions. But how these companies or employers will react, is entirely up to them - then again, it depends on the serverity of your criminal charge.<br><br>Yes it is true that criminal records will be erased after some years only for those who have been charged and have either 1) been fined a minimum of $2000, 2) have served prison term of 1-2 years, or both.<br><br>However, a Criminal Record doesn't just mean that if you have been charged in the Court of Law. If a WARNING have been served to you, for certain crime/s committed in which it is viewed as SERIOUS, it is still regarded a Criminal Record even though no custodial sentence was passed unto you because of the very CRIMINALITY of the acts participated in.<br><br>But technically, you WILL BE worst off if you were charged and have served time in jail. That means the Police and the Judicial System had sufficient evidence/s to convict you without doubts.<br><br></div>
