              <p><strong>One year has passed. A word of thanks.</strong></p>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>This blog Singapore Dissident has been in
                  existence for more than a year. During this time, its readership has
                  increased exponentially. You will recall that Dr. Vivian <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Balakrishnan</span>, when asked what he thought about blogs had <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">dismissed</span> them as ineffective. I still remember his exact words. Blogs he said
                  "had a readership of one! The author". An arrogant man and an arrogant
                  statement. Just as his other PAP arrogance.<br><br>Well, Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Balakrishnan</span>,
                  you could not have been further from the truth. This blog has up till
                  now, over 5,000 hits only on my profile in just one year. In other
                  words, people who read the blog for the first time, may look at the
                  profile. At this rate, the regular readers who do not have the need to
                  look at the profile may be perhaps 50,000. I have no means to know the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">exact</span> number since only profile views are published. This figure is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">indeed</span> encouraging. Singapore Dissident is indeed widely and regularly read. Thank you.<br><br>And when I began this blog, I told myself that I cannot be incognito, under a disguise. If a man wishes to say <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">something</span>, he should have the courage to show his face. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">What</span> sort of a man is that if he makes <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">speeches</span> hiding his face in a mask!<br><br>So it is as you see. I am <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair. My face, my address and contact is fully disclosed. And I will say what is in my mind. It gives me great <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">pleasure</span> and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">satisfaction</span> to do it this way.<br><br>There are thousands of other <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">bloggers</span> who share my views about <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>. Like me, they are disgusted at this dictatorial regime of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>.
                  They consider him, like me, no better than a thief who steals $3.7
                  million each year for each person. They are angry at the lack of human
                  rights. At the persecution of political dissenters. So like me, they
                  write, but with one difference. Out of fear, they prefer to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">remain</span> in disguise. They use names such as <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Robin</span> Hood or <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Botakbotak</span> for their blogs. It is sad to see this. I am sure deep in their hearts,
                  they deeply wish if only they could identify themselves. But alas, they
                  are in a grip of fear. Since I am not a doctor or psychiatrist, I
                  cannot say this with certainty, but personally I think this all
                  consuming pent up fear is not only bad for them mentally but <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">also</span> physically.<br><br>I think this blog, like others who try to expose the tomfoolery of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew is doing a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">tremendous</span> amount of good for <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>. For one thing, they tend to educate <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporeans</span> when the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">government</span> tries to keep them in ignorance. I have been writing a lot about the
                  fundamental human rights that people have, but which is denied to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporeans</span>. I have been writing <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">about</span> the need for a free press. The right to free <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">speech</span> and expression. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Telling</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">people</span> that the first thing needed for your advance<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-error">ment</span> is your liberty. Without it, you have no future.<br><br>It is true that I am now an American Citizen. But that does not prevent me from writing about <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>. I was born there. My birthright remains. No one can stop me from writing.<br><br>Secondly
                  simply because I write from California does not mean I am entirely
                  safe. As you know the Russian recently who had criticized <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-error">Yeltzin</span> from London had been murdered in London by poisoning. In 1979, while I
                  was in London, the Bulgarian correspondent at the BBC English language
                  section was <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">murdered</span> while crossing London Bridge by someone who stuck an umbrella into him, tipped with poison. Well Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_34" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew may one day decide enough is enough and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_35" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">finish</span> me off in California. Furthermore, I come to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_36" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> almost twice a year travelling on an American passport. They could stop me in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_37" class="blsp-spelling-error">Changi</span>, arrest me and do whatever they want. These are dangers that I face by criticizing Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_38" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew. But none of this scares me. There is a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_39" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">saying</span> in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_40" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gurkhali</span> which goes like this "A brave man dies only once. A coward dies many times over".<br><br>I believe my blog is doing a tremendous <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_41" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">amount</span> of good. For one thing, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_42" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">educated</span> who have been reading my blog has resulted in increased rates of
                  emigration among them, particularly to Australia. They can see that <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_43" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> is nothing more than a tiny island with a dictator and his son <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_44" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">strutting</span> around as if they own the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_45" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">place</span>.
                  This is not the first world country they want to live in, so they
                  leave. My blog helps them in their decision to leave. My blog has been
                  instrumental for the increase in brain drain. This is hurting the Lee
                  Regime. There is not enough people to run the place.<br><br>My readership of my blog has increased in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_46" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">monumental</span> numbers thereby spreading the message that the Lee Administration is bad for <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_47" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>.
                  The government is aware of the danger of such mass dissemination of
                  critical information. As you know in the past, as soon as any person
                  wrote anything critical, the government pounced on them with full force
                  with defamation action, criminal charges, the works. The reason is
                  quite obvious. Just one piece of critical writing against the
                  government can result in serious damage to the government, as news
                  tends to spread like wild fire. But now <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_48" class="blsp-spelling-error">the</span> tables have turned. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_49" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew has not sued me. He cannot because he knows he will lose. The truth is on my side, not his.<br><br>Blogging is indeed a very <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_50" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">powerful</span> tool. I am <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_51" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">glad</span> I have been able to use it.<br><br>So this is my message to all. If you are not yet a blogger, become one. Keep writing so that your message <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_52" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">spreads</span> long and wide. The more it spreads, the more Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_53" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew is in trouble. And if possible, identify yourselves. Tell them who
                  you are and where you are. This will send an even stronger message to
                  these tyrants by showing you are not afraid.<br><br>If you are within <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_54" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> and afraid to show your face, it is understandable. But there are <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_55" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">thousands</span> of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_56" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporeans</span> in Australia New Zealand UK and all over the world who left <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_57" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> for the very reasons why I left. Their positions are no different than mine. They too can show this <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_58" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">dictatorship</span> a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_59" class="blsp-spelling-error">piece of</span> their mind. They are better able like myself to blog with their identities public. Yes they may be killed by a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_60" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> hit man but as far as I know, Francis <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_61" class="blsp-spelling-error">Seow</span> is still alive and kicking. So is Tang <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_62" class="blsp-spelling-error">Liang</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_63" class="blsp-spelling-error">Hong</span>.<br><br>So if you are not yet a blogger, join the family. And tell this Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_64" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew that he may be able to silence his citizens within that island, but he cannot silence everyone.<br><br>Such blogging causes massive emigration from <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_65" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>, warns foreigners about the true <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_66" class="blsp-spelling-error">political</span> state of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_67" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> thus preventing good <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_68" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">immigrants</span> making <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_69" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> their home, adversely affects <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_70" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore's</span> international trade by <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_71" class="blsp-spelling-error">revealing</span> the lack of rule of law in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_72" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>, makes <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_73" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporeans</span> willing to publicly protest and demonstrate against this regime, discourages many European companies from investing in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_74" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> because of the lack of human rights. Blogs such as this reveals to
                  foreigners in Singapore the truth about Singapore which they take back
                  with them to their countries where the reputation of Singapore is
                  ruined at their places.<br><br>Blogging is hurting the Lee Administration.</p>
              <p>Please join me in hurting them further.</p>
              <p>Become a blogger.</p>
              <p>A public one at that.</p>
