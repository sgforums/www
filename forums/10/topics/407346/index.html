We are always the first on the retrenchment list. Is this good in the long run?<br><br>I will like to suggest that we impose a significant increase in PR, FW, FT levies. i.e. Instead of allowing companies in employing anyone they like, Singapore must impose additional levies on the above mentioned groups.<br><br>As there are approximately 1 million to 1.43 millions PRs in Singapore, if we increase the levies of each PR, FT by minimum 1K for each PR employed, companies will have to think twice before employing FT as the cost to employ them would be significantly higher.<br><br>However, such increase in levies which increase the government's coffer cannot be used to justify for Ministers' pay raise. Instead, this levies must be used to create jobs for the locally born Singaporeans.<br><br>At present, I see lots of unemployed and underemployed Singaporeans. We need to bring food for the family.<br><br>If we do not help the local community, all the locally born Singaporeans will be in trouble.

See:<br><br><em><a style="color: #8b7f65; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt</a></em><br><br>Looking at the list, its not surprising that countries like Greece, Italy are in the list. Countries that have been in the wrong limelight of the EU Financial Crisis.<br><br>Number one on the list is Japan - and the economic problems of its economy has been ongoing since the great bubble burst of 1990. (The lost decade or should we say decades is a very well known espression to describe Japan's economic problems).<br><br>So the big question here is WHY our country (the so called great Singapore model) has accumulated such huge public debt? Where is the money for this public debt going to?<br><br>One of the biggest reasons that countries like Greece, Italy, Japan have huge public debt is their state welfare system (life time pensions, minimum wage laws, unemployment benefits to name a few).<br><br>The Singapore Government has always prided itself on being a non-welfare state and always hit out at any critics of our system.<br><br>Well obviously the citizens of Singapore do not enjoy life time pensions, minimum wages nor unemployment benefits.<br><br>So the important question is WHERE is money that we have "borrowed" going to (based on est 2009 numbers - almost US$250 Bn)? Certainly not in the average singaporean's pocket!<br><br>Thankfully, there are concerned singaporeans like myself debating this as you can see here:<br><br><em><a style="color: #8b7f65; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?t=352067&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=50">http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?t=352067&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=50</a></em><br><br>With elections coming up, I sincerely hope that the SDP can raise up this issue and make our government more accoutable.<br><br>Thank and best regards,<br>KT</p>

I am a retrentched civil servant who have given decades of loyal service but nnow having difficulty in finding a job. Many of my fellow retrenched civil servants are disllusioned and want to help bring about changes in our political consitions.<br><br>On the other hand, the PAP leaders have been increasing political posts like many mayors, MM, SM and NCMPs, hosting YOG and other conferences at public expenses. The hosting of YOG was in response to China deliberately leaving Singapore out of the 2008 Olympics Torch Relay.<br><br>I urged you to pose questions (see below) to the PAP government over party rallies at the coming elections. By posing questions which come from our local citizens, you can avoid libel suits which the PAP likes to bring against the opposition political parties in Singapore. This will open the eyes of our citizens that the PAP leaders are hypocrites and only care about feathering their own nests.<br><br>The questions are as follows:<br><br>1. How many civil servants and employees in Statutory Boards have been retrentched over the past 5 years?<br><br>2. How many political posts has the PAP government created for its political leaders and party members?<br><br>3. How many foreigners and PRs are being employed in the civil service and Statutory Board in preference over Singapore citizens?<br><br>4. Why is the government spending millions of taxpayers' money on the YOG when majority of Singaporeans are not interested and the government has to boost interests among local citizens?<br><br>5. Does the Singapore government feel a sense of responsibility in the Thailand unrest since it was Mdm Ho Ching of Temasek Holding and the PM's wife who bought over Shin Corp from Thaksin in 2006 which triggered the military intervention and bloody protests in Thailand.<br><br>6. This question from a Singapore citizen who have dealings in property market is that "Did the DPM Wong Kan Seng or members of his family put on sale a property worth S$9milion in recent years?<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>WEE C.H.<br></blockquote>

Consider these facts (I will start alphabetically):<br><br>1. <strong>China:</strong> Singapore has spent billions in assisting China in the Suzhou industrial park and training Chinese public officials in Singapore. But China repays us by pointedly leaving Singapore out of the 2008 Beijing Olympics Torch Relay. A stingling slap that resulted in the PM, Ministers and officials (Vivian, Teo Ser Luck, Ng Ser Miang) rushing to save face by hosting the YOG 2010 which cost tax-payers minillions of dollars. Now efforts are needed to generate buzz to galvanise excitment among the people for YOG. By the way, Singapore with its extremely humid and hot weather, will need to brace itself for brickbats from athletes from temperate countries who can't take the heat in August. Did our PM, Ministers and officials consider this before rushing to host the YOG?<br><br>2. <strong>Indonesia:</strong> When the Tsunami struck Aceh, Singapore took the opportunity to curry favour with Indonesia by rendering assistance, etc. Indonesia repays us by banning export of ssand to Singapore thus hampering Singapore construction activities. Another slap in the face! What has MFA got to say about this?<br><br>3. <strong>Romania:</strong> It appears that even Eastern European nations like Romanis holds Singapore government in low regards. To date, the Romanian government has yet to repatriate the diplomat who killed a Singapore PR and injured two Singapore citizens in a car crash. Is the governemtn hoping that this whole matter be blown away and forgotten? MFA has still not informed the nation what steps have taken to prevent repeat of such tragic incident.<br><br>4. <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>: Recently, a Saudidiplomat beat up a Singapore citizen after he told the diplomat that he has parked his car at a lot meant for the handicapped. this shows how little respect foreign diplomats have for Singaporrre  laws. I am sure this case will be quietly squashed as Saudi Arabia is an oil rich nation which Singapore can ill-afford to offend. Everything will  be swept under the carpet.<br><br>Finally, my wife and I are wondering whether we have made the right decision in taking up Singapore citizenship, as we are embarrassed by the callous attitude towards this nation by other countries.<br><br>LIM</blockquote>
