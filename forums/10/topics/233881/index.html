            <div class='col-md body'>yeah there's no doubt there is a department for that. if you go sites that these "agents" are not around, the atmosphere is totally different.<br><br>actually its not too difficult to spot agents. They lack originality and passion in what they argue, so they tend to repeat arguments. If you hear  standard propaganda message that seem to be repeated too often its likely to be agent.<br><br>They have no passion, no originality and are merely working on a job, hence their arguments tends to be the same.</div>

They only sit in their ivory towers and make decisions that benefit the rich and mighty.<br><br>Why was Singapore unable to develop a 2 party political system which is beneficial to the citizens of Singapore? It's because of the dominant party suppressing the opposition; who in the right mind would want to dabble with politics in Singapore, you risk being sued till you're bankrupt. But times have changed, as more professionals find it hard to eke out a living in Singapore, more are turning to politics to change Singapore; as shown from the recent election.<br><br>In economics, a monopolistic system is no good for the economy, because a monopoly will always charge more for it's goods by virture of dominant power. Likewise in politics, so a two party system or no party system will be better suited for all the citizens in Singapore.<br><br></div>
