Once converted, they would be able to immigrate to Israel based on the Law of Return.<br><br>About 800 members of the 'Bnei Menashe' have been brought to Israel from northeast India over the last decade by a group called Amishav, Hebrew for "my people returns."<br><br>According to Amishav, there is ample evidence to show that the Bnei Menashe are of Jewish descent. Their customs, including mourning rites, hygiene and the use of a lunar calendar, closely mirror Jewish traditions. \<br>\\<br><br>http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1112414514231</div>

A place of chaos ! </div></blockquote>I think they would probably want to go back to a country where everybody is same race, practice the same religion and not be ashamed to do it.<br><br>There was a covert operation years back when the israeli military airlifted thousands upon thousands of "lost tribe" jews out of africa who were on the brink of starvation in a civil war, many took up the offer until the world press got wind of it and blew the cover on the operation.<br><br>The fact is even if this tribe didn't know they were originally jews and a "lost tribe", their religion and customs so vastly different already set them apart from the locals &amp; that would already make them an outsider, a target to vent anger upon, despised and treated differently if not harshly.<br><br>The same is true with chinese or malay, indian or any other race.<br><br>If I was an chinese living in a country other than singapore where majority is a race different from mine, naturally I won't get much rights or maybe also frequently get bullied by locals or extorted by authorities or treated as second class even though I was born in that country or maybe the country won't even tolerate my chinese name and make me change it, or brutally supress the way I practice my customs or religion... these are the kind of things that very often minority races have no choice but to endure and jews are well known for being persecuted and chased from place to place like this all over the world.<br><br>Do you think this lost tribe in myanmmar will not "jump for joy" and leave myanmmar especially having seen and tasted treatment at the hand of their government?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Israel may be chaos but at least you have a chance to get a job, get respectability, earn a living and send your children to school. I read somewhere that all new comers when they immigrate to israel get all sorts of help. Free hebrew lessons, help on accomodation, money enough to tide them over for 2 months and sometimes even get jobs for them. So even if you died in an attack you'd know it was probably from an enemy who did it and not your own countryman who did you in.<br><br>In myanmmar due to the embargo there are very little jobs for commoners without any "guanxi", everything is heavily taxed and frequently &amp; I heard "child soldiers" from as young as 13yrs old are grabbed off the streets to fill the ranks in the ever growing army.</div>
