              <p>SINGAPORE -- Government of Singapore Investment Corp. suffered a loss around 59 billion Singapore dollars (US$41.6 billion) in the fiscal year ended March, making it one of the worst years for the sovereign wealth fund since it was established in 1981, a person familiar with the situation said Tuesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The equities investments suffered the most, followed by falls in property valuations. It was one of the worst years ever," the person told Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The person said GIC's portfolio now stands around S$265 billion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GIC is the world's fourth largest sovereign fund in terms of money managed, according to Deutsche Bank, with high-profile investments in Western financial institutions like <a class="companyRollover link11unvisited" href="http://sgforums.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=C"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Citigroup</span></span></a> Inc. and <a class="companyRollover link11unvisited" href="http://sgforums.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=UBS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">UBS</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earlier in the day, GIC said in its annual report that its portfolio lost more than 20% of its value in the last fiscal year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, it said, the recent rebound in global stock markets has helped it recover more than half of the loss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The person said GIC's property valuations are also recovering strongly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GIC said in the report that it had an annualized 5.7% return in U.S. dollar terms over the last 20 years from 7.8% a year earlier. Its nominal return over 20 years in Singapore dollar terms was 4.4% compared with 5.8% a year earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It holds a 9% stake in UBS by way of preferred shares it bought in late 2007 for 11 billion Swiss francs ($11 billion).</p>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <p>It’s Sunday, a good day to gloat about how <a href="http://exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8194&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&amp;phrase_id=21862&amp;PAGE=3">I was right </a>and everyone else who gets paid serious money was a fucking idiot. The Financial Crisis that everyone claims <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/205522">they couldn’t possibly see coming</a>?
              I saw it coming, two years before the collapse–all the way from Moscow.
              And so I just want to tell all of you lying brainwashed dickheads out
              there: <em><a href="http://exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8194&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&amp;phrase_id=21862&amp;PAGE=3">I toldja so! </a></em>Yup, that’s right: in 2006, two years before the financial collapse, I wrote a big piece in <em>The eXile</em> headlined “Why You’re Fucked: FINANCIAL CRISIS II: ANOTHER
              SEQUEL” predicting that the out-of-control credit bubble would explode
              and tank the financial system. I’m excerpting it below so that you can
              all worship me,. I believe the word is “prescience”?</p>
              <p>And while we’re on the subject, just wanted to remind everyone of the last “who coulda see it coming?” financial collapse that <a href="http://exiledonline.com/old-exile/vault/feature/feature40.html">I predicted</a> before <a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/27905.html">anyone else</a>: Russia’s <a href="http://exiledonline.com/old-exile/vault/gallery/covers/cover40.html">1998 financial crash</a>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="lightbox[6256]" href="http://exiledonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cover40c.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-13040 aligncenter" title="cover40c" src="http://exiledonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cover40c.gif" alt="cover40c" width="400" height="575"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: mceinline;">I got it right in 1998…</span></strong></p>
              <p>Okay, now I can hear you asking through gritted teeth, “But if you’re so smart, Ames, why ain’t you rich?”</p>
              <p>Good question. I ask myself that about 150 times a day, and one of
              the best answers I can come up with is, “Whoever said that there’s a
              relationship between smarts and wealth?” Maybe if my family wealth came
              from taxpayer handouts like <a href="http://www.alternet.org/healthwellness/141802/anti-government_ideologue_megan_mcardle">Megan McArdle’s</a>, I’d be a rich man today. Or if I was <a href="http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/meritocracy.htm">born into a filthy rich family</a>. Inherited wealth, and welfare-for-the-rich seem to be the only paths to riches in this country.</p>
              <p>Butcha can’t take my gloat away, by gum!</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="lightbox[6256]" href="http://exiledonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/exile240.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-13041 aligncenter" title="exile240" src="http://exiledonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/exile240-450x642.jpg" alt="exile240" width="450" height="642"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: mceinline;">…And I was right about 2008, which I called in 2006. Ha-ha-frickin-ha!</span></strong></p>
              <p>So, getting back to my Sunday gloat: ahem…let me clear my throat here…<a href="http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8194&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35">I WAS FUCKING RIGHT</a>!
              Yeah, I may be poor, but I’m not a braindead idiot like the rest of
              you. And while I didn’t get rich off being so smart, I also didn’t
              sacrifice my healthy years accumulating capital, only to see the whole
              thing vanish before my eyes. While you were slaving away in a miserable
              job, I was living in my body the way God intended: fucking, snorting,
              and basking in the kind of cult-celebrity glory you fools only dream
              about. And while your savings vanish and your housing values collapse,
              the investment I made into being more right than you is something that
              pays dividends forever.</p>
              <p>So now I’m going to cash out a few shares of my “I’M RIGHT AND
              YOU’RE NOT” investment–behold my gloat, for your eyes and everyone
              else’s, and not only.</p>

              <p>Why You’re Fucked<br> FINANCIAL CRISIS II: ANOTHER SEQUEL</p>
              <p>by Mark Ames</p>
              <p>Could we be on the verge of another financial catastrophe? I’ll
              admit it: I’m hopeful. First, because I’m poor and spiteful, and
              secondly, because one of the nice things about financial collapses
              (like military disasters) is that all the ugly, corrupt realities
              underpinning a so-called economic boom are revealed, and the worst in
              humanity is laid bare, and everyone everywhere gets pissed off,
              cynical, and hopeless. That’s the kind of thing that boosts my mood,
              not to mention my sexual drive. Financial panics are to me what
              endangered mammal horns are to Chinese men: pure Viagra placebo.</p>
              <p>…</p>
              <p>In retrospect, the financial crises that ripped through emerging
              markets in the late 1990s appear inevitable and obvious. So does the
              bursting of the NASDAQ/dot-com bubble in 2000. But right up to the day
              of the Asian/Russian collapses, no one expected them, and no one
              understood them, because the circumstances, and in particular the
              terminology, had not yet been incorporated into popular
              financial-crisis discourse.</p>
              <p>So what is happening globally this time? What’s the word that
              everyone’s going to “get” this time around, just as the last time
              around words like “debt burden” went from being vague economics terms
              to obvious explanations for why those markets collapsed.</p>
              <p>Last time it was a debt bubble. This time it’s a <em>credit bubble</em>.
              (italicized bold in original–MA) What that means is that since 2000-1,
              when the US markets crashed and the economy headed into a recession,
              the US Central Bank pumped shitloads of money (liquidity) via
              ridiculously low interest rates. This meant that people had not so much
              “more money” as “easy-to-access” money which they used to buy houses.
              All that easy money meant housing prices soared for five years
              straight, to levels unprecedented when compared to the average Joe’s
              stagnating income. However, all the Joes who owned houses saw their
              asset prices soar, much like those who held NASDAQ stocks in the 90s
              saw their stock portfolios soar, and that meant more money to spend on
              everything from plasma TVs to hybrid SUVs, liposuctions surgeries and
              everything else sold on credit. The US government worked the same
              voodoo on its budget — massively increasing spending while at the same
              time cutting tax revenues. In other words, offering easy, free money to
              itself.</p>
              <p>This easy money, and easy credit, is even easier in other parts of
              the world. China has seen its money supply grow 20% over the last year,
              and credit growth has soared 30% in India. The same has been happening
              in Europe, Japan, and of course Russia, where Russians are offered easy
              loans to “purchase” everything from vacations in Turkey to crap
              apartments in podmoskovie.</p>
              <p>While in the last crisis, emerging market economies like Russia were
              forced to issue bonds at increasingly high interest rates in order to
              finance other high-interest-rate bonds they couldn’t pay off, this time
              around, thanks to all the easy money and the weak dollar, yields on
              emerging market bonds are illogically low, approaching developed
              economy bond yields. Meantime, junk bonds issuance is at its highest
              rate since the 1999 speculative peak. Mergers and acquisitions are
              bursting all records. Much of this is financed by debt, and all kinds
              of popular, profitable debt schemes like repos, credit swaps, and all
              sorts of “esoteric” debt products and instruments.</p>
              <p>Central bank reserves in Russia are approaching an insane $240
              billion, while China’s $880 billion now exceeds Japan’s. More and more
              money is being pumped, inflating prices on any piece of crap asset,
              from Brazilian bonds to partly-built Moscow panel apartment blocks.</p>
              <p>Just as record low interest rates in the US led to unprecedented
              rises in housing prices, year after year, all this easy money is
              leading to massive price rises in commodities. Copper has doubled just
              this year alone. Oil — everyone here knows what’s happened. In Moscow
              and elsewhere in Russia, housing prices have soared every year since
              1999, including 45% in Moscow just this year alone. The stock market
              also boomed 50% before falling.</p>
              <p>This is the bubble. Easy credit swells prices to ridiculous heights.
              The credit-issuance bubble is untenable. And now it’s starting to pop.
              And what’s making it pop is an ever-so-slight pullback from five years
              of reckless easy money in the US, where it all started — in the form of
              today’s higher US Federal Reserve interest rates. Even though they’ve
              raised rates 16 times, they’re set to continue raising rates because
              inflation is still rising, and the dollar is still weak. The catch is
              that inflation is rising because of the easy credit. If the credit’s
              cut off, inflation will slow, but the bubble will pop and take the
              whole thing crashing down. If credit remains easy, inflation will
              continue to spin out of control, requiring even more credit tightening
              later and an even bigger bubble burst.</p>
              <p>Recent signals that the Fed planned to continue raising rates were
              the catalyst for this past month’s credit-bubble pop — and why Russia’s
              stock market is tanking. That’s because the US still controls, to an
              incredible degree, international finance. If US rates keep going up,
              that means money gets less and less easy. No one in the financial
              markets world wants to be the last to the gate. So they pull out of the
              speculative markets first — like Russia — and as the bubble burst
              grows, money retreats to safe places, such as US bonds, which are now
              returning rates not all that different from Brazilian bonds. Panic sets
              in — money follows money, and just as asset inflation becomes
              irrational, so does asset deflation.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is this: the global economy is experiencing one of
              those insane, untenable imbalances, all emanating from New York and
              Washington, just like the last time around, most of the effects of
              which will be felt in Mumbai, Istanbul and Moscow.</p>
              <p>As the easy credit dries up in the US, assets that inflated most
              wildly — like American houses and Russian stocks — are the first to
              fall. And both already are.</p>
              <p>What’s happening with emerging market stocks is just a snapshot of
              what’s to come. In just the last month, the stock market selloffs have
              wiped out $2 trillion in wealth around the globe. That’s scary, and
              that means that more money’s going to be leaving places like Russia.
              And just like last time, first it’s the stocks and bonds that get hit,
              and eventually, property prices get creamed as more and more money
              leaves.</p>
              <p>How far everything will fall, and for how long, is anyone’s guess.
              All one can do is hope. And my hope is that the whole fucking house of
              cards comes crashing down, to the point where in a couple of years from
              now, humanoids will be roaming barren cities in packs, competing with
              crows and stray dogs for carcass bones. Because when that happens,
              everything, even a nifty three-room apartment in Kitai Gorod, or a
              humble condo at Zuma Beach in Malibu, will be affordable to a lifelong
              fuckup like me.</p>
              <p>So keep the easy credit rolling, ye greedy finance goons…the higher it rises, the harder it will fall. And the more for me.</p>

              <p>Since the entry of the PAP into Politics in 1957, there has been a systematic strategy of neutralizing the financial influence of the wealthiest in Singapore that had lent its financial and moral support to the political parties.</p>

              <p>The PAP will not hesistate to mobilise the machinery of government to harrass those who dare to make any public and high profile contributions to any political parties - except to the PAP.</p>

              <p>Afterall, a hog will always remain as a hog, when added the "swei-siao" element, is the false opinions of a "swei-siao-hog" worth anything ?</p>
              <p>The pig sty is worse then the sewer, is that not the place where the hog enjoy wallowring its life away ?</p>
