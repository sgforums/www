That has been the existing foundation of progress of the humankind for centuries. Such progress principle has given us a more civilized life and materialistic and spiritual wellbeings. It has unleashed the spirit of enquiry and brought about advancements to our lives.<br><br>Although our elites claim to be the mandarins or talents and have studied science and technologies and seen how progress is brought about by the spirit of enquiry and establishment of truths, do they practise this spirit and the proper respect for truths.<br><br>They prefer to work on their own judgmental and ad hoc assumptions. Economic competitiveness is based on good corporate governance that empower the masses and not the talents or self-interests of elites but have our leaders recognised or respected this truth about oower of motivations and practical knowledge applications in building our progress and competitiveness.<br><br>Today it is obvious that what we are practising is more and more hypocrisy and assumptions and very little truths. Citizens are being told news about how well the economy is without revealing the underlying problems. It would seem that everythng action and policy is aimed at avoiding telling truths.<br><br>It will be obvious there is no more integrity or truths and our so-called mandarins and elites are going back to the dark ages by suppressing truths in every way for the purpose of control. There will be experiencing more NKF as long as truths are being avoided. What should be done is to bring about an open and truly inclusive society based on truths and not what the establishment want the people to believe.</div>
