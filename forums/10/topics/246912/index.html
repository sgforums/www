            <div class='col-md body'>my advice to Doc Ng eng hen and bala krishnan and balaji.<br>if you want more millions dollars please go back to medical practice.<br>that way you can better help singapore by milking those rich indonesians, phiipinos anc create more wealth for our country.<br><br>we dont need to pay them millions of dollars to suggest we need to build a casino. C ten years ago a coffee shop uncle has long suggested that singapore need a casino so he dont travel to batam and genting.<br><br>my FOC suggestion, we shoud earn more foreign reserves by having a legalise prostitution resort with vast choices all over the world.<br>second  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> , legalise drug trafficking and impose 300% 400% tax. that would bring in another billions of dollars, hopefully enough to fill the filthy pockets of our ministers.<br><br></div>
