But i would prefer a revolution to come sooner rather than later. The problem is: Singaporeans are too afraid of political changes. And what if the government used the "Beijing" solution to solve the problem of protest etc. Drive a tank over our bodies.</div>

It's true that LKY made a very significant contribution to singapore--no doubt about that.
