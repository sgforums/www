            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>99.9% of the people who know the work of LKY well fall into two rather polarized camps: Yep, you either love him or hate him.<br><br>Like all other prominent personages who have managed to carve a significant niche in the annals of history for themselves, they will be judged either as messiahs or self-consumed villains masquerading as heroes.<br><br>I personally, fall in that other 0.01%. I do admire the man. But I stop way short of fawning over him. It is hard not to admire someone who was instrumental in building Singapore to what it is today. Sure, we must not forget the likes of Dr Goh Keng Swee who was prominent among the Old Guard whom themselves must have credit for their collaboration with LKY (and his collaboration with them). But every leadership collaboration must have a human face, a frontman if you will. LKY emerged as this frontman because he had the charisma to. If his colleagues had minded this, they would not have stuck with him through thick and thin. What is sure is that he commanded their respect and captivated their dreams for a Singapore vastly different from the one they were called to lead. The Singapore dream was definitely not the dream on one LKY. It was a shared dream and crafted socio-political vision that belonged to the Old Guard collectively. The role of salesman of this dream and vision, by concensus, fell to one LKY who did a remarkable job at it, just as the other members of the Old Guard, I am sure, did equally remarkable jobs in their own fields of planning and governance.<br><br>So yes, it is fair to say that the "legend" of LKY certainly is a little overplayed in the imaginations of most people. But people, being who we are, need larger than life heroes from time to time to help give us a sense of identity and to fire our imaginations that dreams are certainly possible. The legend of LKY will live on years after his passing and one thing will surely continue: many people will continue to either love him or hate him. Perhaps for the better. We all need heroes and villains to keep us passionate about the things we care about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to feel that perhaps MMLKY had overstayed his political welcome and that it might be detrimental to political self-renewal. But I have since altered my view slightly.<br><br>When someone still has something to contribute, why stop him? There must be a balance between potential longterm drawbacks of MMLKY's political longevity and a measured political arrangement to check such potential detriments.<br><br>The most obvious potential drawback is that the current batch of politicians become complacent that their safety net will be there forever. And then when that safety net suddenly disappears due to old age and natural causes, they are left stranded and confused. Or even worse, they may be tempted to emulate the persona of the great man and become mini-LKY's.<br><br>There has obviously been a strategic redefinition of LKY's political role through the past decade precisely to check the abovementioned scenarios. From PM to SM to MM, LKY's influence has certainly not diminished eventhough it has been calculated to appear that way to the general populace. When he speaks, people listen very attentively. But the frequency he has spoken and on what subjects, with what expression of authority has changed since he was PM, to SM, to MM. It's all very calculated and precisely so as to avoid leadership complacency or persona replication. He is giving the younger generation room to breathe and create their own vision.<br><br>However, I see his continued presence on the political scene as a plus point for Singapore in perhaps the same light as GCT has chosen to remain on the scene after handing over the baton. Like I said at the start of this post, why stop someone from contributing when he still has something to contribute? Furthermore, I think it also speaks of commitment. Commitment to see a cause which they have given their lives to, perhaps to their final breath. There is dignity in that.</div>
