              <p>Just FYI, if you want to value the stuff (UBS, Citigroup C for short) our swfs bought, value the convertibles as a bond and embedded option and add the result together. With regards to the reset clause embedded, for UBS it just merely sets the strike price of the option at the lower bound of CHF 51.48. UBS is trading at wow wow weeeeee CHF13.33, although it should recover a little (maybe to CHF 20, CHF 30 tops) when they convert at the end of the year. (I am being optimistic as I don't like seeing my money being wasted.)  For C, although it is a perpetual bond, it's value is not infinite. Counter intuitive, but it is. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetuity Really cunning, the way Tony emphasised this bit of 'downside' protection.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, there are so many clauses in that thing that can trigger a forced conversion. If push comes to shove and C blows up, who do you think will get paid first, the US Government or GIC? I think the answer is pretty obvious. And which one will blow up? Citi Holdings or Citicorp? If Citi Holdings blows up, how much of taxpayer's money is going to be lost? If GIC were feeling so generous as to give money to all those short sellers and investment banks out there, why can't they give it to the people of Singapore instead? In fact, what is the point of having so much in reserves if you are never going to use it to better the lives of your fellow Singaporeans? Looking at the way our reserves are run, I wonder whether do we really have that money. Maybe it was all lost in '97 and the situation is no better than the Madoff scam for all you know. Most likely there is really money in our reserves, but my point is we cannot know for certain as there is really no accountability at all. It is our money and we want to know how much there is! LKY's secrecy be damned! If money is lost so be it, it is our bad luck. After all we did elect PAP as government but hiding behind the curtain of secrecy is cowardly, to say the least.</p>
              <p>Long term investments are really a gamble. Our great leader said he would hold on to these banking shares for 30 years. 30 years ago, GM and Ford were the largest car companies in the world. Right now, they are on their deathbeds.  In fact, 14 years ago there was this investment bank called Barings. You guys probably know what happened to it. Can't our scholars see that if even Wall Street is negative on itself, it probably is fool hardy to enter such investments? It can be argued that if UBS or C does not blow up and the stock prices rise even at 1% a year, the face value of the investment will be made up. What must be considered in this case is the risk free rate, as measured by US Gov debt. The real value of those stakes would probably by eroded greatly by inflation. In other words, $1 could buy you a plate of chicken rice 30 years ago but not now. Furthermore, the profitibility of banks are going to be lower in the post credit crunch era, impeding share price growth. We may have to wait till the next generation before we see our surviving investments reach their par value. 30 years indeed. </p>
              <p>Scholars make poor investors. Scholars go by the textbook, viewing the world through what they learnt from A BOOK. How anyone can invest or make business decisions in this manner is really beyond me. If they really want to do it by the book, invest in US bonds. Those have a far smaller chance of going wrong as compared to equity stakes. As the Hokkiens put it, lang ai kiang mai geh kiang.</p>
              <p>For our investments, I can only hope that GIC and Temasek did buy some real downside protection aka put options or something, anything. I will really feel sorry for the Singapore taxpayer if all this money goes down the drain. 35 bil, even in Singapore doallars, is the sum of all our tax receipts in a year.</p>

                  preferred stock bought by the U.S. government. The U.S. government
                  would have approximately a 36% stake in Citigroup, while existing
                  shareholders would be cut to a 26% stake, if fully executed.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
                  bank is suspending its payment of dividends on preferred stock.</span> And
                  though the common shareholders have to approve the deal, they do not
                  have much choice, as Citigroup will issue securities to preferred
                  shareholders who agree to the swap that let them buy common stock for a
                  penny a share if shareholders don't approve the deal.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
                  Treasury would only participate in the conversion once other preferred
                  shareholders (predominately sovereign wealth funds) participated.</span> So
                  far, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and Saudi Prince
                  Alwaleed Bin Talal have agreed to participate in the exchange.<br><br>While
                  the conversion would not involve any additional government investment,
                  under this maximum conversion scenario the primary result would be a
                  significant increase in its tangible common equity and boost its
                  tangible common equity ratio.<br><br>However, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Citigroup will still have
                  to endure a "stress test"</span> (which examines a bank's ability to withstand
                  various economic scenarios). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Once the test will have been completed,
                  Citicorp would still be required to raise additional capital, which
                  could create to potential for additional dilution.</span><br><br>This move
                  makes the U.S. government the largest shareholder of the bank, and will
                  probably play a much more active role in shaping the bank’s direction.
                  It is a form of nationalization, whatever it may be termed by the
                  Government.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> As a result of the deal, the stakes of existing common
                  shareholders have been severely diluted.</span> We expect the shares will
                  remain under pressure.<br><br>We suspect Government will end up
                  acquiring a substantial stake in the many other banks which will be
                  required to rebuild their capital after the stress tests, as private
                  capital will not be easy to come by. As such, we advise investors
                  totally avoid those banks which are perfect candidates for capital
                  infusion by the Government after the stress tests, like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bank of America</span> (<a href="http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/bac">BAC</a>), <span style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Bancorp</span> (<a href="http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/usb">USB</a>), <span style="font-weight: bold;">PNC Financial Services Group </span>(<a href="http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/pnc">PNC</a>) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wells Fargo</span> (<a href="http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/wfc">WFC</a>).</span></th>

                          Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) will convert all its
                          preferred shares in Citigroup into common stock to cut its losses.</span> The
                          swop will give it an 11.1 per cent stake in the troubled US bank, which
                          yesterday announced a sweeping plan to boost its common equity base.
                          The conversion will pare GIC's paper loss on its original US$6.88
                          billion investment in Citi from 80 per cent or US$5.5 billion to 24 per
                          cent, or US$1.67 billion, based on Thursday's closing price of US$2.46

              <p>Separately, Citi said yesterday that it plans to swop up to US$52.5
                          billion of its preferred stock, including US$25 billion of the US$45
                          billion held by the US government, for ordinary shares.</p>
              <p>Citi
                          also recorded a massive US$10 billion charge for impairment of goodwill
                          and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter, resulting in an
                          additional net loss of US$9 billion for the final three months of last
                          year.</p>
              <p>For GIC, the decision to convert its shares appears to
                          have been the lesser of two unpalatable choices. Citi yesterday
                          suspended dividend payments on its preferred shares as well as common
                          stock, which means that GIC would lose the 7 per cent annual dividend
                          that it has been receiving if it chose not to convert its holdings.</p>
              <p>The conversion will make GIC the second-biggest shareholder in Citi
                          with a stake of about 11 per cent, compared to about 4 per cent at the
                          time of its original investment. The US government will be Citi's
                          largest shareholder, owning 36-38 per cent of Citi's common equity. The
                          final stakes will depend on how many investors in the publicly held
                          tranche of Citi's preferred stock decide to participate in the share
                          conversion.</p>

              <p>One thing is certain: Existing ordinary shareholders will suffer
                          massive dilution of more than 70 per cent. Citi shares plunged 37 per
                          cent to US$1.55 at the start of US trading yesterday after the bank's
                          announcement. At that price, GIC's unrealised loss on its Citi
                          investment would be US$3.6 billion. The profitability of US banks 'is
                          likely to be impaired in the next two years', said Ng Kok Song, GIC's
                          group chief investment officer in a statement.</p>
              <p>'GIC's view is that with this latest move, Citigroup's capacity to weather the severe economic downturn will be strengthened.'</p>
              <p>Before yesterday's announcement, the market value of the preferred
                          shares held by GIC had already slumped 80 per cent to just US$1.376
                          billion since its initial investment in Citi, as mounting losses made
                          it less likely that the bank would be able to keep up its dividend
                          payments.</p>
              <p>The US government, GIC and other investors that bought
                          Citi preferred stock alongside GIC in January last year will receive
                          common stock at a price of US$3.25 a share. Those investors, including
                          Saudi Arabia's Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, have agreed to the exchange,
                          said Citi.</p>
              <p>At the conversion price of US$3.25, GIC will get some
                          2.12 billion common shares in exchange for its US$6.88 billion in
                          preferred stock. Based on Thursday's closing price of US$2.46 a share,
                          GIC's stake after conversion is worth US$5.21 billion.</p>
              <p>That puts
                          GIC's unrealised loss on its original US$6.88 billion investment in
                          Citi at US$1.67 billion after the conversion, compared to US$5.5
                          billion before.</p>
              <p>Under the original terms of GIC's investment in
                          Citi, it would have had to pay a much higher conversion price of
                          US$26.35 for each common share, GIC said. That would have translated
                          into a stake of just 261.1 million shares, worth a mere US$642 million
                          at Thursday's closing price for Citi shares.</p>
              <p>But the conversion
                          also means that GIC will now bear greater risk than before, as an
                          ordinary shareholder. It also gives up for good the 7 per cent annual
                          dividend that it previously earned on its preferred shares.</p>
              <p>Citi
                          chief executive Vikram Pandit said that the conversion plan had just
                          'one goal' - to increase the bank's tangible common equity or TCE.
                          Converting its preferred shares into ordinary equity will boost its TCE
                          ratio - the focus of stress tests by US regulators starting this week
                          as a key measure of the bank's ability to withstand further losses if
                          the recession is worse than expected.</p>
              <p>Ordinary shareholders are
                          the first to suffer any losses, so common equity is seen as the highest
                          quality of capital that a bank holds, and the size of a bank's common
                          equity base relative to its assets is considered the purest measure of
                          its buffer against losses.</p>
              <p>The hope is that by raising its TCE
                          ratio, Citi will be able to weather the worst recession that the US has
                          seen in decades. The plan is expected to increase its TCE as a
                          proportion of its risk-weighted assets from less than 3 per cent now to
                          7.9 per cent.</p>
              <p>Crucially, it does so without the need to inject
                          more money from the public purse. That makes it unnecessary for the US
                          government to seek the approval of lawmakers for more funds amid
                          growing public fury over the use of taxpayers' money to bail out large
                          banks.</p>
              <p>But the US government could still inject more capital
                          into Citi - in the form of mandatory convertible preferred shares - if
                          the stress tests show that the bank's capital cushion still needs
                          bolstering. That would mean further dilution for ordinary shareholders,
                          including GIC, when the shares are eventually converted to common stock.</p>
              <p>'As a shareholder, GIC supports the initiative by Citigroup and the US
                          government to strengthen the quality of the bank's capital base in view
                          of the challenging economic environment,' GIC said in a statement.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Investors such as Jon Najarian are hopeful that stocks could soar next week. They say we could see an explosion to the upside after a meeting scheduled for March 12th.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">On that date, a House financial services subcommittee plans a hearing on mark-to-market accounting rules, which have been blamed for forcing banks to report billions of dollars in write-downs.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Karen Finerman has long been an advocate of putting these rules on hiatus for a while and “letting the banks breathe.”</p>

              <p>sigh....</p>
              <p>That's only delaying the inevitable. When you drop mark to market accounting, the banks will only be inflating the values. People may be stupid and accept the figures, but the sharks arent stupid.</p>
              <p>Sharks are the numerous ponzi schemers still hiding under the low tide of the inevitable stock market collapse, short selling now to survive waiting for such ponzi methods of accounting.</p>
              <p>They would have learnt their lessons by now, and they only want to get out alive and not clapped in chains. When the stock figures rise, they will sell and get out of the market. When they sell, the stock market will collapse again. Madoff's scam was $60billion. How many more others who cook their books but did not confess as Madoff did, who escape SEC investigations?</p>
              <p>The inevitable will come. Best let the stock market be destroyed. New ways of obtaining capital will have to be found for better honesty. The stock market casino had failed humanity through its greed. We this generation must pay the price and not let our next and future generations be doomed. </p>

              <p>your friend can take comfort that he is in the league of lky.</p>
              <p>lky also invested a lot, but of course not his own money, in citi.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some of you people are just
                  like ah soh and ah peks shopping for meat at the wet
                  market.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">wah so cheap...
                  buy! buy! buy!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">hello, if it is selling for
                  $1.00, there are reasons why it is selling for
                  $1.00<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If it is selling for
                  $10.00<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There are reasons why it is
                  selling for $10.00<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You take home the meat and put
                  it under the mnicroscope, the lelong lelong cheap meat you might
                  find, is uneatable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why don't you put all these
                  stocks under the microscope then decide whether to buy or not and
                  decide which ones to buy. What you will find is that there are so
                  many things unknown, unknowable and you are just delusional for
                  being so sure about it.</span></p>

              <p>U have a point. I have met far too many people thinking that stocks n shares are like day to day commodities. 50% off the top = 50% discount. Therefore buy. IF ONLY things were so simplistic.</p>
              <p>Btw, reminds me of a certain SWF .....</p>
