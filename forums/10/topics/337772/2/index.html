Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds of charity, for He loves not any ungrateful sinner.... O you who believe, fear Allah and give up what remains of your demand for usury, if you are indeed believers. If you do it not, take notice of war from Allah and His messenger, but if you repent you shall have your capital sums; deal not unjustly, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly. And if the debtor is in difficulty, grant him time tin it is easy for him to repay.

              <p>Commentary by Michael R. Sesit</p>
              <p>Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Sovereign wealth funds have been buying up stakes in troubled U.S. and European money-center banks, brokers and other financial institutions at such a rapid pace that you have to wonder: Do they know something other investors don't or are they just spending too much, too fast?</p>
              <p>A few months ago, these funds were regarded as the bogeymen of global finance, intent on using their affluence to acquire strategic industries in the West. By year's end, they were its Santa Claus.</p>
              <p>In the past two years, sovereign wealth funds and Chinese financial institutions invested at least $77.2 billion in Western banks and money managers. About $66.6 billion of that was placed in the last three quarters of 2007, accelerated by banks' needs for capital infusions after being battered by the subprime- mortgage crisis and related credit crunch.</p>
              <p>The bigger deals include Government of Singapore Investment Corp.'s $9.7 billion investment in Switzerland's UBS AG, and Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Pte.'s 18 percent stake in Britain's Standard Chartered Plc for $9.2 billion. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority paid $7.5 billion for a 4.9 percent holding in Citigroup Inc., while Temasek invested $4.4 billion in Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. with an option to buy an additional $600 million of stock. China Investment Corp. bought $5 billion of <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=MS%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Morgan Stanley</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>With more than $2.5 trillion in capital, ``not too long ago, these new masters of the universe were more feared than favored,'' says <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Joseph+Quinlan&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Joseph Quinlan</span></span></a>, New York-based chief market strategist at Bank of America Capital Management. By providing badly needed capital to banks and other financial institutions, ``sovereign wealth funds emerged as a source of financial stability rather than instability.''</p>
              <p>`Complicated Messes'</p>
              <p>Maybe so. But these giant piggy banks aren't charitable institutions.</p>
              <p>``We don't know why anyone would want some of these financial institutions, as their franchises aren't worth much; and they have big, complicated messes that won't be fun to try to unravel,'' <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ray+Dalio&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ray Dalio</span></span></a>, Westport, Connecticut-based president of <a href="http://www.bwater.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Bridgewater Associates Inc.</span></span></a> with $150 billion under management, said in a late November report.</p>
              <p>Many banks make money playing the gap in prices, or spreads, between different securities, currencies and interest rates. These strategies, however, can be replicated without banks' large, expensive overheads. ``We are all competing to create the most efficient portfolios to make our spreads over our cost of funds,'' Dalio said. ``Why would you want a bank as your platform, especially when the quality of portfolio managers working there are those who built the portfolios that yielded these results?''</p>
              <p>Bank Managements</p>
              <p>The managements of these banks and brokers are nothing to cheer about. Just look at their losses. And by taking minority stakes, opting not to sit on boards and surrendering voting rights -- as they have in several instances -- the funds are betting on the same folks responsible for the red ink.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: ``Owning a big American bank is a bit like owning a big American automobile company, or a big American newspaper, or, for that matter, the U.S. dollar,'' Dalio said. ``For all of them, the memory of what it was carries a certain cache that tends to make it trade for more than its real value in the modern world.''</p>
              <p>Perhaps the most telling evidence that sovereign funds may be buying pigs in a poke is billionaire <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Warren+Buffett&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Warren Buffett</span></span></a>'s rebuff to U.S. financial institutions seeking cash infusions. ``So far, we have not seen a deal that causes me to start salivating,'' the chairman of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said in a Dec. 26 interview on CNBC. Of course, Buffett isn't averse to all banks. Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and the second-largest in M&amp;T Bank Corp.</p>
              <p>Insurer Ratings</p>
              <p>Two days later, the company said it was buying the reinsurance unit of Holland's ING Groep NV and setting up a company to guarantee municipal debt in competition with existing bond insurers struggling to retain their AAA credit ratings.</p>
              <p>Sovereign-fund investments have focused on Western financial institutions with large presences in emerging-market economies, strong securities businesses and modern asset-management capabilities, according to <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Huw+van+Steenis&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Huw van Steenis</span></span></a>, head of banking and diversified-financials research for Morgan Stanley in London. Much of the investment is predicated on expectations of growing middle-class wealth, especially in Asia.</p>
              <p>Initially, the investments look smart. The stocks are mostly very liquid and cheap. Furthermore, the shares are often sold at large discounts. Temasek purchased Merrill Lynch stock at a 12 percent discount to its share price a week before the investment was announced.</p>
              <p>Unknown Losses</p>
              <p>Unlike most private-sector fund managers, sovereign funds can also afford to be long-term investors. And being government entities, they aren't required to constantly mark their investments to market.</p>
              <p>Even so, the stocks aren't cheap relative to the financial sector's long-term valuation multiples, Dalio said. What's more, Bridgewater says the full extent of bank losses isn't known. ``We also believe that the credit problems that lie beneath the surface are much larger and more threatening than the ones that have surfaced,'' the firm said in a Nov. 21 report.</p>
              <p>When a crisis hits, it's almost reflexive for financial institutions to understate losses and postpone acknowledging them.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, ``2008 will likely present the best buying opportunity for high-quality financials in the last decade,'' Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said in a Dec. 7 report.</p>
              <p>Three problems: One, figuring out which ones are high quality. Two, in July, Lehman was wrong when it said the worst of the global credit-market rout was over. Three, Dec. 7 isn't a very lucky date in American history.</p>

              <p><strong>Citigroup (C)</strong>:</p>
              <p><strong>Citigroup</strong> (C 3.83) reported a massive loss for the fourth quarter and 
              said it was splitting into two businesses, one focused on traditional banking 
              and the other holding riskier assets.</p>
              <p>For the quarter, Citi reported a loss of $1.72 per share, $0.41 worse than 
              the First Call consensus that expected a loss of $1.31 per share.  Revenues 
              were $5.59 billion.</p>
              <p>During the quarter Citi issued $45 billion of preferred stock and warrants to 
              the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP.</p>
              <p>Citigroup said its Tier 1 capital ratio was approximately 11.8%.  The 
              bank also added $14 billion to its loan loss reserves.</p>
              <p>In a move away from its "financial-services supermarket" model, Citi said it 
              is splitting up into two business, Citicorp and Citi Holdings.</p>
              <p>Citicorp will focus on traditional banking business across the globe.  
              The new Citicorp will include the retail bank; the corporate and investment 
              bank; the private bank, which serves wealthy individuals; and global transaction 
              services.</p>
              <p>Citi Holdings will include the company's non-core assets, including asset 
              management and consumer finance segments, including CitiMortgage and 
              CitiFinancial.  The new unit will also be in charge of Citi's 49% stake in 
              the brokerage joint venture with Morgan Stanley.  
              In addition, Citi Holdings will take a pool of $300 billion of 
              assets including loans and securities backed by residential and commercial real 
              estate, and consumer loans.  Those assets are part of a loss sharing 
              agreement Citi has with the government.</p>

              <p>Just my 2 cents on the current Citibank and Bank of America share prices..</p>
              <p>Banking stocks like Bank of America and Citibank are pretty much finished. Their liabilities are over hundreds of billions and even if the US Govt is to backstop them, it would do little to improve their share price. As the US govt pumps more money into these too-big to fail banks, these banks would have to repay a larger debt to the US Govt. This would just wipe out shareholder's equity as banks have an obligation to repay the US taxpayers first  for their huge injection before other more subordinated debts. For the shares of these banks to be worth any money, the banks have to earn a few hundred billions in 2009/2010/2011  to repay all the US bailout money.That would be impossible as even in the height of subprime securitization and CDO, these banks were only raking in 30-40 billion a year. Now that their most profitable stream of income has ended, these banks would at most make a few billion a year and it would never be possible to pay the 10+% yield on the massive debt they've incurred in 2008.</p>
              <p>These banks are technically "nationalized" now to keep their functions going and prevent a fallout like Lehmans when it collapsed. Also, the US Govt is trying to reduce the sizes of these too-big to fail organizations they've bailed out like AIG, BoA and Citibank so that they can collapse with limited impact to the general economy.</p>
              <p>There is very little upside to their equity,  and even buying debt is risky as you would not have a clear outlook of 2-3 years on what the US govt are going to do to these organizations. The best bet is to buy short term maturing debts on these banks, i.e 1-2 years and get high yields before the US govt decide to let these organizations collapse or disintegrate in an orderly fashion.</p>
              <p>Buying equity at the moment is a very short term investment strategy and you are hoping that the prices jump 3-4 dollars (100-200%) on positive rumours or news, but in the long term the share prices of these companies would not be worth much. Just look at AIG, it's still trading at $1.50+ and slowly shedding its operations. That would be the case of BoA and Citigroup.</p>
              <p>I hope people consider these factors before deciding to lunge into an all out buying frenzy of banking shares that seem to be really cheap at knock down prices. There's a reason why it's that cheap, and it's not because market forces are inefficient at the moment.</p>
