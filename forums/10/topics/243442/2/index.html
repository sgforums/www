Once I has to  look after 24 patients with only 2 assistant nurses before. I am not joking. And when I cannot finish my work - the nursing officer likes to highlight my poor time management. Poor performance huh?<br><br>More than 5 medical sick leave in 3 years mean no promotion unless your daddy is somebody - that was also a general unwritten rule.<br><br>I also remembered working with a fever of 40 degrees because the Nursing Officer won't let me go home - she said workload too much and I have to finish it. Now it is different in Singapore after SARs .<br><br>Thank god , Australia is different - nurses who call in sick get replaced by bank or agency nurses.</div>
