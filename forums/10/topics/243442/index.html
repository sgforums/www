            <div class='col-md body'>Friend of mine, who's 6 mths pregnant, is working at an MNC as HR admin.  Ang moh boss.  She started having bad stomach pains this morning &amp; went to see a doc, who confirmed it is food poisoning.  Doc gave her an MC &amp; ordered her to go home to rest right away, but she is afraid her boss will show his unhappiness.  She's afraid to lose her job.<br><br>She doesn't take MC often and does her job well (i've worked with her before), but her boss has apparently expressed alot of unhappiness abt her recent ML (medical leave) for those pregnancy checkups.  He already refused to let her take MC a mth back when she was sick + pregnant.<br><br>This isn't a clear-cut discrimination case because there's no hard evidence.. Want to help but don't know how to.   Argh.  So much for the shiny govt statistics.  Worse, she's stuck with this job at least till she gives birth.<br><br>Anyone came across these cases before / able to offer insight on how to handle these situations?</div>
