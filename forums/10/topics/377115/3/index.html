              <p><br>You got a mental problem, not me. You choose not to be a Singaporean and choose to promote anarchy. Presently, I think you need to figure out what all Singaporeans need and not just aim to kick the PAP out of power without caring about the future of all Singaporeans. You choose not to admit that there are Singaporeans who are just out to gain work privileges and not earn such privileges by hard work and good innovation.</p>

              <p>Wow. None of you are speaking properly. It's your country. All i can offer is some views on how other people have tried to improve things in the past.</p>
              <p>In case you people can't understand what i write, i shall attempt to explain briefly. I have 2 responses; 1 is a philosophical deep explanation on what you people are trying to achieve.  The other one is an attempt at a straight answer to get you service jobs =)</p>
              <p>Yes I have much to learn, as we all do. And if i have much to learn, i can only imagine how much more most people have to learn and experience and read.</p>
              <p>1.</p>
              <p>You people seem to want quick fixes for anything, campaign for smiles to make you all human, campaign for english to try and make you speak better. Setting up a sports school to make locals better sportsmen, setting up a new creative centre to teach locals to be creative etc. You don't seem to understand that great states with good people who enjoy a good life takes a long time to achieve. The various golden ages of countries, britain, USA, Sweden etc all took hundreds of years of thinking, fighting, protesting (and other things deemed unthinkable to you people) to achieve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simply put. If you want better wages on its own, you need freedom to form unions. If you don't have freedom, that is another matter, which Thoreau could offer points like not participating in government, not participating in laws/policies which you didn't sanction in. You would be jailed for dissidence yes, but you are expressing yourself by having bollocks and attempting for change.</p>
              <p>Great states you people want to emulate were built on a long process of self-critique, feedback from people, revolutions, questiong, talking, debate. These are things i do not see Singaporeans getting into within the next few decades.</p>
              <p>Simply put, if you want better economic conditions in the long run for all, you must petition
              the government or be vocal, if not you won't get improvements. If you
              are not being listened to, you must act to change things in the long
              run. This is how countries do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Be less choosy about your employment and you will be hired. If you actually became a better person with empathy, diligence, politeness and civility, you will stand out (especially in Singapore) and you will be hired.</p>
              <p>I have spoken to numerous singaporeans, elite and non elite (although i think none of are elite) so called. And i have been through all your institutions, i know you people. There is a stigma with the service sector. This is an elitist society which frowns on the service sector and prides itself on white collar positions. There is streaming at a young age, siphoning of people into "made it" and "did not make it" categories. You people actually think the service sector is a crap job when it isn't.</p>
              <p>And even if you think employment is not good. You should take measures to change things. Either revolt and change the entire political economy. Or improve yourself to stand out to satisfy the need for good workers.</p>
              <p>Good does not mean having lots of papers. A good worker is someone who is a good human being. Do not wait for a government campaign to be launched before you start being human, that goes for all of you.</p>
              <p>And to those that question my knowledge and ability to even comment about you people. Know that not all foreigners are as aloof as you people and working class eurotrash are. Know that at least there is one foreigner who will not need a cent of that $10million integration package (recently unvailed in the papers). Know that there are foreigners who have served alongside you on that horrible army island and are thus considered your moral and national equivalents as Singaporeans in good measure. Know that at least a few of us have donned your uniforms and marched in step with you in uniformed units at school, know that some of us can speak to you in singlish and malay and mandarin and yet are able to easily intermingle among all people; foreign and local at anytime. Know that we complain and gripe just as much as you do and we understand that fear and apathy that lies within your breast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alas, most of you will never understand the diversity of all people's abroad and here, because most of you will never see beyond your well on your island.</p>

              <p><br>Then why bother to rephrase me? You obviously have some mental problem. Secondly, I havn't met a capable Singaporean political party yet, so when PAP is out of power, there will be anarchy and power struggle.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are well-known to be kiasu and kiasi, when another similar hierachy colleague get extra 2 days of paid leave due to working thru the weekends, another arsehole who doesn't need to work through the weekend go all the way up to General Manager to complain of not having another 2 days of paid leave. I have seen such occurence many times, so I have to admit that Singaporeans are farked-up in being afraid to lose out without knowing the true reason.</p>
