              <p>The tone was such that unemployed singaporeans are too choosy. What they didnt mention was the high influx of foreigners taking away our rice bowls.</p>
              <p>People alrdy unemployed still "drop a stone into the well". lol</p>

              <p>Propaganda.</p>
              <p>Choosy or exploitation from the ruling party??</p>
              <p>A friend who is still financing his housing loan was offered an officer position from NEA which pays him $1100 and so get back pay is only $880.   With this amount, it is not sufficient to pay his housing loan.   With the take home pay of $880 sounds more like allowance than salary.    With the take home pay of $880, it is just sufficient for expenses for transport, meals, paying bills and some amount for contingency that is all.   </p>
              <p>So with the reality I mentioned above, is this not exploitation by govt who is into supporting , condoning employers to underpay employees?  There in the CDC the govt is using trainers to brainwash the employees by stating that the employment trend these days is that staff must be willing to do more, do more than one person's job and get low pay.   They strongly urge and encourage employees to accept low pay.</p>
              <p>Seems clear that the ruling party is not making life better for us, so why should we give them our vote??? </p>

              <p><br>Thanks, I stop reading the propaganda STs.</p>
              <p>They are sickos.     Many still cannot find jobs, I pity those breadwinners who are still stuck in job searching.    We are not blessed to have a govt who place public service before their own selfish interest of sucking us dry.   </p>

              <p>Talking about that, reminds me of a FT complaining about the high cost of living here.    High in rental, food and essentials.   He is seriously considering to get his company to post him to other country.</p>
