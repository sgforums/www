              <p>It's nothing new for interference of politic. Many singapore politicians also interferred other countries politic. Unless they have a substantially strong culture/civic-mindedness of loving-kindness to build an everlasting future together. You see, it's very normal for rule to take precedent because of "property rights" unless an open heart of loving-kindness that are inherently Singaporeans or pple of planet earth is realised and strongly developed and etched along the journey of happiness &amp; bliss. The parties of Singapore is truly non-bias because of their strong democracy of love, they work together for common goal, but most often than not, they lost their purpose in life for loving-kindness to breed harmoniously. Peronally, i am confident that Singapore will always succeed not so much on the principle based on economy, but on the humaneness heart of pple sharing in this small lovely dot <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

Same goes to most of the country around singapore, malaysia is also getting lots of opposition in, it did not fare well and more worst, alot of undesireable politician news, from sex scandal to gay...that got nothing to do with citizens, especially the poorer ones, who care about your scandal and fighting, just give me jobs and foods.</p>
