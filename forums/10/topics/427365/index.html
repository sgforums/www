              <p>There are good guys and bad guys, gun-du and cunning guys, smart guys and naive guys, proud guys and humble guys.....everywhere, it is said that there are more cunning guys in HK, more loud mouth guys in Taiwan, more naive guys in Singapore. é¦™æ¸¯äººå¥¸ï¼Œå�°æ¹¾äººåš£ï¼Œæ–°åŠ å�¡äººç¬¨ï¼Œå¤§é™†äººä»€ä¹ˆéƒ½ä¸�æ˜¯ã€‚</p>
              <p>You sure Singaporeans are open to other cultures, like PRC, India and pinoy??? are you not hearing the noise about "too many foreigners here"?</p>
              <p>You are prejudice against the taiwanese, that blinds you.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are open to other cultures and willing to try the food and even wear the culture national costumes but when there are way over too many pinoys, china nationals , india nationals taking over their jobs, that is a totally different issue altogether. It's living hood problem here now.</p>
              <p>I believe even China and India and Philippines would not want so many Singaporeans flooding their countries and snatching jobs away from their natives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You look at Chen Shui Bian, he can even cheat his own countrymen as a president. Taiwanese have no shame and talk "morals" for show only.  Why are the Taiwanese interested in Singapore politics? What's that to do with or affect Taiwan in any way.  They are interested in our National Reserve, is it ?</p>
              <p>This secret weapon of Worker Party, even if he is educated here, he didn't stay here for the past 30 years , so what is he doing here now when he abandoned Singapore for a better life oversea?</p>

              <p>Unlike the PAP's Janil Puthucheary who only became Singaporean 2
              years ago and who did not serve NS and resisted calls for him to
              serve reservist as an MO.</p>
              <p>Instad he claims that he is "saving babies" for last 10 years
              therefore its equal to NS.</p>

              <p>Both are then not qualified to represent Singaporeans.  Chen Show Mao abandoned Singapore for a better life overseas for the past 30 years. He is doing it for fame.  He is also not close to the heartland people , how can he understand the problems of the average Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Are you sure you are a Singaporean? You compare Singaporeans with the Chinese Nationals andTaiwanese and conclude that we have manners. Just becuse we are more honest and transparent does not mean we have more maners. Just because others are worse, does not mean we are better.</p>
              <p>The Thais and the Malaysians the Filipinos are not as honest and transparent as us, but they are certainly more polite and mannered than us.</p>
