              <div style="margin-top: 6px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin-top: 6px;">If you're wondering why North America is starting to resemble nuclear winter, then you missed the news.<br> <br> At December's U.N. Global Warming conference in Poznan, Poland, 650 of
              the world's top climatologists stood up and said man-made global
              warming is a media generated myth without basis. Said climatologist Dr.
              David Gee, Chairman of the International Geological Congress, "For how
              many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the
              planet is not warming?"
              <p>I asked myself, why would such obviously smart guy say such a ridiculous thing? But it turns out he's right.</p>
              <a name="more"></a>
              <p>The earth's temperature peaked in 1998. It's been
              falling ever since; it dropped dramatically in 2007 and got worse in
              2008, when temperatures touched 1980 levels.<br> <br> Meanwhile, the University of Illinois' Arctic Climate Research Center
              released conclusive satellite photos showing that Arctic ice is back to
              1979 levels. What's more, measurements of Antarctic ice now show that
              its accumulation is up 5 percent since 1980.<br> <br> In other words, during what was supposed to be massive global warming,
              the biggest chunks of ice on earth grew larger. Just as an aside, do
              you remember when the hole in the ozone layer was going to melt
              Antarctica? But don't worry, we're safe now, that was the nineties.<br> <br> Dr. Kunihiko, Chancellor of Japan's Institute of Science and Technology
              said this: "CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or the
              other ... every scientist knows this, but it doesn't pay to say so."
              Now why would a learned man say such a crazy thing?<br> <br> This is where the looney left gets lost. Their mantra is atmospheric
              CO2 levels are escalating and this is unquestionably causing earth's
              temperature rise. But ask yourself -- if global temperatures are
              experiencing the biggest sustained drop in decades, while CO2 levels
              continue to rise -- how can it be true?<br> <br> Ironically, in spite of being shown false, we must now pray for it.
              Because a massive study, just released by the Russian Government,
              contains overwhelming evidence that earth is on the verge of another
              Ice Age.<br> <br> Based on core samples from Russia's Vostok Station in Antarctica, we
              now know earth's atmosphere and temperature for the last 420,000 years.
              This evidence suggests that the 12,000 years of warmth we call the
              Holocene period is over.<br> <br> Apparently, we're headed into an ice age of about 100,000 years -- give
              or take. As for CO2 levels, core samples show conclusively they follow
              the earth's temperature rise, not lead it.<br> <br> It turns out CO2 fluctuations follow the change in sea temperature. As
              water temperatures rise, oceans release additional dissolved CO2 --
              like opening a warm brewsky.<br> <br> To think, early last year, liberals suggested we spend 45 trillion
              dollars and give up five million jobs to fix global warming. But there
              is good news: now that we don't have to spend any of that money, we can
              give it all to the banks.</p>
