So why should the owner bear such a massive financial loss on his HDB flat's market value when the guy across the road with a similar size unit might be able to achieve a premium; as his block of flat does not have any maximum quota against a single ethnicity. The policy strikes me as a totally unfair system.<br><br></div></blockquote>If I'm not wrong, the system doesn't apply to a whole block of flats, i.e. there is no such thing as a whole block of flats not being eligible for a particular race permanently. I think it works this way: let say for a block with 100 units of flat, 65% would be alloted to Chinese, 20% to Malay, 10% to Indian and 5% to others. Then 10 Chinese and 2 Malay tenants shifted out. If the Malay sellers were replaced by another 2 Malay buyers, then no more Malay could buy any the flats in that block until some existing Malay tenants shift out.<br><br>I think this system itself is already racist though it could be for good intentions.</div>

Some of our people's mind had been "rewired" by the people "up-there". The trend among many young people today is mixing mostly with their own kind; only superficially do you see the mixing of races for the cameras and politicians. At almost all dialogue sessionÂ’s ministers are always bombarded with racial issues esp among the minorities asking for some sort of assurances and guarantees that they are not sidelined. Are these hysterical people?  There is a real problem here, which fortunately some of our politicians have come to realize, but due to some reasons they are still reluctant to make some major changes, which we urgently require!<br></div>

I think that's a practical approach.''<br><br>Pointing to France, he noted that the word Â“race'' is not seen anywhere and the official government line is that everybody's French.<br><br>Â“You can't say you're a Frenchman from Algeria, Frenchman from Morocco. You're a Frenchman,'' said Lee, who visited the country last November.<br><br>Yet, the reality is far from the ideal.<br><br>Frenchmen of different races and religions live in different areas, with the people of African and Arab origins congregating in the ghettos of Paris.<br><br>The people who live in the down-and-out places say this is make-believe. We are not all the same. You pretend that we're all the same<br><br>France was rocked by three weeks of riots last November when youths of African and Arab descent torched cars, looted and clashed with the police across the country.<br><br>To aggravate matters, Lee said, the French do not have statistics and data to help them identify the problems because it is illegal to collect statistics by race.<br><br>He also recounted MM Lee's experience when he was a student in Britain looking for a place to stay.<br><br>He would call up and say he was Â“Mr Lee''. As some Englishman also share the same surname, the landlords would think he was white.<br><br>'When he shows up, they tell him, sorry, no flat, no vacancies, because actually they saw him: He's a Chinese.</div>

We must not allow the segregation of races as it exists in many western nations, the results of which are clear, based on recent events in France and the UK.<br><br>Chinese Singaporeans should be encouraged to reside in areas where there is a greater proportion of minority races and similarly, the latter should be encouraged to find housing in Chinese-predominant neighborhoods. Though painful, if we consider the bigger picture the price differential is good, so as to discourage racial segregation."</span><br><br>You must be joking!<br><br>You simply do not understand that its all these laws had altered the mindset of the majority to a certain extent. Some of our people's mind had been "rewired" by the people "up-there". The trend among many young people today is mixing mostly with their own kind; only superficially do you see the mixing of races for the cameras and politicians. At almost all dialogue sessionÂ’s ministers are always bombarded with racial issues esp among the minorities asking for some sort of assurances and guarantees that they are not sidelined. Are these hysterical people?  There is a real problem here, which fortunately some of our politicians have come to realize, but due to some reasons they are still reluctant to make some major changes, which we urgently require!<br></div></blockquote>While sounding distasteful, an ethnic quota is a necessary factor to ensure a stable degree of racial harmony. WP's position on fairness in terms of re-sale value for the minority races is a weak point as careful planning should circumvent this problem.<br><br>If you need examples of what removing such quotas will do, just look at New Orleans, USA. The recent Hurricane Katrina exposed the flaws and bigotry in a 'free society', exemplifying the problem when ethnic groups congregate. Taken from interviews with US citizens: "<span style="font-style: italic;">No white man feels safe in New Orleans".</span><br><br>The fact that the White House stayed blind to this growing cesspool proliferated its decay and even today they feel the urge to DEFEND their actions during Katrina (Below).<br><br><a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/K/KATRINA_CONGRESS?SITE=ASIAONE&amp;SECTION=TOP_STORIES&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" rel="nofollow">http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/K/KATRINA_CONGRESS?SITE=ASIAONE&amp;SECTION=TOP_STORIES&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT</a><br><br>In Singapore context, by removing these control barriers, what's to stop  the Chinese/Malay/Indian from devolving to their primitive and backward enclave mentality? Worst, these enclaves are more than likely to practice bigotry and racial discrimination, scenes reminicent of the old days in SG.<br><br>Our current system is one of racial tolerance.
