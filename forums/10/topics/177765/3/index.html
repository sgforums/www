            <div class='col-md body'>From your responses, I get the impression most of you are not getting the point i'm trying to make. The ethnic quota system is good but the financial loss incurred by the seller of the property is not justified. According to the papers today 300 HDB owners are affected by the quota system annually. i believe there would be more such cases in the future as the population expands. If the HDB owner suffers a financial loss due to the ethnic policy shouldnt the government legally be reimbursing the HDB flat owner on his/her financial loss?</div>
