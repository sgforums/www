            <div class='col-md body'>The recent WP manifesto regarding scrapping the HDB Ethnic Group quota system makes sense as the policy is flawed and works against the owners of HDB flats. I do understand the fact that the policy was originally implemented to prevent the formation of racial enclaves and to promote ethnic integration in HDB housing towns. Its all good and fine. However, its a great idea build with unfairness towards flat owners whose block of flats have been marked as ineligible for sale say to chinese, indians, or malays.<br><br>It doesnt make sense to penalise a HDB owner who is looking to sell his property in the open market and finds out that he can't say sell to the chinese for example. As the chinese make up the majority, a block of flats marked as not being eligible for chinese buyers could see a massive drop in its market value. So why should the owner bear such a massive financial loss on his HDB flat's market value when the guy across the road with a similar size unit might be able to achieve a premium; as his block of flat does not have any maximum quota against a single ethnicity. The policy strikes me as a totally unfair system.<br><br><strong>Solution:</strong><br>If thegovernment insist on maintaining the HDB ethnic group policy; in all fairness owners of HDB flats should be reimbursed by the government for their financial loss when the units are not eligble to be sold to a particular ethnic group. The compensation formulae should take the Open Market Value of the HDB flat LESS the lower price at which the flat is sold as a result of quota of ethnic buyers in that particular block of flats.<br><br></div>

And they convert the surrounding into like a kampong. Things everywhere, benches, tables, like they own the entire common corridor including garden.<br><br>I'm not saying that they are bad in this way, they are just community minded, they like to group together. This is why the Ethnic Quota System is in place. Now, this Policy I can understand.<br><br>Even in schools these days, students are encouraged to mix around with other races. This is to cultivate social and racial cohesion, not band together as one race, and alienate yourself from the other races. It's unhealthy.<br><br>What's your take on this view point?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean, lets face it; when Chinese buy flats, they want to make sure there aren't too many Malays on their floor or in the estate. Not because we Chinese don't like Malays, it's just that we don't want to have to put up with their habit of keeping cats (the cats will roam the block and leave doos doos here and ther which you need to side-step), and their merry making noise now and then.<br><br>Same goes to Malays buying flats; they want to make sure there other Malays in the block to buddy-up with. And note that Malays who stays in the upper floors are different, they don't really mix around like those on the lower and ground floors.<br><br>I know this sounds racist, but I'm not saying anything bad about them. It's just their ways, and isn't this waht the Ethnic Quota is meant for? This is to keep things on even keel in terms of racial proportion.</div>
