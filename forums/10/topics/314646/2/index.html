              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. A plan for success</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Reform Party Party's official beginning with <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeyaretnam's</span> full return to politics and a clear indication that it will work with Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee's</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">SDP</span> is all very good news. The question now is, what is the plan?<br><br>Lets
              look at Singapore now. Lee controls every possible organ of power, the
              judiciary, the press, the media, everything. Therefore regardless of
              whether <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeyaretnam</span> wins a seat at the next election or even the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">SDP</span> winning 4 seats will make no difference at all. You know the pattern
              already. If the opposition winners are of the calibre of Francis <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Seow</span> or Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span>,
              they will not be allowed to take their seats in Parliament. Before its
              sitting, Lee would have organized a libel suit and the worthy opponent
              would be worthy no more, by being kicked out of Parliament through
              bankruptcy.<br><br><span class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeyaretnam</span> has been in politics for a long time. With all due respect given to
              him; except for taking great punishment at the hands of Lee, he has not
              managed to further democracy in Singapore at all. If at all, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeyaretnam</span> had caused Lee to tighten the screws even more. For instance, during
              his time, Privy Council appeals were abolished and across the board,
              laws became harsher with increased punishments.<br><br>And as long as
              Lee continues to have a majority of even one in Parliament, he will
              continue to do whatever he wants, because all the pillars of government
              that matter; the judiciary, the media, the finance everything, remains
              under his absolute control. Regardless of how much wisdom there is in
              their cause, or how many speeches they make in Parliament, Lee can just
              ignore it and there is nothing that <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeya</span> or Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> can do, since the courts and everybody else are beholden to Lee, not to Parliament or to the truth.<br><br>So if all what <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeya</span> hopes to do is to stand for elections, win one seat for himself, enter
              Parliament and make his speeches for 5 years, I really don't think Lee
              would object at all. In fact Lee may even facilitate <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeya's</span> victory this time, since there is nothing for them to lose. Lee can give <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jeya</span> time to talk. And Lee will just ignore it, for another 5 years! It would be the same if Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> got into Parliament.<br><br>What
              we have to understand is; that the power in Singapore, lies not in
              Parliamentary speeches; it lies in the pillars of power; which so
              happens, all of them being beholden to Lee and Lee alone. It lies in
              the newspaper. You have to convince the paper to be impartial, which it
              is not. It lies in the judiciary. You have to convince the judiciary to
              be impartial, which it is not. You have to convince the police force
              that it is not the private security of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew. Convince the civil service to be fair. Convince the colleges to be fair. Convince the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> not to discriminate against the Malays and Indians. Convince the Civil
              Service not to issue visas for unlimited numbers of immigrants from
              China, because it is these pillars where the power actually lies. The
              question is, how do you do it?<br><br>It is impossible to make the
              aforementioned organizations impartial by speeches in Parliament. They
              are not going to listen. So what do you do?<br><br>The bigger and
              important task in bringing about democracy is to instill a sense of
              fairness in these people. A realisation that they are not beholden to
              Lee as they think. Without that realization, no amount of speeches in
              Parliament can bring that about. Change has to come by forcing these
              organizations to realize that what they do is wrong. So I come back to
              where I started. The answer lies in protests.<br><br>Protest outside
              the courts demanding justice and fairness. Protest outside Straits
              Times demanding impartiality in reporting. Protest outside the Civil
              Service demanding equal treatment. Protest outside the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> demanding an end to discrimination against the Malays and Indians. Protest outside the Official <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Assignee</span> demanding a reversal of Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee's</span> bankruptcy. Protest outside the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Istana</span> demanding a reduction in the million dollar salaries of ministers.<br><br>And
              these protests must be sustained and not let up until your demands are
              met.<strong> I have no doubt in my mind that every civil servant, every judge,
              every clerk, everyone, every Singaporean, deep in their hearts, is in
              fact very much on the side of the opposition.</strong> If they act in a manner
              prejudicial and unfair towards the opposition, it is because they fear
              Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew. Sustained protests demanding justice, will I believe, have a
              redeeming and salving effect on them and they will, in the end mend
              their ways and become honest men and women.<br><br>In fact the
              opposition, by which I means the Singapore Democratic Party and the
              Reform Party should concentrate firstly on these sustained protests to
              bring these pillars of power to see reason. This is the fundamental and
              first objective. Only the second objective is entering Parliament.<br><br>The
              people of Singapore are confusing the Parliamentary system there, which
              in fact it is not, to the parliamentary system in countries such as the
              UK. In the UK, the courts newspapers and the civil service are all
              independent. Moreover the power lies in the people, who are fully aware
              of their rights. In Singapore, everything is in the hands of Lee. And
              therefore Parliament means very little or nothing.<br><br>My message to
              the opposition is this. Work on the institutions on the ground first.
              Make them realise their duty to justice and equality. While this work
              goes on, work on Parliament.<br><br>This has to be done by protest, first.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
