              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I was 22 just four years ago.</p>
              <p>At that age, I was in my second year of undergraduate studies. I
              looked like a student, I felt like a student, and I was indeed a
              student. However, at that age, I also knew that if I were to commit
              a crime, I would be tried as an adult no matter what.</p>
              <p>I'm 26 now, and I'm still a student. Can I be tried as a
              juvenile if I were to commit a crime?</p>
              <p>So, let me get this straight - he looks young and he feels
              young, he should be tried as a young person? So if Leonardo
              diCaprio or Christiano Ronaldo were to commit a crime, we should
              treat them as juveniles? They look so baby-faced!</p>
              <p>If you tell me that a psychiatrist had certified him to be
              mentally challenged, I might still sympathise with him. But the
              bottom line is, he's a full-grown adult who has to take
              responsibility for his own actions. If he can't even understand
              that till now, then that's not the problem of the law.</p>
              <p>If you don't set the lower bar for adulthood at 21, where do you
              want to set it then - 35?</p>

              <p>Was this 'boy' given a psychological or psychiatric test to determine his IQ level before sentence was passed ?</p>
              <p>With the methods employed by the SAF in allocating vocations according to the IQ Tests and scholarly achievements - can we not hazzard a guess as to the IQ level of this 'boy' based on his SAF vocation and obvious academic or intellectual abbilities ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is interesting that you should ask at "<em>what age and at what level of cognitive ability, did personal responsibility begin ..... if not at 22</em>".</p>
              <p>Let me lean on a speech by DPM Prof S Jayakumar during the Committee of Supply Debate in Parliament, on 2 March 2007:- </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://notesapp.internet.gov.sg/__48256DF20015A167.nsf/LookupContentDocsByKey/GOVI-6YWCSH?OpenDocument">‘(31)The age of majority in Singapore is actually not defined by statute. It is defined by common law which sets it at 21 year. (35)The point I want to make is there is no single threshold age for all purposes. I guess it is because you cannot say that adulthood is gained overnight on a fixed birthday whether it is 21 or earlier. Rather, it is through a gradual process.’ (*2) </a></p>
              <p>Has the gradual process of adulthood reached this 'boy' at age 22 ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, he has committed a misdemeanour, no one is denying it - and as I had mentioned the offense was - "<strong>At its very worst, the crime was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">serious</span></span> in that he had co-operated with foreign military personnels to breach military security</strong>".</p>

              <p>If you believe in all the smoke and drama created by The Bear a.k.a the Drama Queen of this Speaker's Corner - I will not be surprised if your IQ allow you to so easily succumbed to being impressed to all the smoke from his expertise that seldom come with any bang.</p>
              <p>Did you hear any bang created by The Bear amidst all the smoke through all the threads in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>
              <p>If only you had made some space in your lungs to breathe in the fresh air in all the hoopla of the SAF Pledge, you would have found some small iota of pride in the abilities of the SAF after all the millions spent in the 3G hoopla.</p>
              <p>Singapore has exerted our independent and sovereign rights towards big and small nations before, and this will not be the first time if Singapore assert our position again if necessary.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government had moved aside the personal plea for leniency from the late President Suharto to spare the lives of two Indonesian military personnel who were caught for planting the bomb at MacDonald House during Konfrontasi, and both were hanged on 17 October 1968 - when Konfrontasi was formally over in August 1966 and relations was moving "up and up" between Suharto and LKY.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government ignored the plea for leniency from then President Bill Clinton and proceeded to placed 4 strokes on the butt of Michael Fay.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government ignored the advances of three Indonesian Governments after the fall of ex-President Suharto - for a treaty to extradite Indonesians convicted of economic crimes against Indonesia and had taken refuge in Singapore, where they continue to remain till this day.</p>
              <p>What happened to your hoopla pride for the SAF - in allowing the Indonesian vessel to sail away with the perpetrators of the crime that was committed within the Changi Naval Base - not once but on two consecutive occassions ?</p>
              <p>Have you no confidence in the SAF, or simply find it diplomatically impossible to enforce our rights to do so ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you simply doubt the billions invested in the 3G hoopla that has been advertised in the glitzy high tech short SAF movies over Media Corp ?</p>

              <p>As a lay person, I would think that there are degrees of "retardedness", as there is a difference between mentally retarded, mentally deficient and mentally handicapped.</p>
              <p>It all depends on the psychological and / or psychiatric assessment on the subject before being qualified for NS.</p>
              <p>In the past, the Singapore Judiciary has not made any difference between the IQ of the offenders charged with all types of dismeanour, of which some high profile cases has received unwanted bad publicity for the Singapore Justice system.</p>
              <p>It will be enlightening to note the Attorney-General - Walter Woon's statement in his speech to the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore Inaugural ACLS Annual Lecture on 11 December 2008 -</p>

              <p>If you believe that I am wrong in judging from the photo,
              are you now saying that you can tell that "<em>he does
              not look intellectually sub-normal</em>" by looking at the

              person from the photo than anyone ?</p>
              <p>Why don't you post your photo and I will tell you if
              you are close to being the "boy" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> What is the threshold for responsibility ?</p>
              <p>Should I venture from my own thoughts or would you prefer
              this to come from some authoritative source to determine what
              the threshold should be ?</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dpa.org.sg/Publications/newsdet.asp?news_id=108">‘The IQ of an average person is between 90 and 110,

              and ability to guard against bad influences’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Was this 'boy' given a psychological or psychiatric test to
              determine his IQ level before sentence was passed ?</p>
              <p>With the methods employed by the SAF in allocating
              vocations according to the IQ Tests and scholarly achievements -

              'boy' based on his SAF vocation and obvious academic
              or intellectual abbilities ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is interesting that you should ask at "<em>what age and at
              what level of cognitive ability, did personal responsibility begin
              ..... if not at 22</em>".</p>
              <p>Let me lean on a speech by DPM Prof S Jayakumar during
              the Committee of Supply Debate in Parliament, on 2 March
              2007:- </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://notesapp.internet.gov.sg/__48256DF20015A167.nsf/LookupContentDocsByKey/GOVI-6YWCSH?OpenDocument">‘(31)The age of majority in Singapore is actually
              not defined by statute. It is defined by common law which sets it
              at 21 year. (35)The point I want to make is there is no single
              threshold age for all purposes. I guess it is because you cannot
              say that adulthood is gained overnight on a fixed birthday whether
              it is 21 or earlier. Rather, it is through a gradual process.’
              (*2) </a></p>
              <p>Has the gradual process of adulthood reached this 'boy' at age
              22 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, he has committed a misdemeanour, no one is denying it -
              and as I had mentioned the offense was - "<strong>At its
              very worst, the crime was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">serious</span></span> in that he had co-operated
              with foreign military personnels to breach military
              security</strong>".</p>
              <p>How did you brilliantly read the seriousness to be anything less
              as you have claimed to have been said by me ?</p>
              <p>Was the issue about the seriousness of the offense
              committed, or was the point that I had made that being a first
              time offender, the sentence is not commensurate with the
              offense committed ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you believe in all the smoke and drama created by The
              Bear a.k.a the Drama Queen of this Speaker's Corner - I will not be
              surprised if your IQ allow you to so easily succumbed to
              being impressed to all the smoke from his
              expertise that seldom come with any bang.</p>
              <p>Did you hear any bang created by The Bear amidst all the smoke
              through all the threads in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>
              <p>If only you had made some space in your lungs
              to breathe in the fresh air in all the
              hoopla of the SAF Pledge, you would have found some
              small iota of pride in the abilities of the SAF after all the
              millions spent in the 3G hoopla.</p>
              <p>Singapore has exerted our independent and sovereign rights
              towards big and small nations before, and this will not be the
              first time if Singapore assert our position again if necessary.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government had moved aside the personal plea for
              leniency from the late President Suharto to spare the lives of two
              Indonesian military personnel who were caught for planting the bomb
              at MacDonald House during Konfrontasi, and both were hanged on 17
              October 1968 - when Konfrontasi was formally over in August 1966
              and relations was moving "up and up" between Suharto and
              LKY.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government ignored the plea for leniency from then
              President Bill Clinton and proceeded to placed 4 strokes on
              the butt of Michael Fay.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government ignored the advances of three Indonesian
              Governments after the fall of ex-President Suharto - for a
              treaty to extradite Indonesians convicted of economic crimes
              against Indonesia and had taken refuge in Singapore,
              where they continue to remain till this day.</p>
              <p>What happened to your hoopla pride for the SAF - in
              allowing the Indonesian vessel to sail away with the
              perpetrators of the crime that was committed within the Changi
              Naval Base - not once but on two consecutive occassions ?</p>
              <p>Have you no confidence in the SAF, or simply find it
              diplomatically impossible to enforce our rights to do so ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you simply doubt the billions invested in the 3G hoopla
              that has been advertised in the glitzy high tech short
              SAF movies over Media Corp ?</p>

              <p>Let me sum up your arguments, Atobe:</p>
              <p>1. You say that he looks pretty dumb, and he acted pretty dumb for doing this crime =&gt; so we should be going easy on him because it's obvious that he<em> is</em> dumb.</p>
              <p>Hey, guess what - no one disputes that the fella <em>is</em> a dumb criminal. Actually, if you think about it, in a way, most criminals <em>are</em> dumb. Just probably not in the normal sense of the word 'dumb'. They are not <em>mentally</em> dumb. They just chose to make <em>dumb decisions</em>.</p>
              <p>If Bernie Madoff had been a little smarter, he would have figured that swindling lotsa people of their life savings at the risk of dying in prison is a dumb idea.</p>
              <p>Heck, I can give you a hilarious article on <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article/79_the-5-most-embarrassing-failures-in-history-terrorism">The five dumbest terrorist attack attempts of all time.</a> The last one's a particular gem. One of the terrorists was a doctor <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1086587/I-terrorist-doctor-Glasgow-Airport-bombing-admits.html">in the National Health Service!</a>. But hey, even intelligent people can make dumb decisions to do dumb crimes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So you say we should go easy on all those dumbos too, eh? Lack of good judgement == diminished responsibility? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Oh yeah, Bernie Madoff looks like a real dumbo to me. So you're saying that he should not be made to take responsibility for his own dumbness? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. So, it's pretty easy to go through the SAF Driving School =&gt; only dumb morons who will do dumb crimes will pass through it?</p>
              <p>Hey, guess what. Two of my BMT section mates became drivers. One entered NUS after ORD - I know because I bumped into him repeatedly on campus over the past four years. Not sure about the other guy, but I heard that he went to pursue a degree overseas. They're certainly not challenged in the intellectual department, and last I heard, they haven't committed any dumb crimes. You seriously owe them an apology.</p>
              <p>I suppose Fatum was right - maybe you really don't have a licence yourself? You don't know that no moron can actually pass driving tests without having some measure of intelligence to understand the Highway Code?</p>
              <p>I've had drivers to thank for brilliantly navigating the mazes of Lim Chu Kang and Pasir Laba to help me evacuate no-duff casualties (yes, I'm a medic). No way am I calling the drivers dumb.</p>

              <p>Punishment has to be commensurate with the crime and the background of the offender.</p>
              <p>In my previous response to your first post to this thread, I had clearly shown the punishment for the importer of the smuggled contraband to be S$10,000 fine, a jail term of 5 years, or both.</p>
              <p>Is this "lad" the importer to deserve the 4 years jail time, and for being a first time offender ?</p>
              <p>Are you serious that this "lad" cannot be subjected to the influence of full-time criminals, when locked four to a cell ?</p>
              <p>Even in NUS, there are raggings to the newbies, what will await this "lad" in prison ?</p>
              <p>Just last month, there was a Parliamentary debate <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mha.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=MTUyMA%3D%3D-ByN2r3EintU%3D">'about a first timer being sodomised and bullied by his cell mates over a period of four months, and despite the designed safety system - the abuses were not detected until the first timer went to the medical unit to seek treatment'(*1). </a></p>
              <p>This is only the part of the first timer being a victim, what about first-timers being recruited for the future upon release - that surely will be the start of a long term social costs for Singaporeans to bear.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Authorities have been smart enough to separate the religious JI suspsects from the general prison population, so as to prevent the pollution of such Jihardist ideas in the prison.</p>
              <p>Somehow, they do not seem to realise that the other kind of indoctrination can and do take place to first timers.</p>
              <p>Do you think that this "lad" will not succumb to such criminal influence ?</p>

              <p>From your position as a Drama Queen accustomed to squatting on a fence - it is not surprisng that you will want to know what "personal responsibility" means to others.</p>
              <p>Can I help you to understand the phrase any differently from those who wish for less drama then you always desire to have ?</p>
              <p>Have you not been blaming everyone and everything for your actions ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been your acts of wilfull dishonesty to hold CSJ responsible for the decision of the general membership of SDP in throwing out Chiam See Tong - when this act is purely your own dramatic creation that you cannot accept responsibility in any dramatic way ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>sorry to sound blunt but you sound like the ambulance chasers in the US where they are too stupid to take personal responsibility for something as dumb spilling coffee on themselves without suing everyone for their own idiocy..</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ambulance chasers spilling coffee on themselves ? While chasing ambulances ?</p>
              <p>More drama from a Drama Queen ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>can the gabrament sue you for this guy's smuggling because, indirectly, your bleeding heart defence of irresponsible and criminal behaviour promotes their action because deep down inside their "dumb-looking minds" they feel they can get away with their crimes?</p>
              <p>hell! society is to blame right?</p>

              <p>You must remember that a sharp tongue is no indication of a keen mind.</p>
              <p>Surely you are not always so stupid, or is this thread a special occassion for you to be unable to read what has been clearly written ?</p>
              <p>Is it not in your characteristic ways of wilfull misinterpretation of events - (<em>a'la CSJ and CST and the SDP</em> ) - that you prefer to indulge so as to create more drama ?</p>
              <p>With the characteristic drama that is your hallmark, we can agree with your suggestion of society is always to be blame - afterall you insist on CSJ being responsible for CST departure from the SDP - even when the records show that CSJ was on hunger strike at his home, while the SDP held an EGM at their Party HQ where the general membership with the CEC voted to throw CST out of SDP.</p>
              <p>How straight is your arrow ?</p>

              <p>Are those the standard features of a person having Downs Syndrome ?</p>
              <p>Did I mention anywhere in any statement that "he is mentally impaired by reading a picture" ?</p>
              <p>This seems to be the skewed conclusion preferred from reading my following  simple statement printed on Page 1 of this thread:</p>
              <p><em>"You should step back and take a look at the photo placed by TS - is that an adult's face looking like anyone mature ?</em></p>
              <p><em>He looked like someone with a serious deficiency in judgment."</em></p>
              <p>Maturity and mental deficiency is a world apart - if you can grasp the meanings implied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is anyone denying the fact of the lad being caught red-handed ?</p>
              <p>Was there any ignorance involved or claimed in my statement ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Punishment has to be commensurate with the crime and the background of the offender.</p>
              <p>In my previous response to your first post to this thread, I had clearly shown the punishment for the importer of the smuggled contraband to be S$10,000 fine, a jail term of 5 years, or both.</p>
              <p>Is this "lad" the importer to deserve the 4 years jail time, and for being a first time offender ?</p>
              <p>Are you serious that this "lad" cannot be subjected to the influence of full-time criminals, when locked four to a cell ?</p>
              <p>Even in NUS, there are raggings to the newbies, what will await this "lad" in prison ?</p>
              <p>Just last month, there was a Parliamentary debate <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=5879">'about a first timer being sodomised and bullied by his cell mates over a period of four months, and despite the designed safety system - the abuses were not detected until the first timer went to the medical unit to seek treatment'(*1). </a></p>
              <p>This is only the part of the first timer being a victim, what about first-timers being recruited for the future upon release - that surely will be the start of a long term social costs for Singaporeans to bear.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Authorities have been smart enough to separate the religious JI suspsects from the general prison population, so as to prevent the pollution of such Jihardist ideas in the prison.</p>
              <p>Somehow, they do not seem to realise that the other kind of indoctrination can and do take place to first timers.</p>
              <p>Do you think that this "lad" will not succumb to such criminal influence ?</p>

              <p>I'll take back what I said about the mental deficiency part. Still, how do you read that he isn't mature enough to make decisions like a person of majority age, or that he should've been in Boys' Town, just by looking at a photo?</p>
              <p>The punishment is commesurate - he showed brazeness by indenting a larger vehicle for the job, accepted gifts, led the other 2 chaps and facilitated a security breach. Are you more concerned about what happens to him in prison? Then you should be advocating that he be separated from violent criminals. Then again, who says "white collar criminals" can't recruit among themselves or abuse him?</p>

              <p>Thank you for your correction.</p>
              <p>Did you miss out on my quote from Prof S. Jayakumar, which I posted on 29 Aug '09 4.00PM - Page 2 of this thread ?</p>
              <p>For your benefit I will repeat it here:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://notesapp.internet.gov.sg/__48256DF20015A167.nsf/LookupContentDocsByKey/GOVI-6YWCSH?OpenDocument">‘(31)The age of majority in Singapore is actually not defined by statute. It is defined by common law which sets it at 21 year. (35)The point I want to make is there is no single threshold age for all purposes. I guess it is because you cannot say that adulthood is gained overnight on a fixed birthday whether it is 21 or earlier. Rather, it is through a gradual process.’ (*2) </a></p>
              <p>How did you refer him as a "lad" in your reply at 12.51PM of this date ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, from his boyish face had been noticed by you.</p>
              <p>The fact that he was stupid enough with his judgment that landed him into hot soup clearly showed that Prof S. Jayakumar was correct - that adulthood could not possibly arrived into the mind of this "lad" just because he passed a fixed birthday.</p>

              <p>There is no dispute to your observation, and you are correct with your views that he should be separated from violent criminals - so that the longer term social cost to Singapore will be looked into now.</p>
              <p>Can anyone insulate him permanently ?</p>
              <p>The least we can do for ourselves is to ensure that while in prison, this "lad" should not come under any influence from the more mature criminals.</p>

              <p>So the drama is now about NATIONAL SECURITY and creating a DIPLOMATIC incident by a Lance Corporal who is seen by others as no more then a "lad' ?</p>
              <p>Your mind must have been over fertilzed to come up with so much drama that certainly suit your recall of Bollywood.</p>
              <p>Was there any dispute about the crime, or were you objecting to the fact that a claim was made that the sentence does not fit the offense ?</p>
              <p>Coming from the Drama Queen of Speaker's Corner - with an inability to take events with honesty and responsibility - what value is there with the verbage that you have woven with so much drama ?</p>
              <p>The main drama has been skewed by you in all accounts - when the fact are clear that you have thrown the book at CSJ and the SDP simply to protect the dishonorable CST determined to protect the PAP instead of his own Assistant-Secretary General who had been maligned by a PAP stalwart with false charges.</p>
