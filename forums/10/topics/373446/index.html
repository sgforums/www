              <p>A FORMER full-time national serviceman, who helped foreign navy personnel smuggle duty-unpaid cigarettes out of Changi Naval Base, was given a stiff jail term on Wednesday. Ee Jin Liang, 23, who was a lance corporal and military driver, appeared stunned after a judge meted out a prison sentence of <strong>four years and five months</strong>.<br><br><strong>Explaining the tough sentence given to the first-time offender</strong>, Senior District Judge Tan Siong Thye said a deterrent sentence was clearly called for as Ee had assisted foreign personnel to circumvent the security precautions at a military installation on five occasions.<br><br>He said: 'If not deterred, some other national serviceman could be bribed to look the other way...We can ill-afford such security compromise in today's context, as terrorism is very real and terrorists will exploit security lapses and cause massive public mayhem and destruction of human lives and property.'<br><br>The judge also pointed out that the amount of contraband involved was one of the highest to come before the courts: The excise duty and goods and services tax unpaid on the cigarettes exceeded $3 million.<br><br>Besides Ee, who pleaded guilty last week and has been in military detention since his arrest, two other former military drivers were also involved: Ang Zi Heng, 22, who was a lance corporal, was jailed for a year and four months in March on one count of corruption; and Adrian Tan, 23, who was also a lance corporal, is awaiting trial.<br><br>During Ee's trial last week, the court heard that meetings between representatives of the Singapore and Indonesian navies are held every month, with the two navies taking turns to host these meetings. When meetings are held at Changi Naval Base, drivers like Ee are assigned to ferry the Indonesians.<br><br>In August last year, an Indonesian officer asked Ee if it was safe to take contraband cigarettes out of the base. Ee replied that he did not know, but allowed the Indonesians to load the cigarettes onto the minibus that he and Ang took turns to drive.<br><br>The pair went on to make five or six trips to a carpark outside the base, where the contraband was loaded onto lorries. For their work, Ee and Ang were given 20 cartons of cigarettes.<br><br>Two months later, Ee repeated the favour. As the minibus was too small, he obtained a larger vehicle and made three trips to transport the contraband out of the base. That time, he received a chest of tea in addition to 20 cartons of cigarettes.<br><br>The smuggling operation went up in smoke last December, when Customs officers intercepted two lorries loaded with the smuggled cigarettes and caught Ee while his vehicle was being loaded with contraband at the wharf. Investigations revealed that the Indonesians were in cahoots with a syndicate that sold the cigarettes here.<br><br>Sinkies are forced to perform Full time NS at a young age of 16-18. They train hard, force to become a killing machine but not taught soft skills, matters of heart - Corruption is a Crime but robbing one's innocent mind is Also a Crime!<br><br>Look at this one, he is just a Boy!</p>

              <p>Intergity and morals is taught by parents and school... And although he looks young, he's still 23... Old enough to know wat's wrong and wat's not... Dun quite involve the NS...</p>
              <p>So let's say he didnt corrupt and smuggle ciggies but instead murder, rape, rob ppl... Can we say it's not his fault becoz NS dun teach them abt not to do those?</p>
              <p>And the part where the indos ask him whether <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">it is safe</span></span></strong> already implies it's not OK... If given a half-half answer like "I dun know" means innocent then ppl smuggle drugs can just say "I dun know" too...</p>

              <p>Firstly, my apologies to both for making a single joint reply to the different responses, but will respond separately when necessary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are both correct in that the Lance-Corporal is an adult at age 22 at the time when the crime was committed.</p>
              <p>How many of us at that age truly thought of ourselves as an adult ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps at the present time looking back into the mirror, we have forgotten how we looked like at age 22.</p>
              <p>You should step back and take a look at the photo placed by TS - is that an adult's face looking like anyone mature ?</p>
              <p>He looked like someone with a serious deficiency in judgment.</p>
              <p>Yes, it was too bad that he made a mistake and deserve to be punished for the offense committed.</p>
              <p>What was the gravity of the crime that was committed to warrant such a sentence for a first time offender ?</p>
              <p>At its very worst, the crime was serious in that he had co-operated with foreign military personnels to breach military security and had undermined Singapore's Revenue Collection efforts.</p>
              <p>Yes, the incarceration will cost the State resources to keep him for the duration in prison and the efforts to re-educate him if such program exist.</p>
              <p>Are there no longer term implications for Singapore - if the sentence make this "boy" into a potential hardened criminal ?</p>
              <p>Being a first time offender, incarcerating this "kid" in the company of more hardened criminals can only result in long term social costs for Singapore, if this "kid" should come under their influence to hit back at society for the injustice that maybe felt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are a few options available to "punish" the Indonesians - without the need to let the war-mongering imagination of a child become a real nightmare to the adults.</p>
              <p>Impounding the Naval Warship for the duration of the investigation would have been the first option. It has been done before by other countries, with China and North Korea - facing down a mightier US Naval Force - when they had separately impounded US Naval Warships that trespassed their respective sovereignty.</p>
              <p>Other commercial vessels would have been impounded and even confiscated if the Captain and the crew were found to be involved with the conspiracy.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian naval personnels should have been arrested for the contraband being brought onto our sovereign soil, and considering that the Indonesian naval personnels were already on Singapore soil and not on their naval vessel when the SAF truck was stopped by the Singapore Customs Officials.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian naval personnels should have been prosecuted in Singapore for an act that had contravened Singapore Laws on smuggling contraband.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Singapore Authorities preferred to take a softer approach by dealing with this "incident" in the most diplomatic manner, but allowing the Captain of the Indonesian naval vessel to deal with his crew members, and at the same time sending a diplomatic note to the Indonesian Government concerning the incident.</p>

              vessel to deal with his crew members, and at the same time sending
              a diplomatic note to the Indonesian Government concerning the
              incident.</p>

              <p>wow ! ... so are you saying that he looks dumb, and so he must be ? .... you can tell all that from a picture ? .... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">. </p>
              <p>Actually, he does not look intellectually subnormal to me, ... he can't help how he looks of course, you may want to take it up with his parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so, to you, what is the threshold ? How smart does a person has to be, before you'd consider him fit to be responsible for his own actions, and fit to be punished for the crimes he's committed ? ... does he have to be freaking einstein ? At what age, and at what level of cognitive ability, did personal responsibility begin for you, since you didn't feel like an adult at 22 ?</p>
              <p>You said so yourself, and I quote "<strong>At its very worst, the crime was serious in that he had
                                      co-operated with foreign military personnels to breach military
                                      security</strong>" How is that not a serious offense, pray tell.</p>
              <p>And it gets funnier .... so ..... you really want to impound a warship of a neighbouring country ? ..... That's powerful stuff you've been smoking, where did you get it ? .... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p>but hey, I guess that's enough for a saturday morning .... cos the bear's said it all ....</p>

              <p>I was 22 just four years ago.</p>
              <p>At that age, I was in my second year of undergraduate studies. I looked like a student, I felt like a student, and I was indeed a student. However, at that age, I also knew that if I were to commit a crime, I would be tried as an adult no matter what.</p>
              <p>I'm 26 now, and I'm still a student. Can I be tried as a juvenile if I were to commit a crime?</p>
              <p>So, let me get this straight - he looks young and he feels young, he should be tried as a young person? So if Leonardo diCaprio or Christiano Ronaldo were to commit a crime, we should treat them as juveniles? They look so baby-faced!</p>
              <p>If you tell me that a psychiatrist had certified him to be mentally challenged, I might still sympathise with him. But the bottom line is, he's a full-grown adult who has to take responsibility for his own actions. If he can't even understand that till now, then that's not the problem of the law.</p>
              <p>If you don't set the lower bar for adulthood at 21, where do you want to set it then - 35?</p>
