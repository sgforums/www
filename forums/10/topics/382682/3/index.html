              <p>If you want a discussion, it has to be stated as "Lets discuss whether our political system is screwed up" not to "discuss ABOUT our screwed up political system." You have stated the discussion is ABOUT our screwed up political system. That is already asking people to discuss about a conclusion that you have reached and not asking them to reach their own conclusions through a discussion. Maybe you are really actively doing something about these agendas in reality but I am always interested in a discussion on neutral grounds but doesnt care about entering into a discussion with parties who have already determined the conclusions they are seeking. Hope you have a fulfilling life fighting battles online. Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>Since when did I put up a topic for discussion "discuss ABOUT our screwed up political system", you have to understand the difference between a statement and a topic of discussion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I said PAP's political system is screwed up, it's a statement not a topic, if you have a valid point to debunk my statement then go ahead. But you seem to think that my statement is correct because the discussion is a forgone conclusion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Neutral grounds? Whatever you are smoking must be very good. There are always 2 sides to a discussion, that's where you see whether your points are really valid. You are asking for a neutral party to speak with you a bias party? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No conclusion has been reached unless you yourself has reached the conclusion on your own from the start. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So......You think that raising the HDB property tax is also a move by the government to help the poor to own property? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Oh another thing about discussion. We do not say things like "what are you smoking" or things that focuses on the person rather than the topic being discussed. Doesnt add value and doesnt reflect a discussion. But of cos of cos, maybe here in a forum, rules for a discussion is different from what is in reality.</p>
              <p><strong>"Don't Singaporeans have a right to discuss openly about
                                          our screwed up political system." </strong></p>
              <p>that was what you said. That you want to have a right to DISCUSS ABOUT our screwed up political system. Unless now you want to tell me that you are just saying other Singaporeans and you are not referring to yourself when you use SINGAPOREAN in this case.</p>
              <p>As for raising the property tax, if you really want my opinions, the move to raise the property tax and then give us a rebate does not make a lot of sense. Although people will appreciate the rebate, we do note that the rebate is one off, it is not gonna be every year, and no doubt after next year, that increase will be an additional burden to people especially those in the middle class. the argument that people are gaining more through sales of HDB thats why they should pay more tax only reflects one side of the story. Unfortunately, unless you do not buy another apartment, the gains in selling will be lost to the higher costs in buying another apartment.</p>

              <p><br>I thought that your sentences were the result of hallucinations caused by substance abuse. Your statements certainly didn't look like it's logical to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So is <strong>"Don't Singaporeans have a right to discuss openly about our screwed up political system.", </strong>the topic here or a statement?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I guess those ST forums where folks post, "Singapore has the best government in the world" is not subject to debates by the other parties? It's also like what you claim, a forgone conclusion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A conclusion is forgone if at the onset of the argument you anticipate an inevitable end. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It is not a surprise for Rear Admiral (NS) Lui Tuck Yew to "talk cock and sing song" - to claim that it is better to "increase tax now then increase in the future when HDB prices gets higher, and need a higher property tax".</p>
              <p>If current property tax is 5% on a unit that is valued at $100,000 - the government will be collecting $5,000 in Property Tax today.</p>
              <p>If the property tax remains at 5% on a unit that increases in value to $160,000 in the future, the Government will collect a HIGHER tax of $8,000 in Property Tax - without increasing the tax rate.</p>
              <p>With the present property valued at $100,000 and the Government increasing the tax rate from 5% to 7% now, it will be effectively collecting $7000 in Property Tax - which is $2000 more.</p>
              <p>When the property price increase to $160,000 in the future, the Government will be collecting $11,200 - which is $3,200 more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the typically PAP talk about the obvious, it will simply push the talk to its most basic and simplistic idiocy that takes the sting out of their scheme.</p>
              <p>By increasing the tax rate today, the government need not make a big jump and will effectively split the tax increase into two instalments at 2% now, and another 2% in the future - which means the Government is determined to increase the same total amount anyway by making it more easily acceptable.</p>
              <p>Can it be acceptable at a time  when jobs are few, unemployed still looking for an employer that will employ him over a foreigner, and at a time when the economy is said to be turning upwards with so much uncertainty still hovering over the horizon ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note: the 2% is only a number used for purpose of discussion - and the Government may use a bigger or smaller number.</p>
