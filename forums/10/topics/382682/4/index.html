              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br>I thought that your sentences were the result of hallucinations caused by substance abuse. Your statements certainly didn't look like it's logical to me. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well you thought wrongly then.</span></strong> <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The alternative is much worse than substance abuse, I leave that to your imagination.</strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">You must be an idiot!!! LOL</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So is <strong>"Don't Singaporeans have a right to discuss openly about our screwed up political system.",</strong> the topic here or a statement?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">You are asking me whether Singaporeans have a right to discuss about the screwed up political system so it can only mean that there is a discussion abt the screwed up political system right? If not, why the need to ask me that question?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">You still have problems distinguishing a statement from a topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Also if you look at my original statement enclosed below, it wasn't even a question, it was a rhetorical question, one that does not require an answer. I didn't even put a question mark to it.</span></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One also has to question why you are asking folks to stop discussions about anything negative about PAP.</span> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Don't Singaporeans have a right to discuss openly about our screwed up political system.</span></strong> <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I guess those ST forums where folks post, "Singapore has the best government in the world" is not subject to debates by the other parties? It's also like what you claim, a forgone conclusion.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If they put down a discussion and the topic is "SINGAPORE has the best government in the world." Then that is not a discussion. That is also looking for agreement with a preconceived conclusion. I would prefer that it is stated that the topic would be "Do Singapore has the best government in the world." </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">A statement if it's not substantiated by facts can always be refuted, like the example I cited about 10 + 10 = 100. So if I make that statement does it mean that it's a conclusion that cannot be challenged?</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">If you don't have the facts to deny my statement, then obviously you chose the easy way out and said that it's a foregone conclusion and you are still clueless what is a foregone conclusion.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A conclusion is forgone if at the onset of the argument you anticipate an inevitable end. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Its either that or in a discussion, the parties involved insist that their conclusion is right. And that is what I am seeing here. Everyone comes in and says "the government sucks" and insist he or she is right and that everyone must see the same way as them or else risks being branded "lackeys", "dogs" etc. Vice versa for people who insists PAP are the best government in the world. I did not insist on either conclusion. I am only insisting on a discussion that highlights the bads and goods of the government fairly. A good discussion involves the agreement to disagree and if everyone agrees to disagrees, there would be name calling which unfortunately I see alot in this forum. Not necessarily you, but there are many.</strong></span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I said the government sucks and substantiated it with proof of their doings. They are always squeezing out more tax dollars from the poor and middle class. You agree that their policy sucks too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Apart from that, they also deprive Singaporeans of their rightful wages by importing cheap foreign talents, so that they could compete with China and India for cost. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>How can this even happen as Singapore's cost structure is much higher than those countries? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></strong></span></p>
              <p>The effects of the substances must be wearing off, I see you agreeing with me that it's a scewed up political system. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Me agreeing that the tax rebates doesnt make sense doesnt constitute me agreeing that the political system is screwed. Again that is a conclusion you choose to see. I am perfectly fine with that. Because I am not in the business to make people agree with me. I just love a discussion. If I am right, fine. If I am wrong, fine also. And again as said, resorting to implying people using and abusing substances just because their views do not tally with yours is what you will do in a discussion? And if you are going to say, you thought that I am using substances, then as i said earlier, you thought wrongly.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then the political system must be superb. One that has no accountability, one that is based on nepotism (appointing friend and family members to GICs and GLCs), one that deprives citizens from their fundamental rights, one that over taxes her citizens so that they can show a good reserve. Can you refute all these points I made? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></strong></span></p>

              <p>Take it that I cant because I am not interested to refute anyone's opinion. I am only interested to discuss. And to discuss does not mean to refute anyone and prove anyone wrong. A discussion doesnt necessary have to come to a point where one party must be right and one party must be wrong. If that is what you seek, then sorry, take it that I cant. Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>I never wanted to do that. My only point is that a discussion should start with a neutral statement. And I do not think I have mentioned anywhere that I think we have a brilliant government nor do i think they are a sucky government. If you think they are sucky, fine. i respect that opinion. But to me in a discussion, there must be a balance. If every discussion starts, with lets discuss how sucky the government is, what kind of discussion is that? It is just inviting more people to contribute flaming statements without any substance. I can see there are people in this forum who are able to sustantiate their claims whether they think the government is sucky or not but we have even more people who come in and say, "ya they suck and you dogs stop sucking their balls" or something along those lines, what kind of discussion is that?</p>
              <p> And lastly as I always maintained, a discussion is a discussion. I do not resort to imply that the person is using substance/is a moron/is a lackey etc unless you are telling me that personal attacks are acceptable rules of a discussion.</p>
              <p>Hope you get what I am trying to say. Not everyone who doesnt agree with you is a lackey of PAP or incoherent. But again if you choose to maintain that sort of stance, then its your choice.</p>

              <p>blame it for micro managing the people in the first place under the earlier regime. now the people are getting sick and tired of being managed and they are now fighting back, even if the policies are good and effective. they are just fedup with all the ERP, CBD charges and more.</p>
