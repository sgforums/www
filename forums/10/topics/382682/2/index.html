              <p>I dont get this...</p>
              <p>Let's say we 'bought' a 4-room flat for $250k. Every month we will pay thru CPF around $700 for around 30 years. That should already cover all expenses and costs in building the flat during the time it was built.</p>
              <p>So, how can they charge us again if the property price go up? Its not as if HDB will have to pay contractor for the increase in prices.</p>
              <p>It as though you are paying for your lcd tv installment for 48 months (from Courts eg) and 13 months later Courts called you up and say you have to pay another $50 fee because the price of lcd tv go up.</p>

              <p>Why can't opposition get their act together?</p>
              <p>It comes from the decades of fear politics created by LKY, that's why in the past the opposition lacks qualified candidates.</p>

              <p>It's kind of contradictory, because society works based models conceived by politicians, if you want changes in your life, you first need to change the government. You say you work, your working environment has been drastically changed by the PAP government from their import of cheaper foreign labour. The HDB you live in, it has gone up dramatically the past 5 years. Why is this so? PAP's policy of mass spamming Singapore with more cheap foreign talents to compete for you with for housing?</p>

              <p>Ok apologies for calling it "bashing". Whatever it is, let me know when it works. I will not deny that there are people who are willing to stand up for this and actually do something and make things happen. Let me know too if you are one of those who are trying to actually do something in real life, I will support you. But most people, my opinion is, change what you can change. Influence those you can influence. There are many things that you may be concerned about, like rising costs but these may be things you are not able to change. So change those things you can and leave those other things to people who can do those things better.</p>

              <p>Remember when they first implemented GST or increase the rates, they always give you rebates, so you think you are actually benefiting or breaking even from it. But after 1-2 years they remove the rebates, but you have already gotten used to the GST and forgotten about the rebates you used to receive.</p>

              <p>When I say Mr. A is bad, but you think Mr. A is good, we bring up points to support our arguments. When I say Mr. A is bad, you think it's a forgone conclusion, then you obviously lack valid points and agree with my statement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If I say it's a screwed up political system, you think otherwise, we can discuss our points. But you seem to think it's a forgone conclusion. So what more can I say? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Not looking for folks to agree with me, but looking for facts and truth, something which they have denied all Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I am all for folks speaking up, unlike you trying to silence everybody. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If you want a discussion, it has to be stated as "Lets discuss whether our political system is screwed up" not to "discuss ABOUT our screwed up political system." You have stated the discussion is ABOUT our screwed up political system. That is already asking people to discuss about a conclusion that you have reached and not asking them to reach their own conclusions through a discussion. Maybe you are really actively doing something about these agendas in reality but I am always interested in a discussion on neutral grounds but doesnt care about entering into a discussion with parties who have already determined the conclusions they are seeking. Hope you have a fulfilling life fighting battles online. Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p></div>
