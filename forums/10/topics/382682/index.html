              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Acting Minister for Information, Communication and Arts Rear-Admiral Lui Tuck Yew said that the property tax of HDB flats is being raised next year partly to avoid having to introduce a bigger increase later should home prices continue to rise.</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p><em>“The problem is, the longer you defer it, the larger the increase will be…if HDB prices continue to go up.”</em></p>
              <p>The property tax rate is 10 per cent of a property’s annual value which has increased with rising property prices.</p>
              <p>HDB resale prices have risen a hefty 31.2per cent in the past two years and hit a record high in June this year.</p>
              <p>The sky-rocketing prices are attributed partly to cash-rich PRs entering the resale market.</p>
              <p>According to real estate agency ERA, 40 per cent of the buyers of resale flats are PRs.</p>
              <p>An Indonesian PR forked out a record $653,000 for a 4-room HDB flat in Queenstown lately while he could well afford a similar-sized condominium in the suburbs.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui also repeated the official view that Singaporeans will stand to gain from the rising value of their HDB flats.</p>
              <p><em>“If they eventually need to sell…(it) releases more money for their old age,” he said.</em></p>
              <p>However, Mr Lui did not elaborate further on where the homeowners will stay if they sell their flats in such an inflationary market. They will probably have to fork out more to buy another flat.</p>
              <p>More than 85 per cent of the population live in public housing built by the government agency HDB. However, these are 99-year old leasehold flats whose sale and resale are subjected to a variety of conditions such as a minimum 5 year occupation period.</p>
              <p>Government leaders and HDB officials have insisted that the rising prices of flats helps to “create wealth” for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>This prevailing misconception has been debunked by a research done by two NUS professors NUS professors Abeysinghe and Gu Jiaying showed clearly that “higher property prices, instead of creating a wealth effect, exert a significant and negative “price effect” on consumption expenditures leading to a fall in the average propensity to consume.” (read article <a href="http://temasekreview.com/2009/09/03/debunking-the-hdb-myths-part-3-rising-prices-of-hdb-flats-generate-wealth-for-singaporeans/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>As house prices go up, the increase in the value of housing assets is accompanied by a concurrent rise in the financial liabilities of households, in the form of higher downpayments for purchase of residential properties and burgeoning housing loans.</p>

              <p>They always LPPL strategy, give you property tax rebates then raise property tax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The other time also, give property tax rebates but raise net annual value of property, ended up paying more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's like initially the price of the product is $100, then they say give you discount of $10, before they give you the discount, they increase the price to $130.</p>
              <p>You end up paying more despite the discount. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i don think it cretes wealth, Firstly HDB expects us to stay in our homes once we bought it. THen sell off now due to what? PRs?</p>
              <p>Firstly the flawed market pricing approach by HDB also raises the price of new flats..</p>
              <p>2ndly the ease of gaining citizenship here will convert more PRs to locals and they will scheme to buy new flats... As they are cash rich, they will get the flat compared to singaporean...So where does our locals go too?</p>
              <p>then we live where?</p>

              <p>They must be voted out in next elections.</p>
              <p>There are still many people who have the mental block about PAP, cannot take the next step to end PAP rule.</p>
              <p>This type of mentality must change.</p>

              <p>I think the PAP guys are really not looking into the welfare of the country anymore. Yes, we have grown richer in assets, but are we really rich? Many house owners have assets which are worth more than 500k, but how many of them can actually spend without worrying?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we have this same 500k at Thailand, Taiwan, Australia, we will be so rich and can spend without much worry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what is the point of us being so asset-rich?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually the PAP knows this fact. This is an old trick that they have been using since 1970s. Dangle a carrot to make us work harder and harder and harder. By making our house prices out of reach for the new generations, and forcing them to take 30 years housing loan, it is essentially asking them to sign a 30 years contract agreement with the government to work for the rest of your life. The PAP understands this strategy very well; where do you think all the scholars brain cells go into?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember Mr Lim - the NTUC chairman - says this in a recent article "We need to be cheaper, faster and better." Anyone can guess what this means to Singaporeans.</p>

              <p><br>As i said, we dun need someone to tell us about our govt, if he dun likes it, changi is open 24hrs. You can go ahead to spend your 500k in taiwan or Aust, that aint a problem for us here. They got homeless, and almost everyone of us have home, think about it. Property up will make those rich pay more, how much is your 5 rooms HDB tax compare to a bungalow of 20millions.</p>
              <p>Even if PAP dangled a carrot, throughout the whole 50 years of national building, they are still in full control of the Govt, so the question is that you, as citizen of singapore should ask yourself, aint you lucky boy. Afterall, you get educated, have a job and a roof on top of you happily posting with not much worry about tomorrow. Credit should go to yourself and PAP, and yet  you turn around and make a joke out of PAP who nurtured you as what it is today, aint you ashame of yourself.</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Acting Minister for Information, Communication and Arts Rear-Admiral Lui Tuck Yew said that the property tax of HDB flats is being raised next year partly to avoid having to introduce a bigger increase later should home prices continue to rise.</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p><em>“The problem is, the longer you defer it, the larger the increase will be…if HDB prices continue to go up.”</em></p>
              <p>The property tax rate is 10 per cent of a property’s annual value which has increased with rising property prices.</p>
              <p>HDB resale prices have risen a hefty 31.2per cent in the past two years and hit a record high in June this year.</p>
              <p>The sky-rocketing prices are attributed partly to cash-rich PRs entering the resale market.</p>
              <p>According to real estate agency ERA, 40 per cent of the buyers of resale flats are PRs.</p>
              <p>An Indonesian PR forked out a record $653,000 for a 4-room HDB flat in Queenstown lately while he could well afford a similar-sized condominium in the suburbs.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui also repeated the official view that Singaporeans will stand to gain from the rising value of their HDB flats.</p>
              <p><em>“If they eventually need to sell…(it) releases more money for their old age,” he said.</em></p>
              <p>However, Mr Lui did not elaborate further on where the homeowners will stay if they sell their flats in such an inflationary market. They will probably have to fork out more to buy another flat.</p>
              <p>More than 85 per cent of the population live in public housing built by the government agency HDB. However, these are 99-year old leasehold flats whose sale and resale are subjected to a variety of conditions such as a minimum 5 year occupation period.</p>
              <p>Government leaders and HDB officials have insisted that the rising prices of flats helps to “create wealth” for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>This prevailing misconception has been debunked by a research done by two NUS professors NUS professors Abeysinghe and Gu Jiaying showed clearly that “higher property prices, instead of creating a wealth effect, exert a significant and negative “price effect” on consumption expenditures leading to a fall in the average propensity to consume.” (read article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://temasekreview.com/2009/09/03/debunking-the-hdb-myths-part-3-rising-prices-of-hdb-flats-generate-wealth-for-singaporeans/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>As house prices go up, the increase in the value of housing assets is accompanied by a concurrent rise in the financial liabilities of households, in the form of higher downpayments for purchase of residential properties and burgeoning housing loans.</p>

              <p>The property tax is something that affects the middle-class the most. The rich and elites are not that affected. The rich and elites have much more equlity compared to the middle-class. Remember that the property constitute a huge majority of the middle-class - probably 50% or more, while the property only constitute a small majority of the richs and elites because these guys invest in stocks and companies, etc.</p>

              <p>Yes you are right, our homeless rates are lower than many countries, but it does not mean that we have no homeless. Our govt is so damned rich, GIC is one of the biggest fund in the world, when we are such a small country. We are doing very well, and the govt is doing a very good job at that. But isn't it also time for the govt to lessen our load rather than spending so much time focusing on making us better, faster and cheaper?</p>

              <p>As long as PAP continues to win easy victories in elections, there won't be pressure on them to change their fucking policies.</p>
              <p>If 66.6%, 70%, 80% vote for them they won't feel there is a need for change.</p>
              <p>Only when they suffer a defeat will they reflect on their rubbish policies.</p>
