            <div class='col-md body'>When our ancestors came here, the environment was totally different from what it is today.  The population was small, opportunities aplenty and the place was just opening up.  They built this place. It's not the same now.  Jobs are increasingly more difficult to come by and the pie is not getting bigger, at least not fast enough. That's why we can't have the FTs nibbling at it and straining our infrastructure as well.  If their "talent" are needed here, fine, let them work here. Give them work permits or whatever but not citizenship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Concepts and assumptions are concepts and assumptions. Usually they are unproven or untruths. It will be worse it such assumptions are just excuses for government to shift their responsibility to look after its own citizens.<br><br>It is certainly not good corporate governance to govern a country based on some wild assumptions which run contrary to our basic social fabric like loyalty of government to citizens begets loyality of citizens to the nation.<br><br>If we need a few Foreign talents here and there for certain specialist areas of works and professions, just confine the permits and privileges specifically for such categories but not across the board or let employers choose freely among the cheapest labor force in the world.<br><br>People stick out the neck for their government doing NS and paying certain high fees and taxes and chipping in in bad time to forego certain CPF to employers. So why should people's interest be taken so lightly on some unproven assumption that all  foreign talents will be talents and allow employers to take them as they like across the board.<br><br>Due to lack of accountability to the people over the past 40 years many policies were formulated based on such unproven assumption resulting in high costs of living which cause our loss of economic competitiveness and many problems as posted to the feedback unit.<br><br>Today, there is a tendency to govern the whole nation by assumptions of all kind, including lately the assumption that pro-PAP ward will object to upgrading for Potong Pasir or Hougang wards according to objective schedule.<br><br>Assumptions about contribution of foreign talents is too general and sweeping. It is right for citizens to stand their ground and desist from being over-whelmed by such highly risky and fallacious assumptions which tend to excuse the government of problems and inefficiencies.<br><br>Leaders should be held accountable to all such assumptions as otherwise we may just one day lose all the jobs and opportunities to more foreigners without even foreigners contributing anything to the economy or job creations as assumed.<br><br>We might end up foreigners taking us for a ride and leaving us at the next downturn for their own country of origin.<br><br>Why work on assumptions over such matter as citizens loyalty and government's duty to preserve jobs and opportunities for their own citizens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is very simple. Our rules regarding citizenship for FT should mirror those of the countries the FT come from.<br><br>Meaning, if their country welcomes Singaporeans, then we should welcome their citizens. If their country have strict policies against emigration, we should apply the same to their citizens seeking to come here.<br><br>I am sick of seeing so many foreigners here from countries that make it near impossible for us Singaporeans to work/live in, even when we are more than qualified.</div>

The Singaporean company just basically told one girl  (my friend) that Immigration will give 6 month temp visa to find a job in Singapore about a year ago . She got it and went to Singapore to work.<br><br>That boggles me  on the purpose of a foreign talent policy . If we are to look for people with talent and experience - why pick up fresh foreign graduates without experience? And this girl's pay is higher than what most singaporean overseas graduates would be paid.  So that defeats the purpose of lowering wages.<br><br>Why train a foreigner  when your local graduates require the work experience and then open the doors to foreigners claiming there are no experienced singaporeans ? Isn't that a revolving door syndrome ? Anyone care to explain?</div>

Not because we are anti-immigrant, but they have to show that they can add value to the economy in more ways than mere wage competitiveness. We cannot always base our economy on wage differential, because that is not one major push for innovation or any emphasis on skill elevation.<br><br>NUS has many foreign students who drop out after 1 or 2 years.Do they learn much? Are they diffusing their knowledge or hard work to us? I've not seen much, save for a few exceptions.Some of them are beggingly pathetic at their studies that they resort to leeching and etc.<br><br>Simply put, they should stop paying lip service to entrance prerequisites and TOEFL  requirements.I'm but a student and a layman, but the impression that ITE students may have better academic qualities than at least half of the foreign students that are on campus, is very strong.<br><br>Talent has to be well-defined according to needs.Why open the dam when you don't have a sieve? You'd only spend extra effort cleaning up the reservoir, and it neutralises any theoretical advantage balanced immigration brings. If they can contribute in areas we cannot, they will make it big naturally. Why be the welfare agency for mediocrity when we have students here who struggle to pay their fees.<br><br>Halt the banal talk on wages, it's getting tiring.It's time to show why citizenship is supposed to be more valued than mere residency.You want to build a cohesive nation, make sure the balance is well-kept, and not unduly skewed.<br><br>The process of making Singapore Inc a versatile nation, is not easy.So don't make it harder by choosing to ignore the harsh reality that uncontrolled input into globalisation is not always the best way to go.In the end, you may gain a cheaper workforce, but not a cohesive society because you only appease the lowest common denominator.<br><br>Move beyond this labor argument and seek to develop our heartware, our tertiary and academia.</div>
