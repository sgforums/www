The problems will continue," he told Bernama when asked to explain why Malaysia did not just build the bridge in its own territory without negotiating with Singapore.<br><br>Speaking at a news conference earlier after visiting the Ministry of Rural and Regional Development here, Abdullah said the Cabinet made the decision to scrap the project after considering the sentiments and wishes of Malaysians who opposed the project being linked by Singapore to the sale of sand to the republic and the use of Malaysia's air space by its military.<br><br>"If we proceed with the project, it will upset the people and turn the project into an endless issue," he said.<br><br>He said Malaysia was not pressured by Singapore or anybody to make the decision.<br><br>"In fact, we made our decision on our own. It is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">political decision</span>. </span><span style="color: red;">Singapore did not even know about our decision</span>. <span style="color: darkblue;">We take into <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consideration the feel</span>ings of the people.<br><br>"We can't ignore the feelings of the people because we are the government elected by the people, for the people," he said.<br><br>The Prime Minister said the newly built Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex would not turn into a "white elephant" as it still could be used with the construction of roads linking the causeway to the complex.<br><br>He said new roads would be built to divert traffic to the CIQ complex before heading to the causeway.<br><br>The half-bridge or "scenic bridge", estimated to cost RM620 million, was to be built on the Malaysian side of the Tebrau Strait.<br><br>The bridge was meant to form part of the RM2.5 billion Integrated Southern Gateway project to turn Johor into a regional logistics centre connected by a network of ports, an airport and highways.<br><br>Work began in early 2003 but was halted in February 2004 to enable negotiations to proceed with Singapore to build a straight bridge to replace the 80-year-old causeway.<br><br>However, the talks stalled because Singapore set two conditions -- the sale of sand to the republic and the use of Malaysian air space by its air force -- to be agreed to by Malaysia before the republic gave its consent to the bridge plan.<br><br>Last January, the government gave the go-ahead to resume work to build the bridge and targeted it for completion in the second quarter of 2009.<br><br>The decision drew objections from Singapore.<br><br>In his announcement today, Abdullah said the government had stopped all negotiations with Singapore pertaining to the bridge, thus the issue of the sale of sand and the use of Malaysian air space did not arise any more.<br><br>He said Malaysia's decision on the bridge would not affect bilateral relations with Singapore, which were normal, but future discussions on outstanding issues between the two countries would not include bridge, sand or air space matters.<br><br>One of the outstanding issues is the continued sale of water from Malaysia to the republic.<br><br>Abdullah said Malaysia-Singapore relations would continue as they did not depend on the bridge alone, adding that their relationship was not an issue.<br><br>He also said the government would </span><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">compensate about RM100 million </span></span><span style="color: darkblue;">to Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd, the bridge contractor, for scrapping the project.</span>-- BERNAMA<br><br></div>

Esp since both govts agreed NOT TO SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC (read terms &amp; conditions of the talks) prior to any mutual agreement, how come 'news' of this 'exchange' was leaked (to the common people)?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  As I suspected, news of this swap was covertly 'leaked' by non-ther than Syed Hamid himself!  It was perhaps, I suspected, an attempt by the M'sian govt <span style="color: red;">to 'cushion' and to preemptive any major uproar on the ground</span> PRIOR to the official announcement (in the event of a breakthrough of the talks).  Whereas the hoohah announcement that the M'sian govt has given the green light to the contractor to proceed with the construction was, I suspected, a sort of brinkmanship event that is to 'pressure' Singapore to agree quickly and if the talks fail, it will create the impression to the M'sia people that as it was Singapore's 'stubborness' thaty contibuted to the failed talks.<br><br><blockquote>..."We can't ignore the feelings of the people because we are the government elected by the people, for the people," he said...</blockquote>PLEASSEEEE........don't emulate JFK famous speech here!  When have you given much talk to ' we can't ignore the feelings of the people' over this issue?  Imagine,<strong> IF </strong>the talks succeeded, whereas Singapore agrees to demolish its halve of its causeway, in exchange for sand and airspace access, you seriously think the M'sian govt will give a DAMN about the 'feelings' of the people'?  The M'sian govt will just brush aside, just like they did to the same people who protested at Protonas Tower over the rise in fuel charges, claim that 'We a democratic country where we will listen to the MAJORITY, BUT we'll not be held hostage to a few who held opposite views'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Therefore, I suspect that given the a) the negative sentiments of the people on the ground (towards the sale of sand &amp; airspace access), b) the cost of the project if carried out unliterally, c) Singapore's reluctance to the replacement of the bridge, &amp; d) legal implications (applicable to the country's int'l image) of any unilteral action finally caused the M'sian govt to capitulate here.  TALK ABOUT SHOOTING ONE IN ITS OWN FOOT!<br><br>P/s.   A crooked-bridge is still called a crooked-bridge, what SCENIC BRIDGE?  Please, don't play with the English Language when your language is Behasa M'sia!  Scenic brigdge!  ha!  Imagine getting a frail 90yo greatmother posing on the centrefold of Playboy magazine and calling that THE MOST SEXY AND ALLURING FEMALE ON THE PLANET!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Out Of The Cage: It turned out to be a bridge too far<br>15 Apr 2006<br><br><strong>Khairy Jamaluddin (Son in law of Msia PM) gave the reasons why Sg din want the bridge. Since they knew the reasons, they shld asked themselves why Sg will agree? </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Saturday/Columns/20060415071252/Article/index_html</span><br><br>GOVERNMENTS the world over will only consider a volte-face in policy as a last option. The one thing that political leaders want to avoid is a U-turn, a track back, a change of mind. The public consequently attaches great value to politicians who stubbornly stick to their guns come what may.<br><br>Perhaps hardheadedness is an overrated political virtue. The British economist John Maynard Keynes, who was famous for not holding the same opinion for long, once remarked: "When the facts change, I change my mind."<br><br>Similarly, a leader must be bold enough to change his mind if the premise upon which his decision was made has changed.<br><br>This is evident in the decision made by the Government not to proceed with a bridge of any kind to replace the Causeway with Singapore after months of political signalling that we would go ahead with a new structure on our territory.<br><br>Why the about-turn, especially after some very strong and categorical statements from senior government leaders that work on a curved half-bridge would commence shortly?<br><br>We knew the Singapore Government was not keen on a bridge replacing the Causeway. The last thing they want is easier access across the Johor Strait for Singaporeans to spend their money in Malaysia.<br><br>They know that a new bridge combined with the new Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex would considerably alleviate traffic woes for the 70 million users of the Causeway every year and make the trip up north all the more palatable.<br><br><strong>A bridge would have also been a catalyst in promoting Johor as a cargo, logistics and transshipment gateway.<br><br>They have also been aware for some months that the Prime Minister has earmarked southern Johor as a new growth centre for services, strategically positioning it as a competitor to Singapore which has natural limits to growth and a richly valued property market.<br><br>With this in mind, they could not allow any project Â— like the bridge Â— that would accelerate the development of southern Johor.</strong> But obviously they couldnÂ’t afford to be so obvious in showing their hand. Instead, they strung us along for the ride, feigning interest and even talking about a "balance of benefits" for both sides.<br><br>Of course, SingaporeÂ’s idea of a "balance of benefits" is the scale tipping over on their side. In return for agreeing to co-operate on a straight bridge, they literally asked for our bumi and langit.<br><br>They knew their request for sand and airspace was a politically loaded proposition which would be met with tremendous resistance by the Malaysian public.<br><br>They knew that in the case of airspace, for instance, there was no "balance of benefits" Â— Malaysians would regard it as encroachment into our sovereign territory while for Singapore it would be, in the words of their media, merely a "good-to-have convenience... like (a) sheltered walkway".<br><br>With SingaporeÂ’s hemming and hawing on the straight bridge, the only conceivable way forward was to build the curved bridge in order to replace the Causeway on our side, provide a sea lane through the Johor Strait and link traffic with the new CIQ complex on Bukit Chagar. And for a few months, that was our default position that precipitated a war of words across the Causeway.<br><br>All that, of course, changed with the announcement on Wednesday that there would be no bridge. Many have attributed this to public sentiment Â— that Malaysians did not want to have to bargain with their territory for the new bridge. Even the Prime Minister said that he listened to the views of the people before making this decision.<br><br>That is, of course, true. But public pressure does not fully explain the strategic importance of the decision to abandon the curved bridge. By definition, the curved bridge is a unilateral decision. If there was a bilateral agreement the bridge would be straight.<br><br>Any unilateral decision involving another country would have exposed us to a reaction from the other side.<br><br>In this case, unilaterally building a bridge, even on our side, would have most probably resulted in Singapore bringing this matter to the Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, arguing that it is a demolition of a common facility joining two countries.<br><br>While the Foreign Minister is confident that we would have a strong legal case, it would serve to delay construction, with the possibility that the millions of ringgit spent on works would be wasted if there were an unfavourable decision. The unilateral option would have also eventually led to a bilateral face-off because cutting and relocating the pipes that take water from Johor to Singapore would require the latterÂ’s consent.<br><br>Imagine building the bridge and not getting an agreement to relocate the pipes. Another potential waste of money.<br><br>Finally, apart from the road and pipes that are built onto the Causeway, there is the matter of our railway line. As with the water pipes, a new railway connection requires SingaporeÂ’s agreement.<br><br>If we fail to get an agreement with the Singaporeans on a new railway connection, our trains will be forced to stop at Johor Baru.<br><br>This could possibly lead to the closure of the Tanjung Pagar railway station and the loss of other Malaysian railway land in Singapore based on the Points of Agreement signed in 1990.<br><br>In other words, the unilateral option would have not just exposed us to the possibility of international arbitration, but it would have compromised our national interest and given Singapore leverage over us.<br><br>If they can ask for our bumi and langit for a straight bridge, imagine what their demands would have been had we begun spending money on building a curved bridge only to find that their agreement was needed for the water pipes and railway to be connected.<br><br>By then, we would not be able to simply walk away from the project by merely compensating the contractor. By then the sunk cost would be considerable, effectively strait-jacketing us in our negotiations with Singapore.<br><br>So yes, it was a case of our leaders listening to us. But much more significantly, it was a strategic decision based on careful reconsideration.<br><br>It was an about-face because doing otherwise would have meant negotiating from a position of weakness on other outstanding issues.<br><br>When dealing with slippery opponents, hardheadedness is the worst strategy. Call their bluff, change your mind, walk away, even float like a butterfly. Now they know itÂ’s game on.<br><br>The writer is an investment banker and deputy head of Barisan Nasional Youth.</div>
