Not true those there not paid well.  They are paid very well OK, doctors senior get 5 figure salaries and other positions like managerial also pay very well and comparable to private sector.  When they say wann adjust pay, want to pay them fairly it's just crap lah.<br><br>Economy doing well does notjustify the increase in charges in hospiitals.  Govt really ssuucks!  They never fail to find opportunities and time to back up their reason to increase charges.  Seems that they focuse so much on earning lots of $$$ for themselves.</div>

In recent years, we have seen many senior doctors and heads of department leaving for the private sector. With salaries that are double or triple that of the public sector, even junior specialists are leaving the moment they obtain their specialist qualifications.<br><br>"THE exodus of doctors from the public to the private sector seems to be picking up this year, after two years of relatively little movement.<br><br>And this time, an unusual number of senior people are leaving. There were 43 specialists among the 177 doctors who quit last year in spite of Sars causing massive disruption in the health-care system for almost half a year. Twenty-one were from the SingHealth cluster, which in just two months this year has already seen 11 more go. The other major player, the National Healthcare Group, admitted that it, too, has lost specialists this year, but would only say they represented 1 per cent of all its doctors. Both groups said that the departures are inevitable since the public sector's role has traditionally been to train young doctors.<br><br>Still, several recent resignations have raised eyebrows because of the calibre of the people involved. They include at least four heads of department. Last month, Singapore General Hospital lost its top colorectal surgeon, Dr Francis Seow-Choen, and ear, nose and throat specialist Goh Yau Hong. Associate Professor Patrick Tan, SGH's head of haematology, will leave shortly. He is best known for pioneering efforts in using cord blood to cure blood and bone marrow cancers. The National University Hospital has seen six obstetricians and gynaecologists go since last December. They include a former department head, Professor Ng Soon Chye, and fertility expert Jothi Kumar. Its chief of hand and reconstructive microsurgery, Associate Professor Lim Beng Hai, is now serving his notice. The National Cancer Centre has lost radiation oncologist Lee Kim Shang to the Parkway Group. Changi General Hospital will be saying farewell soon to its head of surgery, Dr Michael Ho. He is going into private practice as he wants to spend more time with his four young children.<br><br>Most of the doctors The Straits Times spoke to cited more time for themselves and their families, plus the better service they believe they can give patients in the private sector, as the main reasons for leaving. Ear, nose and throat specialist Dr Goh said he could see as many as 100 patients a day at SGH, reducing the time he would have liked to have for treating patients. His former SGH colleague, Dr Seow-Choen, who was with the hospital for 22 years and is known internationally, said he wanted to leave while he was still at his peak. 'My leaving will also make way for younger doctors to move up,' he said.<br><br>However, there are not as many of these left from the 100 or so specialist trainee posts available each year. Last year, 45 from this pool resigned; the year before that, 35 did. Before 2000, fewer than 20 would leave each year. The last major exodus of all doctors was in 2000 when 243 left. In the two years after that, their numbers dropped drastically to 124 and 135, as the economy slumped. As a result, the number of doctors in the public sector crossed the 3,000 mark last year, surpassing that in private practice for the first time in a decade.<br><br>The Straits Times<br>09 Mar 2004 "</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE public health sector is possibly seeing the biggest exodus of specialists in a decade, including six heads of department among the more than 50 who have left for private practice this year. The average number of specialists leaving the public sector has been just over 40 a year since 1995.<br><br>In the past decade, the only time when more than 50 consultants quit in a year was in 2000, when 61 specialists moved to the private sector. That year, a record 243 doctors - or more than 20 a month - left the public service. The rationale then was that the Asian economic meltdown that began in mid-1997 had discouraged many doctors from venturing out in 1998 and 1999.<br><br>Last year, 177 doctors - 43 of them specialists - quit, which works out to nearly 15 a month. This was despite the Sars outbreak making conditions in private practice more difficult, because many foreign patients were put off coming here for treatment. The number of doctors leaving this year looks set to exceed that, as 131 doctors have left in just the first six months. This is an average of nearly 22 a month.<br><br>It was paperwork that drove Dr Tan Chee Eng out of the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Dr Tan, the former head of endocrinology, said he was spending half his time on administrative work, and the needs of running a department curtailed both his patient care and research. 'That took away my reason for staying in the public sector,' he said. At 44, he was a senior consultant and both his salary and title had reached a peak. 'Salary was not the major factor. If it was, I would have left long ago,' he said. Since he set up his clinic at Gleneagles Medical Centre last month, he not only sees more patients but is able to spend more time with them. He reserves Wednesday afternoons for research and retains his position as adjunct senior research fellow at the Centre for Molecular Epidemiology.<br><br>Dr Khoo Kei Siong, the National Cancer Centre's former head of medical oncology, gave the same reason for leaving - too much administrative work. 'When I cannot spend enough time with patients, I find the work less satisfying.' He used to see 40 to 50 patients a day. Diagnosis and treatment can be quite fast, he said, but cancer is a major disease and he wanted to spend more time explaining to patients what they can expect and the alternative treatments available. Private patients can also afford more expensive medicine that has been shown to have better results, he said. 'We are less likely to see the treatment fail. It is always more satisfying when patients do well,' he said.<br><br>The push to make Singapore a regional medical hub makes the transition easier. Foreigners now account for almost half the patients he sees.<br><br>Other prominent doctors who have gone into private practice this year include SGH's former head of haematology, Dr Patrick Tan; and its former head of colorectal surgery, Dr Francis Seow-Choen. Changi General Hospital lost its head of surgery, Dr Michael Ho, while the National University Hospital (NUH) lost its chief of hand and reconstructive microsurgery, Dr Lim Beng Hai. Next year, NUH may lose its head of medical oncology, Dr Lim Hong Liang. He has told the hospital of his intentions, but has not tendered his resignation yet.<br><br>The Straits Times<br>04 Sept 2004</div>
