Got some a lil disposable income, u wont feel it. Now that u mentioned it, damn.. technically lent almost 100K to the dude. Or should i say, invested on him over the years ammounted to so much. I know got some loss , n he using some money to recover in the process, but its something i am not in control off. I'm not in total control. I recieve mails like what he bought.. then he call me sometimes say he sells what.. do this do that. </p>

              <p>But u know how sometimes u got emails from friends telling about this guy who says its good time to invest this or what. Why.. u think its real ?Or its just bullocks.  Alot of the articles look hella credible but i am just not sure. Being limited in knowledge in terms of these stocks n market trends , how am i sure that its not a bunch of jibberish trying to con my money ?  What if its some mater plan by some company to incrase thier profile by persuading people to buy thier shitty stocks ?</p>

              <p>We have to risk it in order to get it. By the time u come up with a 100% the opportunities are lost. Failed to seize it.</p>
              <p>To
              me gambling is when u have no idea of the odds and u are begging on
              whatever odds it is to be in ur favour. U have NO knowledge whatsoever,
              not even the slightest idea..  thats gambling. Like u said, but risk..
              calculated risks borders it. To gamble on this area and begin
              excavation for coal without doing proper prospecting to determine the
              veins and where the coal is, and reaping in huge amounts of profit at
              the cost of disregarding other important facilities that will tell you
              ur chances.</p>
              <p>While proper prospecting determining the exact
              contour of the area and determining where the coal are , having data's
              to back it up , and even that , the risk of starting the project after
              compiling so much data , the go ahead.. that.. is calculated risk to me.</p>
              <p>but
              anyways , i didnt invest. Thats why i let the people that know what
              they are doing do it. I just needed some sort of contrasting view in
              this entire outlook of things to determine my own position in this
              scale. The real meaning of gambling.This entire concept that how some say its not gambling some say its gambling.</p>

              <p>Similarly, you put it like that, it is the individual's "<span style="color: #333333;">risk tolerance that decides what is gamble and what is investment", <span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; line-height: 19px;">that is too subjective to be of any use. To the gambling addict, his risk tolerance is so high, nothing qualifies as "gambling". Therefore what you suggest, your criterion, is really useless..</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> What did I suggest? You are violently agreeing with me that everything is subjective, so what is your OBJECTIVE CRITERION?</span></p>
