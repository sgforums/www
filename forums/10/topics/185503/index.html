More so for nurses because the workload is lighter and the profession is far more well paid (not to mention more respected) than in Singapore.<br><br>There is no balance which can be striked. Health professionals move around globally because there is always a shortage and greener pastures elsewhere. The African countries are pleading for WHO to prevent richer developed nations not to take their health professionals away but ultimately it is the choice of the person.<br><br>All you can hope is that by training more - there will be some left to stay in the country. Most people stay to work in their country because it is somewhere they call home. I didn't stay in Singapore to work as a nurse because I felt it was not home at all and not from the crap i got from working in the singaporean hospitals for a sh*t pay or being target practice for doctors in a bad mood throwing folders about  . I could work for the US but I didn't like the guns there. I could work for UK but being in Singapore was bad enough -  I don't fancy being a folder fetcher anymore. So I stayed in Australia since 2002 and it is my home now.<br><br>Even in Australia, they are also facing a problem of shortages . Their nurses and doctors are moving to USA for the money or canada or just to see the world.<br><br>So no real way to solve this. Bond your doctors and after the bond they will still run if they want to . Pay them more but there will be someone else who is really willing to up the pay to get them there. Make them feel home and they will stay home.<br><br>So what does Singapore do? Make sure health is the responsibility of everyone and I think that is a good concept with the exclusion of genetic related diseases.<br></div>

Certainly, we may need more doctors (and nurses too, right?), but not an exponetial increase in numbers ... n Quantity without quality is of no use ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good...some of you have already made the suggestion I was going to make, so this makes my life easier.<br><br>First, one must understand that there are many levels of healthcare. For most people, their contact with the healthcare system is for minor medical problems or chronic illnesses that can be handled by a primary healthcare attendant, ie. a general practitioner, either in a private clinic or in the polyclinic.<br><br>There is a secondary level of healthcare, for those who require treatment in a hospital context but the level of expertise required is low to intermediate. I would include in this category common operations like mastectomy without reconstruction, colectomy  for cancer,etc.<br><br>Beyond that, we have tertiary level healthcare that is expensive and labour and technology-intensive. This will include intensive care treatment, oncology services, transplant services and the like.<br><br>We need different solutions for different levels of healthcare. At the moment, there is no clear distinction between the secondary and tertiary levels of healthcare. Hospitals that do separation of siamese twins also perform breas_t resections, which can be done in a secondary healthcare facility. My proposal is a clearer separation between primary/secondary versus tertiary levels of healthcare.<br><br>Singaporeans want cheaper medical services for their flu and common chronic illnesses like hypertension and diabetes, for which they need medication frequently. These conditions are simpler to treat and common complications including amputations for foot gangrene in the case of diabetes can be handled in secondary level facilities.<br><br>My solution is to greatly increase the number of primary and secondary level facilities. Open the floodgates to hire more cheap doctors from Malaysia, Thailand, India and Pakistan; nurses from China and attendants from Bangladesh. Training our own doctors will not decrease heathcare costs much, since they also have a family to feed, a car and HDB flat to pay off in Singapore.<br><br>If Singaporeans want cheaper healthcare for 'simpler' medical ailments, then we have to take in more foreign talent. As the Minister has already done so, radiology in the polyclinics are outsourced to India. Alas! we cannot outsource our patients to Thailand and Malaysia for their monthly checkup, so the solution must be to bring the mountain to Muhammad...bring in MORE foreign talent.<br><br>Mind you, we will not get the best doctors from India and Pakistan...those who do well enough in their PLAB or USMLE examination (qualifications for medical graduates to work in the UK and US respectively) will move to London and the USA, where the pay and prospects are better. We will have to settle with 'second rate' doctors but as these are simpler medical conditions, they should suffice in most instances.<br><br>Singaporeans cannot expect to have a doctor that speaks their language and there will be initial pain as these foreigners adjust to the local working environment but in time, they will become used to our culture. Someone complained to the Forum page recently about doctors from Myanmar with thick accents. We cannot oblige them their choice of doctors if this is to work.<br><br>Yes, we will have to relax the stringent regulations we now have that only recognizes top foreign medical schools. You don't seriously expect a graduate from Harvard Medical School or Oxford University to settle for a starting salary of below 2k? For the salary of a local graduate 2 years' post-housemanship, we can employ two doctors from India or China.  But obviously you cannot expect the same quality...sometimes you get lucky and you hire a good doctor...sometimes, not so good.<br><br>Secondary healthcare institutions will not be required to satisfy the stringent accreditation standards by which tertiary institutions have to abide.  Lab tests can be outsourced to Malaysia but obviously you cannot expect their labs to be accredited by international bodies. Test results may vary more, they may be less accurate and they will take longer to come back (because it is economical to batch tests) <strong>but they will be cheaper</strong>.<br><br>Such institutions will not have intensive care or full emergency services...but Singapore is small enough for patients to travel to tertiary institutions.<br><br>The range of services will be more limited, <strong>only generic medicine will be prescribed </strong>and as a rule, surgical implants and appliances will be older models where the patent has run out (generally 20 year patent protection).<br><br>Patients have to accept that you may have to take 2 tablets 4 times a day instead of a capsule once a day. Instead of taking your gallbladder out with three holes in the abdomen, you will have the traditional long scar and stay a day or two longer in the hospital but the fees will be lower. Your prosthesis is more likely to loosen than more expensive models and you may have to come back for a revision (repeat surgery) earlier. Obviously, you might be lucky and yours might give you no problem as well...we are talking about statistics here...<br><br>I will talk about funding for basic (primary/secondary healthcare) later. The point I am making is that there is a price to everything. We can make your visit to the doctor cheaper, but you cannot demand to have the best doctor, the best medication, most accurate lab results and the most comfortable consultation room.<br><br>If Singaporeans are prepared to accept that, this model can lower healthcare costs. We will still not be cheaper than a hospital in JB for the simple reason that even if we were to hire all their staff, why should they come over unless we pay more than what they are currently getting? No, we will not be cheaper than a JB hospital unless (touch wood) our economy falls way behind theirs.<br><br>However, basic medical care will be cheaper...would Singaporeans accept this?<br></div>

But obviously you cannot expect the same quality...sometimes you get lucky and you hire a good doctor...sometimes, not so good.<br><br>Secondary healthcare institutions will not be required to satisfy the stringent accreditation standards by which tertiary institutions have to abide.  Lab tests can be outsourced to Malaysia but obviously you cannot expect their labs to be accredited by international bodies. Test results may vary more, they may be less accurate and they will take longer to come back (because it is economical to batch tests) [b]but they will be cheaper</strong>.<br><br>Such institutions will not have intensive care or full emergency services...but Singapore is small enough for patients to travel to tertiary institutions.<br><br>The range of services will be more limited, <strong>only generic medicine will be prescribed </strong>and as a rule, surgical implants and appliances will be older models where the patent has run out (generally 20 year patent protection).<br><br>Patients have to accept that you may have to take 2 tablets 4 times a day instead of a capsule once a day. Instead of taking your gallbladder out with three holes in the abdomen, you will have the traditional long scar and stay a day or two longer in the hospital but the fees will be lower. Your prosthesis is more likely to loosen than more expensive models and you may have to come back for a revision (repeat surgery) earlier. Obviously, you might be lucky and yours might give you no problem as well...we are talking about statistics here...<br><br>I will talk about funding for basic (primary/secondary healthcare) later. The point I am making is that there is a price to everything. We can make your visit to the doctor cheaper, but you cannot demand to have the best doctor, the best medication, most accurate lab results and the most comfortable consultation room.<br><br>If Singaporeans are prepared to accept that, this model can lower healthcare costs. We will still not be cheaper than a hospital in JB for the simple reason that even if we were to hire all their staff, why should they come over unless we pay more than what they are currently getting? No, we will not be cheaper than a JB hospital unless (touch wood) our economy falls way behind theirs.<br><br>However, basic medical care will be cheaper...would Singaporeans accept this?<br>[/b]</blockquote>I sense sarcasm . With all due respect,  what is the real reason behind this post and posting the most ludicrous, nonsensical model I ever read about ? In general whereever you are in developed nations, people won't accept these type of conditions. Australia already had have a big hoo ha over some indian doctor of death. So what is the real issue you are addressing here?<br><br>UK NHS is not the best system to quote , neither is the german system. Of course they are the better known ones to most.<br><br>Try looking at the Finnish health system - they  have a better idea and their life expectancy is excellent. In fact , the scandinavians have a generally good idea of how to run a health care system - it comes with a price - heavy price tag on taxpayers.  However I don't see much scandinavians moving out of their countries to practice somewhere - and they can speak english perfectly fine too. They must be doing something right ....or they could just love their saunas in finland..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Both fymk and snow leopard are right... By increasing the responsibilities of our nurses we can reduce the workload of the doctors and lower healthcare costs, since doctors are paid more. We already have nurse practitioners but most nurses in Singapore are not prepared to accept a bigger role because of greater legal liabilities.<br><br>Fymk is right in that nurses will have to buy malpractice insurance if they are to have a bigger role. Incidentally, doctors in high risk specialties such as obstetrics and cosmetic surgery pay an annual premium as high as 10k, so it is not feasible to expect them to lower their fees too drastically either. If we pay nurse practitioners 3k a month like those in Australia, we will raise, not lower healthcare costs.<br><br>In any case, I doubt getting more Singaporean nurse practitioners will be any cheaper than bringing in more Indian and Chinese doctors, who are willing to work for around 2-3k a month. If you are willing to lower your standards, you can get them at below 2k as well. Doctors can take on more operative procedures but in the context of rehab medicine, geriatrics and convalescence wards, yes...it will be cheaper to get nurses and we should do so.<br><br>Along this vein, I understand that in some hospitals nurses are doing less than what they used to do when I was a houseman some 20 years ago. Following a few instances when nurses were found negligent for administering wrong dosages of medication, many nurses now refuse to give intravenous medications. Compared to the duties of nurses in the Uk, certainly our nurses can do more, but they would want more money.<br><br>We are already short of nurses and globally there is a shortage of trained, English-speaking nurses. If if we want them cheap, we have to get them from China and give them on the job training.</div>

Do not forget also that medical students now pay 18k per year for 5 years in NUS (again, provided they pass every year). During the additional year as a houseman they are paid just below 2k and if at the end of it all, you will not be paid much more than the average Singaporean and with a 100k debt from NUS, why would anyone bother with medicine?<br><br>It is too late to turn back the clock in any case. If we were to place a cap on doctors' salaries at the 50th percentile as you suggest, we will lose a large proportion of our doctors. Our qualifications are recognized in the UK and other Commonwealth nations where there is a shortage to meet the needs of their aging population.<br><br>There is another fallacy: that medicine obeys the economic principle of demand and supply. It does not....in fact, quite often, we see a supply induced demand in medical practice. We used to take out gallbladders by making a long incision in the abdomen but I do remember the days when we started doing laparoscopic surgery, making a few holes instead of a long cut. The patient could also go home earlier but it also costs more. The moment one patient in the ward had it, all the other patients waiting for the operation also wanted it. The more surgeons who can do this operation, the more such expensive procedures are undertaken.<br><br>When you want to buy a dress, you shop around for the best price and you decide what you need and pay what you consider to be a reasonable price. With medicine, it's different. Your doctors tell you what needs to be done and does it, you pay him whatever he charges. We know that the rate of caesarian deliveries and all surgical procedures is higher among private patients, if doctors get a cut of the operating fees. As medical students, we could almost predict who will need assisted delivery by just looking at the ward class of some patients.<br><br>With more doctors we will have more expensive procedures being performed, because everyone wants to earn more money as long as it is legal. That's a fact.<br><br>Wouldn't hiring cheap foreign doctors give rise to this problem as well? Not if we restrict them to work in public hospitals. They will not be licensed to work in private clinics/hospitals and so we can control their pay packet. In my proposal, primary and secondary healthcare institutions will only provide basic healthcare...no keyhole surgery until such time when the cost of such procedures is equivalent to older techniques. This will leave poor patients an avenue for treatment, even though it is not going to be the best available (and should not be).<br><br>I would indeed expect alot of Singaporean doctors to leave, because with the cheap foreign doctors, our local doctors have only two options left in Singapore:<br><br>1. Go private and compete with the ever-increasing pool of local doctors in the private sector if they want to earn more than the 2-3k a month paid to the foreign doctors<br><br>2. Upgrade, specialize and try to get a job in the ever competitive tertiary institutions, which will do high-tech medicine for the wealthy, private patients and foreign patients.<br><br>In other words, we will create a bigger gap between the salary scale of our doctors. Currently GPs earn anything between 3k to 10k, but I would think the average is about 5-7k a month. If we flood the polyclinics with foreign doctors, GPs will see their salary drop to probably 3-5k a month. Top doctors with skills that are highly sought after will still command salaries above 10k in tertiary institutions. But you have to be the best to be there...<br><br>Back to your point about 20k salaries. There is a big problem in the wage discrepancy among doctors. Your neighborhood GP is probably getting 5k a month and the hospital consultant psychiatrist will be extremely luckly if he can manage 10k with performance bonus added in. But surgeons in Singapore are paid more highly than their counterparts in the UK, and that is not linked to their skills or experience either. The pay scale for surgeons is much higher and yes, they get a cut from the operations they do.<br><br>Remember when Dr Ng Eng Hen joined politics, the PM pointed out that he lost a big chunk of his salary by becoming a cabinet minister. Now we know the salary of a cabinet minister is close to a million or so, if Dr Ng has lost a huge chunk of his salary, he must have been earning at least a million a year as a brea_st surgeon.<br><br>I think by bringing in foreign doctors, we will force local GPs to lower their fees to some extent (but not much as their pay is not as high as Snow Leopard suggests). However, the biggest impact will be to increase the competition for tertiary institutions as we have never seen before. Surgeons in tertiary institutions will also have to lower their salaries in that case.<br><br>If it is at all possible, I would propose that the salary scale of various medical specialities should not vary so much. When a consultant psychiatrist gets 10k a month and a surgeon gets 100k a month, we will see a diversion of our best talents in one or two specialties. There will be good people who specialize in poor-paying discipline because of passion, but we are not being fair to them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Healthcare funding</strong></span><br><br>How do we find the funding for our heathcare system so that Singaporeans can afford it despite an aging population that will consume more services?<br><br>Medical insurance is the way to go to even out risks and make it affordable for all. For this to work, we need a compuslory system that everyone has to buy into. The reason is simple: unless it is compulsory, why should the young want to pay in to support the old? Why should the healthy athlete want to pay in for the benefit of the neighbour with renal failure?<br><br>Premiums for a national medical insurance scheme have to be paid through the medisave and we already have that to some extent. The problem is that the coverage is not enough. The reason for that is the pot of money for premium is not sufficient and healthcare expenses can rise exponentially. For this to work, we have to curb the expenses as well.<br><br>If we define primary and secondary healthcare institutions in the manner I have mentioned...cut out all the patented drugs and new surgical procedures that are expensive, hire loads of cheap foreign doctors and nurses, it might be possible to make a medical insurance policy cover say, 80% of all costs in primary and secondary healthcare institutions. I say 80% because I do agree with co-payment to discourage abuse of the system. Patients must pay something out of pocket, unless they are truly destitute.<br><br>Patients who want to take one capsule instead of 8 a day can get a prescription to buy out of their own pocket. But those who cannot afford any medication otherwise will get it. And no, HIV patients will not get the anti-retrovirals and brea_st cancer patients won't get Herceptin...not for another 10-20 years at least.<br><br>The medisave currently covers only hospital inpatient expenses but this is clearly inadequate. I welcome the recent news that the Minister for Health has opened it to chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes. It is certainly a very big change and indicates that he is aware of the limitations of medisave. Obviously he is concerned that patients might exhaust their medisave accounts quickly and that is also quite possible with chronic illnesses. That's why I would advocate a national insurance scheme paid through medisave that will cover all basic hospitalisations and outpatient treatment in primary and secondary healthcare institutions.<br><br>For this to work, it is essential that our basic healthcare is truly basic although extensive. If you need to get that colon cancer out, consider the cheapest way to do it...from the type of suture you use to the kind of bowel preparation. Although a truly efficient conveyor-belt type surgery is not possible, if we can hire alot of cheap foreign surgeons from Eastern Europe and the Indian subcontinent, they can be made to specialise in just one type of surgery. You gain lots of expertise quickly if you only remove colons and nothing else, day in and day out. Local doctors will not want to do that because they quickly become incompetent in other types of operations but with hired foreign surgeons, we can forced them to do that.<br><br>If the expensive surgeons we have currently are worth their salt, we may see higher failure rates and infection rates when these operations are handled by cheaper, less skilled foreign surgeons who cannot get jobs in the UK or the US. But they are cheap and as long as the drop in standard is not too much, perhaps Singaporeans will accept it rather than not being able to afford the operation at all? Who knows? Perhaps there will not be a drop in standard...perhaps surgeons like Dr Ng, Dr Balaji and Dr Balakrishnan were overpaid for their services.<br><br>I wonder where Atobe is. If Singaporeans are prepared for this sort of system, it will be possible to lower healthcare costs. But it will not be reasonable to ask for cheap hospital fees and demand that Ng Eng Hen removes the brea_st lump!<br><br></div>
