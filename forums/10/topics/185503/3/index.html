Written by acknowledged experts in each field, it provides accessible summaries of the scientific<br>justification for isolating different aspects of social and economic life as the primary determinants of a population's health.<br><br>The new edition takes account of the most recent research and also includes additional chapters on ethnicity and health, sexual behaviors, the elderly, housing and neighborhoods.<br><br>Recognition of the power of socioeconomic factors as determinants of health came initially from research on health inequalities. This has led to a view of health as not simply about individual behavior or exposure to risk, but how the socially and economically structured way of life of a population<br>shapes its health. Thus exercise and accidents as as much about a society's transport system as about individual decisions; and the nation's diet involves agriculture, food manufacture, retailing, and personal incomes as much as individual choice. But a major new element in the picture we have<br>developed is the importance of the social, or psycho-social, environment to health. For example, health in the workplace for most employees - certainly for office workers - is less a matter of exposure to physical health hazards as of the social envrionment, of how supportive it is, whether people<br>have control over their work, whether their jobs are secure. A similar picture emerges in other areas ranging from the health importance of the emotional envrionment in early childhood to the need for more socially cohesive communities.<br><br>Social Determinants of Health, 2E should be read by those interested in the wellbeing of modern societies. It is a must for public health professionals, for health promotion specialists, and for people working in the many fields of public policy which we now know make such an important contribution<br>to health.<br><br>Book Info<br>Univ.

Even with these low expenditures, the income of <strong><span style="color: blue;">Singapore doctors is about the same in relation to average wages as physician income in the United States </span></strong>..."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Public institutions dominate Singapore's hospital sector: 13 of the 23 hospitals and 8,640 of the 10,469 beds are in facilities controlled by the Ministry of Health. A key component of the government'spolicy is a tiered structure of subsidies based on the setting in which care is delivered and the amenities provided with it. In the public hospitals, there are five classes of wards that receive varying degrees of subsidy, while private hospitals are unsubsidized. "<br><br>"the government has implemented three programs that help people pay for medical expenses: Medisave, Medishield and Medifund. With these three programs, Singapore has managed to create a largely self-funded health care system that requires people to first look to their own resources for health care, relying on the government only after their resources are depleted."<br><br>"Because mandatory Medisave deposits are a percent of wages, deposits are smaller for lower-wage workers, and the least affluent may not be able to pay much out of pocket. Thus <strong><span style="color: blue;">the combination of out-of-pocket, Medisave and Medishield payments may not cover all of their medical expenses</span></strong>.<br><br>Medifund is a government-funded program established in April 1993 to provide financial assistance to the poor whose Medisave accounts are low and who have few resources to pay the difference out of pocket. Initiated with a government grant of S$200 million, Medifund receives an additional S$100 million each year there is a government surplus. This provision is only theoretical at present, since government surpluses have been robust, but it underscores the government's position that health care is a good to be purchased within the limits of available resources and not an entitlement.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Funds are distributed on a case-by-case basis. Preference is given to patients who have made regular contributions to Medisave/Medishield and to the elderly whose Medisave accounts have not grown adequately to cover expenses</span></strong>."<br><br>"Under the three Medishield plans, coverage varies according to the level of service chosen."<br><br>"The Medifund program aids those whose out-of-pocket, Medisave and Medishield payments may not cover all of their medical expenses."<br><br><strong>Third-party insurance. <span style="color: blue;">The Singapore government has not encouraged the growth of American-style third-party insurance on the grounds that it encourages the perception that medicine is a free good</span></strong>. Tax deductions for all allowed medical expenses are limited to 2 percent of the employee's base salary. Firms are encouraged to make additional Medisave contributions of up to 2 percent of salary instead of providing employees with additional hospitalization benefits. Since Medisave does not pay for most outpatient treatments, many companies provide some coverage for them."<br><br>"In 1992 the total amount of subsidized care in Singapore was approximately S$360 million, equivalent to 19 percent of the total health care expenditure, or <strong><span style="color: red;">0.7 percent of GDP</span></strong>"</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">If the Government can hand out BILLION Dollars in refunds from surplus tax collections - would it not have been more effective for the Billion Dollars to be placed in a NATIONAL HEALTH "SINKING FUND" so that those who need it most will stand to benefit from it, rather then placing the entire family in desparate situation to source for funding at the last minute.<br><br>A National Insurance Scheme to protect ALL SINGAPOREANS - with the ANNUAL HANDOUTS will be sufficent to help implement the proposal mentioned in the Workers' Party Manifesto.<br><br>About your remarks concerning raising proposal without any implementation plans - would you not believe that MM LKY will dream up many proposals for his faithful minions to research and find ways to implement ?<br><br>Singapore is certainly not the only country seeking the answers to the topic raised, as can be seen in the following paper prepared by an Indian National submitting his thesis on: <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/takemi/RP117.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>Technology, Competition and Costs of Medical CAre: Some Emerging Issues and Policy Imperatives in India"</strong></a><br><br>An Abstract is as follow:</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The private sector plays a significant role in meeting the health care needs of the people of India.

We thus are faced with two important questions:<br><br>(a) what are the causes for the increasing costs of care?, and<br>(b) what can we do to contain them?<br><br>Many scholars have analyzed the question of why various cost-control strategies in market economies have not been successful in the past.[62]<br><br>Some of the reasons are to be found in the nature of the market system that encouraged the transformation of physicians into a class of manager-physician-entrepreneurs.<br><br>Some others have blamed the unholy alliance between the government and the medical profession in encouraging peoplesÂ’ dependence on private medical services.[63]<br><br>Some scholars suggest why blending market mechanisms with regulations is necessary in containing costs of care.[64]<br><br>While studies in future will throw further details of physiciansÂ’ behavior under different market conditions, it is necessary to reflect on the implications of what we are beginning to observe and how we may have to institute different mechanisms to develop a better health care system.<br><br>I have attempted in this essay (a) to put together evidence that throws some light on the behavior of this new class of entrepreneurs, and how as a result we are facing certain basic issues, primarily ethical in nature, that restrict access to appropriate care; and (b) to indicate certain policy measures by which costs of medical care could be better contained.<br><br><strong>It is important to mention here two widely prevalent "myths" (particularly among the policy makers): <span style="color: red;">one is that greater access to better medical care and containing cost of care do not go together. </span></strong>To put it differently, if you are to have the finest medical care system, be prepared for high costs.<br><br><strong>The second myth (some would call it "public expectation") recognized by many scholars, <span style="color: red;">is that high technology is essential for improved health and longevity.</span></strong><br><br>There are several examples (of community-based health care projects in India as well as in other parts of the world) which explode these myths.[65]<br><br>Policy lessons emerge and can be learnt not only from our own past mistakes and achievements, but from the experiences of developed economies as well.<br><br>The recent developments in the medical care market in the US have a clear lesson for the health policy makers in India.<br><br>While there are forces that seem to be pushing up the costs of medical care beyond our control, there are also ways and means that are well within our reach and control that can be used effectively to reduce costs of care and thus effect some savings for the society."</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">A further referenced piece that you may wish to consider reading - instead of limiting the comparison of Singapore with some of the costlier National Systems such as UK, Sweden or USA, perhaps the following article may give you some diversity of views:</span><br><br><a href="http://www.ncpa.org/~ncpa/studies/s200/s200.html" rel="nofollow"><strong><br>Private Alternatives to Social Security in Other Countries</strong></a><br><span style="color: darkred;">- prepared for the National Centre for Policy Analysis<br><br>Is it any wonder if Singapore do not have Doctors taking care of Public Policies in matter related to Health Care ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>

"</span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I can only say : economically feasible short term , penny wise pound foolish long term after I read the WP manifesto on health.<br><br>I found loopholes. If you want insurance to cover public beds and users for the sake of affordability - make everything basic as it is. Don't offer people a choice of paying a gap . They want freakin nice amenities - THEY PAY IN FULL - PERIOD. The profits generated from FULL PAYMENT BETTER CLASS BEDS should go into subsidising the public beds.<br><br>National Central Pharmacy sounds abit like PBS in Australia. Prepare to go under American fire in the FTA. I think bulk buying is going on already since the Singaporean government already subsidises. Hey I don't think the govt is that dumb to not even negotiate prices since the govt is a paying party as well.<br><br>The WP manifesto sounds suspiciously like the beginning of a HMO system in USA with the public insurance scheme. In the beginning people combined resources to get basic healthcare  ..........now look at good old uncle sam. You never ever do anything in conjunction with private health insurance companies unless you want to raise the cost for the common person. The private insurance companies strive on profits ONLY.<br><br>I do not even understand what they mean by lifetime payout with no yearly limit.<br><br>Premium should never be the same - ask any actuary or economists and they will tell you why. As a person grows older , they develop chronic diseases - premiums remain the same - you have a big problem of healthy youngster subsidising the older ones.<br><br>Outsourcing? Our dear mandated govt is already outsourcing so many things. What is a little more other than singaporeans losing more jobs again.<br><br>Detailed costing in hospital treatments ? Idea is good . I always wondered how much ethane oxide costs to sterilise a whole bunch of things.<br><br>Information technology will only increase costs as technology advances each time plus you need to maintain it and upgrade it plus get staff to do all those things.<br><br>However to be fair , I like the idea of equitable health for all concept through means testing for polyclinics.<br><br></div>

However what I like better is a feasibility paper in application to the context. This paper which talked about the 2 myths does not apply. It is talking about the indian system and american system which is vastly different from ours.<br><br>I worked in the hospital system in Singapore before and I don't think the doctors will frivolously order tests as described in this paper.<br><br>This paper also addresses in great detail financial interests aka profiteering of private physicians through having some shareholding stake in the hospital  plus regulations. With the Singaporean government controlling and regulating a huge bulk of restructured health services, this paper does not apply.<br><br>What I love about this paper - HEALTH PROMOTION as a cost saver.<br><br>Public expectation - how are you going to advise the public about their expectations and reality? Not much . Internet = free info center on the latest life saving technology. Let's put it this way - most people are scared to die and willing to prolong their lives at any cost . I don't see much substantiation in what this author written.<br><br>This paper is in conclusion just what I call a scoping paper not a proposal of any kind . It just does the comparative analysis and in effect cannot be used to argue any case in the Singaporean context. And yes it is a takemi paper - harvard la la la etc etc.  Give me the primary research literature which dispels the 2 so-called myths.<br></div>

You forget to see all sides.<br></strong><br><br>and what does health of the population relate to?  time for exercise?  how to afford more time for exercise when one is laden down with tons of work and family duties?  so you've seen one step beyond health care - health itself.  why not see even further, the overall quality of life here, of slogging long hours, stress, competition, worry about being retrenched and replaced by foreigners ... just because you've seen one extra side, you think you've seen all sides?<br><br><strong><br>Meaningless or not, look at your social policies in Singapore. the anti smoking campaign - financial disincentives by increasing cigarette costs- banning of smoking in certain areas - those are health-social-economic policies.<br>Riding a bike or walking to MRT - health-social policies.<br></strong><br><br>anti-smoking campaigns i agwee but riding a bike to MRT?  that is being encouraged here?  you know how dangerous it is to ride a bike on our roads?  remember the group of cycling enthusiasts who ended up with one dead?  i once read about an ang moh who complained in the forum that he had to carry his bike across five overhead bridges to reach his destination.  if you're referring to riding bike to the MRT as an example of the govt's promotion of a healthy lifestyle, you get zero marks for that.<br><br><strong><br>On the other side, they are already outsourcing alot of jobs out ( i.e. outsourcing x rays to india - that is what I heard from a few singaporeans) which are trying to cut down your health costs. They already got alot of china nurses in to keep costs down.<br></strong><br><br>but have we done enough to ensure that the expensive doctor is not being used to examine coughs and flus?<br><br><strong><br>Why blame society? Health is your own responsibility . Don't give excuses.<br></strong><br><br>who's blaming anyone?  we just merely reflected the simple inbalance between demand for and supply of doctors.  do we blame society for lack of doctors?  no, we blame the institutions that churn out doctors for not producing enough doctors.  we blame the institutions that doctors work in for not utilisiing their specialist skills appropriately.<br><br><strong><br>Don't ask everyone else to pay for your own problem - isn't that what you implied when I told you that I have some rare genetic problem.<br></strong><br><br>wait a minute, where did i say i have a problem that i need you to pay for?  i said i am young and healthy and have no problems and despite the fact that i have no problems, i feel a lot of old people have problems.  most problems occur to old people, you should know that better than i do, you're a health professional.<br><br><strong><br>You can at least eat healthy instead of hawker food. Walk for 1/2 hr everyday before or after work. Or at least just do some stretching exercises around the house. Housework is also a form of exercise.<br><br>Health care costs works both ways - on the government and on the individual. Don't just look at one side without getting to both sides of the story.<br></strong><br><br>like Zoe Tay climbing up the stairs?  you know what else she does besides climbing up the stairs (just once for the TV shoot)?  she goes to expensive gyms and does all the Tai Tai stuff that Tai Tais do.  what do we have to do?  slog all day my friend!  you think we're like President Nathan, nothing better to do, go East Cost for jogging?<br><br>you look two ways doesn't mean this world is two sided only ok?<br><br><strong><br>If you have a healthier society , then the economic burden of chronic diseases will decrease . Less people with less problems mean less costs to the public health system. Am I right in saying so?<br></strong><br><br>you are right.  but how do you get people to exercise, when they come home late from work and plonk straight into bed?<br><br><strong><br>If the society is not healthy , then the burden of disease increases and the healthcare costs of the public increases.<br><br>Read any health economics book - they will tell you the same thing.<br></strong><br><br>actually, you don't have to read health economics books, common sense will tell you that.  and health economics books probably won't tell you that exercise needs time, precious time from family and work.<br><br><strong><br>Don't just focus only on doctors' wages . Use your polyclinic doctors if you cannot afford private general practitioners. Use the public system and wait if you cannot afford to pay private specialist's consultation fees . All this while you have been focusing on wages but that is only one part of the picture. You cannot just suggest improvements on one or two factors without realising there are other factors involved and inter-related.<br></strong><br><br>you don't focus on doctor's wages, you focus on chain smoking and cycling?  i say despite all the anti-smoking campaigns we've always had, what else do you suggest?  lock them away like they do to drug addicts?  and what about cycling?  more deaths on the roads?<br><br><strong><br>You want to make healthcare affordable? You can. Implement Social policies to complement your healthcare policies. Everything must be related to benefit each other instead of being a separate entity. Read about the reforms on NHS and social/economic policies in UK . They are trying to merge health together with other policies to save the healthcare system there.<br><br>That is my point.<br></strong><br><br>well, you started with brushing off our suggestions to increase doctor supply.  now you're saying i forgot about the char kuay tiao and the chain smoking.  you're getting more and more out of point ...<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">surely you could not be missing a sparring partner - who is a mere lay person.<br></div></blockquote>I want to know what alternative you have. I have laid out the implications of a two-tiered healthcare, one for the poor with very basic but cheap healthcare and one for those who can afford the first-world standard of medicine that people like fymk expect..<br><br>I still do not know if you and Singaporeans in general are prepared for a lower standard of healthcare without the patented drugs, without the high-tech medicine, as I have laid out. It makes no difference to those with minor coughs and cold, which resolve without treatment anyway...but it may mean that the poor person unfortunate enough to contract a bacterial infection that is resistant to all the common, generic antibiotics will die. It means that the woman with early breast cancer has to live with a 60% chance of cure instead of 80% and so on...<br><br>Are we prepared for that? For those who want healthcare to be cheaper than it is now, do they have the moral courage to accept the implications of a cheaper, 'more basic' healthcare?<br><br><blockquote>Is Singapore's model the best - with Singaporeans being made to pay for their needed medical attention, especially at your stated "secondary and tertiary levels" ?</blockquote>Do you have an alternative? Are you and Singaporeans prepared to pay higher taxes to fund a system like the NHS in the UK or a co-payment scheme like in Finland with taxes that are many times what we pay?<br><br>And I understand that almost 40% of Singaporeans do not pay taxes after deductions (housewives, low income etc). The tax burden will fall on the middle class that is already hard pressed. Is that fair? With an aging population and a shrinking workforce, how are you going to fund a welfare system without massive immigration?<br><br><blockquote>In a report prepared by the National Center for Policy Analysis - "Medical Savings Accounts: The Singapore Experience" - it was stated that Singapore only spend<br><br>"..... about 3.1 percent of gross domestic product. Even with these low expenditures, the income of Singapore doctors is about the same in relation to <span style="color: red;">average wages </span>as physician income in the United States ..."<br></blockquote>And what are those figures? Look at this website which has listed the salaries of US doctors from various sources:<br><br>http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/TiffanyYam.shtml<br><br>The latest figures from "Physicians and Surgeons. Medical Group Management Association, Physician Compensation and Production Report, 2003" gives a figure between USD$150,267 - $306,964 per year. The lowest is that of the GP at about 150k a year and that is considerably more than what many GPs in Singapore are earning.<br><br>The reason is that  if you look at average wages, you do not see the big picture because the high salaries commanded by a minority (mainly surgeons, O&amp;G doctors) obscure the true income of the majority. It is a basic error in statistics...Particularly in Singapore, where there is a huge discrepancy in salaries between different specialties and between doctors in the private versus government sector, you cannot talk about average wages...the median or mode will give you a better picture...<br><br><blockquote>"Because mandatory Medisave deposits are a percent of wages, deposits are smaller for lower-wage workers, and the least affluent may not be able to pay much out of pocket. Thus the combination of out-of-pocket, Medisave and Medishield payments may not cover all of their medical expenses. </blockquote>Everyone knows that but what is the alternative? Welfare states that fund a comprehensive system based on taxes are finding it difficult to cope all over the world. With an aging population in Singapore, we will face a similar problem with such a scheme. Would tax payers in Singapore be prepared to pay more for those who do not? There are people like fymk who feel that there must be more individual responsibility as well.  Surely smokers should pay more for the consequences of their habits..<br><br><blockquote>If the Government can hand out BILLION Dollars in refunds from surplus tax collections - would it not have been more effective for the Billion Dollars to be placed in a NATIONAL HEALTH "SINKING FUND" so that those who need it most will stand to benefit from it, rather then placing the entire family in desparate situation to source for funding at the last minute.<br></blockquote>Do we have billions in surplus tax collections every year? What about the years when we go into deficit? Tell the patient with cancer to wait for a good year before he gets treated?<br><br>Relying on surpluses to fund a healthcare system is no better than the chronic gambler hoping for a 4-D strike to put food on the table.<br><br><blockquote>It is important to mention here two widely prevalent "myths" (particularly among the policy makers): one is that greater access to better medical care and containing cost of care do not go together. To put it differently, if you are to have the finest medical care system, be prepared for high costs.<br><br>The second myth (some would call it "public expectation" recognized by many scholars, is that high technology is essential for improved health and longevity.<br></blockquote>If you have read my earlier posts carefully, you will note that studies have shown that although there is a general trend globally that with greater health expenditure, life expectancy increases, the correlation is not perfect. In this respect, Singapore has done better than Sweden and the US. The US spend more money on healthcare with the least improvement in life expectancy.<br><br>So I agree with your first myth but is life expectancy is only relevant measure? Does it matter if one stays in hospital for a shorter period and with less pain following a keyhole surgery compared to a long incision? An improvement in survival of 3 months may not be cost effective for the thousands you pay. But is it worth it? Why don't you ask the patient?<br><br>Not being a medical doctor yourself I don't expect you to understand how  advances in technology has transformed healthcare. But you are still avoiding the question. If we restrict non-patent drugs (drugs lose their patent protection after 20 years) to patients in public hospital, we can lower healthcare costs tremendously. If we combine that with outsourcing lab tests to non-accredited labs overseas, employ cheap foreign doctors who do not hold similar internationally recognized qualifications of our doctors, we can lower healthcare costs in public hospitals even more.<br><br>Is that what you want? Do Singaporeans want that? It is easy to criticize but are you prepared to accept the implications?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Snow leopard, coughs and cold seem to be your prime concern. Let me say that as a medical practitioner I agree with you that most of these colds can be handled by a nurse or pharmacist. Most people in UK just get some medication off the counter at the recommendation of the pharamcists anyway, although the price of the medicine may be more than a consultation with medicine in Singapore.<br><br>Most people wih simple cough and colds don't need to see a doctor. The conditions are self limiting and they will get better even without treatment in most instances. The only reason why they see a doctor...and that is a VERY IMPORTANT reason: because their employer needs to see an MC.<br><br>I have previously advocated that the MC system is flawed. Let employers give a variable bonus equivalent to 14 days' salary which will be given in full if the employee does not report sick at all. If the employee reports sick for any reason, no MC is required...just deduct the variable bonus pro rata..<br><br>I have come across malingerers in my clinic who admit they want an MC because they 'lugi' otherwise: they are entitled to 14 days' MC.<br><br>However, forget about coughs and cold for the moment. What about the patients with more serious illnesses? You can't possibly expect them not to be seen by a doctor?<br><br>You seem to think that by taking in more locals, we will have more doctors willing to accept lower pay. Our non-specialist doctors in public hospitals are being paid about 5k-7k , with a 100k debt from medical school here, do you seriously expect them to get less? If you are going to pay them 10k a month, that's more than what they are currently getting anyway.<br><br>For senior doctors, there is an exodus to the private sector in recent years. This movement is so marked that that even LKY is concerned about it, as he said in a recent speech.  We may have a situation where all the high-tech medicine is concentrated in the private sector. That can work if Singaporeans are happy with a lower standard of medical care in public hospitals for more serious illnesses than your cough and cold. Are you and Singaporeans prepared for that?<br><br>If you are, that's not an issue. We can provide relatively good value basic medical care with cheaper foreign doctors and non-accredited labs but of course, don't expect the same standard as those in private hospitals. People like fymk will just have to fork out the money to go to private hospitals for the higher standard of medicine they desire.<br><br>That will provide choice to the people. If you want first world standard of medicine, you have to pay close to first world prices (we will still be more competitive than places in the US because they have a more litigious climate). If you want third world prices for medical care, we can provide that but don't expect the patented drugs that you can still get currently from our polyclinics. Don't expect keyhole surgery and advanced cancer treatment that targets genetric mutations instead of destroying any cell in the body that grows more quickly.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong><br>Snow leopard, coughs and cold seem to be your prime concern. Let me say that as a medical practitioner I agree with you that most of these colds can be handled by a nurse or pharmacist. Most people in UK just get some medication off the counter at the recommendation of the pharamcists anyway, although the price of the medicine may be more than a consultation with medicine in Singapore.<br></strong><br><br>not concerned with coughs and cold per say but concerned with well qualified doctors treating coughs and colds.  glad we see eye to eye.  unfortunately, we don't have the same practice here and someone from the clinic once told me that certain medication for coughs are controlled items that cannot be dispensed from pharmacies.  so a lot can be changed here really ...<br><br><strong><br>Most people wih simple cough and colds don't need to see a doctor. The conditions are self limiting and they will get better even without treatment in most instances. The only reason why they see a doctor...and that is a VERY IMPORTANT reason: because their employer needs to see an MC.<br></strong><br><br>you are right but a cough can be terribly painful and prevent you from sleeping all night.  the MC part i agwee.<br><br><strong><br>I have previously advocated that the MC system is flawed. Let employers give a variable bonus equivalent to 14 days' salary which will be given in full if the employee does not report sick at all. If the employee reports sick for any reason, no MC is required...just deduct the variable bonus pro rata..<br></strong><br><br>then you're discriminating against the old because they genuinely tend to fall sick more than their younger colleagues and you're not encouraging people to take a rest when they really need to take a rest, especially when they are having a flu and in danger of spreading to everyone else.<br><br><strong><br>I have come across malingerers in my clinic who admit they want an MC because they 'lugi' otherwise: they are entitled to 14 days' MC.<br></strong><br><br>yes, the system is open to abuse but it is self-reinforcing.  you can't have someone constantly taking MCs without getting penalised in some way by his own company can you?<br><br><strong><br>However, forget about coughs and cold for the moment. What about the patients with more serious illnesses? You can't possibly expect them not to be seen by a doctor?<br></strong><br><br>good, you're coming along with me rather than brushing me off with some stupid ideas about fat and lazy.  let's say you're in a polyclinic where there are many people.  you install a machine manned by some attendent that dispenses ticket based on your illness category.  if it's cough or flu you go straight to the pharmacist.  no need to waste time, a short interview by pharmacist and you're off with your medicine.  more serious categories, you go to the real doctors.  so instead of having say five doctors manning the polyclinic, you can have one doctor and four pharmacists / nurses.  you just freed up four doctors to do expensive procedures!<br><br>for private clinics, i'm of the opinion if we can get more people to take medication from pharmacists (and allowing them to issue MCs as well), opening up a clinic may become less profitable for doctors who would then be more inclined to perform surgeries that we really are in need of.<br><br><strong><br>You seem to think that by taking in more locals, we will have more doctors willing to accept lower pay. Our non-specialist doctors in public hospitals are being paid about 5k-7k , with a 100k debt from medical school here, do you seriously expect them to get less? If you are going to pay them 10k a month, that's more than what they are currently getting anyway.<br></strong><br><br>no, no.  you see, of course the doctors won't be willing to accept lower pay.  so what will happen is that they will pursue the specialist route instead of opening up a clinic, which will be made less profitable.  so instead of being paid less, they will end up being paid more and we end up having more specialists that would ease the acute shortage, bring down costs and make better lives for specialists themselves who would see more of their kind helping one another out.<br><br><strong><br>For senior doctors, there is an exodus to the private sector in recent years. This movement is so marked that that even LKY is concerned about it, as he said in a recent speech. We may have a situation where all the high-tech medicine is concentrated in the private sector. That can work if Singaporeans are happy with a lower standard of medical care in public hospitals for more serious illnesses than your cough and cold. Are you and Singaporeans prepared for that?<br></strong><br><br>you are right.  this is what is happening now and it is a vicious cycle.  all doctors are required to serve a bond of a few years in govt hospitals.  many become jaded with the heavy workload and choose to open their own private practice instead.  it's the most natural tendency, decent life, self employed, good earnings.  when most of the doctors we train end up checking coughs and colds, there aren't many left for specialist roles.  so we need to reverse that trend by pushing them in the right way ...<br><br><strong><br>If you are, that's not an issue. We can provide relatively good value basic medical care with cheaper foreign doctors and non-accredited labs but of course, don't expect the same standard as those in private hospitals. People like fymk will just have to fork out the money to go to private hospitals for the higher standard of medicine they desire.<br></strong><br><br>i'm still more comfortable with our own people.  i got my teeth cleaned for free by a nurse as a kid.  i don't mind, its an equally good job.  now i pay $80 per session, that's daylight robbery!  if we allow nurses the licence to providing cleaning services for us all, you can be sure that $80 fee will plummet like a shooting star.  before fymk asks me to go to the polyclinic again, i'd like to say that appointment dates can be six months down the road, too painful for any jaw to take ...<br></blockquote></div>

You will take it apart and criticise it in separate parts. Go to the library - borrow the book and read it. No one is asking you to buy it.<br><br>You want healthcare cheap - you have to give something up like travel . Not that I am saying I always use private specialists but I do use polyclinic doctors mostly when I was in Singapore because of my lower pay scale in Singapore and I want to save money. Now I can afford specialists in Australia , of course I would pay to use them since I have been stuck with certain problems which never went away and which even polyclinic doctors missed out on .<br><br>Waiting lists will be in effect once you start cutting down on specialist's pay . Most specialists might move off to private sectors. 6 months won't be a problem for you , 12 months will be. Australia has the problem of this already if you are on the public system. Only people with private health insurance will be able to afford what is termed as queue jumping.<br><br>Yes we can all free up the poor overloaded doctors to work on more important cases. Get nurse practitioners in . But then again , would the community accept them readily?  If going to a polyclinic is so difficult for one person like you , then how about seeing a nurse practitioner?<br><br>I liked the dental nurses when i was in school. But they needed to get a dental surgeon in to fix my broken tooth in the end .<br><br>So if the nurse practitioner cannot treat the problem of the patient - what would happen? You have to pay her and then she refers you to a doctor - then you have to pay the doctor for treatment . Double payment when you can just go see a polyclinic doctor in the end for 8 dollars a consult. We are not talking about diabetic nurse educators , stoma nurse educators - we are talking about a semi independent nurse practitioners. How about training? Their training has to be more stringent.<br><br>The only reason why they use nurse practitioners in UK and Australia is because of the large areas they have to service. UK is more of an economic reason since NHS is slowly eroding and seriously NHS system does not impress me at all. Nurse practitioners in Australia is there because of the reason that there are not enough doctors in the rural/remote areas and it is better to have someone experienced who still can control symptoms or treat injuries ,at a more advanced level than a lay person , than NO one at all. It is cost efficient for countries who use them because of geographical size. Unless there is a demand for them , pursuing the cause of nurse practitioner may not be efficient at all.</div>

They act as the first line detection grid.    Just so you know.<br><br>5. If every doctor decides to specialise  - who is going to be your gp? Where is the business going to come from? High Demand for GPs vs low supply of GPs = higher cost for the consumer. Basic health economics .<br><br>[/quote]</div>

You will take it apart and criticise it in separate parts. Go to the library - borrow the book and read it. No one is asking you to buy it.<br></strong><br><br>it is precisely because it is not good enough that is why it can be torn apart.  if you have thought through the ideas instead of merely regurgitating them, no one would be able to tear them apart.<br><br><strong><br>You want healthcare cheap - you have to give something up like travel .<br></strong><br><br>it wasn't as if it used to be expensive when it was located around the corner ...<br><br><strong><br>Not that I am saying I always use private specialists but I do use polyclinic doctors mostly when I was in Singapore because of my lower pay scale in Singapore and I want to save money. Now I can afford specialists in Australia , of course I would pay to use them since I have been stuck with certain problems which never went away and which even polyclinic doctors missed out on .<br></strong><br><br>again, you pay for your special conditions, nothing more.<br><br><strong><br>Waiting lists will be in effect once you start cutting down on specialist's pay . Most specialists might move off to private sectors. 6 months won't be a problem for you , 12 months will be. Australia has the problem of this already if you are on the public system. Only people with private health insurance will be able to afford what is termed as queue jumping.<br></strong><br><br>just endorse the dental nurse to do it, the waiting lists will vanquish in no time.  anything more than a month is pathetically inefficient.  so australia has a problem therefore its ok for us to have the same problems?<br><br><strong><br>Yes we can all free up the poor overloaded doctors to work on more important cases. Get nurse practitioners in . But then again , would the community accept them readily? If going to a polyclinic is so difficult for one person like you , then how about seeing a nurse practitioner?<br></strong><br><br>when we have lots of nurse practitioners, we can afford to open up many more branches at more convenient locations, going to polyclinics would be easy once again ... for a person like me ...<br><br><strong><br>I liked the dental nurses when i was in school. But they needed to get a dental surgeon in to fix my broken tooth in the end .<br></strong><br><br>yeah but how often you get a broken tooth versus how often you need to get your teeth cleaned and polished?  how many times must i say so that you can understand?  most of what the dentist does can easily be done by a dental nurse or anybody who gets six months training on the machine.<br><br><strong><br>So if the nurse practitioner cannot treat the problem of the patient - what would happen? You have to pay her and then she refers you to a doctor - then you have to pay the doctor for treatment . Double payment when you can just go see a polyclinic doctor in the end for 8 dollars a consult. We are not talking about diabetic nurse educators , stoma nurse educators - we are talking about a semi independent nurse practitioners. How about training? Their training has to be more stringent.<br></strong><br><br>you saw 15 doctors all of whom could not diagnose your problem and you end up seeing a specialist.  so do you go back to those 15 doctors and ask for a refund?<br><br>if the nurse can treat 80% of what we need at a fraction of what dentists charge, we are more than happy to accept them.<br><br><strong><br>The only reason why they use nurse practitioners in UK and Australia is because of the large areas they have to service. UK is more of an economic reason since NHS is slowly eroding and seriously NHS system does not impress me at all. Nurse practitioners in Australia is there because of the reason that there are not enough doctors in the rural/remote areas and it is better to have someone experienced who still can control symptoms or treat injuries ,at a more advanced level than a lay person , than NO one at all. It is cost efficient for countries who use them because of geographical size. Unless there is a demand for them , pursuing the cause of nurse practitioner may not be efficient at all.<br></strong><br><br>really?  they use nurses in the UK and aussie?  my goodness, my idea's not that bad after all eh?  so you see?  it doesn't matter if it's the nurse or the doctor who treats you as long as he/she is properly trained.  how do you know there is no demand if you don't even supply it?  how can you say it is not efficient when it's being practised elsewhere and we used to have it too?<br></blockquote></div>
