Doesn't matter if you are clinical nurse specialist.<br><br>In Australia.<br>If the nurse has the bachelors, Grade point average must be at least 3.5 for everything with double weightage given to the third year.<br>Then the nurse takes the GAMSAT which is worse than the MCAT - score about 60% percentile to ensure an interview into a recognised university.  If they pass the interview which is not too easy- it will be 4 years minimum for the medical degree.<br></strong><br><br>you have gotten me all wrong.  maybe i didn't explain myself clear enough.  i am not converting these nurses into full fledged doctors, for that would be counter productive.  i'm not asking people to spend 3 years getting a nursing degree followed by 4 years to get a medical degree.  you spend a total of 7 years to become a doctor when all you need is 5 years.<br><br>what i'm saying is we convert the nurses into a new profession with a new title, maybe clinical practitioner or something like that.  this new profession will have all the competence that the doctor has in and only in a clinic environment, which is really not too much to ask of them considering it is just common day to day mild illnesses.<br><br><strong><br>But then again snow leopard makes it sound so easy.<br><br>First of all you have to get NUS or NTU to agree on a 2.5 shortcut medical degree. Then you have to get people to pick and choose out of the syllables to give the nurse /pharmacists a qualified recognition.<br>- 1. Everything is evidenced based now - you have to ensure half the degree is made out of how to scrutinise evidence based research.<br>-2. You need to retrain them on pathophysiology , anatomy which takes at least 3 years from theory to application .<br><br>So snow leopard - you have ideas - so how would you implement it?<br></strong><br><br>what you have listed can be done as they have been done in many other faculties.  on top of that as i say again, in case you read me incorrectly again, i am not asking for these nurses to be converted into full fledged doctors, only doctors certified for private clinics.  surely they do not need three years to cover those parts of the anatomy that a doctor in a clinic setting is required to know?<br><br>furthermore, given their experiences, they probably already know.  the important thing is that these nurses are already experienced and competent enough to handle patients in a clinic setting.  the conversion course is just a formality to cement their status.  we can even do away with that and stick to exams and interviews.  as long as these folks pass stringent exams and interviews specifically meant to test doctors in a clinic setting, there is no reason to doubt their capabilities.<br></blockquote></div>

I have been trained as one  - I worked in the acute sector and yes sometimes intern have to consult the senior nurse specialist on how to handle problems. However a nurse only specialises in one area , that doesn't mean she sees other clinical problems, unlike the houseman/intern they rotate around for about 2-3 years to gain a wider experience of other clinical areas before deciding on a specialty .<br><br>They don't rotate nurses around for long periods of time . Nurses stick to their ward and the designated specialty. yes you have community health nurses but some of them are long out of touch with independent diagnosis of acute problems.<br><br>I know of specialist nurses in cardiology but they cannot deal with intensive care area while the stoma nurse only knows how to assess a stoma, how to teach a patient how to deal with his/her stoma, whether the stoma is working but give her an 12 lead ECG and a arterial blood gas reading - she is lost . Sure we have competent nurses, no doubt about that - just in the area they always practise in that they are very competent. Put a cardiology specialist nurse to deal in the infectious disease area or work in an orthopaedic area- you get a literal  fish out of the water. Community health nursing education in Singapore is not  too advanced . They focus more on primary prevention ,  primary health care delivery , health assessment and community education. Even a nurse like me can do community nursing in Singapore.<br><br>You want nurse practitioners?Sure<br>Think of all your potential problems<br><br>Firstly which singaporean wants to see a nurse practitioner. In singaporean culture, don't forget about the kiasu and the kia see people.<br><br>Secondly , if the pay is crap at the end of their program , do you think nurses will be retained ? Plus added responsibilities, make a mistake and the nurse lose her registration which means end of a career. Most nurses will think like that - it is like a loss of livelihood. It is just like a lawyer getting debarred - loss of a livelihood - it means that the lawyer cannot practice anywhere<br>I remembered a hospital in Singapore wanted to teach nurses to cannulate so that they can free up time for the houseman to get around his business. Do you want to know what my ex colleagues and schoolmates said to me? They said why should they get the responsibility and the blame if  something goes wrong through no fault of theirs especially when there is no money involved .<br>I am all for nurses getting more responsibilities - however more responsibilities must come with more income earnt and indemnity protection . How much MORE do you want to pay senior nurses? I am well aware that some senior nurses earn as much as a houseman does .<br><br>The reason why nurse practitioners are good in rural areas of australia is because they are like the doctors there - rely on the basics of health assessment and basic equipment. In addition they know the people around well enough, their habits , the town gossip etc  plus people in small towns will know almost everyone around. However regional and rural health is still below par compared to big metropolitan areas because of the lack of manpower, advanced equipment and lack of specialists. I won't do rural nursing because it is too basic in equipment and all you pray is that the medical helicopter comes fast while you try to stabilise the patient using BASIC methods. I have plenty of respect for rural nurse practitioners . I came from the major metropolitan hospital and I seen the patients who the rural general practitioner and rural nurse practitioner stabilised long enough to ensure their survival with just PLAIN BASICS. I spoken to a few nurses who worked in the rural areas and they are good as any doctor in health assessment because they see the whole community - they actually go to the homes to see sick kids and adults. If they cannot deal with it - they have to call up the rural GP and if he cannot deal with it - he calls the bigger regional or metropolitan hospitals. If it is just one nurse practitioner - she can radio a doctor to discuss the problem and it will decided if the patient goes to the better equiped hospital . That is EXTREMELY different from Singapore.<br><br>Even in Singapore, the polyclinics are better equiped than the rural outback hospitals.<br><br></div>

I cannot however afford peanuts.....heard that one peanut is too expensive in singapore.<br><br>I do not work as a nurse anymore. I am working in a different sector which deals with the healthcare system but in terms of policy implementation and costs. I can tell you how frustrated I am about it but I learnt quite a bit more.<br><br>Anyhow , I think the health system is best co runned by a health economist , a doctor and a nurse. Health economist will tell you the costs , a doctor will tell you what is required and a nurse will tell you the impact on the patients .<br><br>I think a good health minister will always consult the major medical and health professionals as well as the consumers before implementing something. Does not matter if he or she is a medical professional. Just matters that policy does not flow just from top down but both ways which includes the grassroots .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I did have an idea on cost cutting for Singapore Health System<br><br>Centralise everything again. You cut out unnecessary agencies.<br><br>I remembered a WHO consultant who went to Singapore to help out with SARS outbreak telling a group of us on how wonderful he thought the technology was there but there was a problem with the collation of data because everything was not centralised. They actually had to get more people to try and fix the surveillance database to fit it into central data collection. Each hospital was reporting on different wards and there was difficulty acquiring actual new cases . To be fair to the government , he however did say the health minister was very helpful in providing resources and would try his best in that testing time .  I am not sure if that system was improved but that was the problem back then.<br><br>I think too much concentration has been given on ISO quality control. They should switch it to a performance based measure on producing a result within an acceptable standard  rather than to compare and upgrade in terms of EVERYTHING from customer service to medical care to even the bloody laundry service or the cleanliness of the toilet.<br><br>With performance measures, you can actually determine if the CEOs or the minister is actually delivering, rather than to waste time and alot of money on beautiful ISO results and glossy reports or some stupid crystal decoration . Delivery of the results will give them a bonus but non delivery means a cut to their pay.<br><br>In addition, you will actually spare the health professionals and doctors from performing MORE paperwork than necessary for legalities. They could actually concentrate on treating people.<br><br>Polyclinic will do well with income means test but Singapore has the problem of the poor "rich" who have a mercedes benz and a condominium and a heck lot of debts to pay off.<br><br>I think best thing is to have an inverse income means test and debt test as well for those who are trying to qualify for private class because if they cannot pay - the healthcare system is actually burdened with unrepaid costs until it can be fully paid off. Not only that the family gets stuck with a massive bill and that will conversely affect their own health when they see the actual bill.<br><br>I think social policies , in terms of employment, need a bit of tweaking as well because snow leopard did say that work can wreak havoc on a person's health. That is where you can actually save the most money by lowering the healthcare burden in the long term rather than looking at short term results.<br><br>Nurses will come in useful for preventative health and direct hospital nursing referrals to community nurses to deal with simple post admission problem. I am not sure if you have it now since I have been out of the loop . Involve the allied health professionals as well since physiotherapists and occupational therapists can prove useful for an ageing population.<br><br>Cough syrups, lozenges , panadol should not be subsidised in any case. They are cheap as they come. Cough syrups and lozenges only relief symptoms and have limited benefits.<br><br></div>

That is what Australia does. The government subsidises 30% of the costs. If the person is above a certain income and have no private health insurance - tax them extra according to an income strata.

Good competent medical care and not dying as a result of a policy move or rather a say so. I look at the macro view not your micro view of promoting cheap but unnecessary manpower.<br><br>All you ever talk about is paying some doctor to see coughs and cold . Then when I said polyclinic - you said that you are not interested in travelling and why not have advanced nurse practitioners etc . Now let me put it to you this way - where do you think advanced nurse practitioners will be placed? IN A POLYCLINIC WHERE DOCTOR'S FEE are just 8 bucks per pop . There is no profitability of doing advanced nursing in a private setting all around for people who do not want to travel - cost of renting a private premise? Cost of running a "cheap" nursing clinic ? HOW much will the patient be actually paying ? You have a long term sustainability issue . If something is not sustainable - it will just fall apart and public money just gets wasted. Nothing learnt , nothing  gained except for a bunch of nurses who will get lost in the system if the idea fall apart.<br><br>Seriously people would just pay to see a doctor nearby, like you said - you rather get to a nearby gp .<br><br>I think most people still would rather see a doctor except for yourself. The SARS or Avian Flu scare was enough to remind quite a few people when they get symptoms resembling either one of these but when they are actually in fact having a mild cold.<br><br>I don't think Singapore will be able to handle advanced nurse practitioners - it is not necessary in terms of economic costs or workforce shortage. You have gps who are happy being gps . It is only when there is no gp or the gp cannot cope then you bring in advanced nurse practitioners.<br><br>What you have suggested so far is akin to paying for paying 20 dollars for a shoe that lasts 1 year instead of a 100 dollar shoe that last you 10 years which actually more value for money.  20 x 10 years = 200 dollars while on a 100 dollar shoe, it is just a 100 dollars . So like I said before penny wise pound foolish.<br><br>Singapore already have a nursing shortage in the acute/ hospital sector - nurses come and nurses go and you want some new scheme to take away nurses where they are most needed -  it will be hard to balance it out. Now doctors are slowly going into the ranks of international shortage as well - they will come and they will go as well .  Singapore is doing its best to retain healthcare professionals but against international demand and offers - it is hard for a small country. Sure some nurses may be happy where they are - good for them. Half of the people I knew from my nursing days have already left for greener pastures. Go address the problem of retention first.<br><br>If you want to make the healthcare system cheaper - look at the whole system and how it is runned and understand how money  flow through it. Healthcare is always a blackhole for funding. Don't blame me for the lack of comprehension of your proposal or me for being intelligently stumped by your ideas - I debated my fair share and so far you have shown me nothing to support your case.<br><br>Atobe's idea of a sinking fund is good although I might not agree with his public health insurance for all. At least he bothered to research . You just shut off books and use "commonsense" . May I remind you that all governments run on a different level of commonsense. Policies are made for economic efficacy and efficiency because governments have to justify to their citizens the costs . No working model , no proven feasibility = no funding , unless it is heavily politicised with alot of pressure like SARS which was an pandemic . I don't think Singaporeans in general would want to pay to see an advanced nurse practitioner in a polyclinic - they want their money's worth of seeing a doctor. Unless the current government says they have to and make it so.<br><br>First thing to do if you get a new government on may 6 instead of the same regular one is to ask them to open the books - be very transparent and then examine where the true costs are going to.  Don't bother telling me to get that for you - you are the typical citizen with rights to know where your tax money is going, just like me but I am overseas so I don't have the same access like you do.<br><br>If you have something solid , then bring it out instead of giving me the "cough and cold " reason of not paying for a gp or whinging about how private doctors earn their money . That is the impression I am getting.<br><br></div>
