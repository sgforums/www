How do you propose to subsidise/pay for advanced medical education locally and overseas for doctors ( most surgeons do training overseas) ?<br></strong><br><br>they can take loans, from savings (they are not poor people, mind you) and with each attainment of a higher specialist level, their corresponding scope of responsibility (and pay) increases as well.<br><br><strong><br>2. How about doctors who might enjoy community health delivery?<br></strong><br><br>what about that?<br><br><strong><br>3. Have you ever considered the ethical moral of pushing doctors to do a specialty against their will?<br></strong><br><br>who's asking anybody to go against their will?  there are so many specialties, take your pick.  if you do not want to advance as a doctor to eventually become a specialist then don't be one in the first place.  be a nurse practioner, that is enough for you to man a clinic, if that's really what you want to do.<br><br><strong><br>4. Give me the statistics on how many doctors wanted to do medicine to treat coughs and colds only?<br></strong><br><br>i don't know of many doctors who want to treat coughs and colds but i do know a lot of doctors who end up treating mostly coughs and colds.  more people take pork than they do take lamb.  you want the statistics, go get it yourself.<br><br><strong><br>Sometimes gps or polyclinic doctors also follow up on post surgical cases, monitor hypertension/diabetes/asthma of the patient and adjust their medications.<br></strong><br><br>and how much more difficult are these over coughs and colds?<br><br><strong><br>They also form the foundation of sentinel surveillance of any odd infectious occurence - think SARS/MEASLES/DENGUE- they are the first ones who will see and refer or even sometimes diagnose infectious diseases before the hospital gets the patients in and before the health system even know there is an outbreak . They act as the first line detection grid. Just so you know.<br></strong><br><br>yeah but that comprises a series of steps and some rules which any nurse practitioner can acquire right?<br><br><strong><br>5. If every doctor decides to specialise - who is going to be your gp?<br></strong><br><br>the nurse practioner or the pharmacist lah.<br><br><strong><br>Where is the business going to come from?

            <div class='col-md body'>I love deficient answers - not every doctor is rich and not every doctor is poor.<br><br>Tell me do you really know how the healthcare system work in and out in Singapore , snow leopard?  From the backend to the front end. From primary care systems to tertiary care systems.<br><br>I am no expert in it but I can see this argument is not within reason especially the part where you seem to imply is that " all doctors are rich ". Not all are rich. Some make enough to get by. Just because you might have saw one doctor's paycheck , doesn't mean that all doctors live in private housing - some do live in HDB flats and with loans to pay off.<br><br>Statistics - if there is no  needs survey done of the community and how many people will actually use a nurse practitioner - then forget about such a policy. every policy is backed by a pilot study , a consumer needs survey and then they check it for feasibility and evidence of cost cutting which means  you need the statistics .

Measles fall into infectious disease and by law you have to quarantine the person with measles from the population. It is in no way minor.<br><br>Hrm how is diabetes different from cough or cold? Diabetes is a chronic illness which can cause serious complications . It affects the whole system from kidney function to the blood circulation in veins of the legs to the immune system to the eye if not controlled properly. Hypertension are known to cause strokes, can be a symptom of heart trouble , renal trouble etc . Oh yes What can I say about asthma - never give beta blockers ( a type of antihypertensive medication which is also used for heart conditions)  when the person with asthma because it can cause problems for their breathing. OH WAIT....don't tell me - you thought it was so simple? Just dispense out medications?  Oh wait ....it is only very minor - just like cancer ( NOT).<br><br>You  can say you are young and you need just a low cost nurse practitioner but how about thinking of the elderly population who have alot of illnesses and not to mention plenty of medications? Bearing in mind , the elderly population will start to grow. Just because you might not need a general practitioner due to your youth doesn't mean other people won't need one.<br><br></div>

Japan - everything is expensive - if you own an apartment the size of a HDB 3 bed room place- you are a millionaire. Most of the latest technology is coming from USA and  Europe, the new life saving drugs from european and american pharmaceutical companies - look at our conversion rate even.

I am all for terminal patients receiving pallative care but hey what if their relatives don't accept it? If you stop them , they will say that you are letting their loved one die without trying and they might attempt to sue . There are processes to Grief , two of which is undesirable : Denial and Anger.

This is not said in jest, as I have seen close members of families and friends going through the anguish and pain to let their love one move on - some as young as six years old (too young to make any independent choice).</span><br><br></div>

This certainly suggests you are not aware of the numerous breakthroughs that have been in recent years, particularly in cancer treatment.<br><br><blockquote>The Japanese Tax system is not punative in its DIRECT Personal and Corporate Income Tax, nor in its INDIRECT Tax schemes covering a whole host of consumption tax, inheritance tax, stamp duties, and with exemptions even granted on domestic transaction of assets.<br></blockquote>The Japanese have an income tax rate of up to 40-50% That does seem alot more than what I am paying. The top income tax rate here is only about 22%. In any case, there is a danger of using taxes to finance a healthcare system.

That money came from government surpluses like those you mentioned. If people who manage the funds can earn billions, then yes, they deserve their millions or else they will go elsewhere.

I have known drug addicts who accumulate bottles of such cough mixtures and people have been known to die from drinking litres of it..<br><br><blockquote>you're not encouraging people to take a rest when they really need to take a rest, especially when they are having a flu and in danger of spreading to everyone else.<br></blockquote>No discrimination here and sick people should take a rest.

The reason why you would go to the polyclinic is to get an MC...I have worked in 3 polyclinics before and I can tell you that I have seen patients who just collect the MC and go next door to buy a better cough mixture from the private pharmacy.<br><br>Are you suggesting to let the nurse give out MCs instead? Might as well abolish the MC system in that case.<br><br><blockquote>so what will happen is that they will pursue the specialist route instead of opening up a clinic, which will be made less profitable. so instead of being paid less, they will end up being paid more and we end up having more specialists that would ease the acute shortage, </blockquote>By the way, not every doctor who wants to specialize succeeds. The average pass rate for many specialist examinations like radiology and pathology is only about 40%. And those who make it will obviously want to charge a rate that is commensurate with their skills and knowledge. Since Singaporean specialists have internationally recognized qualifications and can go elsewhere, we have to pay them first world salaries. So what happens when a poor citizen has cancer or heart failure instead of a cough and needs a specialist?<br><br>If he can afford the private sector, that's not an issue. If he cannot afford it and has to see someone in the public sector, then will he find the specialist he needs there? If the public hospital pays doctors much less to cut healthcare costs, how can they afford the specialist who demands the same salary as the private sector?<br><br>The way we do it at the moment is to give doctors a bond to specialize overseas. But of course, since the private sector pays so much better, doctors simply break their bonds when they return. Another way is to employ foreign specialist doctors who do NOT have internationally recognized qualifications. (Those who do will demand the same high salaries as local specialists). They cannot work in UK or the US and so will be willing to accept lower salaries. But are we willing to accept that?<br><br><blockquote>if we allow nurses the licence to providing cleaning services for us all, you can be sure that $80 fee will plummet like a shooting star.</blockquote>I agree and I am sure the Minister for Health will absolutely agree as well. Let more dental nurses do teeth cleaning for those who only want to have their teeth cleaned. Of course don't expect these nurses to be able to pick up subtle gum or root canal disease unless you complain about a toothache. But yes, I agree with you that we should deploy our dentists to do higher value jobs.<br><br>Unfortunately, you know, my colleagues are telling me that you can earn more giving botox injections to perfectly healthy people than treating sick diabetic patients with a mountain of complications. Why are doctors doing the job of beauticians instead of focusing on our true mission to help the sick? Because that's where the money is...<br><br></div>

But our nurses have to be better supported.<br><br>There must be access to doctors for consultation when they encounter something beyond their expertise. I think that's why we don't have more dental nurses who can do cleaning and polishing work. Most dentists in Singapore no longer work in the public sector and those who do are highly trained dental surgeons and oromaxillofacial surgeons who handle complex cases. I was told NOT to go to the National Dental Clinic for my teeth to be cleaned...they want to see complex cases only.<br><br>There are hardly any dentists left in the public sector to supervise dental nurses. But yes, I agree with you that we should have more dental nurses in the public sector to do cleaning and polishing work...but then most of the dentists in the private sector will go bankrupt...<br><br>For medical problems, we can have nurse practitioners who handle patients with chronic illnesses. In fact, we do have them....more than 10 years ago I used to refer my stable diabetics and hypertensives to our nurse practitioners who will see them for their monthly medication, unless their condition changes.<br><br>Can we get nurse practitioners to see cough and cold? Apart from the problem with MCs, I have no objections and I think with training, they can do quite a good job. The biggest fear is to miss a pneumonia but now that we have X-ray machines in the polyclinics, it is easier to diagnose these cases as well. But yes, they will have to buy malpractice insurance like doctors. Wonder what fymk think of this...<br><br>I doubt that kiasu Singaporeans will accept it though, especially if it involves children. Although I think to the ah peks, seeing a Hokkien-speaking nurse practitioner is probably much better than an English-speaking Indian doctor for his high blood pressure.<br></div>

Look something have to give . this is my personal opinion.<br></blockquote>I agree with fymk that $8 consultation fee in the polyclinic is really very low and I don't think most Singaporeans can really find fault with that. It's the cost of hospitalisation and medication for chronic illnesses that's the problem.<br><br>There was an article in the straits times recently about a diabetic patient who has to pay $450+ for 3 months' worth of medication (from a public hospital). The problem is that doctors are prescribing the best medication with the least side effects for each patient. The price is set by the drug company, not the hospital and not the government. We cannot make it cheaper unless doctors do not prescribe patented drugs. If we want the best, we have to pay more for it. It's either we pay directly or indirectly by taxes.<br><br>Atobe talks about using surpluses. I have no objection with that but what happens during years when the economy experiences a downturn?

Then again that's my opinion and yes you seem keen on a vendetta rather than actually discussing constructive , just judging from the way you answer. </blockquote>Most doctors did not come into this profession for the money. We know we can earn much more in finance or law. Most people started out wanting to be doctors to help people and in return, society renders healthcare staff a special place in society and respect. The terms 'missy' and 'lau goon' were once honorifics sufficient for many to aspire to be a nurse or doctor. Medical school education was almost completely subsidized by tax payers and medical staff enjoy free medical benfits. In return, doctors have the moral obligation to serve the public even if they do not earn as much as their skills and training command.<br><br>Unfortunately, that 'social contract' has been eroded. When I entered medical school, my fees were heavily subsidized by taxpayers and so I have a social responsibility to serve the public even though I can earn three times more in the private sector. Nowadays, medical students are expected to pay the bulk of the fees and end up with a $100k debt when they graduate. We do not enjoy any special medical benefits even though we are exposed to the risks of deadly infections like the SARS virus, which killed a number of our colleagues. The government and society now considers medicine as a commercial transaction like any other.<br><br>Do you not expect doctors to demand remuneration as someone would in a purely commercial transaction? It is sad that we have come to this state of affairs, but the clock cannot be turned back.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong><br>There is a very good reason for that: certain cough mixtures contain opiates (opium-like substances) which supresses cough but as you know, are often abused by drug addicts. I have known drug addicts who accumulate bottles of such cough mixtures and people have been known to die from drinking litres of it..<br></strong><br><br>yes, it was the cough mixture that was a controlled item that i supposed couldn't get from the pharmacist.  that's why i feel the role of the pharmacist can be expanded and enhanced so that he or she can perform diagnosis and prescribe particular cough mixtures in a controlled way.  that way, we need not go back to the doctor and be charged a premium.<br><br><strong><br>No discrimination here and sick people should take a rest. Their salaries won't be cut...we are talking about an additional bonus if you stay healthy.<br></strong><br><br>yes, but everyone would want to earn maximum bonus by not taking MC at all, which would be detrimental to their health ...<br><br><strong><br>As I said, if you have a cough and want some cough mixture, you can just get it from Guardian Pharmacy. The reason why you would go to the polyclinic is to get an MC...I have worked in 3 polyclinics before and I can tell you that I have seen patients who just collect the MC and go next door to buy a better cough mixture from the private pharmacy.<br></strong><br><br>as we've discussed above, certain controlled cough mixtures aren't available over the counter from Guardian Pharmacy.  but if the pharmacist at Guardian can be 'upgraded' to also hold a proper diagnosis role, he would be able to dispense the controlled cough mixture perhaps more cheaply than a doctor would.<br><br>come to think of it, if we allow pharmacists to give MCs, people would go to the pharmacists for MCs instead of bogging down the doctor who would then have more time for patients.  isn't that good too?<br><br><strong><br>Are you suggesting to let the nurse give out MCs instead? Might as well abolish the MC system in that case.<br></strong><br><br>what's wrong with that?  you don't trust the nurse's ability to read a patient's health condition or you don't trust his or her moral integrity to give out MCs?<br><br><strong><br>By the way, not every doctor who wants to specialize succeeds. The average pass rate for many specialist examinations like radiology and pathology is only about 40%.<br></strong><br><br>yes, like driving test, fail just try again.<br><br><strong><br>And those who make it will obviously want to charge a rate that is commensurate with their skills and knowledge. Since Singaporean specialists have internationally recognized qualifications and can go elsewhere, we have to pay them first world salaries.<br></strong><br><br>remember you said that some specialists earn millions?  we're not making paupers out of them, just increasing the competition so that they perhaps earn a couple of hundred thousand dollars less.  they would still command a significant premium over the masses, a premium good enough to make them stay.<br><br><strong><br>So what happens when a poor citizen has cancer or heart failure instead of a cough and needs a specialist?<br>If he can afford the private sector, that's not an issue. If he cannot afford it and has to see someone in the public sector, then will he find the specialist he needs there? If the public hospital pays doctors much less to cut healthcare costs, how can they afford the specialist who demands the same salary as the private sector?<br><br>The way we do it at the moment is to give doctors a bond to specialize overseas. But of course, since the private sector pays so much better, doctors simply break their bonds when they return. Another way is to employ foreign specialist doctors who do NOT have internationally recognized qualifications. (Those who do will demand the same high salaries as local specialists). They cannot work in UK or the US and so will be willing to accept lower salaries. But are we willing to accept that?<br></strong><br><br>it is fundamentally an issue of inbalance between demand and supply.  we don't have enough surgeons so whatever few we have are readily lapped up by private hospitals which can afford to pay premium salaries.  but the moment we churn out enough surgeons that more than meets demand, there is no way private hospitals can absorb all the extra surgeons and still pay them premium salaries.  after all, singapore is only that big and can only support that many surgeons.  so when that happens, the inequilibrium will slowly ease.  but we can only make surgeons out of doctors, not out of nurses or pharmacists.  as such, flooding the market with inexpensive clinic services will push doctors towards a higher level, a situation that benefits everyone.<br><br>we also need to remember that it is not just the pull factor of money but also the disatisfaction doctors have of govt hospitals that compels them to make the jump to private hospitals.  in this respect, hospital management can be improved.<br><br>i do not rule out your suggestion although i am uncomfortable.  one way is that, if these foreign doctors accept, we get them to go through some form of conversion course in our medical school and pass our exams set at stringent levels.<br><br><strong><br>I agree and I am sure the Minister for Health will absolutely agree as well. Let more dental nurses do teeth cleaning for those who only want to have their teeth cleaned. Of course don't expect these nurses to be able to pick up subtle gum or root canal disease unless you complain about a toothache. But yes, I agree with you that we should deploy our dentists to do higher value jobs.<br></strong><br><br>glad you see the merit of the idea.<br><br><strong><br>Unfortunately, you know, my colleagues are telling me that you can earn more giving botox injections to perfectly healthy people than treating sick diabetic patients with a mountain of complications. Why are doctors doing the job of beauticians instead of focusing on our true mission to help the sick? Because that's where the money is...<br></strong><br><br>yes, doctors becoming beauticians isn't something we would respect very much.  similarly, though to a lesser degree, doctors not taking up the scapel but instead sets up his own clinic, making comfortable living out of treating coughs and colds isn't very commendable either.<br><br>i suppose as long as we keep botox expensive, it remains exclusive to the rich and exclusivity means the demand remans small and can only support a small number of beautician doctors.<br></blockquote></div>

It's the cost of hospitalisation and medication for chronic illnesses that's the problem.<br></strong><br><br>fymk kept badgering about $8 and i never bothered to reply.  you know why?  it never was an issue to me.  what he constantly fails to understand is that i'm not concerned about the $8 per say but the fact that $8 plus govt subsidies is keeping the doctor in a clinic when he ought to be treating chronic illnesses.  when we free doctors from clinics and put them in hospitals to treat chronic illnesses, we abate the costs of treating those illnesses.<br><br><strong><br>There was an article in the straits times recently about a diabetic patient who has to pay $450+ for 3 months' worth of medication (from a public hospital). The problem is that doctors are prescribing the best medication with the least side effects for each patient. The price is set by the drug company, not the hospital and not the government. We cannot make it cheaper unless doctors do not prescribe patented drugs. If we want the best, we have to pay more for it. It's either we pay directly or indirectly by taxes.<br></strong><br><br>yes if the patient cannot afford the best and the next best is good enough, why not?  we do not have control over drug companies so i cannot suggest anything to improve costs other than lament that drug companies charge too much.  but we can do something to increase our pool of doctors treating chronic illnesses by minimising their time spent in clinics prescribing cough and flu medicine.<br><br><strong><br>Atobe talks about using surpluses. I have no objection with that but what happens during years when the economy experiences a downturn? What if we have a deficit for that year? What will we do with the patients then?<br></strong><br><br>i suppose we need to use some and save some.<br><br><strong><br>Most doctors did not come into this profession for the money. We know we can earn much more in finance or law. Most people started out wanting to be doctors to help people and in return, society renders healthcare staff a special place in society and respect. The terms 'missy' and 'lau goon' were once honorifics sufficient for many to aspire to be a nurse or doctor. Medical school education was almost completely subsidized by tax payers and medical staff enjoy free medical benfits. In return, doctors have the moral obligation to serve the public even if they do not earn as much as their skills and training command.<br><br>Unfortunately, that 'social contract' has been eroded. When I entered medical school, my fees were heavily subsidized by taxpayers and so I have a social responsibility to serve the public even though I can earn three times more in the private sector. Nowadays, medical students are expected to pay the bulk of the fees and end up with a $100k debt when they graduate. We do not enjoy any special medical benefits even though we are exposed to the risks of deadly infections like the SARS virus, which killed a number of our colleagues. The government and society now considers medicine as a commercial transaction like any other.<br><br>Do you not expect doctors to demand remuneration as someone would in a purely commercial transaction? It is sad that we have come to this state of affairs, but the clock cannot be turned back.<br></strong><br><br>in case you think like fymk, who accuses me of having a personal vendetta against doctors, i say again categorically that my emphasis on doctors earning a good income prescribing cough mixtures is not a personal grudge against them because i've also said that i understand why they are doing it.  the important thing is, from a society point of view, it does not make social, moral and economic sense for the govt to spend huge sums of money training doctors who eventually end up opening up a clinics to sell cough mixtures.  isn't it such a waste that after spending so much time and money you end up doing only a fraction of what you are trained for.  if that's the case you don't need to be trained that much in the first place.<br><br>it is not just the doctors but society as a whole has become very transactional and commercial.  that is why we can only move things and people with money.  when the money in the pot is no more (private clinics), you can be sure doctors would be nudged into those fields where they are most needed.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The recent move by the Minister of Health to open up Medisave to chronic illnesses is telling us where the government is likely to proceed.<br><br>They will indeed train more doctors, including a larger number of bright foreign students who may be given a bond in return for study grants. These additional doctors are meant for our biomedical industry, to conduct clinical trials, do research rather than manage cough and colds. They will provide cutting-edge medical services to make Singapore attractive for rich foreign patients. Increase in this group of doctors will not lower healthcare costs for Singaporeans but will be good for the economy. They will be highly qualified and you have to pay first world rates to see them.<br><br>For the heartlanders, there will be a shift towards more primary healthcare. Send to to be treated in nursing homes and small district hospitals that are cheaper and  less skill-intensive.<br><br>More cheap foreign doctors will be recruited for our public hospitals and polyclinics. We are now accepting degrees from a larger number of Universities. For example, Malaysian doctors who studied in Sheffield, UK (the University of Sheffield has a joint degree program with Malaysian Universities) could not work in Singapore in the past. Now we recognize their degree and so avail ourselves of a source of cheaper doctors. They will be cheaper but not as cheap from doctors from India and China. If Singaporeans still complain that the polyclinics are too expensive, I suppose they can recognize even more Universities from India, Bangladesh and China. These doctors can be given limited license to work only in polyclinics and government hospitals.<br><br>The government will not go as far as I have suggested: to restrict non-patented drugs for polyclinics and public hospitals. It is just not politically acceptable...our patients will not accept having to take 2 pills 4 times a day when there is a once-a-day pill with less side-effects..<br><br>So the government is allowing people to use medisave to pay for them...It is not going to lower heathcare costs, just making it more affordable by letting people use their own savings. But what if those savings run out? What if there is not enough medisave?<br><br>That's Khaw Boon Wan's headache too...but hopefully by then he would have retired and that becomes another minister's nightmare  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

What is the form of education for training nurse practitioners? How many years? What's the incentive?  The costs of educating them?  How much do you want to pay them per month?  How many people will be willing to see them? What will it cost the person from the community to see a nurse practitioner? <strong> Most importantly , what are their limitations on treatment ( and no I don't want to hear coughs and cold again - I mean ALL treatment forms) </strong> Who pays for their indemnity ? In Australia , most nurses just join the union because they have professional indemnity insurance thrown in for about approx 400 dollars per annum (full time rate) .<br><br>I used to remember those Singaporean home visit nurses charge about 10-20 dollars per visit  depending on the difficulty of the job and they have to use transport etc. What they did was not really close to the level of nurse practitioners and they had the support of the polyclinic doctors as well as nearby gps. Nurse practitioners practice on a semi- autonomic role at a level somewhere between a registered nurse and a general practitioner. So what will it cost the person from the community to see a nurse practitioner VS seeing a polyclinic doctor?<br><br>And I am just stating facts here.<br><br>Remember about what oxford mushroom said about kiasu singaporeans and lest not forget the kiasee ones as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another question for snow leopard :<br><br>So what can nurse practitioners prescribe as well for the said coughs and cold? Or let's say pharmacists.<br><br>If you say antibiotics for coughs and cold , please address the problem of resistant pathogens like MRSA,  resistant streptococcus etc. Resistant pathogens are actually increasing healthcare costs in developed nations .  Would people readily accept symptomatic treatments for a viral cold from a nurse practitioner? How would the nurse practitioner be able to counter that problem?<br><br>I am all ears now.<br><br></div>
