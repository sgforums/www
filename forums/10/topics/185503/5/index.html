            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put it this way ,<br><br>Health of the population -&gt; sick individuals -&gt; demand of healthcare delivery -&gt; healthcare costs<br><br>Acute illnesses - don't need to say so - they come and they will go . They won't affect the person for life. Of course lah , there are the big problems like SARS and avian flu everyone is scared about.<br><br>Chronic illnesses - affect the person for life and the largest burden on healthcare costs. Hospitalisation bills are usually the largest on the medical expenditure list not coughs and colds.<br><br><blockquote> MOH :Better Health Outcomes for the Chronically-Ill Through Structured Disease Management Programmes<br><br>Chronic diseases are a major source of morbidity, suffering and misery to patients and their families in Singapore. They are also the major causes of death. This is a phenomenon common to all developed countries.<br><br>Four common chronic diseases affect about 1 million Singaporeans: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (lipid disorders) and stroke.  </blockquote>For example :<br>You can have a diabetic person who does not control the diet -&gt; unstable diabetes -&gt; increased monitoring which includes blood tests and HBA1c tests -&gt; need to see the doctor more who advises this person-&gt; gets more prescribed medication since blood sugar is not controlled -&gt; heavier burden on healthcare costs -&gt; still does not control diet or do exercise or even check the feet regularly -&gt; complications -&gt; diabetic nephropathy ( kidney disease) , eyes affected , feet has sores -&gt; see the doctor or nurse educator -&gt; gets advised on diet again etc etc -&gt; not listening -&gt; may end up with renal disease , blindness or lower limb amputation -&gt; heavier burden on the healthcare system since this fellow probably needs multiple admissions to the hospital , needs more specialist focus i.e. nephrologist, opthamologist , orthopedic surgeon etc as well as allied health support like dietitions, podiatrists etc -&gt; might need insulin on top of the diabetic medications -&gt; might need amputation -&gt; loses the job probably because the person is too unhealthy to even work -&gt; social costs on top of healthcare costs .<br><br>You have another diabetic person who controls the diet and exercises regularly . Less risk of kidney disease, and just needs to see the diabetic nurse educator regularly . Cost is not too bad - sees the doctor once every 3 month to get medications which might be just one or two types. Cost is kept low even though this person has a chronic illness.<br><br>Preventative health care  will cut healthcare costs  very efficiently and probably more than you think that the  nurse practitioner policy might.<br><br>Specialist nurses are helpful in a way if you use them in a preventative type of setting in a chronic disease setting . Will help the costs to drop down. However to use nurse practitioners in  diagnosis and treatment for Singapore might not help costs at all. First of all Singapore is small and the population is also small compared to larger countries . There are enough doctors going around for a community. You just need to refocus on preventative health strategies.<br><br></div>

Sure, they will have to go through 5 years' of medical school to do that and become doctors themselves...we are back to square one.<br></strong><br><br>but how much of what the doctor learns in the five years is used in a clinic setting?  remember, medical school is medicinal bachelor and bachelor of surgery.  how often does the doctor in the clinic does surgery?  if it's half the course that we need to train a clinic doctor, then rightfully it should just take 2 1/2 years.<br><br><strong><br>Allow nurses and pharmacists to give MCs? That means they can distinguish the malingerers from those who are truly sick...same problem...you have to send them through medical school to learn how to make proper diagnosis. Of course they will have to buy medical liability insurance like doctors, which will cost them at least 1-2k a year. You will have to raise their salary then...how can you expect them to give up a month's salary for malpractice insurance?<br></strong><br><br>how complicated can diagnosis in a clinic setting be?  you mean it takes five years for a doctor to learn if someone's geniunely having a cough or not?  every time i see the doctor, it's the same few, simple procedures, nothing complicated.  you want to know if he's having a fever, a thermometer does the trick.  it's not rocket science and with training, nurses and pharmacists (when that happens we no longer call them by those names) can do an equally good job.<br><br><strong><br>But if they are willing to take the added responsibility and risk and not demand a higher salary, sure...why not? I have a feeling the number of MC seekers will rise though but if Singapore employers don't mind, I have no issue..<br></strong><br><br>as i've said before, who can continuously take MC without getting himself into trouble with his own company?<br><br><strong><br>Ya...I know of someone who has been failing since I met him 15 years ago...he has just given up. For some exams, two tries and you are out..It is not easy to even get in...very few are selected for specialist training. Of course, if we are willing to lower standards, we can let more in...<br></strong><br><br>i suppose the selection of medical undergraduates ought to be more stringent, so that we get more doctors with the quality to go all the way.<br><br><strong><br>Ya, the few surgeons who are making the millions will stay, but most of the specialists are NOT earning millions...they can easily move elsewhere and they will if we lower their salaries too much. The BBC has just reported that the average pay for a GP in the UK will be 100k GBP or S$300k a year. Even for a newly qualified consultant, the average pay is 72k GBP or S$216k. That is much more than what many other specialists are getting here. If our doctors have equivalent qualification, why should they stay here?<br></strong><br><br>we cannot look at just the income but have to balance it with cost of living too.  100K pounds converted to SGD becomes SGD $300k.  but a one pound ice cream converted to SGD is also SGD $3.  furhermore, if you're talking about pay differences, it extends to all the other professions as well, as i've said to fymk before when he tried to compare us with aussie, apart from the president and the prime minister, probably every other job pays better in the UK.<br><br>so if your question is why should mobile doctors stay here when he can earn more in the UK, it is the same question as why a lawyer, financial analyst, engineer ... would stay here when they can earn more elsewhere ...<br><br><strong><br>You forget that they can go overseas..but our surgeons earn too much compared to UK surgeons. I agree with you about surgeons, but not for other specialties where our specialists are paid less than the first world.<br><br>It's not only an issue of demand and supply (which I agree with) but there is also the issue of a global market.<br></strong><br><br>the global market afflicts all professions, not just the medical profession.  the first world countries have higher standards of living and can always afford to pay more, be it for an engineer or an accountant.  to the extent that people here can find greener pastures elsewhere, it reflects the degree of variation in standards of living or exploitation here.<br><br><strong><br>But if you make it so difficult for foreign doctors to work here, why should they come? If they are good enough to pass the stringent exams set by US and UK, do you think they will come here? Of course we are getting the second rate ones...what do you expect if you want them cheap?<br></strong><br><br>well if they have no where else to go but here, they should not mind those extra tests.  safeguards both parties.<br><br><strong><br>Ha...point is people won't blink an eye spending $800 for botox treatment but complain about the $8 in the polyclinic. No wonder more and more GPs are going into this...they call it aesthetic medicine..<br></strong><br><br>who's complaining about $8 in polyclinics?  do i have to remind you like i keep reminding fymk?  not $8 per say but the under utilisation of manpower resources used to treat coughs in polyclinics, unless he happens to be a new doctor and is in need of training and exposure.<br><br>i have no problems with rich, old women paying $800 for botox.  but if they take good doctors away from surgery and other specialties then that is a problem ...  i can only hope that $800 limits the number of botox customers to just a handful, which in turn can only support just a handful of beautician doctors.<br></blockquote></div>

They probably want the MC only...but if we let nurses give out MC too, I have no issue with that too. As I said though, you can expect everyone to get an MC...patient will say he has headache and a nurse is not a doctor. He/she will not take the risk to deny an MC in case the patient is truly sick and sues later...<br></strong><br><br>yes a nurse is not a doctor and i'm not expecting a nurse to just put on a doctor's coat now and start diagnosing MC cases like a doctor.  i would expect some kind of selection and conversion for the most competent nurses / pharmacists to a level that he has the ability to assume the role of a doctor in a clinic setting.  do not under estimate nurses, some of them really know their stuff well ...<br><br><strong><br>Do you know what is your salary in 3 years' time? We don't know how much surplus we will have next year or whether we might have a deficit instead. So how will you know how much to spend and how much to save?<br><br>You tell your patients the medicine is only $10 a month this year, but next year the economy is not doing well and so you have to tell your patient who has lost his job because of the poor economy that he now must pay $30, because we don't have a surplus to subsidize his treatment now.<br></strong><br><br>my primary interest in this thread is to highlight the fact that we do have many qualified doctors who can be trained to become surgeons if only they're not encouraged to take the easy way out by setting up a private clinic.  how a minister balances his budget is hardly my interest.  nevertheless i shall make comment.  from a minister's point of view, there is no way he will allow cost of essential items to fluctuate 300% from year to year.  he would set a budget for this year's expected medical costs, using last year's surpluses.  any shortfall would result in a deficit, as simply as that.  if next year, there is a budget surplus, then that deficit can be replaced back.  however, if we suffer deficits year after year, then there is a fundamental problem with our economy that we need to rectify.<br><br>is it meaningful to ask dad how much pocket money you'd be getting when dad is out of job?<br><br><strong><br>That is true to an extent. When the money is no more in medicine, they will go overseas and more people will go into law, finance or politics. You can still earn a million in the cabinet I think..<br></strong><br><br>the money is no more, not in medicine but in private clinics.  other medical avenues are still lucrative, like surgery for example where it is most needed.  if their training is medicine by profession, it would be hard for them to go into law or finance.  mind you i am talking about doctors not pursuing specialties but opening up clinics instead.  as for becoming a minister in the cabinet, there can only be that many cabinet ministers.<br><br>finally about going overseas, it is not just an issue with the medical profession but any other profession that is in demand all over the world.  we're not, as i say again, making paupers out of doctors but nudging them to go higher and in turn earning more as well.<br></blockquote></div>
