            <div class='col-md body'>Don't get so worked-up.<br><br>Anyway my 2 cents worth.<br><br>I did medical training in Europe, did 1 year of training in Singapore and then , then USA training for years.<br><br>I can tell you some of the good points and bad points about each system.<br><br>The bottomline - THERE IS NO PERFECT SYSTEM.<br><br>The system has to work for the people on what their healthcare beliefs and philosophy are.<br><br>Issue 1: Life expectancy -  Why are we so hung up about comparing life expectancies between Singapore and other countries vis a vis healthcare expenditure as a portion of the public budget?<br><br>Many of the countries with high expenditures are developed nations with mainly white populations - maybe they are expected to live to 70 to 80 years old and if we spend just as much, Singaporeans will live to 90 to 100 years old.<br><br>Issue 2: We generally only have one acute illness reimbursement system and no chronic illness insurance/reimbursement system.<br><br>Some folks live to 60 years and finds out that they have renal failure and need chronic dialysis but they don't want it (their attitude towards life) so they perhaps should purchase insurance that does not cover dialysis. Others may want everything done so they should spend on the top-tier medical insurance that roughly runs about US$300 to 1000 per month that covers also experimental therapies. These are personal choices and freedom of choice can be encouraged if the current government guides the development of these choices instead of just leaving it to the private sector.<br><br>We need about 5-6 classes of nationally (mutualized - not private medical insurance companies) run medical insurance to provide coverage according to people's attitudes towards healthcare.<br><br>Issue 3: Folks not in the know - there is truly a biomedical revolution going on here. But all these require funding to maintain doctor's competency and also gets ploughed back for further R&amp;D.<br><br>Singapore does not do much and does not have proprietary techniques, medications, technology, etc. becuase we don't put our money into our healthcare sector for all these to be self-sustaining in generating these new ideas - so newer drugs/devices that have been shown to improve morbidty and mortality - we pay through our nose to other developed countries which then again funds their technological drive.<br><br>Issue 4: More doctors means they will treat more, so costs go up. That is a fallacy, in keeping with the biomedical revolution, doctors are, have and are now actively conducting clinical trials to translate these advances into practical applications. In time they get incorporated into practice guidelines. In my training the same amount of time to cover a specialty is now expended to cover a lot more areas that have developed into further super-sub-specialties, and I can tell you, I am drowning in information overload.<br><br>You can only get good in smaller areas becuase all these smaller areas of expertise have further bloom to full-fledged sciences and training - so you need more doctors if you want really competent and knowledgeable doctors.<br><br>The basics are basics - stop smoking, proper diet and public health measures are cruicial in avoiding repetitive insults to the chronically ill and precipitating acute illnesses. However, like me and other Singaporeans - how many of you still eat junk food and all sorts of crap?<br><br>Because it is the Singaporean way of life - besides, healthy food costs more - so we save and enjoy our food and plop it down for a bypass surgery later on in life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Healthcare funding and costs of healthcare is a complex issue and a multiprong approach is required.<br><br>The fundamental truth that underlies "service" is the same - what you pay is what you get.<br><br>When you pay "peanuts" you get NKF, when you pay properly for services to cover yourself - you get less ambiguity on the type and quality and assurance of treatment.<br><br></div>
