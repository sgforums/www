            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i quote myself again "they'd probably need at least $10,000 a month to be happy." so on the contrary i'm not limiting their pay to 50% percentile. i'm putting them right on top although i am advocating that between top and the rest, the gap shouldn't be like $17k ($20k - $3k). </blockquote>I might have misunderstood you then. I think most doctors will be happy with about 10k a month. As I said, there is a huge gap in salaries among doctors as it is. As I said, we have surgeons who earn close to a million dollars a year and on the other hand, a young doctor in the public hospitals 5 years after graduation is getting about 5k to 7k. Unless they specialize, their salary will remain stagnant for a long time. Highly trained consultants get as little as 9k to as much as 30k for surgeons. So far I have been talking about doctors in the public sector. The pay in the private sector is at often 2-3 times higher.<br><br>If you look at the average salary of doctors as reported by Asiaweek, the figure of USD 4386 per month is closer to the 10k you spoke of.<br>(http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/features/salaries/2000/popups/content/sing.html).<br><br>However, what the average figure does not reveal is the huge discrepancy in pay between doctors. The doctor you quoted with a salary of 20k a month is definitely not the usual, he is in the minority. Many of your neighborhood GPs can only dream of a 10k monthly salary.<br><br>As a result of the wide gap in salary between doctors in the public versus those in the private sector, about half of doctors registered in Singapore are working in the private sector but the public sector sees double the number of patients. Low pay and heavy workload are the two main complaints of  doctors in the public sector and as you might have read in the papers in recent years, there has been a continuing exodus of senior doctors to the private sector. To make medical fees lower than they are in the public sector, there is no other way apart from hiring cheap foreign doctors. Lowering doctors' salaries in public hospitals will drive far too many out in the private sector and overseas that we will have to replace them with foreign talent.<br><br>BTW, if you are talking about the big gap in salary between Singaporeans, why gripe about doctors? The difference between 20k and 3k is big but what about the difference between the pay of a cabinet minister and the 3k you spoke of?<br><br>In a globalised economy and when our doctors have qualifications that are recognized internationally, we have to pay competitive rates to keep the best people. If cheap healthcare is more important than quality (which fymk opposes), then the only way is to bring in cheap foreign doctors and accept lower quality medication and treatment. Mind you, the quality is lower but still high compared to many third world nations....but we must be willing to accept one form of treatment for the rich, another for the poor.<br><br>However, I do agree that the salary of some doctors are just far too high. If someone posseses a unique skill then he can certainly command a high salary...I have no issue with that. If he is the only person in the world who can do heart transplants and we need this operation, then we have to pay whatever price he calls. But why should all surgeons be paid more highly than say, psychiatrists of equivalent senior and experience?</div>

Perhaps they have difficulty holding to a job that pays reasonably well, perhaps their jobs have been outsourced to China and India, perhaps they are just too weak and ill to work...whatever..<br><br>For Atobe and others who demand a cheaper healthcare system comparable to hospitals in JB and Thailand, I cannot see a solution unless we offer a more basic level of healthcare and import foreign labour. Like the factory workers from Maxtor whose jobs got outsourced, our doctors will have to upgrade their skills to offer a premium service for the wealthy, emigrate or accept a much lower salary with the influx of foreign talent.<br><br>However, I suspect that Singaporeans will also complain. The fact that the rich get Herceptin and the poor do not will be a source of unhappiness. I fear that there are those who want the best at the lowest price and still think it is the government's job to get them that impossible deal. Even if the governmemt agrees, they will have to raise taxes to finance a cheap, high quality healthcare system but then the citizens will also complain about paying more taxes..<br><br>Damned of you do...damned if you don't.</div>

Surgeons have a technical skill and a certain set of physical criteria they have to have. They have to have steady hands to operate. Now a psychiatrists sit and talk to patients - prescribe medications etc . Surgeons are different - they are at risk of being exposed to biohazards especially when they doing their jobs in a body cavity full of blood, serous fluid etc.<br><br>Depending on what type of surgery they do as well. Cosmetic surgeons come pricey because they do mostly aesthetics on the human and fine sewing . let's say if a person's hand get sawed off by accident - who do you think will be doing delicate microsurgery? a psychiatrist?<br><br>Not forgetting their personal equipment like those magnifying glass googles etc . How about maintenance or even sterilisation ?</div>

Mind you, the quality is lower but still high compared to many third world nations....but we must be willing to accept one form of treatment for the rich, another for the poor.<br></strong><br><br>i agwee with you about the common flu and cough category (i can't remember the terms u used).  in addition, i also feel that nurses and pharmacists have a role to play in this respect.<br><br><strong><br>However, I do agree that the salary of some doctors are just far too high. If someone posseses a unique skill then he can certainly command a high salary...I have no issue with that. If he is the only person in the world who can do heart transplants and we need this operation, then we have to pay whatever price he calls. But why should all surgeons be paid more highly than say, psychiatrists of equivalent senior and experience?<br></strong><br><br>well ... i wouldn't stop at that, if there is only one doctor who can perform that operation, then surely we're not training enough?<br></blockquote></div>

Want to compare?   To see an australian gp - you pay around 30-39 dollars (of course medicare rebates 27 dollars or so) . Essential drugs separate - but they come under PBS with a limit of 23.70 per medication you buy . Singapore gps , last I heard from my mom cost around 35 with drugs inclusive.  <br><br>we can't save on the expensive procedures nevermind, but we can do something about the expensive doctor being used to diagnose our coughs and flus right?  surely these can be performed by the nurse or the phamacist or in Mr Oxford's opinion, doctors from low cost countries?<br><br><strong> Who use the doctor to diagnose in the first place? How many people used to abuse the emergency system to see doctor for cough and cold before they started charging for non emergency cases? Flu is a different thing from a cold - smiliar to a cold but with more complications.  And rare illnesses - it is a human right to universal health care regardless of how rare your condition is . I went to see private specialists because I was sick of how the public system was bouncing me about to see registrars only or gps  </strong><br><br>it doesn't matter how much the govt is subsidising.  it is still a costly issue, otherwise it wouldn't have been so fervently debated both in and out of parliament.  we need to do something and not say "oh, we actually have more subsidies than USA therefore we should shut up".<br><br><strong> I am not saying we should shut up . I am telling you to look at the prices of things, from medication to equipment to biomedical engineering maintenance , everything has to be maintained for patient safety - not everything is about wages. Everyone wants the world class service but no one wants to pay. Why not look at who is getting the pay - the hospital doctors aren't the ones earning 1 million dollar salaries - the nurses aren't the ones who earn 1 million dollar salaries.<br><br>The administrators are earning more than what the health professionals earn. Why not say cut their pay after all CEOs just do managerial stuff instead of the dirty work - they are the ones earning the premium.  Cut management ? Ask your policy makers to centralise everything instead of dividing things in regions when Singapore is so small. You will make healthcare affordable but of course the staff in those regional divisions will complain about their jobs getting cut. Look at the bigger picture where your money goes .<br><br>Everyone can get the C class ward but not so much treatment options then. Shut down the 24 hr fancy radiology clinic . Everyone waits to get an xray done from the emergency clinic according to priority.   No fancy electronic beds. Get relatives to do the cleaning , clothing and feeding of the patients instead of the nurses - this way you don't need to pay for health assistants, food and laundry service. Now that is a cost cutting measure for you. Just pay for the bed. No frills for affordability <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>Oh by the way , forget the nice triage areas in SGH. More cost cutting measure. Just consolidate it into one triage area and one triage nurse and everyone waits. That is what one australian hospital did to me . I had to stand in line til I nearly turn blue from my pneumonia - but hey it is free , no complaints there - just wasn't nice to end up in the resus bay when the triage nurse saw me . No need to employ foreigners since it is to cut off staff and cut off costs. If you want to employ foreigners, don't blame them if they cannot catch what you are saying. There was a few complaints in australia already about overseas health workers not understanding english and that impediment costs lives. But hey never mind, you did say you want it affordable.<br><br>Oh yes and always give the willing payers what they want <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> - if they pay - they jump the queue. Fair for those who want no frills , no fancy specialist and just long waitlists .<br><br>No guessing how many singaporeans will angrily write in about "service".<br><br>Do you seriously want a second hand MRI machine to do an MRI scan on you with all those electromagnetic and radiation fields ?<br><br>If computers spoil , it is ok since you can replace it. If a human dies, you cannot replace that individual. You can outsource everything but at what risk?

They have to have steady hands to operate. Now a psychiatrists sit and talk to patients - prescribe medications etc . Surgeons are different - they are at risk of being exposed to biohazards especially when they doing their jobs in a body cavity full of blood, serous fluid etc.<br><br>Depending on what type of surgery they do as well. Cosmetic surgeons come pricey because they do mostly aesthetics on the human and fine sewing . let's say if a person's hand get sawed off by accident - who do you think will be doing delicate microsurgery? a psychiatrist?<br></blockquote>That is not true...actually surgeons are the easiest to replace precisely because their work is more about skill with the hands than knowledge-based. You can train an Indian surgeon to do a colectomy as well, if not better, than our local surgeons. Psychiatrists have to understand the local culture and background cos mental illnesses are culturally coloured. So it is easier to replace our surgeons than psychiatrists.<br><br>That's probably the first thing we will do to lower healthcare costs. We will continue to pay high fees for those with skills that cannot be replaced easily, like some transplant surgeons but the bulk of our surgeons can be replaced.<br><br>And in case people don' know, the surgeons do not make the diagnosis of a tumour. That's often detected by the radiologists or physicians and the diagnosis is made by a pathologist, whom people don't know about or see. The surgeon is just like the plumber who takes out diseased parts and straighten out the plumbing.<br><br>No intention to denigrade the surgeons here but our surgeons are paid far too much compared to those in the UK, when their skills are replaceable by those in Indian in the large part.<br><br></div>

Before you and I go around in circles, let's clear some points here :<br><br>Which healthcare system are you referring to? Private or public.<br>it seems like you are directing at doctors who earn good living and if I am not wrong - they might be private specialists.<br><br>What part of the AND SUBSIDIZED restructured system are you not happy about costing?<br><br>Are you not happy about paying for polyclinic doctor ? What's wrong for $8 per consultation . You only need to wait outside for a long long looooong time.<br><br>What's wrong with polyclinic tests costings? 2 dollars for standard blood tests. other tests variable.<br><br>I am sure medicines are cheap at polyclinics. Just ask for generics. Buy generics. No problem .<br><br>Affordability is dependent on how much you can afford to pay. If you cannot afford B class, I am sure the government will allow you to stay in C class. I think in Singapore, that is fair enough as it can get.<br><br>C class get you medical attention still. Just not so much of expertise.<br><br>A class don't say lah , that one is for consultants' attention and of course it is private paying class.<br><br>So what is the true problem here?<br></strong><br><br>let me say again what i've been saying throughout my posts.  i am not complaining specifically about anything.  the fact that i am young and healthy means i hardly find a need to see doctors beyond the simple cough and sore throat.  but that doesn't mean there is nothing wrong with the system for if our healthcare is as perfect as you deem it to be, we wouldn't even have this topic raised here in the first place, would we?  i hope you understand what i'm saying.  i'm only making suggestions to improve our healthcare situation.  by finding ways and means to lower healthcare costs, it would benefit everyone.  it does not matter whether it is with public or private healthcare, both should be scrutinised to find avenues for optmisation and improvement.<br><br>we all know that doctors are overworked and that's because there isn't enough doctors to go around.  rather than lament about their hard lives, why not do something to improve their lives by balancing the demand and supply?  coz obviously that is not in balance.<br><br><strong><br>I am not belittling other occupations. I am just saying they don't have a direct link into preserving a human life and they don't have occupational risks as high as frontline hospital staff have.<br></strong><br><br>why differentiate direct and indirect?  when the Nicoll highway collapsed, can the engineer who got sacked claim he had an indirect link to the lives of the construction workers who were killed?<br><br>so maybe we should also pay the banghra workers a premium for working under such hazardous conditions?<br><br>like i said, haggling over whose work is more impt is meaningless ...<br><br><strong><br>Nurses in Singapore are not paid well , not for the workloads they are getting. Why did you think I came to Australia? But that is not the issue since you never seen how a hospital runs from an employee point of view . You want china nurses - fine - some of them cannot even read the medication name in english. Don't complain about the service you get .<br></strong><br>i've friends whose wives are nurses or whos' sisters are nurses.  they're doing quite alright actually ... even better than my non-nurse friends ...  maybe you and them have different expectactions?  you're not the only person who has left home but this is not the right topic to lament about why you had to leave.<br><br>as for china nurses, i've spoken to some of them.  they speak with an accent, as all china born people do, but they are perfectly understandable and it is not as if i can't speak chinese.  in any case, what's most important is that they are competent and before the doctor gave his advice, she already could tell me what the doctor would be advising ...<br></blockquote></div>

Every health economist will tell you that too.<br><br>You want to cut costs on one side only . You forget to see all sides.<br><br>Meaningless or not, look at your social policies in Singapore. the anti smoking campaign - financial disincentives by increasing cigarette costs- banning of smoking in certain areas - those are health-social-economic policies.<br>Riding a bike or walking to MRT - health-social policies.<br><br>On the other side, they are already outsourcing alot of jobs out ( i.e. outsourcing x rays to india - that is what I heard from a few singaporeans)  which are trying to cut down your health costs. They already got alot of china nurses in to keep costs down.<br><br>Why blame society? Health is your own responsibility . Don't give excuses.  Don't ask everyone else to pay for your own problem - isn't that what you implied when I told you that I have some rare genetic problem. You can at least eat healthy instead of hawker food. Walk for 1/2 hr everyday before or after work. Or at least just do some stretching exercises around the house. Housework is also a form of exercise.<br><br>Health care costs works both ways - on the government and on the individual. Don't just look at one side without getting to both sides of the story.<br><br>If you have a healthier society , then  the economic burden of chronic diseases will decrease . Less people with less problems mean less costs to the public health system. Am I right in saying so?<br><br>If the society is not healthy , then the burden of disease increases and the healthcare costs of the public increases.<br><br>Read any health economics book - they will tell you the same thing.<br><br>Don't just focus only on doctors' wages . Use your polyclinic doctors if you cannot afford private general practitioners. Use the public system and wait if you cannot afford to pay private specialist's consultation fees . All this while you have been focusing on wages but that is only one part of the picture. You cannot just suggest improvements on one or two factors  without realising there are other factors involved and inter-related.<br><br>You want to make healthcare affordable? You can. Implement Social policies to complement your healthcare policies. Everything must be related to benefit each other instead of being a separate entity. Read about the reforms on NHS and social/economic  policies in UK . They are trying to merge health together with other policies to save the healthcare system there.<br><br>That is my point.<br><br></div>
