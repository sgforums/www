(I was told about this by an American friend.)<br><br>In the 1980s to the early 1990s in the US when awareness/support for gay issues was nowhere near as high as it is today, an individual from a campus queer club came up with a truly brilliant idea: designate one day on campus "Blue Jeans Day" with the tagline "Wear Blue Jeans If You Support Gay Rights".<br><br>The problem: just about every student on campus wore blue jeans!<br><br>The results ranged from the hilarious to the truly infuriated. Initially, most people were caught unaware and reactions to them were anything from being thanked for their "support" to being ridiculed by their friends.<br><br>There were also varying reactions from those who were unaware of Blue Jeans Day. Anger at being "tricked" to amusement etc.<br><br>Over the years, some people conciouslly wore blue jeans, while others equally conciouslly did not. But everyone started talking about something they had previously refused to talk about.<br><br>No, this was not a way of trying to inflate the actual support for gay rights; it actually got people starting to talk about gay issues and rights.<br><br>I witnessed one such Blue Jeans Day in 1995. It was hilarious, it was superb; it was the most brilliant idea that I'd come across.<br><br>The idea will not work wholesale with what you hope to accomplish. But adjust it to the local situation.<br><br>Someone suggested dressing in black on Orchard Road. If that is a very common colour to wear in Orchard Road on a Saturday afternoon (or night) then it is something along those lines. But you also need something distinguishing. Don't meet at the same spot, for instance. (Like the Mr Browners.) This way the police will have a very tough time to knowing who is protesting and who is not. (Be prepared with your own individual, "innocent" reasons for wearing what you are wearing.)<br><br>I'll pay attention to this thread as and when (or if) the idea develops.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Quote form the guy that started this movement<br><br><blockquote>Hi everyone.<br><br>Please remember this event is to show our displeasure over the forced compulsory annuities that starts payouts at age 85 and forfeits our capital upon death before 85. It is not against the current annuities available.<br><br>Please also don't be foolish enough to get identified and marked for life. There are many people here who have many different agendas, please do not in a moment of anger against the government be used by them.<br><br>We have to remember why we are going to CentrePoint dressed in black on 8th September 2007.<br><br><strong>8th September 2007 is a day we all go shopping in CentrePoint, but dressed in black.</strong> When you are there, please don't just stand there - you may get singled out - just go shopping within CentrePoint. There is no need to be fully black from head to toe, just either the top or bottom is black can liao.<br><br>I am strongly against any suggestions that will identify the participants. I disagree with wearing a black armband or a black ribbon or anything that will sets us apart, I think it is a very foolish idea as such items will identify us.<br><br>It will make it very much easier for the authorities to differentiate who are the real shoppers and who are those against the compulsory annuities scheme.<br><br>Being identified is not the name of the game. We don't intend to be martyrs - please make sure you don't become one.<br><br>It is a citizens' effort, we don't need people like CSJ because we are not making a political statement. We do it because we love - we want equitable policies for ourselves and our love ones. So, please don't be used by others for their own hidden agendas.<br><br>Shopping is not a crime. Shopping dressed in black is also not a crime. We just want to tell the government, please think of us when they come out with future policies. It is not our aim to bring down the government. We just want them to know that we have feelings, we have aspirations and we know how to think and in future, when they come up with policies, they should be equitable policies.<br><br>So, just go shopping with friends and relatives - no need for heroics. And for maximum impact, it will be good if all of us can be there from 4pm onwards. Can you just imagine an entire CentrePoint building of shoppers dressed in black? Shopping is a national pastime, so let's just go shopping on the 8th September 2007 dressed in black in CentrePoint for a good cause!</blockquote></div>
