CPF is not national security.  It is social security.  If he can come up with a scheme to look after the old age without touching the CPF, he would be god to so many forumers whinning here, and might even win the next election.  If I were him with such a genius scheme, I'll tell opposition hopefuls and wannabes during the next election!</div>

A lot of people look forward to the magic double 55 for big windfall.  While everyone is passionate about their own monies and want to touch them before going to the graves, it is a fallacy to think that many are financial-savvy.  Forumers here think they can manage their monies better than experts.  The truth is farther than they thought.<br>The CPF is no longer just a simple saving scheme. And the monies in there are not all tied up.  You can use it for housing, investment, education and of course, to pay your medical/hospital charges. That could mean very little 'real' cash left behind.  Didn't you hear this often: SGreans are asset-rich, cash poor!<br>But you need cash to buy 3 square meals, 4D, Toto, and to treat China dragon ladies!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aah, forgot this thread is about protest.  Seriously, do you think the annuity scheme is socially unjust, corrupt, deplorable, useless, discriminatory, dishonest? Also, annuity is not a new invention by PAP or CPF.  It has been available from insurance companies.<br>I read here and in other similar threads that bcos the scheme is compulsory, therefore, got to go against or protest.<br>Most people forgot - you already have compulsory schemes within CPF - Medisave which can be used to buy Medishield, mortgage insurance if you use CPF to buy property.<br>So, what is this protest all about? Some innocent people got killed, persecuted, mistreated, thrown out of the homes, etc.????</div>
