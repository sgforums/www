If anything,it was a demonstration of supreme arrogance on the part of the political party currently in power.</blockquote>Agree, but people have short memories. The ruling party had been arrogant for the better part of SG's independent history.<br><br>Arrogance itself is not going to change much in the local political landscape.<br><br>Furthermore, the way electoral boundaries are drawn, its not likely that any GRC will be able to muster enough votes to throw out the PAP.<br><br><blockquote>2)Foreign immigration: While it is accepted that we require migrant workers to drive the economy,again,a significant number feel that the government has threatened the position of Singaporeans within their own country by perhaps allowing too many immigrants in.We see this in the rising social friction and changing social landscape of Singapore.</blockquote>What social friction? u see riots on the streets? munjen vs bangla?<br><br>Sure, there's some discomforts but i wouldn't exaggerate its impact.<br><br>Fact remains, SG is dependent on foreign labour for its labour intensive industries like construction and manufacturing (what's left of it).<br><br>As for "FT's", although I have my reservations about some of them whom I feel to be blubbering idiots incapable of distinguishing elbow from arsehole, the writings on the walls are that there aren't enough of the right kind of skilled manpower ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.<br><br>We have to let them in because there aren't enough locals to do those jobs anyway! Take wealth management for example: tons of ang mohs and indians in the industry but fact is, not enough experienced wealth managers in the world and these guys will go wherever the money takes them.<br><br>As for the locals who have fallen on hard times, truly, I am sympathetic. The government would be wise to start cobbling together something that roughly resembles a social safety net.<br><br>I believe that there isn't enough of a critical mass to topple them yet, but if they hope to maintain the moral high-ground for the rest of the citizenry, they better do something about it or they might lose more votes than expected.<br><br><blockquote>3)Opposition growing in strength: Chee Soon Juan can't orate for nuts,but they guy can write very good essays and present good academic arguments regarding the politics of Singapore.The opposition are learning and adapting, taking the strengths and strategies of the PAP and making them their own.There <strong>IS</strong> a <strong>credible opposition</strong>,with qualified professionals who are competent in their areas of expertise.However, a media controlled by the ruling class disseminates the idea that there is a lack of credible opposition when the opposite is true.

Nobody is paying attention to him and I frankly feel that he has himself to blame for this.<br><br>Singaporeans do not buy his style of confrontational opposition politics.<br><br>Academia be damned. The core of 30 - 50ish HBD heartlanders are not gonna be reading his high-brow journal articles and airy fairy ideals.<br><br>My personal opinion: they are noble and attractive on paper, then again, but so was nazism and communism.<br><br>For JBJ, its the question of mortality... Just as we do not expect the Old Man to live forever, I think we would be over-generous to expect different of Mr JBJ. If he was 20 years younger, I would think differently.<br><br>As for the other parties, I think they stand a good chance of improving on their strengths and credibility but even the WP is taking a gradual approach.<br><br>They are wise to do so. Change is not going to happen overnight.<br><br><blockquote>These are the 3 primary factors I feel will play a part in ensuring that while the PAP will still remain the dominant party by virtue of their incumbent status, they will lose their overwhelming majority in parliament.<br><br>If the decreasing margin of votes between the PAP and the opposition is any indicator,the next election looks set to have a good showing of the opposition and a weakened PAP base.</blockquote>Interesting factors, and valid for the purpose of discussing the future political landscape of SG, but I see it more as a process of erosion rather than a "big-bang" at the next GE.<br><br>It may happen over 3, maybe 5 GE, but not the next one.<br><br>In order for opposition to be effective, they must:<br><br>(a) occupy at least 1/3 of the seats so that they can block legislations and move beyond token opposition.<br><br>(b) debate effectively in parliament. By this, I do not mean just to argue for the sake of arguing, but have the mind and the resources to draft proper amendments and alternatives for bills which they object to.<br><br>Such resources takes time to build. The PAP was not wrong to criticise the lack of a "shadow cabinet" in the WP team in the last GE. It takes time to learn the art of governance and if the WP wants to be a serious player, they should have started yesterday.<br><br>If they had not done so, I certainly hope they do so soon or they will never be taken seriously.<br><br>LKY was quite perceptive to observe that Singaporeans love the festivities and the ra-ra atmosphere of opposition rallies, but when it comes to the ballot box, they vote with their head.<br><br>That being the case, what the opposition needs to do is not just to tug at Singaporean's hearts and idealism, but to appeal to their minds and wallets and portray themselves as a credible alternative.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just think if/should they win the eleclation again which I feared will definitely happen. Everything will be the same again. Infact ministers pay could even be raise more, bus fare goes up, ERP goes up, ceo goes up, gst increase and with the new plan by the current PM Singapore will not be like how it used to be anymore. Just look at the national library, It looks something like Daily Planet to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS and some of the people here brought up very good points.<br><br>LKY and gang are smart people, especially the cunning old fox.   LKY must have calculated the risk before suing any oppositions for defamation.   It is absolutely true to say that if the oppositions don't pose a threat to LKY he will not be bothered to sue them.    We all know old cunning fox is expert in suing oppositions, even the western media have noted this and repeat this in their articles.<br><br>I, too, together with most people hope that our people will be smart and daring to vote against PAP, but from what I observe and my talk with locals they have not changed a bit.    So I don't think PAP will suffer that drastic further drop in the percentage of their winning in the next election.  REason being there aren't sufficient courageous Singaporeans to vote for the oppositions.</div>
