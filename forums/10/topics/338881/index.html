              <h2>CEOs “cashed out” prior to economic crisis</h2>
              <h5>By Tom Eley <br>28 November 2008</h5>
              <p><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/ceos-n28.shtml">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/ceos-n28.shtml</a></p>
              <p>Balzac’s
              maxim that “behind every great fortune lies a great crime” may yet
              prove a fitting epitaph for American capitalism. A recent survey by the
              <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reveals that CEOs at major US financial
              and real estate firms converted tens of millions of dollars of
              overvalued stock into cash prior to the eruption of the current
              financial crisis, even as many of their corporations approached the
              precipice.</p>
              <p>The <em>Journal</em> analyzed the fortunes of CEOs
              from 2003 to 2007 based on executive compensation and stock sale data.
              Fifteen of these CEOs took home more than $100 million in cash during
              this period. At the high end was Charles Schwab, who made over $816
              million from his self-named accounting firm, almost all of it from
              stock sales.</p>
              <p>Of the 120 publicly traded firms the<em> Journal</em> analyzed, CEOs cashed out a total of more than $21 billion. However,
              data was gathered only from publicly traded companies, and thus does
              not include similar fortunes that have been made by “hedge fund chiefs,
              Wall Street traders, and executives who sold their companies outright.”
              Nor did it include data related to exit packages, the
              multimillion-dollar “golden parachutes” awarded to retiring or fired
              executives.</p>
              <p>The <em>Journal</em>’s findings underscore the
              parasitism and criminality of the US financial elite. Defenders have
              long justified extravagant CEO pay by claiming that these were the
              talented “risk-takers” who generated enormous wealth for investors. But
              the <em>Journal</em>’s<em> </em>data shows that there is no
              correlation between compensation and a firm’s success. On the contrary,
              many CEOs rewarded themselves just as their corporations approached
              ruin.</p>
              <p>These included Richard Fuld, the CEO of Lehman Brothers,
              who transformed his firm’s stock into well over $100 million in cash.
              When added to his salary and bonuses, Fuld pocketed nearly $185 million
              in the five years before 2008, even as he guided his 150-year-old
              investment bank to ruin. James Cayne of Bear Stearns did nearly as well
              at his investment bank, collecting over $163.2 million, the vast
              majority of which was garnered from selling stock that would soon be
              scarcely worth the paper upon which it was printed.</p>
              <p>Maurice
              Greenberg of American International Group (AIG) made $132.8 million
              between 2003 and 2005, when he was forced to resign. Well over $100
              million of this came from windfall stock sales of the giant insurer.
              AIG collapsed in September, but was determined to be “too big to fail”
              by the federal government, and was bailed out twice in less than one
              month to the tune of some $120 billion.</p>
              <p>In August, the sub-prime
              mortgage giant Countrywide Financial Group collapsed spectacularly, and
              was absorbed by Bank of America. In the previous five years, however,
              Countrywide’s CEO, Angelo Mozilo, took home $471 million, over $400
              million of which came from sales of the company’s soon-to-be-worthless
              stock.</p>
              <p>A look at the sectors of the economy where these richly
              remunerated executives worked, moreover, demonstrates the advanced rot
              of the US economy as a whole. Without exception, they represented
              corporations that engaged in financial speculation—“industries closely
              tied to the financial crisis,” as the <em>Journal</em> puts it—and
              that produced no real value. These until recently “vibrant” parts of
              the economy functioned only to siphon off enormous social wealth and
              deposit it in the bank accounts of the CEOs and big investors.</p>
              <p>One example the<em> Journal</em> considered is the private student loan sector, which made Daniel
              Meyers, the CEO of a firm called First Marblehead, a very wealthy man.
              Marblehead specialized in servicing loans to students who had
              “exhausted the cheaper government-backed variety,” and then repackaging
              and selling the debt to big banks such as Bank of America. Meyers
              earned nearly $100 million, almost all of it in the sale of company
              stock; together with other Marblehead insiders, $660 million was taken.
              The<em> Journal</em> notes that Meyers used $10.3 million of his
              fortune to buy an ocean-front property in Rhode Island—the state with
              the highest unemployment rate. Meyers tore down the villa that was
              there and has put up a 38,000-square-foot mansion he named, befitting a
              pirate, “Seaward.”</p>
              <p>Another sector of the economy that has proved
              highly lucrative for CEOs is that of home mortgages. In addition to the
              aforementioned case of Angelo Mozilo and Countrywide, the <em>Journal</em> highlights the case of New Century Financial, the nation’s second
              largest subprime lender. While the lender is now bankrupt, over a
              period of four years its three leading executives took home a combined
              $74 million. The<em> Journal</em> also mentions the case of Herbert and
              Marion Sandler, who made $2 billion off selling their mortgage firm,
              Golden West Financial Corp., to Wachovia in 2005. This purchase likely
              contributed to the demise of Wachovia, which collapsed in October and
              was bought out by Wells Fargo.</p>
              <p>In the field of “credit-default
              swaps,” Michael Gooch made $82.5 million through his firm GTI Group.
              Over $77 million of this came from a remarkably well-timed sale in May
              of 2006. Since then, GTI’s stock has lost over 90 percent of its value.
              Gooch owns three mansions, and boasted to the <em>Journal </em>that he could pay off his only debt, a $1 million mortgage, “with the spare change in my bank account.”</p>
              <p>The <em>Journal</em> notes with some surprise that one of the most highly remunerative
              fields was that of “home-building.” The wealth accumulated by CEOs in
              this sector is a clear byproduct of the speculative real estate bubble
              that emerged over the last decade. Toll Brothers, specializing in
              building suburban mansions, made Robert and Bruce Toll three quarters
              of a billion in cash, largely in stock sales. The company has lost 74
              percent of its value in the past year.</p>
              <p>Chad Dreier, CEO of
              Ryland Group, made $181 million building homes in “hot markets” such as
              Las Vegas that have now gone bust, exposing thousands of families to
              foreclosure. Dwight Schar, the CEO of a building firm called NVR, took
              home $626 million in 2003-2007, almost all from the sale of stock.
              Schar spent about $86 million of this fortune in 2005 to buy the Palm
              Beach, Florida estate of billionaire Ronald Perelman. The <em>Journal </em>notes that the 11-acre oceanfront complex includes two swimming pools and a tennis court.</p>
              <p>It is perhaps a sign of the times that the <em>Wall Street Journal, </em>long
              a mouthpiece of US finance capital, would run a prominent article that
              questions the enormous personal fortunes built up by CEOs through
              dubious means even as their corporations sailed toward disaster.
              Running such an article aims in part, no doubt, to appease the rage of
              thousands of middling investors who have lost their shirts in the
              economic crisis.</p>
              <p>In any event, the criminal methods of these
              CEOs, who have led their companies and American capitalism as a whole
              to the brink of ruin, do not derive from personal greed alone. In their
              criminality and nearsightedness the CEOs reflect, instead, the
              narrowing horizon and historical decline of US capitalism, in which the
              accumulation of extreme wealth long ago lost whatever connection it had
              to the creation of real value.</p>
