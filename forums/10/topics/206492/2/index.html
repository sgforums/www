If you dont know what i am talking about, you haven't been there long enough yet. The Aussie people hate asians coming to take their jobs and compete against them for their property prices and pushing up day to day cost of living. Especially in the big cities. Not every aussie is a racist, but if you start rubbing shoulders in terms of Jobs or even chasing a girl...you will the racial 'treatment'.<br><br>Do you even read the australian newspapers? Racial attacks on asians are common. u'd probably have had waiters or cooks spit in your steak and you're none the wiser. Pauling Hanson won votes simply coz she spoke out against immigrants. They dont want you there. You get people banging rite into you coz you're taking up the air they grew up with. You find yourself keeping to asian circles.

Due to its condition, Singapore was mainly a young nation with immigrants. Perhaps many people can still trace their grandparents births from the origin country. I think with this condition, the young nation is unsure to shed it's ancestral links yet. Actually it's got to do with bilingualism too. You can almost see it as a manifestation of that fundamental subconcious wanting of keeping both feet a little here and holding a little there. I think with bilingualism in place, it will always have an effect of withholding greater integration.<br><br>I agree with your idea, more progressive melting pot should take place naturally in society.

            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i have my doubts about singapore now, my generation and future ones are sure going to have deep trouble. will our streets be too dangerous to walk on even in broad daylight? will we be reduced to total oppression while aliens rob us of our rights? can we fight back?<br><br>i only have the answer to the last question. yes, we can and must fight back. how? i only have one proposed solution so far. join the civil service or opposition and make a difference. the peasants await daylight. or rather, singaporeans await daylight.<br><br>and so say we all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
