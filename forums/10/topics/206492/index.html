Under.....[/b]</blockquote>the education system is one of the iron fist of the govertment,to make every being studying under them to be one with the mass...[learn the main language and the secondary language]<br><br>Even in schools,the path of one's knowledge is determinded by the school.<br>They chose the enrolled subjects to be taken and when they're in their final years,they're expected to follow suit.<br>This can be seen from the examination system of Secondary schools[final year]<br>All is expected to take a certain or combination of subject and deemed it compulsary for participation for the cambridge exams.<br>No doubt a minimium of 5 subjects is needed for entry to instituite,and that,handsdown.<br><br>A min of 5,but why are students being forced to take up 7-8 subjects?<br>and the much prestigeous school,to the extend of 10?[My cousin was in HCJC and was pressurised to take 11 subjects]<br>when i took my o lvl last yr,they claimed that 7 subject is compulsary buthow true?<br>Are the students aware that they can juz hold 5 subject and walk into the examination hall?<br>i see many teachers in my days in secondary school pressing students to retain their 7 subjects and even said its necessary.<br>But i tell u NO,Its not essential to hold that much.<br>Currently,My bro takes bio,chem and phy...<br>he wants to drop bio bt the teacher said its a combination with chem and its compulsary.<br>what BULLSHYT and atrocity to say that!<br>Cambridge have seperate papers for pure chem,bio and pure phy so Why is it neccesary?[I doubt they're unable to give a much feasible answer,other that the ones i've mentioned]<br><br>The teachers claimed that this gives the student an alternative routes of other subjects they can fall back on if they're unable to keep up with the other subjects?<br>is it necessary?or does those that implemented this* in the education system have such little faith in the students..?especially schools in the lower end of the list<br><br></div>

Make sure you go into one of the professions that are most in demand as mentioned in this article:<br><br>Australia's skilled immigration policies working<br>18 April 2006<br><br>Australia has boosted its number of skilled workers in its labour force by 78,000 already this year. This has been achieved by immigration policies put in place by the Australian Government, to solve the country's current skills shortage in its domestic labour force.<br><br>"The government has responded to the shortages by bringing record numbers of skilled immigrants to the country. The Australian Government has made over 97,500 Skilled Visas available for 2005-2006," said Amanda Vandstone, Australia's Immigration Minister.<br><br>Australian Government statistics reveal that 89% of Skilled Independent Visa holders gain employment within six months. A total of 18,700 immigrants took advantage of the state-specific and regional migration program, with 7,100 settling in the state of Victoria and almost 5,000 immigrating to South Australia.<br><br>In the six months from July last year, 39,500 skilled workers were granted the "457" visas. A total of 49,855 were issued the previous financial year. With the 457 visas an applicant and their dependents can stay in Australia permanently after four years.<br><br>Vandstone said the 457 visas were popular among employers because electronic processing meant a skilled foreigner could arrive in Australia within a month of applying, and formal migration could take more than a year.<br><br>States like Western Australia are relying on skilled immigrants to relieve the labour shortages in the state. The WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry predicts a return to steady growth of 6.5% this year due to the increase in skilled immigrant employment. A report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that WA's economic growth fell by 2.7% in 2004-2005 due to the skilled labour shortage.<br><br>The biggest increase when it came to specific skills came in the form of <strong>doctors</strong>, with 260 immigrating to Australia, an increase of 300% on the previous year. <strong>The most sought after skilled immigrants by Australian employers are accountants, nurses and trades-people including mechanics, electricians and builders.</strong><br><br>http://www.workpermit.com/news/2006_04_18/australia/australias_skilled_immigration_policies_working.htm<br><br></div>
