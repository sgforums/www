              <p>as said, laws are created by men, men who are mandated by the Govt and president of Singapore to guards it. And the Govt and President are mandated by the citizens who voted them to be...so now, what you want?? Let them do the job ya.</p>
              <p>And since 1965, the world already long know the penalty of 5g of drug smuggled into Singapore, you see big board at harbour, causeways and airport.

              <p>It is not his age, it is the amount of drugs he brought in. 40 grams? You are hanging him for 40 g? Its not even enough for his own consumption. I think it is a bit too harsh. Perhaps should impose a deterrent prison sentence.</p>
              <p>Yeah, who am I to say whether a person should be hung or not. I don't want to judge anybody but I give my sympathies to everyone involved.</p>
              <p>In USA drugs are a major problem, but capital sentencing is only limited to certain states and jurisdiction so mexican, black and neo nazi drug gangs flourished there. The drug smuggling has caused a lot of problems in Mexico and Colombia. In Colombia, the main drug supplier, FARC has launched a rebel war against the Colombian government, killed and kidnapped many civilians and plunged the country into chaos. Most of the drugs in Colombia are illegally exported to USA via Mexico. In Mexico, drug cartels have killed scores of law enforcement, civilians, government candidates who campaign against drugs. And then USA, drugs have robbed the life of many prominent Hollywood stars and also ordinary people through overdose. In prisons, thousands of prisoners were killed each day, in drug gang related wars as each gang trudges into each other's business turf. Even in the streets of America, gang shoot outs and gang wars are killing people everyday. Some mafia, mexico and black gang members give their new members the rite of passage by ordering them to kill at least one person. Corruption, murder, havoc, kidnapping, drug abuse, overdose terrorism are some of the problems created by the illegal drug trade.</p>
              <p>So I ask you, when you smuggle drugs intentionally (not by accident or set up by other people), does this ever affect your conscience?</p>
              <p>I hate to admit it and though capital punishment is inherently cruel but it had in the past saved many countries from the drug problem.  </p>

In comparing to US of A, we are a small fragile city, now if we are not strict to such extend, we are asking for trouble, we got 2 causeways, 4 to 5 ferries terminals from west to east, 33 world busiest PSA gates to mend, one top class airport to take care of, if we are lax with laws in drug smuggling, then we can kiss goodbye to Singapore.</p></div>

              <p>For my opinion,drug trafficking should be punished with life or 15 to 20 years.That will serve as a serious warning.I mean,a person has how many 15 or 20 yrs?Surely,these offenders will do some soul searching while in jail.Death penalty is too much,as many countries has viewed us as police state.</p>
              <p>Its just like in Communist China,raping a women or corruption money can easily put u in death sentence.From our view,it is too much.Thats why for other democratic countries,our PAP ministers are over reacting towards drug trafficking.</p>

              <p>I dont think the maid suffer from any mental sickness,if i remember correctly,the way she murder her female employer seems to be well planned.And if i am not wrong,she also murder the employer kids,(correct me if i am wrong).</p>
              <p>Anyway,i am no expert in analysing whether the maid was mentally ill.But,i think its too serious to charge the Malaysian boy with death penalty.If i were a judge n could choose,i would rather sentence the maid to death,coz mentally ill or not,if she were out of jail,she might likely to kill again since she already has experience n has killed someone before.But that boy will less likely to kill someone when he was released from jail.</p>

              <p>Recently,a young Malaysian boy was sentence to death penalty for trafficking drug into Singapore,n he was sentence to death.</p>
              <p>Now,there are some big problem here.If my memory serve me right,i remember there was a case whereby an Indonesian maid kill her employer n get away with death penalty.My guess is probably our PAP government afraid to offend the Indonesia.</p>
              <p>This time,a young Malaysian Chinese was sentence to death just becoz of drug traffickering?What kind of logic is that?Killing someone can get away with death penalty,while carry drug is sentence to death,tell me,what kind of logic is that?No wonder many Singaporeans dont respect Singapore laws anymore,coz it seems to be "LKY Law",not our country law!!!!</p>
              <p>Furthermore,although Malaysian government do plead for the boy,but we all do know that Malaysian government is a racist country.They only care about Malay Muslim,they dont really give a damn about Chinese n Indians or any other races in their country.From their "Malay Privileges" policy we can tell that.So,our PAP government might think they will be "safe" to sentence the boy to death without any retaliation from Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Another wrong part about this judgement is that that offender is only 18 or 19 yrs old when committed the crime,what does a 19 yrs old boy know about "life"?What does he know about the "evil nature" of some humans?(i think i dont need to elaborate who is the devils here).That poor victim doesnt even consider a "man" but merely a "boy" who doesnt know the dangerous of this world.</p>
              <p>And yet LKY n his PAP ministers simply sentence the boy to death without consider the age of the victim,LOL!!!!I know its the judge who sentence the boy to death,but who create the law?Who can control the law?</p>
              <p>And becoz of this,LKY n his PAP ministers can be rest assure that they will go to "Hell" after their death.</p>

              <p>Lets not mix up the indonesian and the malaysian. offence committed in Singapore and they are tried under the singapore law, regardless of their nationality.</p>
              <p>The police ascertain the facts, the prosecutor present the case against the offender, the defendant is entitled to legal defence, and the judges pass the judgement and sentence according the facts and argument presented, and based on the law.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing "if you were the judge", for you don't know the law, you don't have all the facts, and your only argument for the trafficker is that he is a boy, by what definition do you call him a boy? he shares pacifier with you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              death penalty.If i were a judge n could choose,i would rather
              sentence the maid to death,coz mentally ill or not,if she were out
              of jail,she might likely to kill again since she already has

              <p>Maybe you can dig out the report to check cos I'm posting base on my memory too. Leaving the case of the maid aside, we were all taught from young the damages drugs can inflict socially as well as on an individual well being. I do not know how much drugs that has to be consumed before it kills a person, thus for that 40g of drugs, I am not sure how much damage would be done. </p>
              <p>However, one thing for sure is, damage would definitely be done. And drugs kill, in other words, he is also considered a murderer, someone who would cause social problems in Singapore, someone who would disrupt another person way of life by bringing that drug. </p>
              <p>For someone who would impose so much trouble in our country, why should we show him leniency? </p>
              <p>True enough, not everyone have that many 10 or 15 yrs. But the real culprits behind the scene could have easily given him a lump sum which could be use for taking care of his family for that 10-15 yrs. In this case, it is most likely that he would return to his old ways, seeking it as a means to provide for his family. </p>
