But sometimes u have to probe the reasons why people don't like certain things.<br><br>Example: if casino/gambling allowed to thrive, there will be an increasing trend of social ills i.e. bankruptcy, families breaking up, loansharks, suicide, giving pple the wrong idea that gambling is a quick way to gain big bucks w/o working for it etc<br><br>Casino/gambling threatens to tear up society.  This is an example of how individual preference (i.e. dislike gambling) is actually part of the right of a person to decide what kind of society he wants to live in.<br><br>So there's nothing wrong in voicing out individual preferences when they affect our lives and what we decide to make of our own country and society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's a fair argument. Yes, Singaporeans have the right to choose the society that they live in.

            <div class='col-md body'>Smokers pay more taxes than non-smokers. At least gahmen should provide convenient places for them to smoke. Non-smokers can stay clear of these places.<br><br>I think non-smokers are not getting lung cancer from cigarette smoke but from pollution, particularly motor pollution. Smoking has been on the decline and many places have smoking ban. Therefore lung cancer should decline as well. If it is increasing, it must mean that something else in the air is causing the cancer.</div>
