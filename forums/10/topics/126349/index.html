Its amazing..i really feel like telling them that this is a government's way to tax u all. please stop throwing money away !!!!<br><br>come on, lets boycott 4D and all those nonsense that singapore pools come out with , gambling is bad no matter if it is approved by government or not. and 4D is never connected to gods , dreams or spirits. Not a single 4D word was every written in scriptures of buddhist or daoist. Its all abt luck , nothing abt e supernature meddling with e balls to come out with e 4 numbers, or its jus a case of probability ....<br><br>I wonder where does the money of singapore pool go into ? if its 4 billion like someone mentioned... where will it go ???</div>
