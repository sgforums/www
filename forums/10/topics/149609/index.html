But is this the situation in reality? Some of us sweat blood as conscripts, but when it comes to job security, we are on the edge of our seats. This can't be allowed to go on. Those who made the most sacrifices for the country deserve some form of reward. Even if this means empowering the labour unions to take up enterprise bargaining, so be it.</div>

Ever since the 2000/2001 crisis, the gov has been talking about companies should hire older workers and career changers, etc. Its always just lip services. It is plain simple to any Singaporean that being law-abiding, the only way to goad companies to take in minorities is EEOC legislation. Sad to say no smell of such legislatin in the air.</div>

We have just launch our Youth Wing which you could visit at http://www.wp.org.sg/youthwing/<br><br>I think this is the most relevant happening in WP that could relate to this forum as many forumites here are young people. There is an age limit, from 18 years old to 40 years old. There are two levels of membership, one is full membership whereby you have to join as WP party member or just become associate member which does not require you to become WP member.<br><br>We are in the midst of planning for the upcoming event, most probably a forum on a subject that is interesting to youngsters. The Youth Wing also help in running grassroot activities in Hougang, like the coming Latern Festivals as well as social welfare events, like Free hair cut and giving out of rice to the needy residents of Hougang. The weekly giving away of bread by Food from the Hearts is also coordinated by YW members who happen to be in HGCC as well.<br><br>The Youth Wing also support grassroot activities like walkabout and Hammer sales.<br><br>The other happening of course is the re-organization of our two election fighting forces, Nee Soon Area Committee into Nothern Area Committee and GRC Area Committee into Northeastern Area Committee.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Timothytsgsg,<br><br>Though we welcome people to vote for us, but we need to have a long term following instead of just "protest voting". The consistent growth of alternative parties' presence in parliament depends very much on the "enlighten" voters who vote rationally instead of emotional protest voting.<br><br>We are just too small to become alternative government now, but we need to start somewhere and the growth path is important. This growth path need die hard consistent support from people who understand and value checks and balances in the political system.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br>singaporealternatives.blogspot.com<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by timothytsgsg:</div><div class="quote_body">It's time we stood up for what we believe in, and in what we believe we should have.<br><br>If we don't register our unhappiness in the upcoming elections- whether held this year or next year- we may never will.
