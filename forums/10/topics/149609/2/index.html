Which democratic nation gives their opponent a level playing field? C'mon.. please don't tell me you've been speaking all this while without even knowing this?<br><br>Take for example Michael Moore. He has filmed numerous videos and wrote several books undermining George Bush in the US.. Do you see Bush calling in the police to question Moore? Do you hear about Bush sending Moore to jail for saying things against him? The answer is NO.<br><br>You are comparing an apple with an orange to start with. China in those days operated under the aristocratic system. Here, we claim we operate under the system of democracy but we behave as if we were aristocrats.<br><br>Of course everyone would want to enchance their chances of winning in a competition, but there is no need to resort to underhand methods in achieving that. Please don't tell me about Sun Zi and emperors and castles. Open your eyes - this is not China. This is a "democratic" country!!!<br><br></div>

The foolhardy emperor and his troops were crushed.<br><br>Moral of the story : To be kind to others is to be cruel to oneself.<br><br>The story above tells you that the emperor is a fool. Do you expect our gahmen to be that?. Nevertheless, a brave, wise and benolevent warrior will overcome all odds and win the war.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Yes,i know the story,and i know what u meant.In reality,i also make a fool out of myself by being too kind to others.But now the problem is,the PAP leaders no need to be kind to the opposition party members,but at least,our election system has to be "transparent and justified".<br>Today the PAP leaders feel like disqualified opposition members eligibility to sit for the election,they disqualified them.Tomorrow they feel like "tweaking" the election rules,they tweak it.Then i ask u,what the hell is our General Election" stand for,a "Barbie Girl Game"????</div>
