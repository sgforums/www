By the way the TC is under the MP controlled right??? I have noticed in Hougang that TC and the RC or CC had some rivarly or "cold war". Like eg happened a few months back RCzone5 want to organise barbecue party and to organise it in the park opp the TC(Blk 701) and go and apply from TC and they rejected why is this so??? Having this type of situation is bad and good for the residents as for the good the residents benefit from both of them. While the bad thing is the residents will surely get involved in this type of political situation and there would be mistrust and suspicious arouse in there which can be quite chaotic.</div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>To add on to what Meng Seng said, I hold the view that the Hougang Town Council (HGTC) under Workers' Party has for the last 10 years been very objective in its management and handling of the PAP-affiliated "national" grassroots (namely CC, CCC and RC).<br><br>Despite the fact of how the partial and partisan "national" grassroots treat the Workers' Party's presence in Hougang <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And HGTC is definitely far more impartial than the PAP's treatment of Workers' Party nationally <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There are several instances I know of that I am not able to reveal; however I may reveal the following 2 instances:<br><br>1) When Workers' Party members put up a poster containing the Party logo in some new notice boards specially for Hougang Constituency Committee (Workers' Party's party grassroots body in Hougang), the "national" grassroots lodged a complaint against Workers' Party to Hougang Town Council on the basis that the HGCC should not have notice boards since it was a party arm and if the notice boards were under HGTC, they were not supposed to be used for non-political purposes. HGTC promptly asked Workers' Party to remove the notices.<br><br>2) There was a broken and abandoned RC notice board left in its state for a long time which the RC zone committee did not bother to do anything about. HGTC estate surveyors found it an eyesore and highlighted it to the HGTC GM, who bothered to write a letter to People's Association (PA) to repair the notice board, doing the RC zone a favour.<br><br>I am sure since you know Hougang situation pretty well, you may have heard of these instances <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regards</div>

Desperately poor people, especially those who are old and of retirement age need all the help they can get. In my opinion, taxpayers money spent in this area is well spent.<br><br>But we can do better too, such as trying to lower their medical fee expenses, their well being, their food problems and better housing etc.<br><br>In short, I'd rather set aside some money to help the bottom 10% of society than throwing money at dubious unprofitable ventures overseas(and then losing money) like Ho Ching and Temasek Holdings.</div>

The notice boards were not removed. Only one was relocated to another wall. The RC made noise and the HGTC put it back in the old place. But in fact, according to HGTC survey, the wall that the RC noticeboard was relocated to had better human traffic since it faced the carpark.<br><br>Actually, come to think of it, I am not surprised that the areas you mentioned are the 700s blocks. The RC Chairman in that vicinity an extremely petty man. I think his character is the cause of many quarrels with the HGTC, not the HGTC. Else, why is it that zone having so many problems and not other zones.<br><br>There is a chairman in another zone in Hougang who is very gentlemenly and earned my respect. He never complains unnecessarily. Incidentally, I see him appearing less often with Mr Eric Low than the nasty zone chairman, raising the question that this nasty chairman is possibly a mere "ball-carrier".<br><br>I think this RC zone is far over-calculative. I think if the HGTC wants to take a leave from the nasty chairman's book and also calculate with the RCs, they will have to go through more problems.<br><br>Regards</div>

The notice boards were not removed. Only one was relocated to another wall. The RC made noise and the HGTC put it back in the old place. But in fact, according to HGTC survey, the wall that the RC noticeboard was relocated to had better human traffic since it faced the carpark.<br><br>Actually, come to think of it, I am not surprised that the areas you mentioned are the 700s blocks. The RC Chairman in that vicinity an extremely petty man. I think his character is the cause of many quarrels with the HGTC, not the HGTC. Else, why is it that zone having so many problems and not other zones.<br><br>There is a chairman in another zone in Hougang who is very gentlemenly and earned my respect. He never complains unnecessarily. Incidentally, I see him appearing less often with Mr Eric Low than the nasty zone chairman, raising the question that this nasty chairman is possibly a mere "ball-carrier".<br><br>I think this RC zone is far over-calculative. I think if the HGTC wants to take a leave from the nasty chairman's book and also calculate with the RCs, they will have to go through more problems.<br><br>Regards</div></blockquote>Mr Eric Low ai yah. My zone the RC chairman want things to be perfect by organising this programme and that in order to get three stars and get praises from Mr Eric Low. When he comes for the activity held by the RC she tried to command people to do this and that in order to please him. But she do this type of thing and sometimes buay song and talk bad about him!!!!</div>

We also can voice out our views too but only a "little" But you see other countries the government don't allow them to vote and also to voice out or else they will be oppressed. So our government is quite ok but still need a room of improvement and we consider ourselves lucky already with little corruptions and etc in the country. I think the government should encourage us to read in politics or maybe even join them as we may better serve our country as now not a lot of people are interested in it(my opinion) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
