            <div class='col-md body'>The perception of this case is very complicated as she has died too after the baby had been thrown down. We might never know the real truth on why she threw the baby down?<br><br>First of all, when she came to singapore to work, she might not get use to the place here as this country is a total stranger to her and she has difficulty in adapting staying here.<br><br>Second, Singaporeans tend to be very very impatient when coming to teach ppl how to do work and things. But have they ever think of how are they being thought and how patient the trainer can get? Singaporeans have this damn mentality that they are damned great and they are smart but they are wrong. Theyare only great in this small country and they are arrogant!<br><br>There could be lots of reasons as to why the maid has thrown the baby down and eventually herself. Rumours that she has been abused. I do agree on that point that she has been abused. She came here dun know anything about the country's culture and the living lifestyle and the employer expect her to know everything about housework. I think that's stupid thinking as employer think they are great! Why dun they do it themselves? They are think that they are damn f#@king rich and they can do anything to other ppl. They tend to neglect or didn't even think that the maid is also a human being!<br><br>If the employer did abuse her, she deserves this kind of punishment but it's cruel as a child is involved and the child dun deserve this kind of treatment.<br><br>I have one last thing to say is that Singaporeans are screwed up totally! They are Kiasu, Kiasi and selfish!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are a lot of Singaporeans who still have this feudal mentality that a maid is their property and not their employee.We should emphasise to one and all that a maid is a live-in employee.She deserves equal labour rights as another employee in a firm.Most of us begin to think that a maid is a necessity, which is a vey wrong concept.The argument that no one is there to look after their kids is very fallacious and weak.Stay-in maids in the West are not commonplace, yet the parents both work.Are their children any more screwed up?I think not.<br><br>We should increase the amount of day care and creches available to parents so that we don't have a situation where all and sundry think that maids are a necessity in life.Clean your own goddamn house and take responsiblity for the upbringing of your own child.If you cannot afford childcare, then do not have a baby until you are financially solid enough to do so.Why let your kid be raised by a total stranger who is not trained in child care or even early childhood education?And for those who have maids, it's high time you treat them equally.Feudalistic notions are outdated, so please stop shaming the rest of us who are more mentally capable to comprehend that a maid deserves treatment worthy of a free individual.</div>
