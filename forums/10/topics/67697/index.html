            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> from today's straits times.<br><br>Leader<br>The absent Singaporean<br><br>IT IS a perverse law. The world's population, which is about 6.33 billion now, is projected to grow to 7.8 billion by 2025. Most of the growth will take place in the developing world, that is, in many of those countries that are least equipped to support the new numbers. By contrast, the populations of many developed countries are expected to shrink over the next two decades, threatening their ability to maintain labour forces, raise sufficient taxes from the working population and, ultimately, preserve their standard of living. Combine that prospect with an ageing population, and the conclusion is a frightening one. Just how frightening was suggested by Mr Erik R. Peterson and Mr Jay C. Farrar of the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies. Today, they told a conference here recently, there are 30 pension-eligible elders in the developed world for every 100 working-age adults. By the year 2040, there will be 70. In some countries - Italy, Japan and Spain - projections suggest that the number will be 100 by the year 2040: one pension-eligible person for every working-age adult. How, they asked, could the social welfare systems of Western Europe be sustained in the face of ageing societies? The question is a pertinent one for other affluent societies as well.<br><br>Given these stark realities, it should be logical for those in poorer countries to opt to have fewer children - to preserve the little that they have - and for those in richer countries to produce more children to sustain what they have. But the reality is very different. All around the world, people live as if there is no tomorrow. The poor, accustomed to scarcity, do not appear to care what happens to the next generation. The rich, anxious to protect their living standards, do not seem to understand that their children would not enjoy the same if their numbers fell sharply. Some of them take children out of the equation - by not having any - thereby worsening an already bad problem for their societies. This is why absent Singaporeans - those who are not being born - featured in Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's Chinese New Year message last week. In spite of incentives, there were just 41,451 births in 2001 and 40,864 in 2002, when Singapore needs at least 50,000 births a year to sustain economic, defence and other manpower needs.<br><br>Perhaps this is nature's revenge on inequality. The poor increase their numbers even as the rich decrease theirs, thus making the world a little more egalitarian for those who have no way of choosing whether to be born in sub-Saharan Africa or in Singapore. But nature is of little comfort to policy-makers who must try to keep Singapore going. However, there is a problem with what governments can actually do. A New York Times article on Mexico in 1999 quoted a mother who bore 14 children in 25 years. 'I know the government tells everybody to have fewer now, but I think it's none of their business,' she said. Singaporeans would, by and large, disagree that their having more babies is none of the Government's business, but not enough of them seem to be listening to its message, sweetened though it is with incentives. Ultimately, perhaps, the answer lies in nature. Having children, bringing them up and watching them as they overtake one's hopes and dreams - this is the reward that parenthood brings. Ultimately, children are their own justification. What they mean or do not mean for the economy comes afterwards. This is true in the poorest countries as in the richest. Maybe, some of the wisdom of the poor will rub off on Singapore's rich.<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.</div>

the Prime Minister of Yue, realized that in order to restore his country back into a strong state, one of the important issues that he would have to tackle effectively, would be to increase the tiny population size of the Yue State, from it miserable number, to a sizable figure that would enable the country to hold conscription orders for a sizable army.<br><br>To encourage the Yue population to increase the country's birthrate and figure, the State implemented the following new legislations:<br><br>1) For every family that has more than one child, the State will take care of the expenses that is required to bring up a Second.<br><br>2) For families with more than two children, the State will take care of all the expenses that is required to bring up both the Second, and the Third Child.<br><br>3) In conjunction with the above, all newly cultivated farmlands will be tax free for the next 7 years.<br><br>The above, took place under circumstances which is a little familiar to us at the moment.<br><br>Yue was facing internal economic woes while Singapore has just experienced a continuous wave of economic recessions and slowdowns since 1997 to current.<br><br>Yue has had its population lost by a significant number after the war while Singapore has been facing a long run decline trend in birthrates ratio and numbers.<br><br>While the Baby Bonus Scheme had eventually materialized to encourage and attempt to address the unfavourable reproduction trend, I fear that the current incentives' efforts may only meet the tip of an iceberg problem.<br><br>To better address the deep rooted concerns, why not have the following :<br><br>1) A new public housing scheme where by family units can purchase larger room flats at a significantly discounted price, in agreement for say, a 3 children + 2 parents family unit in fifteen years time?<br><br>Failure to adhere to the agreement can always have HDB reclaiming back its discounts back from the original purchasers at a later date.<br><br>2) Like the State of Yue, have free primary and secondary education for the 3rd or onwards child?<br><br>3) And similar to number 2, but with State paying for free basic medical consultation fees at government polyclinics?<br><br>Investments made in the above areas should not be seen as expenses to the State.<br><br>Since every single cent that goes into the above illustration reaps long-term returns with a child eventually growing up into an economic able contributer, a NS ready soldier, as well as a better and more mature reflecter on the investments made in him/her by the State, clearly these will be money well spent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What Neo said is definitely well-written and true to the point! But, we live in a modern society, in a very metropolitican city, if you were to look at other fast paced cities, you will see that birth rates are exceptional low. People are more focused on getting that job, earning a good salary, getting that yacht(all the Cs)... they're losing sight of family values and rising a family.<br><br>Look at girls, nowadays, they're ambitious and want the Cs. In the old days, they were programmed to start a family before their 20s. Now, girls are starting only when they are reaching 30. As for guys, it starts with getting good grades, then getting that dream job, then getting the career started, by the time we have time for ourselves to look back for a suitable partner, we're like in our 30's. Hah! Thinking about, I'm not that far off...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if this will give the govt more excuse to justify their foreign talent policy.<br><br>Leading on from there, citizenship rules will change, perhaps making it much much easier and then sg will really be like a cosmopolitan city. So when the govt eventuall gives up persuading singporeans to give birth, I wonder will it take the other extreme measure to go and promote sg citizenship to foreigners. Quite a scary tot.. then singporeans will become their country's own 2nd/ 3rd class citizens.. if it is already not so yet.<br><br>In the long run, everyone will suffer.. Singaporeans will suffer. As Atobe pointed out national security is at stake.. Mercenaries? More capital investment on machines and gadgets then on manpower? Like in many scenarios, if there is to be really an invasion.. all the leaders will run first.. The only one I know who din was Saddam.<br><br>I m not being pro govt, but trying to regenerate ourselves is really to our own advantage and survival. but of course, it will be tough trying to sell this idea to the females and maybe even to male singaporeans out there..<br><br>Sometimes I wonder if all these is one big conspiracy that the PAP govt has set up just to put us all down.. haha..<br><br>Imagine, 20 years down the road, any baby bonus scheme fail, govt on a hunt and prowl for talented foreigners begging them to become citizens of singapore, then they have to pass a law to say these people cannot vote. Then they quietly relocate "aborignes singaporeans" into one corner of singapore run by an opposition. while the rest of singapore gets PAP walkovers.. and they stay on in power and really for their own "Good Years to Come"<br><br>Radical rite?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If it requires too much resources the government won't even  consider it... It may not work as well since people do not want kids not because they can't afford to. The richer people in singapore doesn't seems to have more kids than the poorer people here... in fact the opposite can be observed... I guess richer means they to too busy to take care of childrens...<br><br>I agree with Neo tat his suggestions r new and workable, especially the housing scheme... Maybe maybe we can modify a bit so tat a potential 3 child family get to have priority in choosing flats and smaller discount.<br><br>Or maybe the parents of 3 children, working in gov service get to have 5 days week instead of 5 1/2 days so they will have more time for children. Or they be granted 20% more leaves than normal people.<br><br>Children in 3 child family get to have priority in choosing primary (and only primary) schools perhaps...<br><br>Vaccination against more dieseases be free for family of 3 childrens. Medishield and etc be cheaper for them...<br><br>For monetary advantages, maybe lowering the tax for hiring maids, discount on HDB flats and public transport may help. Or maybe singapore shares be given to members in family of 3 every year.<br><br>But then again these may not work wonders in improving the birth rates. Wat is the added advantages of 3 children compared to 2 ? The problems for having the 3rd children, however is 50% more than having 2 children... Thus is seems hard to pursuade them to born 3 children</div>
