            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading Freakonomics on the bus when 2 group of girls came aboard, one group was standing behind me and the other just beside me.<br><br>The group behind me was talking about the Superstar auditions a few days back, seems of them and their friends tried but fail, listening to the way they hum the tunes the audition must be very embrassing for themselves and their friends. The whole journey they keep talking about stars and their singing.<br><br>The group of girls who was standing beside me made me look up from my book and stare at them; both groups of girls were of the same age (16-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, but this group was talking about which university in the staes is better and how they are going to do their degree and masters. They also talk about which subjects are they going to major and minor in and how will it help them in their career next time. Their conversation topic also included accomodations, how to finance their loan for study and housing and the finer tips of getting better scores/results in exams. Their maturity and focus for their age really shock and surprise me. From their conversations, you know they were forward thinking, know what they wanted in life and seems nothing can stop them from achieving their goals.<br><br>The first group are local teenage girls, the second group of girls are from mainland china. Later I discuss this with my sister and she highlighted a point which explain alot; if you were send at an early age to study abroad, your views and perspective will totally be diff, even for adults to move to overseas is very traumatic, thus the resulting impact of this is ultimate drive and determination.<br><br>By the way i was not being k-po but they were like just talking beside my ear.</div>

For all you know they could be the next Stephanie Sun and be the next Singapore Icon. If we are like the PRC chinese aiming for lower level needs like survival, we would never be able to have a popular culture like Taiwan or South Korea.<br><br>Sometimes i think the PRC spoil their children more than Singaporeans because of the 1 child policy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agreed that there is nothing wrong being facinated with project superstar, my question is whether do young Singaporeans have foresight, and more realistic, worldly views (as mention by hloc) as their China counterparts<br><br>How can we raise our children to be more competitive, more capable and more wanting to do more under the peaceful prosperous and secure environment that they are being brought up from</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you see those kids in china who are living in comfort.. They will also think of what our local teenagers are thinking. Everywhere is the same no matter where you are from. nothing to be sad or depress on. teenagers who are in the comfort zone most of them are like that.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>it's also a matter of culture. the chinese have to fight very hard to survive even in china. such a culture of survivability is prevalent enough in singaporeans, where we've been trained to just accept life it is and continue. china is blooming and it's youth believe that if they work hard they will succeed. though it has also created a problem of results over procedures, money over morals.</div>
