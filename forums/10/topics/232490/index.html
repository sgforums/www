            <div class='col-md body'>Syringe so close that I can't move<br>S'porean refuses to give JB man 45 cents<br><br>Robber then threatens to jab him with HIV-tainted needle<br><br>By Lynette Lim<br><br>January 19, 2007<br><br>IT was well past midnight when a Singaporean couple decided to drive back to Singapore from Johor Baru.<br><br>Mr Lim showing the Cashcard he offered the robber and a copy of the police report he made. With him is girlfriend Ms Teo. -- NG XINYAO<br>On the way, they stopped to get a drink - and clerk Wong Shui Sheng ended up being threatened with a possibly HIV-tainted syringe.<br><br>All because he refused to give RM1 (45 cents) to a robber.<br><br>Mr Wong, 21, and his girlfriend, Ms Teo Qian Wen, also 21, were saved when a shopkeeper and his friend charged at the man with a metal pole after suspecting something was wrong.<br><br>The couple had gone to JB on Friday night for a meal and to top up the petrol in his two-month-old Chery QQ. A few kilometres from the Causeway, Mr Wong wanted to stop by a provision shop.<br><br>As the main road was lined with cars, he parked in a small unlit alley nearby. His was the only car in the alley then.<br><br>They bought their drinks and returned to the car in three minutes.<br><br>After getting in, Mr Wong was about to shut the door when a man held onto it and stopped him from doing so.<br><br>It was about 1.45am then.<br><br>They had earlier seen the man - who appeared to be in his 40s - coming down a staircase next to the alley.<br><br>THREATENED<br><br>The couple described the man as short, hunched and wearing dark clothing.<br><br>Said Mr Wong: 'He said in Mandarin, 'Excuse me, do you have RM1?'<br><br>'I had just over RM1 but I didn't want to give it to him. So I told him I did not have any money left.'<br><br>Ms Teo was in the passenger seat next to him.<br><br>The man then held a syringe filled with what he claimed to be blood and placed the needle less than 5cm from Mr Wong's right arm.<br><br>'He said in Mandarin that he had Aids and that the blood had the HIV virus,' said Mr Wong.<br><br>'He wanted to jab me if I did not give him the money.'<br><br>Mr Wong panicked and tried to give the man all the money he had - RM1.30. But the man then changed his mind.<br><br>He told Mr Wong that he was 'not begging' and that he just wanted money to treat his illness.<br><br>'He then asked me to give him $20 to $30. I told him that I did not have any Singapore dollars on me and tried to give him my CashCard instead,' said Mr Wong.<br><br>The man rejected it as he 'did not know how to use it'.<br><br>Instead, he demanded Mr Wong's handphone (worth about $800), telling Mr Wong to remove his SIM card before handing it over.<br><br>Mr Wong refused to give up his expensive phone, claiming that he had no money to buy a new one, but the man told him to 'tell your father to buy one for you since your father is very rich'.<br><br>'He probably thinks that all Singaporeans are very rich,' said Mr Wong.<br><br>The man refused to let Mr Wong get out from his car to talk outside.<br><br>'I wanted to talk outside because my girlfriend was inside the car and I did not want to frighten her further.<br><br>'He had already threatened me, claiming that he had a knife in his back pocket and I felt helpless throughout because the syringe was so close and I could not move. I did not know if the blood really had HIV virus, but I did not want to take the risk,' said Mr Wong.<br><br>Fortunately for Mr Wong, the shopkeeper knew him and became suspicious when he did not see Mr Wong's white car move.<br><br>The shopkeeper moved closer and saw the man holding the syringe.<br><br>He then shouted in Malay: 'Hey what are you trying to do to my friend?'<br><br>The man then said: 'I'm just asking him for RM1 to buy coffee.'<br><br>The shopkeeper did not fall for it and alerted his friend who was in the shop.<br><br>The friends confronted the man with a 30cm-long metal bar and overpowered him. They told Mr Wong to make a police report while they held the thief.<br><br>Mr Wong and his girlfriend then went to a police station nearby to make a report before driving back to Singapore.<br><br>They went back to JB again on Sunday night and heard from the shopkeeper that the man had eventually managed to flee.<br><br>Said Ms Teo: 'I have been having nightmares since that night.'<br><br>The couple have been making such trips to JB every two or three days for the past two months since Mr Wong got his first car.<br><br>They go to buy petrol and to eat at a food centre which serves 'good food'.<br><br>'I have read about cases such as this in the newspapers but I never thought it would happen to me,' said Mr Wong.<br><br>Despite what happened, Mr Wong said he will not be staying away from JB. But he will take a spanner with him for protection.<br><br></div>

He demanded RM10 ($4.50).<br><br>When Mr Ho told him that he had no money, the man raised a syringe and asked Mr Ho if he could see the needle.<br><br>The sight of the needle unnerved them.<br><br>Left with no choice, Mr Ho offered the robber all he had - RM50 ($22) and $5.<br><br>But the man refused to take all the money. Eventually, he just took the $5 bill and left without another word.<br><br>In February 2005, events manager Vincent Lam, 38, said he had a similar experience at the same place.<br><br>He was stopped from closing his car door by a man who was described as skinny and shabbily clad.<br><br>When Mr Lam told the man that he did not have much and 'to go home', the man's accomplice appeared. The second man held a syringe.<br><br>After he gave the robbers all the money he had - RM30 - the two fled.<br><br></div>
