They get paid instead of money taken away.  maids are no FTs!!<br><br>we have agreement on your last two paragraphs, singaporean, like sgPAP, looks only at bottomline, money!! who are developing those hybrid cars? who ensure that emission limits are implemented? history tells us that we can't just leave it to the cars manufacturers or the oil companies, there must be legislations, by international bodies, by the governments, WTO/IMF meeting is one of the opportunities where many such and similar issues and concerns are brought up. These CSO activists do not travel all over the world demonstrate and vandalising as a norm, and accommodating them as a host is only an identification with their cause.
