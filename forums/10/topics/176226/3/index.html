It will only make them more dependent. There is also a question of degree.

The public sector doctors in the UK are helping sick people by giving them the best medicine and you condemn them for over-spending public money.</blockquote>I am not brain-washed lah. What I mean is that it is given out so freely that UK spends more than 10% of its GDP just on healthcare. I wouldn't say it's unreasonable. But I feel that those drugs, should be kept for people with serious conditions, not prescribed to anybody who has any illnesses. My teacher has told me that they prescribe one of the top flu's drug just for the common flu. He has been to UK and once came down with flu. He visited the doctor and was prescribe some drugs. When he came back to Singapore, he asked more about the flu drug. He was told that it is one of the best ones around. I was surprised.<br><br>If the illness isn't too serious and common drugs could treat it, why not use the common drugs? Why use expensive ones? It is wasting taxpayers' money.</div>
