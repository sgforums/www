He commited politcal suicide when he shouted at the popular GCT.<br><br>At least, his fate is not as bad as Francis Seow. The former Law society President's records were dug up like Andrew Kuan and was charged with tax evasion and also went under arrest under ISA. Maybe its a blessing in disguise for him to commit political suicide. It could have been worse.<br><br>For opposition members that dares to argues with PAP, they are  already putting their personal wealth at stake. They also face the risk of their personal records being dug up, or bankrupted like the former opposition members.<br><br>So when PAP tells says you cant vote because of weak opposition and not because of GRC, take it with a pinch of salt.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the biggest problem here is not about whose right or wrong, but Singaporean voters in general think that their individual votes have no effect on the overall political system. Democracy cannot be achieved without citizen participation.<br><br>Just a cautionary statement from pre-WWII history: Hitler was immensely popular in Germany and was voted in the German Parliament. We know it was a historical disaster. The main point is Hitler was democractically elected into the parliament. Germany's Nazi history serves to remind us that popularity does not justify if a politician has a sound manifesto. It makes you wonder how many German voters actually assess Hitler's manifesto?<br><br>I think the same question applies for Singapore too:<br>1. How many Singaporean voters assess the PAP manifesto?<br>2. How many Singaporean voters assess the WP manifesto?<br>3. How many Singaporean voters assess the SDP manifesto?<br>4.

            <div class='col-md body'>The tenable position the Ruling party has carefully build up over 40 years has placed voters in a difficult choice.<br><br>The way i see it, many people are upset with actions and decisions made by the Ruling party. But the logical choice is as good as no choice at all.<br><br>Choose between PAP or an opposition member of untried calibre.<br><br>In today's context, that is as good as choosing between the lesser of two 'evils'.<br><br>Choose the Ruling party and continue to be subjected to their mundane and 'infallible' leadership? Or choose a young blood who could potentially point us in a fresh direction?<br><br>The choice isn't that difficult if you live in landed property, had a good education and enjoy the relative comforts of the middle-income living. There is unfortunately, very little the ruling party has done to earn these voters. As a result, single-seat wards like Nee Soon South almost fell to opposition hands in a 49%-51% in the 90s elections. Soon after, Nee Soon South boundaries were annexed and formed part of the new AMK GRC under current PM LHL.<br><br>The result is that such residents have not voted in the last 15 years.<br><br>In contrast, average-low income living citizens have a heavier reliance on rebates and grants from the govt. This 'dependency' syndrome means that for a significant defection to opposition votes, these people are voluntarily giving up these 'necessities' to an opposition candidate whom may be effectively 'powerless' to provide to his constituents in the same manner as the PAP.<br><br>For these people, is it any choice really?<br><br>On the other hand, if i digress a little, many people claim that the current crop of oppostion candidates are unknown, untried and untested.<br><br>But as <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LKY himself admitted</strong></span></span> in a recent interview about his running for the upcoming election, GRCs promote the introduction of such 'unknown, untried and untested' PAP candidates into parliament.<br><br>Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee is just one such unknown candidate who has been in Tanjong Pagar GRC for the last 15 years, a GRC which has been UNCHALLENGED since 1991 when Professor Koo joined LKY in a 4 member team.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it would be very useful to Singaporeans to have a listing of various issues and know where the ruling party stands in relation to the Opposition. As more manifestos are published, we can fill in the gaps and perhaps then we will be in a better position to vote. For starters, I have initiated the following list and hope that others will add to it:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affordable healthcare</span><br>PAP: Emphasize personal responsibility, relying on Medisave, medishield and personal health insurance policies that can be bought through medisave, possible means testing for ward allocation in future<br>WP: healthcare costs to be largely funded by the government with co-payment of basic hospital insurance, means testing for certain services, subsidies for those who cannot afford basic hospital insurance, HIV drugs and treatment to be provided to all<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Greater sanctions against NS dodgers:</span><br>PAP: For (new legislation passed)<br>Opposition<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abolish Elected President</span><br>PAP: Against<br>WP: For<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proportional representation</span><br>PAP: Against<br>WP: For<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abolish Internal Security Act</span><br>PAP: Against<br>WP: For<br><br>I like some things in the WP manifesto but I am wary of their facts and figures. Just confining my comments to the healthcare sector that I am more familiar with, the WP is in favour of greater government funding. However, it has not given us any indication as to how much more subsidy they expect. Perhaps they do not know themselves  (have they done their sums?). How are they going to fund the difference?<br><br>My fear is that because the WP does not expect to have to form the government they feel they can demand for more spending without having to handle the negative aspects of the policy, such as higher taxes, decreasing competitiveness and a dependent culture.<br><br></div>

However, there are some causes for concerns:<br>1. Why are foreigners paying the same fees as Singaporeans for tertiary education? They ought to be paying at least 50% higher and still being bonded to Singapore for at 3years.<br>2. Isn't primary education insufficient to meet the demands for today's knowledge economy? It makes more sense that the minimum education level should be secondary, so that the individual is still elligible to apply for technical institutes or polytechnics in future, when the need arises.<br>3.
