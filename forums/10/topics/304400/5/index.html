Stocks and shares may make up a part of their assets.<br><br>If their assets lose value, when it comes time to convert them to cash to pay bills, there will be no money. Other assets like factory equipment, inventory, or the property in which their business transact may not be as liquid. No money to do business so the company goes bankrupt. So you lose your job.<br><br>You start looking for a new job but many companies have been hit similarly and they are cutting staff to stay in business.<br><br>You start living off your savings. The bank your money is in goes bankrupt because they overextended themselves. Your family starts to starve.<br><br>The Government starts to give out free food to keep the population from starving to death. You don't want to depend on handouts, they make you feel vulnerable and helpless.<br><br>You smuggle yourself overseas to get a job and earn money. They spit on you and call you brown monkey and beat you for taking their jobs but still you work like a slave for a miserable wage to support your family in Singapore.<br><br>Are you getting worried yet?</div>

I'm not an economist and I don't follow the markets. I find Andrew's posts informative and the graphs and explanations sound reasonable so I am impressed with his knowlege and his ability to explain things in a way I can understand.<br><br>I'm not so impressed that I would accept everything else he says blindly and neither would I think he is incapable of making a mistake.</div>
