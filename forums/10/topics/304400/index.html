            <div class='col-md body'>I like how you created a thread to reply to yourself in quick succession.<br><br>First of all, let's not treat the proposal as a fact. Singapore has not crashed...how can you blame anybody for something that has not yet happened?<br><br>Oh but you say you CAN SEE that it will crash. In other words, everything you say is based on your own prediction. In other words...it's all personal opinion.<br><br>Here's mine:<br><br>I must admit I've seen a deterioration in Singapore in the last decade. No, not the finances...that part is ridiculously healthy(despite what you say). No, not because of the influx of FT. But because I'm starting to see the ugly side of singapore emerge. In other words, People like you are starting to crawl out of their holes.<br><br>Spoiled by years of government protection, enjoying high standards of living unique to few countries have made some of us(and by us i mean you) soft. You happily take the benefits when times are good, but is quick to look for people to blame when times are not so good(notice I don't say bad, because it's not).<br><br>Sure, blame it on the FT when you can't compete in the global market(what are you, a baby that needs protection from the big bad world?) Blame the government for increasing taxes (remember all the times you like to compare sg gov with foreign ones? How about comparing the taxes?) Blame the old leaders for hanging on to power(with maniacs like CSJ on the loose, can you blame them, really?)<br><br>Decades of soft living have made people such as yourself dependent on the very system you claim to despise. You're like the little boy who complains to his friends about how domineering his dad is, but at the first loud noise, runs back to daddy for protection.<br><br>People have faced the challenges we faced for years. Instead of blaming everyone we can see for changing the way of life, perhaps we should take a moment to reflect on the boon that had been given to us years before, sheltering us from the cruel reality of the world economy. We're not going downhill. We're reverting to mean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">STI plunges 6% in worst one-day fall since Oct 1987  </span></strong><br><br>SINGAPORE'S market yesterday suffered its worst one-day fall since the Black Monday crash in October 1987 while other Asian bourses had to go back to the Sept11, 2001, terror attacks for a day as bad as this.<br><br>The Straits Times Index was the region's second-worst performer, diving a jaw-dropping 187.1 points, or 6.03 per cent, in the frenzied, fear-driven bail-out. The STI has now fallen 15.8 per cent since Jan 1, wiping $62 billion off the value of local shares.<br><br>India was the worst performer yesterday, with the Sensex Index initially plunging 12 per cent before a late recovery brought the final dip to 7.41 per cent.<br><br>Other casualties stacked up across the region - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 5.5 per cent, Tokyo's Nikkei-225 was down 3.9 per cent, and China's resilient Shanghai Composite dived 5.14 per cent.<br><br>The causes were the same factors that have been hammering markets for months - a possible recession in the United States and concerns that regional banks will be hit by the massive writedowns that have belted Western banks.<br><br>'Irrational fear is stalking regional markets. Fundamentally, things haven't changed, and the economy is humming along nicely,' said CIMB-GK research head Song Seng Wun.<br><br>One dealer said hedge funds - powerful investment vehicles with billions at their command - were trimming their positions across the region ahead of possibly more bad news from the US.<br><br>'With the US markets closed for Martin Luther King Day, the funds are left rudderless as they struggle to find directions in the gloom and this is exacerbating the panic selling region-wide,' he said.<br><br>Financial shares took the biggest hit. Bank of China and HSBC Holdings came under heavy attack, with investors spooked by fears of their balance sheets being hurt by big sub-prime writedowns, following Citigroup and Merrill Lynch's massive losses.<br><br>DBS Group Holdings was one victim here, falling an eye-popping $1.18 to a 17-month low of $17.50. But SingTel's 7.7 per cent slide to $3.58 and Keppel Corp's 5.6 per cent fall to $10.80 stunned investors as well.<br><br>European markets were also well down when they opened yesterday afternoon. Financial stocks there sank on concerns of their possible exposure to the bond insurance market, which has been tainted by the US mortgage crisis.<br><br>At close, London's FTSE-100 Index was down 5.48 per cent, Paris' CAC Index fell 5.88 per cent, while Frankfurt's Dax Index tumbled 7.16 per cent.<br><br>Even booming commodities markets suffered. Oil fell US$1.68 (S$2.42) to US$88.98 a barrel on fears of falling demand if the US slips into recession, and gold fell US$13.17 to US$870 an ounce.<br><br>However, anxiety over the US economy may be soothed over coming weeks if the financial results of multinationals such as Microsoft and AT&amp;T are robust.<br><br>'But more disappointing earnings could send stock prices down further, as they fuel the risk of a recession,' warned Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management's chief Asian strategist Marshall Gittler.<br><br>But some traders here saw yesterday's nosedive as a golden opportunity to pick up blue chips like DBS and UOB. 'I view this sell-off as the last shoe dropping and I am sinking all my remaining funds into blue chips,' said local remisier Bernie Tan.<br><br></div>
