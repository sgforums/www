              <p>Andrew, something got stuck in my head so I'm asking for your opinion as you are the most knowlegeble and responsive person I know to ask.</p>
              <p>If the stock market prices were going up, wouldn't there be a relationship to inflation with goods/services prices be going up too? In other words there is no real increase in overall value because of inflation, however there is a transfer of value because savings loses its value.</p>
              <p>In other words, for every real dollar a speculator earns, someone with savings loses a real dollar.</p>
              <p>I hope I make sense. I don't possess the right vocabulory. Have you heard that before and is there is anywhere I can read up on that?</p>
              <p>Thank you for your continued posts, I find them very informative.</p>

              <p>Andrew, something got stuck in my head so I'm asking for
              your opinion as you are the most knowlegeble and responsive person
              I know to ask.</p>
              <p>If the stock market prices were going up, wouldn't there be a
              relationship to inflation with goods/services prices be going up
              too? In other words there is no real increase in overall value
              because of inflation, however there is a transfer of value
              because savings loses its value.</p>
              <p>In other words, for every real dollar a speculator earns,
              someone with savings loses a real dollar.</p>
              <p>I hope I make sense. I don't possess the right
              vocabulory. Have you heard that before and is there is
              anywhere I can read up on that?</p>
              <p>Thank you for your continued posts, I find them very
              informative.</p>

              <p>Phil, I'll take this quesiton. Inflation is a measure of speed in the first derivative. A constant inflation rate still means your money loses value every year. The typical hedge against inflation is to put money in low risk vehicles. The simplest example is a bank, which pays you interest every year.</p>
              <p>Many factors influence inflation. A booming economy is just one of them. Stock market prices increasing is an indicator of a booming economy. The key point to look for(in answer to your query), is whether your ROI can offset inflation.</p>
