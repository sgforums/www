              <p>Yes, you indeed recommended people buy thai baht just before it rose. It should however be noted that the reasons you gave for buying it were ridiculous. It should also be noted that you gave random predictions every other week, most of which fizzle and never come true.</p>
              <p>What matters is the fact that you never claim to have lost money in your bad predictions, but the moment the thai baht rose, you instantly claimed to have invested in it. The claim came AFTER the fact, which you have repeatedly tried to use as proof of "documentation".</p>
              <p>Again, I must point out to you that predicting a market dip after an all time high is not exactly the work of a fortune teller. You predicted a CRASH, however, which has yet to come about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here, I'm simply pointing out to you that your idea of documentation is eroneous at best, downright deceitful at worst.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My forecast for the first quarter is filled with uncertainty. Huge variance. That's why I'm advising my friends and loved ones to stay out of the swings. I'm not going to stop you if you want to put your savings in the markets now. Like I said, I would have great fun watching you most likely losing it all.</p>
              <p>Note that the above paragraph is valid documentation. If months from now the markets do indeed crash, this is considered valid documentation. Learn the difference.</p>

              investors who thought they could trust <a style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow">Standard Chartered</a>, the venerable old
              British bank that has been around Asia for a
              century and a half, are whistling in the wind for their money.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The group,
              now 19 percent owned by the Singapore
              government through Temasek Holdings, is walking away from its US$7.2 billion
              structured investment vehicle (SIV), appropriately named Whistlejacket Capital.
              This pile of assets was sold in the form of notes to big-name, deep-pocket
              clients in Asia and the <a style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow">Middle East</a>. But now
              that Whistlejacket’s assets have fallen sharply in value, today put at around
              half the level of six months ago, the bank no longer wants full responsibility
              for it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">That is
              perfectly legal. StanChart, like other major banks, enticed clients to acquire
              various debt assets that it claimed were good investments but were not on the
              bank’s own balance sheet.  When trouble
              first hit the market in <a style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow">collateralized debt obligations</a> (CDOs) and similar
              fancy instruments in the wake of the US sub-prime crisis, StanChart offered to
              provide liquidity to Whistlejacket —  but
              only so long as its assets were worth 95 percent of their book value.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">That is no
              longer the case, so StanChart has walked away and Whistlejacket is going into
              receivership. Others could have done the same, but to protect their reputations,
              rivals such as HSBC and Citicorp volunteered to bring the SIVs onto their own
              balance sheets, requiring them to provide for some US$40 billion in losses and,
              in Citi’s case, forcing it to go cap in hand to sovereign wealth funds for more
              capital.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Some
              investors in Whistlejacket who held short term notes were able to get out,
              helped by the liquidity facility. But the rest are locked in and may well,
              according to London
              sources, lose half or more of their money. That would come as a shock to investors
              who thought they were buying AA-rated paper. But such a rating was possible
              through the financial alchemy (approved by ratings agencies) that enabled
              asset-backed securities — when suitably re-packaged — to acquire superior
              ratings while delivering higher yields.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Whistlejacket
              investors will have to wait and see how the assets look to the receiver, and
              what assistance StanChart will give in providing some ways of disposing of its
              assets at other than fire-sale prices.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Unwillingness
              to put Whistlejacket onto its books raises questions about the strength of StanChart’s
              own balance sheet. The bank has long been a subject of takeover rumors and may
              now seem a tempting target. However, with so much financial asset destruction
              over the past year and with more to come, cash-rich investors are likely to
              hold back till the extent of losses throughout the system is known. Arab, Singapore
              and China
              funds may be regretting the amounts they have already pumped into ailing
              western institutions now that the size of their combined losses is becoming
              clearer and many more calls for rescue are likely to be heard in the coming
              months.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This
              episode must leave a sour taste in the mouth of Temasek, which only recently
              increased its stake in Stanchart to 19 percent. It acquired 11.5 percent from
              the estate of the late Malaysian banker Khoo Teck Puat in 2006. Khoo had helped
              rescue the bank from a takeover in 1986 following write-offs in <a style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow">Southeast Asia</a> and Hong Kong that forced it to sell landmark city-center buildings, including
              its Hong Kong head office.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Temasek
              evidently thought it had a good buy, gradually building on the Khoo stake. But
              with the latest problems, StanChart’s share price is back to where it was two
              years ago. Temasek’s stake is now on the threshold where this level of holding
              is becoming a quasi-political issue. At 20 percent it would bring into question
              whether StanChart could continue to be a note-issuing bank in Hong
              Kong – a privilege that is of limited practical value but carries
              much prestige.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Temasek
              may want to use the price fall to go above 20 percent, on the assumption that
              the <a style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</a> would not object. Its stake could rise to 30
              percent before being required, under British rules, to make a full offer. That
              looks unlikely given Singapore’s
              new sensitivity to foreign suspicion of sovereign wealth funds.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Also,
              while Temasek probably wants to go above 20 percent, it has splurged so much
              cash on troubled banks that it may bide its time to see if more troubles are in
              store for StanChart. Nor can it ignore the damage to StanChart’s reputation among
              those in the Middle East and Asia who had long
              trusted it as a stable institution.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Standard
              Chartered was formed in 1969 from the merger of Standard Bank of <a style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow">South Africa</a>, founded in 1863, and the Chartered
              Bank of India, Australia and China founded in 1853. The South
              African operations were sold during the apartheid era but Stanchart acquired a
              big Middle East presence by acquiring
              Grindlays Bank, another British colonial enterprise.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Today,
              StanChart has globe-spanning operations and is seen as emerging-market focused.
              Most of its profit comes from Asia, notably Hong Kong,
              India and Korea (through
              its acquisition of Korea First Bank in 2005). It is expanding in the Gulf and has
              ambitions in China.
              However it is not the major bank in any significant market and may have been growing
              too fast for its own good. Even without off-balance-sheet vehicles, its asset
              base grew 24 percent to $266 billion in 2006. Like so many other financial
              institutions over the past five years, it may have confused rapid growth in
              size and profits with its own skill, rather than the era of easy money and
              buoyant economies.</p>
