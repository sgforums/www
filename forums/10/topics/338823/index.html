              <h2>Renewing your passport in the UK if you live abroad</h2>
              <p>You can renew, amend or replace your passport whilst you’re visiting the UK. You should apply to the <a href="http://www.ips.gov.uk/"><strong><span style="color: #003399;">Identity and Passport Service</span></strong></a>.</p>
              <p>You’ll need to make an appointment, provide a verifiable residential address, and be able to attend any interviews as required by IPS. You’ll have to be available at this address so you can sign for the passport. Please note that IPS do not accept applications by post or email from abroad.</p>
              <h2>Replacement and emergency passports</h2>
              <p>We can issue you with a replacement travel document if you need to travel urgently. But we’ll need some verification of your identity and to be satisfied that you are a British national. You’ll also need to show us a police report and pay a fee.</p>
              <p>This document may be an emergency passport valid for a single journey, a temporary one-year passport or a standard passport, depending on embassy facilities and your travel needs. We need to make checks before we can issue a passport and this may mean you have to delay your travel plans.</p>
              <p>You’ll have to pay an extra fee if staff need to issue an emergency travel document outside of normal office hours. This starts at £121. You should also consider whether you need to obtain an exit visa from the local immigration authorities. Some countries do not issue such visas outside normal office hours.</p>
              <p>Check with the local British embassy or consulate to see what services it offers. Local conditions mean that different passport services are available in different areas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arrest or detention</span></h1>
              <div class="moreinfo">
              <h2>If a relative of friend tells you have they been arrested abroad contact us on 020 7008 1500.</h2>
              <p>British nationals arrested abroad should contact the relevant British embassy, high commission or consulate.  You're entitled to do this whichever country you are in. </p>

              <p>If the detained person wants us to, we can tell their family or friends that they have been arrested or detained. </p>
              <p>We can't provide details of the arrest without the detained person’s permission.</p>
              <p>We'll aim to contact the detained person within twenty four hours of being told of their arrest and if they want, we'll aim to visit them as soon as we can.</p>
              <p>Our staff are there to support arrested British nationals. We aim to be sensitive and non-judgemental. We treat all prisoners the same regardless of what crime they are being held for.</p>
              <h2>What we can do to help:</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>provide general information about the relevant country, prison conditions and the local legal system, including whether local legal aid is available </li>
              <li>provide a list of local lawyers and interpreters </li>
              <li>make sure any medical or dental problems are brought to the attention of the police or prison doctor </li>
              <li>take up any justified complaints about ill treatment, personal safety or discrimination with the police of prison authorities </li>
              <li>send money to prisoners from their families - in some countries we can also help British prisoners buy prison ‘comforts’ with money sent by their family and friends </li>
              <li>we can also send messages between prisoners and their families </li>
              <li>put prisoners in touch with the prisoners’ welfare charity, <a title="Prisoners Abroad" href="http://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/"><strong><span style="color: #003399;">Prisoners Abroad</span></strong></a> (external site) </li>
              <li>if it is possible, provide information on how British prisoners may apply for transfers to a UK prisons. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>We'll consider approaching the local authorities if we feel that a British national is not being treated in line with internationally-accepted standards regarding fair trials and prisoners’ rights.  </p>
              <p>We'll visit prisoners in European Union countries or in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Canada, Switzerland, Canada, the USA and New Zealand once after sentencing and then only if there is a real need. In other countries we aim to visit once a year, or more if necessary.</p>
              <h2>But we can't:</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>get a British national out of prison or detention, or get them special treatment because they are British </li>
              <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime </li>
              <li>pay for any costs incurred as a result of being arrested </li>
              <li>forward prisoners parcels sent by family and friends </li>
              <li>prevent the local authorities from deporting a British national upon release. </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Dual Nationals</h2>
              <p>If you are a dual national travelling on your British Passport in a third state (that is a country of which you are not a national) we will offer you our full support. If you are travelling on the passport of your other nationality, we will normally direct you to that state's local Embassy, High Commission, or Consulate. If you are a dual national travelling in the state of your other nationality we would not normally offer you support or get involved in dealings between you and the authorities of that state. We may make an exception if, having looked at the circumstances of the case, we consider that there is a special humanitarian reason to do so.</p>
              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sick or injured abroad</span></h1>

              <p>If you have travelled with a tour guide or have a tour representative you should contact them in the first instance if your condition is not serious.</p>
              <p>Please be aware that medical facilities abroad may differ from those in the UK.</p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">In hospital abroad</span></h2>
              <p>If you're admitted to hospital abroad you should contact your nearest embassy.  </p>

              </ul>

You will need to tell us the country where you think they have gone missing.</p>
              <p>We can only help in cases where regular contact has been unexpectedly lost.</p>
              <p>We can NOT help if you wish to trace someone you lost contact with a long time ago.</p>
              <p>You should try to provide as much information about the missing person as you can, such as:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>name, date and place of birth </li>
              <li>the last time and place contact was made </li>

              <li>recent photo </li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you are abroad, use the search facility to the right to find the nearest British Embassy.</p>
              <p>If you are in the UK you should contact your local police force and ask them to inform the UK National Centre Bureau of Interpol, who will liaise with the relevant foreign police.</p>
              <p>Please be aware that responsibility for conducting searches overseas rests with the local police force. UK police will assist with enquiries but it is rare they will become actively involved in the case.</p>
              <h2>What we can do to help:</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>check our records to see if the missing person has come to our attention.  The Data Protection Act 1998 may prevent us from releasing information without the person's consent </li>
              <li>liaise with the local authorities and will keep you informed of our progress </li>
              <li>pass onto the appropriate UK authorities any requests from host governments for help in mounting a  search, rescue and recovery operation </li>
              <li>provide you with details of any local organisations specialising in tracing missing persons </li>
              <li>provide contact details for local private detectives.  However we cannot guarantee the professional ability of any person or company </li>
              <li>we will appoint a caseworker in London with whom you can liaise </li>
              <li>our embassy staff can arrange to meet you should you decide to travel abroad to search yourself </li>
              <li>we may be able to facilitate press or TV appeals in the relevant country </li>
              <li>provide information on local printing companies, should you wish to initiate a poster and leaflet campaign. We can advise on suitable poster locations </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>What we can’t do:</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>conduct physical searches on your behalf. </li>
              <li>provide financial assistance for rescue operations of people missing in remote areas </li>
              <li>pay for the repatriation of a body </li>
              <li>control media coverage of the case. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>We never release information that is not in the public domain. But you should be aware that the media may be persistent in obtaining background information on the missing person from other sources.</p>
              <h2>What you can do:</h2>
              <p>Consider the following when trying to trace a missing person:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>when and why were you expecting contact from them? </li>
              <li>was there anything in their last communication with you that might suggest where they are now or why they might not have been in touch? </li>
              <li>you may wish to contact the family of any travelling companions, or other people with whom the missing person might have been in contact whilst abroad </li>
              <li>the missing person’s bank or building society may be able to tell you when and from where their account was last accessed.  The bank may require official police intervention before they agree to give you this information </li>
              <li>in some countries it may be possible to offer a reward for information.  Consider the implications of this and contact an organisation that has experience of tracing missing persons </li>
              <li>consider what you would be able to achieve by travelling to the country yourself. Local authorities may be reluctant to pass on information </li>
              </ul>
              <p>You may wish to identify a personal item of the missing person.  A toothbrush, hairbrush or razor could provide a DNA profile.</p>

              <p>If you are living in the UK and a relative or friend dies when abroad, then you should contact us on <strong>020 7008 1500</strong>. If you are abroad, you should contact the relevant embassy, high commission or consulate.  You'll find a link to our 'Find an embassy' page to the right.</p>
              <h2>What you need to do</h2>
              <p>It is essential that the death is registered in the country where the person died. We can advise you how to do this.</p>
              <p>You will need to provide documents from yourself and the person who died, which show your names, dates of birth and passport details.</p>
              <p>You will also have to inform the local authorities if the person suffered from an infectious condition such as hepatitis or HIV, so they are prepared when dealing with the body.</p>
              <p>You don’t have to register the death with the British Embassy but if you do, you will get a UK death certificate. Local death certificates issued in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa and Zimbabwe are suitable for British purposes.</p>
              <h2>What we can do to help:</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>our staff in London can pass on your wishes about how to deal with the body to our staff overseas </li>
              <li>unfortunately, in some countries it is possible that a post mortem may be carried out without your permission </li>
              <li>organs may be removed and kept during this procedure without your prior knowledge or consent </li>
              <li>we can tell you about the cost of local burial or cremation </li>
              <li>we can advise you about bringing the body and personal belongings back to the UK </li>
              <li>we can provide details of local and international funeral directors. And if an English speaking firm is not available our staff at the embassy can help you with arrangements. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Please be aware that in some countries inadequate storage makes it impossible to get the certificates necessary for transporting a body from one country to another.  </p>
              <p>We will do everything we can to ensure that you do not hear about the death of close relative through the media.</p>
              <p>On rare occasions, where we have to act quickly, we may have to inform you about the death over the phone. We never release the name of someone who has died to the media before we have told the next of kin.</p>
              <p>If the person who has died was travelling with a tour company, the company will usually contact their next of kin themselves.</p>
              <p>If the death of a British national abroad is reported to us we will ask the UK police to inform the next of kin as soon as possible. Alternatively we will ask our staff in the relevant country to do this if the next of kin are abroad themselves.</p>
              <h2>What we can’t do:</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>we cannot pay burial, cremation or repatriation costs, but we can help to transfer money from friends or relatives in the UK </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Death abroad in suspicious circumstances</h2>
              <p>In addition to the above support, where there is evidence of suspicious circumstances we can:<br>offer some basic information on the local police and legal systems.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>provide lists of local interpreters, lawyers and local support groups where possible- these lists are usually on the local embassy’s website </li>
              </ul>
              <p>In many countries the authorities and courts will refuse to answer questions from British consular staff so we highly recommend you appoint a local lawyer to help you. Please note that we cannot :</p>
              <ul>
              <li>investigate deaths ourselves </li>
              <li>offer financial assistance with legal costs. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Please also be aware that the standard of investigative procedures and police expertise varies greatly around the world. We will however consider making an appropriate representation to the local authorities if there are concerns that they are not carrying out the investigation in line with local procedures.</p>
              <p>You should appoint one family member to liaise with us as the case continues.  Your local police force may decide to appoint a Family Liaison Officer to help you if the investigation is ongoing.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Death or Injury of an American Citizen Abroad</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Death</strong></p>
              <p>When an American dies abroad, the Bureau of Consular Affairs must locate and inform the next-of-kin. Sometimes discovering the next-of-kin is difficult. If the American’s name is known, the Bureau’s Office of Passport Services will search for his or her passport application.</p>
              <p>The Bureau of Consular Affairs provides guidance to grieving family members on how to make arrangements for local burial or return of the remains to the U.S. The disposition of remains is affected by local laws, customs, and facilities, which are often vastly different from those in the U.S. The Bureau of Consular Affairs relays the family’s instructions and necessary private funds to cover the costs involved to the embassy or consulate. The Department of State has no funds to assist in the return of remains or ashes of American citizens who die abroad. Upon completion of all formalities, the consular officer abroad prepares an official Foreign Service Report of Death, based upon the local death certificate, and sends it to the next-of-kin or legal representative for use in U.S. courts to settle estate matters.</p>
              <p>A U.S. consular officer overseas has statutory responsibility for the personal estate of an American who dies abroad if the deceased has no legal representative in the country where the death occurred. The consular officer takes possession of personal effects, such as:</p>
              <p>
              <table style="BORDER-RIGHT: #cccccc 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #cccccc 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #cccccc 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #cccccc 1px solid" border="0" width="90%">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td>
              <ul>
              <li>convertible assets </li>
              <li>apparel </li>
              </ul>
              </td>
              <td>
              <ul>
              <li>jewelry </li>
              <li>personal documents and papers. </li>
              </ul>
              </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </p>
              <p>The officer prepares an inventory and then carries out instructions from members of the deceased’s family concerning the effects. In Washington, the Bureau of Consular Affairs gives next-of-kin guidance on procedures to follow in preparing Letters Testamentary, Letters of Administration, and Affidavits of Next-of-Kin as acceptable evidence of legal claim of an estate.</p>
              <p><strong>Injury</strong></p>
              <p>In the case of an injured American, the embassy or consulate abroad notifies the Office of Citizen Services, which notifies family members in the U.S. The Bureau of Consular Affairs can assist in sending private funds to the injured American; frequently it collects information on the individual’s prior medical history and forwards it to the embassy or consulate. When necessary, the State Department assists in arranging the return of the injured American to the U.S. commercially, with appropriate medical escort, via commercial air ambulance or, occasionally, by U.S. Air Force medical evacuation aircraft. The use of Air Force facilities for a medical evacuation is authorized only under certain stringent conditions, and when commercial evacuation is not possible. The full expense must be borne by the injured American or his family.</p>
              <p><strong>Privacy Act</strong> - The provisions of the Privacy Act are designed to protect the privacy and rights of Americans, but occasionally they complicate our efforts to assist citizens abroad. As a rule, consular officers may not reveal information regarding an individual Americans location, welfare, intentions, or problems to anyone, including family members and Congressional representatives, without the expressed consent of that individual. Although sympathetic to the distress this can cause concerned families, consular officers must comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act.</p>
              <h3> </h3>
              <h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arrest/Detention of an American Citizen Abroad</span></h3>
              <p>One of the most important tasks of the Department of State and of U.S. embassies and consulates abroad is to provide assistance to U.S. citizens incarcerated abroad. The State Department is committed to ensuring fair and humane treatment for American citizens imprisoned overseas. We stand ready to assist incarcerated citizens and their families within the limits of our authority in accordance with international law.</p>
              <p>We can and do monitor conditions in foreign prisons and can protest allegations of abuse against U.S. citizen prisoners when requested to do so. We work with prison officials to ensure treatment consistent with internationally recognized standards of human rights and to ensure that Americans are afforded due process under local laws.</p>
              <p>While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject to that country's laws and regulations which sometimes differ significantly from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law. As our <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1765.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Country Specific Information</span></span></a> explain, penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating the law, even unknowingly, may be expelled, fined, arrested, or imprisoned.</p>
              <p>Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines. If arrested abroad, a citizen must go through the foreign legal process for being charged or indicted, prosecuted, possibly convicted and sentenced, and for any appeals process. Within this framework, U.S. consular officers provide a wide variety of services to U.S. citizens arrested abroad and their families.</p>
              <p><strong>Privacy Act</strong> - The provisions of the Privacy Act are designed to protect the privacy and rights of Americans, but occasionally they complicate our efforts to assist citizens abroad. As a rule, consular officers may not reveal information regarding an individual Americans location, welfare, intentions, or problems to anyone, including family members and Congressional representatives, without the expressed consent of that individual.

              <p><strong>Consular Assistance to American Crime Victims</strong></p>
              <p>Consular personnel can provide assistance to crime victims. When a U.S. citizen becomes the victim of a crime overseas, he or she may suffer physical, emotional, or financial injuries.  Additionally, the emotional impact of the crime may be intensified because the victim is in unfamiliar surroundings.  The victim may not be near sources of comfort and support, fluent in the local language, or knowledgeable about local laws and customs. </p>
              <p>Consuls, consular agents, and local employees at overseas posts are familiar with local government agencies and resources in the country where they work.  They can help American crime victims with issues such as:</p>
              <p>Replacing a stolen passport;</p>
              <p>Contacting family, friends, or employers;</p>
              <p>Obtaining appropriate medical care;</p>
              <p>Addressing emergency needs that arise as a result of the crime;</p>
              <p>Obtaining general information about the local criminal justice process and information about your case;</p>
              <p>Obtaining information about local resources to assist victims, including foreign crime victim compensation programs;</p>

              <p><strong>Individual Reactions to Crime Victimization</strong></p>
              <p>How individuals react to being the victim of a crime will vary from person to person.  Reactions are affected by individual factors such as how the victim handles stress, the nature and duration of the crime, the physical safety of the victim, and the number and type of support systems available.  Reactions to a crime may be immediate or delayed.  The physical, emotional, or cognitive (involving thinking ability) symptoms a victim may experience could include nausea, headaches, fatigue, hyperventilation, or sleeping problems.  Some victims report feelings of anxiety or fear, hyper-vigilance, guilt, anger, or isolation.  Some experience difficulty making decisions, short-term memory problems, difficulty concentrating, or recurring memories of the crime.  </p>
              <p>It is important to realize that these are normal feelings, behaviors and reactions to an abnormal event.  One of the first things to pay attention to is your need to feel safer.  Addressing safety concerns and receiving emotional support can help.  For most victims the reactions described above diminish with time.  If these reactions persist and are disrupting your life or getting worse after three or four weeks, you should consider seeking professional assistance.</p>
              <p><strong>Resources and Information for Crime Victims:</strong></p>
              <p><em>Victim Assistance</em> : If you are the victim of a crime while overseas you may benefit from specialized resources for crime victims available in the U.S.  Throughout the United States thousands of local crime victim assistance programs offer help to victims of violent crime and most will help residents of their community who have been the victim of a crime in another country. These include rape crisis counseling programs, shelter and counseling programs for battered women, support groups and bereavement counseling for family members of homicide victims, diagnostic and treatment programs for child abuse victims, assistance for victims of drunk driving crashes, and others.  Information about locating crime victim assistance programs is below.</p>
              <p><em>Victim Compensation</em> : All states operate crime victim compensation programs and nearly half of them offer benefits to their residents who are victims of violent crime overseas.  (See contact information for state compensation programs below.)  These state compensation programs provide financial assistance to eligible victims for reimbursement of expenses such as medical treatment, counseling, funeral costs, lost income or loss of support, and others.  Generally victim compensation programs require the victim to report the crime to law enforcement and they usually request a copy of the police report. </p>

              <h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">American Citizens Missing Abroad</span></h3>
              <p>As concerned relatives call in, Consular officers use the information provided by the family or friends of a missing person to locate the individual. We check with local authorities in the foreign country to see if there is any report of a U.S. citizen hospitalized, arrested, or is otherwise unable to communicate with those looking for them. Depending on the circumstances, consular officers may personally search hotels, airports, hospitals, or even prisons.</p>
              <p><strong>Privacy Act</strong> - The provisions of the Privacy Act are designed to protect the privacy and rights of Americans, but occasionally they complicate our efforts to assist citizens abroad. As a rule, consular officers may not reveal information regarding an individual Americans location, welfare, intentions, or problems to anyone, including family members and Congressional representatives, without the expressed consent of that individual. Although sympathetic to the distress this can cause concerned families, consular officers must comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act.</p>
