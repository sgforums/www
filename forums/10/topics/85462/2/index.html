There is still many Singapore descendant on the island.<br><br>The history of the sovereign of Christmas Island is a bit tricky, it was actually administrated by the British Colonial Office of Singapore but not a territory of Singapore. It was adminstrated by the British Colonial Office of Singapore for abt a hundred years before the administration was transfer to Australia in 1958.<br><br>The money paid to Singapore was sort of a "take care" fee for helping to administrate Christmas Island.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
