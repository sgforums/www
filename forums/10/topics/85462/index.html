I am NOT going to be activated for reservist just so SG could invade and try to claim Christmas Island as her own again. Anyway, the past is past. If SG does try to do that, it'll be like a chicken attacking a tiger. 2 seconds of attack, then the coup de grace. Mmm. Tastes better when fried.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take back? and hold with what? If we held it during our independance the aussies would have annexed it anyway. If we take it back now do you think they will stand for it if we posted a unit there to guard our claim? It was the right thing to do to sell it off in the first place.<br><br>Also I heard under the old maritime law, anything above and under the sea  within 2km of the coast line belongs to you. And that means if there is a stone or coral size of a durian protruding out of the water, that claim is extended for another 2km, that means our claim may even stretch all the way to spratly islands leow.<br><br>That's going head to head with the chinese, vietnamese, indoesians, malaysians an bruneians and filipinoes who have oil claims there.<br><br>You want them to declare WWIII on us.<br><br>No thanks!</div>

Sure or not?<br><br>Hey, people make mistakes, so do the gov't, but think, was it a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wise</span> decision at that time when they sold off X'mas Island? Australia would have taken it anyway, seeing as to SG was a <strong>newly formed</strong> sovereign country.<br><br>Now think of this, if say, SG would try to reclaim X'mas Island, forcefully or thru negotiation, whatever, would that be a prudent decision? I don't <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> so.<br><br>Furthermore, do you think Australia would just toss X'mas Island back to SG, like nothing ever happened. If attempting to put our claim to X'mas Island is not <span style="font-style: italic;">challenging</span> Australia's sovereignity, then I don't know what is. Some people in SG get heated up when others challenge our sovereignity, but they have the nerve to challenge other older and more prominent countries' sovereignity.<br><br>Cheerios~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
