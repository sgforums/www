But if you want to base something on future technology, how long is that going to be? 10 years? 100years? 1000years? Sometimes it's about taking what's most important for you when you need it the most. They do not teach you to grab all your clothes during a fire because your life might be put in danger if you do so. That's why we can only provide what we have the most, talents.

It's what has been drilled into me after these years of education in Sg. Imagine what you hear from taxi uncles and people who's been around. We're being leeched upon because they fail in their investments. And I don't understand why by quoting what the government did, it leads to me being one who uses up resources for my own good.
