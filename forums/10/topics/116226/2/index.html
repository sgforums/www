This is their duty as part of the husband and wife team. </blockquote>I could also argue about the fact that duty of women as part of the husband and wife team is to do housework and rear the kids, but that would just be a statement that reeks of chauvinism and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOUR</span> kind of thinking, you racist sexist bigot.<br><br>FACE THE FARKING FACTS, in this day and age, both husband and wife have a part to play in all of these activities.<br><br>Unreasonable people like you expect men to adopt a modern attitude towards marriage by shouldering their fair share of the workload such as helping out around the house and taking care of the children so that their wives can enjoy a full time career, while insisting on the other hand that the husbands be solely responsible for taking care of the household expenses (insurance, taxes, etc.) while their wives keep the money.<br><br>The door swings both ways. If you demand that the man keep to his traditional role of being the bread winner of the household, then it is perfectly fair to expect the woman to confine herself to being a housewife and give up her career (because by your wonderful logic, if men MUST be the breadwinner, then women MUST be in charge of keeping the house clean.)<br><br>Everyone else except you knows that this is impractical. Everyone knows that men can't keep on expecting that their wives take on a full time job as their housekeeper. Both must do their duty as such, in as many ways as they can, or else hire a maid.<br><br>Likewise everyone knows that working women can't expect men to pay all the expenses, because in Singapore one job alone is insufficent to support a family. If the couple are both working, they must both contribute to the upkeep of the family by paying (in proportion to their salaries) an equal amount.<br><br>If unreasonable, blind individuals like you expect your spouse to be responsible for household expenses AND take care of the house and children so that he/she can shake leg, then you have a big surprise coming.<br><br><blockquote>And with the poor spending habits of the Singaporean male, it is well justified for us women to keep a secret slash in case you weaklings run to vietnam</blockquote>Singgapore men who run to Vietnam do so because of one reason alone: to get away from you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
