            <div class='col-md body'>Feb 6, 2005<br>Yes, I do... (have a secret bank account)<br>Research firm finds that one in five Singaporean wives hides her assets from her husband<br><br>By Chua Kong Ho<br><br>MS KAREN Tay has been hiding money from the men in her life since she started dating in her teens. Now in her late 20s, the communications executive is still secretive.<br><br>Her husband does not know of her share trading account, which doubles as her savings fund.<br><br>'If he knew, he'd go out and splurge on his car or buy something stupid. This way, he saves for the both of us,' she said with a smile.<br><br>Ms Tay is among a group of financially independent women in Singapore who keep their assets under wraps to stave off any overspending by their spouse, to ensure they have enough if the man walks out and, in one case, because her husband stole from her.<br><br>But unlike their mothers or grandmothers, they do not squirrel away grocery money in secret Khong Guan Biscuit tins. Their assets take the form of bank accounts, insurance policies or investments in shares or property.<br><br>But this trait is not peculiar to women here.<br><br>A nine-country survey by London-based research firm Synovate found that one in five (20 per cent) Singaporean wives keeps her husband in the dark about her emergency fund. If it's any comfort, the tendency is more prevalent in Japan (38 per cent), Saudi Arabia (32 per cent) and China (21 per cent).<br><br>On the other hand, women in France (7.2 per cent), United States (7.6 per cent), Brazil (9 per cent), Romania (12 per cent) and Britain (16.8 per cent) are more open.<br><br>The survey interviewed 301 Singaporean women, of which three in five were married. It also found that 75 per cent of the married women earned less than their spouse, and that almost half do not routinely save for retirement.<br><br>However, the survey, released last month, did not indicate the age, race or occupation of the respondents.<br><br>It also did not define what 'secret' means. Which suggests that the number of quiet hoarders in Singapore could be higher because 13 of the 20 Singaporean women interviewed by The Sunday Times gave different takes on the word.<br><br>Some do not tell their husbands at all, some tell, but will not reveal the precise value or amount of the assets while others will 'act blur' when asked.<br><br>Aged between 25 and 35, they all have full-time jobs and can support themselves financially.<br><br>Administrative executive Hamizah, 31, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she did not let her husband know how much year-end bonus she received so that she can pamper herself with treats without being nagged by him.<br><br>Are these secret savings an act of bad faith? Or are women merely pragmatic in protecting themselves?<br><br>Bank executive Angeline Lee, 26, who will marry her long-time boyfriend next year, was swift in her retort: 'Why not? My mother has always told me to keep money for myself for protection and not to let the man know.'<br><br>She added, betraying a fatalistic attitude often seen in Asia: 'You never know if your husband will walk out on you. Anyway, he probably has funds that he's not telling me about.'<br><br>Mr Aldrin Thomas, 30, a teacher, finds the attitude dreadful. 'Wives won't like it if their husbands do the same. At the very least, the hubby must know about it. He does not have to control it.'<br><br>A 34-year-old office manager said she had to keep her finances secret because her husband habitually stole from her. For obvious reasons, she asked not to be named.<br><br>However, wives like teacher Celine Tan, 26, believe in full disclosure. She said: 'The most important thing in a marriage is trust. There should be no secret between husband and wife.'<br><br>Legal secretary Yang Yuxin, 28, agrees. Her husband has access to her personal savings account.<br><br>Synovate's survey found that four in five Singapore women have their own savings accounts, two in three have insurance policies, half have jewellery while one in four have mutual funds, shares or bonds.<br><br>Counsellors warn against hiding money because when a spouse stumbles on a large stash, it could undermine the trust in the marriage.<br><br>Ms Teo Seok Bee, programme manager at Touch Community Services, which runs marriage courses, said couples are taught the different options of financial arrangements. 'We always encourage transparency and trust in all aspects of a couple's life, including finances,' she added.<br><br>But old habits die hard. Said a 29-year-old public relations executive, who wanted to be known only as Mei: 'It boils down to trust. For me, if my husband asks, I'll act blur. I'm just not comfortable discussing my money, even with him.' She has been married for eight months.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is best to have your own personal account. It don't have to be secret but you don't need to tell your spouse the amount you have in it.<br><br>We do have a joint account which we use to pay the bills. Both of us contribute to it every month but it is a joint account whereby if any of us wants to withdraw from it, it will require both signatures.<br><br>No one gets hitched thinking about divorce. However, there is no harm being prepared. Be it that the relationship turns sour down the road or something happens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one should always be transparent about such money matters. at least husband and wife can plan their future family financials.<br><br>that aside, one should try to avoid putting too much money in a joint account cos that account will be frozen in the event of a bankruptcy of either spouse!</div>
