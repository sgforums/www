            <div class='col-md body'>By Rita Zahara, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : Closing submissions were made on Friday in the trial of former project director of the MRT Circle Line, Ng Seng Yoong.<br><br>Ng was the first of four men to face criminal charges in the wake of the Nicoll Highway accident in April 2004.<br><br>In a startling proposition by the defence, Ng is now fighting for immunity and protection from personal liability under Section 10 of the Land Transport Authority (LTA) Act.<br><br>This means no suit or other legal proceedings can be brought against any member or employee of LTA, provided he acted in good faith.<br><br>But Deputy Public Prosecutor Edwin San said this was never raised during the trial nor was there any evidence to this effect.<br><br>The prosecution added that Ng was acting as an independent person and not as an employee of LTA.<br><br>But Defence Counsel Andrea Maniam insisted Ng was an LTA employee as he was paid an allowance of $400 to work in his other capacity as the Qualified Person on site, responsible for monitoring the design work.<br><br>The defence also centred their arguments on Ng's capabilities - that he went above and beyond what the LTA system expected of him and had exercised 'due diligence and reasonable care'.<br><br>The trial continues on November 8.<br><br>If convicted, Ng can be jailed up to six months or a fine of $10,000. - CNA/de<br><br></div>

If there is something better, why not make them clear to citizens with accountable processes and commitments that they can understand and support instead of only justifying past unworkable policies to western pressmen.</div>
