However Qin being in power, was an envy of many and also his enemy. An assassination attempt on his life failed but the assassin managed to escape, so a wanted list of a thousand gold taels to be rewarded to whoever capture him, and also the person gets to see the emperor himself by presenting the Emperor with the head of the assassin....</p>
              <p>Part 2</p>
              <p>A plot for assassin the emperor was then set up by the emperor enemy, they managed to persuade the first assassin to give up his life so that another person can bring his head to the emperor, thereby get a chance to be near the emperor and kill him. The first being tire of life and failure agreed, but before he allow his head to be chopped, he paid a visit to his homeland, visited his parents, relatives and his peoples, he found that all are living in better condition then during those worn torn years when Qin was not in power. When he returned for his last day, he gave an advice to the person who is going bring his head to the emperor and kill the emperor, ...</p>
              <p>Part 3</p>
              <p>The advice is two words "Heaven and Earth" let there be peace, before you kill the emperor, remember what i said, the person agreed and chop off his head. So, carrying the head, that person went to see the emperor, the emperor was delighted and invited him in while calling all his guards to stay outside, the person then taking this opportunity of being with the emperor alone, took a sword and attacked the emperor, but just as the sword was about to enter the emperor heart, he recalled that advice, "Heaven and Earth, let there be peace" and retrieved his sword, the emperor was both shock and fascinated, he asked why you dun kill me, you all had sacrifice so much and now it is your chance, the person replied, "For Heaven and Earth, and for peace, I let you go" with that he left but was killed by his own people for the failure.</p>
              <p>From then on, the emperor truly understand that there is hero in our society, true hero that fight for peace in heaven and earth, that even they forgo their revengeful urge and power struggle just for peace. </p>

              <p>Singtel was a monopoly back then.</p>
              <p>Fraser N Neave, and CAAS are already established corporations/organizations. so there's really not much he can do that will make a whole lot of difference.</p>

              <p>Uncle,<br>I will like to take you back to the first dynasty of China, where Qin Shi Huang managed to harmonise the whole of china from it war torn separated states that gives no peace for years to it common peoples. However Qin being in power, was an envy of many and also his enemy. An assassination attempt on his life failed but the assassin managed to escape, so a wanted list of a thousand gold taels to be rewarded to whoever capture him, and also the person gets to see the emperor himself by presenting the Emperor with the head of the assassin....</p>
              <p>Part 2</p>
              <p>A plot for assassin the emperor was then set up by the emperor enemy, they managed to persuade the first assassin to give up his life so that another person can bring his head to the emperor, thereby get a chance to be near the emperor and kill him. The first being tire of life and failure agreed, but before he allow his head to be chopped, he paid a visit to his homeland, visited his parents, relatives and his peoples, he found that all are living in better condition then during those worn torn years when Qin was not in power. When he returned for his last day, he gave an advice to the person who is going bring his head to the emperor and kill the emperor, ...</p>
              <p>Part 3</p>
              <p>The advice is two words "Heaven and Earth" let there be peace, before you kill the emperor, remember what i said, the person agreed and chop off his head. So, carrying the head, that person went to see the emperor, the emperor was delighted and invited him in while calling all his guards to stay outside, the person then taking this opportunity of being with the emperor alone, took a sword and attacked the emperor, but just as the sword was about to enter the emperor heart, he recalled that advice, "Heaven and Earth, let there be peace" and retrieved his sword, the emperor was both shock and fascinated, he asked why you dun kill me, you all had sacrifice so much and now it is your chance, the person replied, "For Heaven and Earth, and for peace, I let you go" with that he left but was killed by his own people for the failure.</p>
              <p>From then on, the emperor truly understand that there is hero in our society, true hero that fight for peace in heaven and earth, that even they forgo their revengeful urge and power struggle just for peace. </p>
