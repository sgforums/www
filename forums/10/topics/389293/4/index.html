              <p>Using HDB for scare tactic knowing majority of Singaporeans are staying in HDB flats.  </p>
              <p>There is no such thing as incompetency and so on about the PAP ministers.    They are perfect that is why they are not sacked or asked to step down when things go wrong.    It is the people that are not perfect and are subject to accusation, blame, reprimanding from the mmlee and ministers of PAP.  </p>
