              <p><br>Charlize, I think we seeing PAP purposely creating a flux now. Minister said this than later changed his mind or another Minister went against another to said the reverse.</p>
              <p>Why? the reason is very clear, isn't it? Many times in the past, MM Lee has made it clear that no one inside the party is indispensable - Minister, MP or otherwise.</p>
              <p>MM Lee's strategy is simple and hard to beat - prevention of certain people from coming to parliament <strong>at all cost</strong>. Therefore, lightweight oppositions like Chiam, Low, he will trade in his chess pieces for the killing of you-know-who.  </p>
              <p>Therefore, I always said - oppositions' election strategies will always have their limitations. Even up till the last minute, just before polling, PAP can switch candidates around. Just like they did in the hotly contested Cheng San GRC.  </p>

              <p>From the electorate's perspective, it is all about voting for the opp to check the PAP.</p>
              <p>But from PAP's perspective, it is all about moving their chess pieces to prevent <strong>certain</strong> opp candidates from ever gaining a foothold in parliament.</p>
              <p>Just like Cheng San GRC, PAP went for broke....During that particular election, all opp can come in but no one from Cheng San..... </p>

              <p>Can u stop laughing!!!??? Only when Angel's talk, Mah would feel the heat...wonder what his ang mo wife see good in him...toothpick size, where got fun?? Must have regretted miserably. Anyway, ah mah is angry, so dun play play...</p>
              <p>NATIONAL Development Minister Mah Bow Tan on Saturday criticised an election strategy of opposition parties, saying they should focus on how they can best serve the people rather than to make him the focus of their campaign.</p>
              <p>'A general election (GE) is not about me, an individual minister or an individual MP. It's really about the residents themselves.</p>
              <p>'I offer myself up for election because I believe that I can do the best and the most for them. But ultimately it's for the residents, the people to decide,' he said at an event where he handed out hongbao to the needy in Tampines. He was responding for the first time to a Straits Times report that the five-member group representation constituency (GRC) he helms as anchor minister was being eyed by several opposition parties as a potential battleground in the next GE, due by February 2012. They are the National Solidarity Party, Workers' Party, Singapore Democratic Party and Reform Party.</p>
              <p>The key reason is Mr Mah. His ministry oversees public housing, an issue they hope to exploit by attacking the affordability of HDB flats, whose prices have been rising. The minister acknowledged some people may be adversely affected by the housing policies. But he pointed out: 'There's no question that our policies are designed for the good of the people.</p>
              <p>'While there may be certain parts of the policies that are not favourable, overall, I think these policies are for the well-being of the people and are good for the country.'</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had weighed in on the issue last week. He said at a housing conference that if Mr Mah was unable to defend his housing policy, 'he deserves to lose' at the next GE.</p>
