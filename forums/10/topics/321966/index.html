              <p>This was what i found on Ti Lik's Blog at chiatilik.wordpress.com the article is titled "Campaign for All Singaporean SAF, Police Force"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lik felt pitiful for the few ISD officers when he compared both MSK saga and the latest Gurkhas riot incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are 2000 armed Gurkhas in Singapore and their number grows annually by 140.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a dangerous sign. Gurkhas are not Singaporeans. They are mercenaries. AND Mercenaries work for money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In other words, Gurkhas can be bought with money. Loyalty is a tricky issue here, for their loyalty is dependent on their having to be satisfied with material reward. AND NOW this has proven to be true with their recent rioting incident in Mount Vernon Camp over pay issues which is very worrying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not know how the trouble makers will be taken to task in this incident and whether or not there will be a coverup because of the way in which the MHA has conducted itself with the lack of transparency in the way it fumbled over the Mas Selamat Kastari escape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The latest Gurkha rioting incident raises many questions in the minds of Singapore Citizens as to: How this mercenary unit being brought in and being armed? How is this mercenary unit empowered to act in Singapore? How is this mercenary unit subject to law and discipline and control?</p>
              <p>Will the rioters be charged and disciplined accordingly? What sort of discipline will they receive?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As seen from the Mas Selamat Kastari escape, our administration will bend over backwards for these foreign mercenaries. The Gurkhas on duty ought to have been charged under the Penal Code but instead they were let off with a slap on their wrists. I believe the negligent Singaporean ISD officers received far heavier sanction compared to the negligent Gurkhas. It is amazing how much better treatment these foreigners are being treated in comparison to their Singaporean counterparts in the Police.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>[By the way when Singaporean boys have petty fight in groups, they are often charged with rioting and they go to jail for it, I wonder if our Singapore Police Force is held to any higher standards of conduct]</p>

              <p>I am shocked that WP and opposition like Chiam has not asked the ruling party what is going on since the last update.</p>
