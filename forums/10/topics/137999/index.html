Disdains her own race and prefers to date Caucasian men, has very high English writing skills and is able to convey her thoughts and feelings well, sleeps around with men like a dirty slut and has no/little morality at all, has little chinese linguistic skills at all.Callous as well because she only thinks of what she wants in life and does not bother about other people's opinion.She does not give a hoot about tradition,a very complicated breed of species to understand, apparently many people are unable to comprehend this species' idiosyncratic behaviour, witty or some would say cocky attidude.Actually she is coping emotionally but trys to put a show and shields her emotions, tries to send the message that "I am tough", most probably an agonistic teenager that hides herself in the room and listens to crappy music like Blink182 or some punk rock band and slits her wrists and whimpers/sobs loudly, she is at the verge of committing sucide but she keeps it to himself because people might perceive her as a weakling.Lastly, a highly species that might have HIV due to rackless and causual sleeping around/having sex.Chances of getting HIV from her is extremely high, BEWARE!Basically, she replicates a prositute with a proper education to an extent of maybe even a degree but she does not know what she wants in life(No objectivity) and a very one dimensional person<br>.Parents are very dismayed at her and hope she would change for the better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd say although the butch- on the news recently- has indeed been one, it's more of a case that people here doesn't seem to understand her sense of brutal honesty.<br><br>Yes, her endless praise of angmoh and her stereotyping of Asian men in the bed are very poor and biased but like I said, S'poreans are the type who cannot stand candor. She isn't 100% correct but nonetheless her words about S'poreans making mountains out of molehills over her blog is quite valid.<br><br>A person's brutual practice of candor isn't gonna make the news for bad reasons unless people made it so. So someone posed nude pics of herself in her blog and talked senseless about her sex experience.<br><br>To Europeans, she's one of the endless. She's nothing in their eyes because European women are open minded about sex, nudity etc. I understand why S'poreans frown upon such open mindedness regarding sex and nudity and guys in general- it's about culture sensibility after all.<br><br>Nonetheless, I think it's time we start educating about sex, nudity and other issues in the general subject of sex education. The earlier we start teaching younger generations about these issues, the more they will understand what is sexual responsiblity. So even if some of them engage in sex or do nude art paintings(non-sexual), they know how to conduct themselves in a proper manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I beg to differ.<br><br>Her blog attracted unwarrented attention from locals becoz many of her values are 'modern'. It simply cannot be accepted by our local culture becoz you're comparing changing values with taboo.<br><br>Just becoz she aired her views doesn't make her a 'hooker' singled out for abuse. Ideals aside, her comments were intuitive and certainly worth more than just a glance. That does not make her a rebel. Politically incorrect maybe, but there was technically nothing wrong with her posts. It was neither inflamatory nor defamatory in nature.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed. She was only saying it as it is. She calls an apple an apple- and well, here people don't like that.<br><br>But I must say she has overestimated her looks. Her face, well...ain't that impressive anyway.</div>
