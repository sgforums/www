Now, i get my medicines from across the causeway and its so much cheaper and  better since i am a "regular" i get it sent to my house and its still cheaper than if i get from the polyclinics / hospitals.</div></blockquote>A good strategy should be to make out a case of inflated government fees and charges and NKF type of building up reserves with false figures and creative accounting which do not benefit the citizens. The approach now till the election will be to ask for specific assistance one item at a time. If we ask too many items, they will say that they will incur deficits and that will become a weaker case and they must increase taxes although very often in the past such claims of incurring deficits were based on assumptions and not true.</div>

If we don't try, it will be worse as then all the citizens will be taken for granted. Rummel's law says that a government is more likely to murder its people who offer the least resistance.</div>

There are quite a number here able to speak up courageously against NKF or other wrong doings without fear or favor.<br><br>I think there is nothing to fear as we are apolitical only exercising our civic rights and speak courageiously. Thanks for supporting such civic consciousness here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">utilities save provided for last month!!!<br></div></blockquote>Cost of generating electricity is between $0.09 - $012 per kilowatt-hour. The current Power Supply billing for electricity is $0.17-$0.21 per kilowatt-hour depending on oil prices inclusive of networking costs (partly exempted for extra-high-tension supply) and land/infrastructure costs already paid for by the taxpayers some years ago.<br><br>A more reasonable electricity charge would be in the region of $0.12 - $0.15 in the current oil-spike situation which will still allow the utility companies to cover costs of operation with some profits without giving inflated high profits to the government. The government should have granted a credit on the land and fixed infrastructure assets to the utility companies upon handing over the facilities to them or corporatising PS as a private entity.<br><br>In view of such creative accounting practices being rampant, I am inviting you to send this post to as many friends and fellow citizens to ask for a rebate on the current utility charges to reverse the unwarranted land and fixed asset/networking charges.</div>

I am apolitical by nature and will not make a good politician. So I will be contented with playing my part as a citizen or armchair critic giving my two-cent worth on issues and problems. I am sure when all of us know NKF is wrong and can make our views heard without being salmanised we are already achieving something and paving the way for problems to be solved some days.</div>
