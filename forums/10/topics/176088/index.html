Such reversal of fees in respect of essential utility services could be alternatively borne by profit-making departments and ministries charging market-level fees e.g. sales of commercial sites, public housing and vehicle excise/COE/ERP.<br><br>(d) Lending unemployment relief loans (capped at $5,000) financed from 20% of national reserve at 0% interest for 3 years to assist employers in engaging long-unemplyed citizens over 6 months so as to incentivise employers to helping to clear backlog of persistent unemployed.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Undersigned<br><br></div>

In fact, I would rather they increase than not doing anything. Increasing means it will be staggered over the years. Not increasing means after donkey years, the increase will be huge. And it will cause an uproar. The university fees increased a few years ago by a lot. It caused a small "uproar". Not recommended.</div>
