              your belts, you have to save more, work more for lower salaries"</strong></span><br> <br> <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/marc-faber-america-listen-you-lazy-bugger-you-need-tighten-your-belts-you-need-work-more-lower-#comments">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/marc-f...ower-#comments</a><br> <br> Marc Faber To America: "Listen You Lazy Bugger, You Need To Tighten Your Belts, You Need To Work More For Lower Salaries"<br> Once again, the latest fire and brimstone sermon by Marc Faber is 
              absolutely spot on, starting and ending with his "policy" recommendation
               for what the US needs: "I will tell you what the US needs.  The US 
              needs a Lee Kwan Yew who stands in front of the US  and tells them, 
              listen you lazy bugger, now you have to tighten your belts, you have to 
              save more, work more for lower salaries and only through that will we 
              get out of the current dilemma that essentially prevents the economy 
              from growing." No money printing, no extensive protests, no excuses. Of 
              course, this would have to accompany a global overhaul of the system, 
              something Zero Hedge has been advocating since day one, as it is 
              impossible to reform this broken system from within: "The problem i have
               with the investment universe is that i find it difficult to envision 
              how the US and western Europe can return to healthy sustainable growth 
              without a complete purge of the financial system and some type of 
              catalyst. Something that restores some measure of social cohesion among 
              people;  it could be hyperinflation, a complete credit market collapse, 
              widespread sovereign defaults, civil strife, major military 
              confrontation.”   Alas, in that he is also correct, and as we said back 
              in early 2010, when the current episode of extend and pretend ends and 
              the can kicking exercise finally fails, next up is war.<br> <br> It is refreshing to see that Marc is a reader of Zero Hedge, and 
              specifically the post that we consider one of the most important of the 
              year, namely that from BSC, which laid out in black on white what the 
              next steps will be:<br> <br> I tell what you to do. I think a flat tax on everybody would be 
              actually a good measure and i think to reduce the regulatory environment
               in the US. We have expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. But we 
              have restrictive regulatory policies. And it curtails any initiative by 
              the small businessmen., and the large businessmen, he doesn't employ and
               invest capital in the US, he does he that in China or somewhere else in
               the world where the regulatory environment is more favorable. If you 
              look at net investments in the US, it's gone down for the last 20 years,
               and it's now negative. In other words, basically the capital stock of 
              America is not being replenished. It's being replenished somewhere else.
               And at the same time, the policies of the Keynesians have always 
              encouraged spending. “We're not going to get out of recession by saving.
               Spend, Spend, Spend.”  That is wrong. The lack of savings is the 
              problem of the United States.<br> <br> Faber on volatility and liquidity:<br> <br> i think the volatility arises because we have the Nasdaq bubble and 
              then we had the housing bubble and the stock market bubble and then a 
              commodities bubble and usually when the bubble bursts like off the 29 or
               after the late '60s you have a period of very high volatility for about
               10 to 15 years before the markets settle down and then reignite the 
              uptrend. As far the dollar is concerned, the reason i'm actually quite 
              positive is that global liquidity, despite of the fact that the ECB and 
              the European governments will flood the market with liquidity to pay the
               sales out, that global liquidity is tightening. And whenever global 
              liquidity is tightening, it's bad for asset prices but good for the US 
              dollar as was the case in 2008.<br> <br> On what the true target of #OccupyWallStreet, whose otherwise noble 
              intentions are unfortunately being abused by higher powers, should be:<br> <br> Basically we have the Keynesians and the Democrats and I'm not 
              saying that all democrats are equal, but they want interventions and we 
              have far too many interventions in the western world where the share of 
              the total economy that goes to government and is government- sponsored 
              has grown. And that essentially makes it very difficult for the western 
              world to grow substantially. As to that huge level of debts, i don't see
               how the western world, including the US, japan, and Western Europe can 
              actually grow. They're going to stagnate. And when you have stagnation 
              over a longer period of time, people start to ask questions and then 
              they go after minorities. And Wall Street is a minority – they are a 
              minority and anyone else would have done the same. They use the system. 
              But they didn't create the system. The system was created by the 
              lobbyists and by Washington. So they should actually go to Washington 
              and also occupy the Federal Reserve on the way.<br> <br> Finally, his conclusion is once again spot on: Wall Street's growth is 
              merely a smokescreen for something far more insiduous and something 
              repeatedly covered by Bill Buckler and other more insightful 
              strategists: namely the infinite growth of central planning and the 
              government apparatus. Wall Street's monstrous increase is merely a 
              smokescreen by government to allow it to operate in its shadows and to 
              pocket the benefits of the most mutated symbiotic relationship in the 
              history of the world.<br> <br> The problem is, governments in the western world -- and I'm not 
              singling out the US  -- they have grown like a cancer. And now they 
              protect themselves to stay in power and they have a variety of 
              alliances, like, for instance Mr. Obama he has no clue, but when he sees
               the protesters in Wall Street he immediately says yes, yes, yes that’s a
               good idea so he can target the minority so can buy a few more votes. 
              And of course the well to do people want to protect what they worked for
               and also what they're paying for because as you know in the US roughly 
              50% of the people don't pay federal income tax. So actually to say that 
              the rich have not contributed anything is actually wrong.<br> <br> The conclusion is that any systemic reset should not target just Wall 
              Street: it should focus first and foremost on what is most broken in US 
              society: its "government."</p>
