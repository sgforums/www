            <div class='col-md body'>My two cents worth.<br><br>All our politicians are in a comfort zone and how many can say that they have been challenged over their policies.Who guards the guards.No one is infalliable.What we are seeing now from the top echelons are a series of u-turns after u-turns and whatever speech they formualte up with today, will get lots of coverage from our Straits Times, which was a paper with 100+ years of heritage but now has been emasculated to become a mouthpiece , or more like a government gazette.We do not have a say, be it direct or indirect. We are just told about the policies which we will be under for the future.Do I want my children to grow up under a system which tells them what to do, and wake up everyday and listen to more and more sickeningly optimistic financial figures when the reality is nothing like it at all.Nope.<br><br>No doubt, the first generation of our leaders wanted to build up our nation and I applaud them for it.The current system is rotten and needs change.Some of you may say it's only natural for anyone in power not to give it up voluntarily.That's why we are supposed to have a electoral system to form some sort of peer appraisal and the results are akin to the KRAs and the KPIs which those working should be quite familiar with.Rule of law ensures that the people are responsible for their own destiny.What some honchos do not realise that the people are the ones they should serve, not their own business destiny.We are a nation, not corporate Singapore.Are you afraid that the populace's wants do not meet your wants?I question the visionary abilities of the leaders today, they fail to have a foresight that was present in the past, instead we see them riding on the coattails of other nations' ideas more often than not.E.g Tanjong Pelapas, AirAsia...<br><br>To check the power of the opposition simply to stay in power just because you believe that your way is the best smacks of arrogance and blasphemy.No one can be God.Remember that.If your policies have made people satisfied, they would vote you in freely and fairly, although what is free and fair is highly subjective.You would not see the increasing number of vitriolic posts these days.We love Singapre that's why we bother to speak up and thump our chests.You are seriously misguided and deluded if you think that the "silent majority" which you so claim , are the real lovers of this nation.If you ignore the plight of the fellows on the ground, you will only alienate those who love Singapore and their passion will one day add and contribute to mosaic of cultures that abound in the streets of Melbourne, Perth, New York City, London, Beijing, etc..</div>
