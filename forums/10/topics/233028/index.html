            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, painful decisions have to be made and be effected I feel. The world does not come around by our telling, rather it is us who would have to adapt to reality. The idealistic me would love a different Singapore, but by the fact we are Singapore, we have embraced idealism and sustain our tiny state for the past forty years staked againist all odds. It is imperative for us therefore, to keep the dream alive by facing the challenges of reality and not be entranced to the myth of western egalitarianism which will do us no good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. learning history back in secondary school and research from wikipedia makes me realise he is an intelligent man.. intelligent but not perfect.. this just might be one of the times he isnt perfect.. yes, up to 7% down to 1 %.. bad for us, good for foreigners (AGAIN!!) imo, this is a move to shift sgreans OUT of singapore.. make sgreans become lawyers in britain, financial advisors in US, pop star in taiwan (hint hint) and yada yada.. why earn income here in sg? look elsewhere so we can keep the BEST here! cos the best can afford 7% gst with fat incomes which are assisted by 1% company tax.. middle-range income hurts a lot here cos of increase in company revenue and profits, providing upper-range income to increase.. yes, middle-range income increases, but disposable income is NOT.. with increased taxes and inflation and yada yada, middle-range income is hurt with higher costs of living as a whole..<br><br>back to the topic at hand, lky is the "father" of singapore, yes.. he is a man to be admired to be so motivated and determined after the japanese occupation.. he stepped forth to repair and develop our broken nation.. perhaps so many years of power has gotten into him, perhaps not.. but i believe he is ESSENTIAL for singapore.. singapore needs lky.. without him, a PUNY island with no resources nor manners would not be able to become what we are now.. no man is perfect, this is something singapore has to learn.. when everything is good, how much recognition has he been given? the new generation holds no respect for him.. the only recognition he's been getting lately are monetary and none as a respectable man.. he is an old man yes, certainly not immortal, but his death means GREAT trouble for singapore.. despite the locals losing out, it is for the future that we do not lose out, for generations to come.. the greatest challenge for singapore, for should i say pm lee hsien loong, is when lky passes away.. would lee hsien loong be able to carry on the "legacy"? this is a huge task.. is he capable, is anyone capable enough? we should be worrying about this more than 7% of gst and 1% of company tax dun you think?<br><br>P.S. i'm looking for information regarding the lee "legacy", can anyone help me out? i'm only 17 i dunno stuff from before well.. like mr lee hsien loong's admission to the cabinet and his family and all.. only read up on wiki, but i feel that's utterly insufficient.. thanks very much!! =) and forgive my kiddy language here =x</div>

If i am not wrong, he written one and his granddaughter written one. Other then this 2, get some other books written by the opposition of sg. When u want to analyze in depth, get as many books from all sources. But keep in mind that most books that tok bad about him might not be on sale in sg.</div>
