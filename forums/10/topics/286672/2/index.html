And I agree understanding the real life application is important. For example, I suspect medical students do not truly learn anything until they go for their housemanship.<br><br>I guess you are right in a way, most young people no aim no goal. But can't blame them, after all if you are not properly exposed to something, how can you have interest in it? For example, before you start to play games, can you say you are hooked to it to the extent you want to be a professional gamer?<br><br>On the other hand, foundational skills are important too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually our education system is really world class you know? The goal set by MOE is there, just that schools have trouble implementing it 'cos of variety of reasons.<br><br>For example, science now is not about regurgitation. Heard of SPA? The closest encounter I had to SPA was in JC, back then they called it design experiments.
