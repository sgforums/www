            <div class='col-md body'><strong>My exp with Singapore education system  :</strong><br><br>- World-class curriculum and student support ... but only for specific subjects.  eg maths, science related.  Support for arts subjects is still pretty third-world.<br><br>- Decidedly high cost of tertiary education for locals, for all the government's stance on how important it is<br><br>- Highly segregated, from different streams to what I call the great big poly and uni class divide.<br><br>- Does not cater to late bloomers<br><br>- The difference between teaching methods and material in SAP schools are vastly different to those in government schools (I compared notes with my siblings.. I was shocked at how different their homework / tests were compared to mine for the same year/subject)<br><br>- students threatened, forced to drop CCAs / less "valuable" subjects (even if you clearly excel at them) if they are not very good at an unrelated, but more "valuable" subject<br><br>- Fickle with new methods/ideas (pertaining to curriculum and teaching).  These are introduced with a bang whether or not they've been planned thoroughly enough, afterwhich they are neglected and expected to float on their own.. few  years later they're dropped at the drop of a hat due to less than desirable results (the only obvious outcome of a lack of planning beforehand and support afterwards).. we end up with many "guinea pig" batches of students (eg GEP, IP.. special/express stream etc) who're basically the ones who lose out<br><br>- students encouraged to be "creative" and to get involved in extra-curricular activities... but students are not given the room to do so.. and they're sometimes even penalised for it! (eg students are asked to paraphrase, but when a student *does* do a good job of paraphrasing, she gets marked down because the teacher herself cannot recognize the same points in different words - yes, this happened to me many times)<br><br>- teachers only spoonfeeding students textbook information.. always emphasizing "don't try to be smart, just follow the book and then u can score well"... not entertaining requests for further explanation either due to time constraints or own lack of knowledge (related to afore-mentioned point)<br><br><strong>My exp with Australian education system :</strong><br><br>- Simple, flexible, non-judgmental and relaxed pre-university curriculum that's hard to fail but also hard to excel at.  Many say there is a lack of focus and guidance - it does not adequately prepare its students for the leap to University standards.<br><br>- curriculum and teaching methods are pretty much uniform throughout schools in each state.<br><br>- However, the above allows for students to really explore into their own interests/develop a real passion and in many cases actually force the students to look forward to learning more so they can stay competitive, instead of dreading school like in Singapore.  Typical Australian student: "It's my passion, that's why I must excel in it".. Typical Singaporean student: "Die die cannot lose.  Huh?  Simi passion. All A1, be  can liao!"<br><br>- Tertiary education is very different from pre-university education, both in terms of system and competitiveness.  It is much more difficult and many subjects have high entrance requirements.  Post-VCE, many students are caught by surprise.<br><br>- Pre-university: you may face a few instances of racist crap but in fairly strong doses.. even if you clearly demonstrate superior linguistic abilities and are articulate to a fault, if you don't act almost exactly like an Aussie, you'll be treated like a stranger.. you'll feel the barrier.  There'll be a handful of small-town morons who will shun you / discriminate against you (sometimes even teachers) / continue to talk to you in a condescending tone / deliberately slow pace (well.. now you know how minorities/PRC in Singapore feel).<br><br>- As an International student, you should never expect to have more privileges than a local (and if you ask for it, they will tell it to your face).  You typically pay 3-5 times more than local students in terms of course fees (not taking into account any additional govt subsidies these students may have)<br><br>- In Singapore, students can call their teachers on their mobile phones in the middle of the night if they encounter problems, say, while studying for "tomorrow's" difficult paper.  In Australia, that's called harassment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>- You are not being "rude" or "trying to be smart/funny" if you correct a teacher during class (politely), giving long and well-articulated answers, or give creative input, and in the event that you disagree with how a teacher marked your creative work, you can appeal to the school to have different teachers review those marks without fear of backlash <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>- Teachers don't spoonfeed.  Students have alot of freedom with how they want to use their time, and nagging from teachers is minimal, so the curriculum/course may seem relaxed... although it is not.  As I said, it's easy to pass.. but not to excel.. because this is not about how well you regurgitate information, and no one will hold your hand.  Many Asian/Singaporean students are not used to this.  While they can may do relatively well in VCE, they often struggle in University.<br></div>

So far, only one has given me a bad grade, but that's because our thinkings clash.
