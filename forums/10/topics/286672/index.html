I also did my degrees in Australia.<br><br>The Singaporean education system has its own merits and flaws , like every education system. It is based on rote learning. The only problem I have with it is that you can't argue against text books because apparently some teachers/lecturers , in my day, hold it up as the gold standard - just like PAP's policies. I never did well in such a system. I like to argue against conventional ideas.<br><br>I would say that the Australian system produce more vocal and opinionated generations. We are encouraged to present arguments. Copy from the textbook straight and you won't do well. I had some friends who did well in the Singaporean system but couldn't think out of what the textbooks tell them. In Australia, they actually encourage us to openly criticise the government's policies.<br><br>What is lacking in the Australian system is actually in abundance in the Singaporean system. For example ,in mathematics, you have alot of Singaporeans doing well because maths tend to stick to long established formulas.However anything to do with formulating a new theory, you don't see many Singaporeans with the ability to do so.<br><br>Critical thinking is seriously lacking in Singapore but it is a systematic problem which stems from the long-entrenched meritocracy and political system.<br><br></div>

That's just an example.<br><br>While twisting facts is one thing, being critical is another issue. That particular example also teaches students to wake up their idea. There are many ways to analyze it. One will have to balance his own set of ideas and beliefs and other reasons get his reason across.<br><br>On this part, I admitted that I've neglected it.</div>
