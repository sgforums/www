Like you say, how much is high ? Should they try to equate their pays with Bill Gate or Wee Cho Yaw? There is no end except that in being a leaders there is expected to be intangible benefits of all kinds, like fame and prestige and getting directorships after retirements.<br><br>Moreover without citizens' moral blessing they have gone unilaterally to pass their own life-long annuities at 2/3 of such hyper salaries and that imposes a great burden on the population.  At one last estimate the combined annuities payable to some 80 retiring MPs and Ministers would cost people some S$1000,000,000.00 enough monies to build an MRT.</div>

Income levels of majority of Singaporeans and their assets have dropped to the lowest in many years. Costs have gone up.<br><br>Until there is a total understanding of the problems faced in failures to adapt to technological changes in world environments and creating the correct level of technology catch-up and start-ups, the whole system becomes totally sold to elitism on fallacies of media hype and presentations like the NKF during Durai. The whole system is not willing to open up for accountable governance and all the scholars are just trying to use market forces to justify their existence.  There is a critical need to get real and be truly competitive.</div>

If they are as upright and moral as the young emperor keeps harping, maybe they should not hae stooped so low as to blackmail themselves, nor give in to their own blackmails???</div>
