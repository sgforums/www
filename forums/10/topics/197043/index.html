            <div class='col-md body'>I refer to the letter by Mr Mah Bow Tan, Â“Upgrading is a unique programme by GovtÂ”. 17 June 2006.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I would have fully agreed with the reply from Mr Mah had he signed off as Minister for PAP Constituency Development, instead of Minister for National Development.<br><br>Mr Mah was right to say, Â“No other Government in the world has anything similar, in terms of scale and commitmentÂ”. Indeed we are thankful to our Government when we compare the conditions of our public housing with those in neighbouring countries. However, we also understand that other governments will never allow its public housing programme to be used as a prize or penalty when garnering the support of the people. They know that this kind of discrimination will generate resentment, riot and even revolt in their country.<br><br>Â“It is funded out of budget surpluses generated by the PAP GovernmentÂ”, said Mr Mah. What then is not funded by budget surpluses generated by the PAP Government, who has ruled for more than 40 years? There must be a better way to retain the faith of the people.<br><br>It insults the intelligence of Singaporeans if we believe that they will vote for the ruling party because they want their house to be upgraded. The people of Hougang and Potong Pasir has had demonstrated that they believe a beautifully spruced up precinct is but a camouflage when compared to the daily high cost of living. They hope an MP from another party can help change things for the better. And I think this sentiment is shared by many Singaporeans.<br><br>From a National Development point of view, a run down dilapidated housing estate is bad for the image of Singapore as a whole, physically and politically. While we would not want to compare the sacrosanct General Election to a game like the World Cup match, we believe every right minded person would nonetheless want to see good refereeing and fair play. HDB should be shown the red card for using the Upgrading Programme to benefit any political party.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: darkred;"><br>This HDB upgrading program - under whichever IUP or MUP program - is a sheer waste of surplus funds.<br><br>In certain neighborhood, construction works that have been completed were torn down and modification works made; while work sequence were seen to be poorly disorganised with contractors having to return to continue work that could have been performed previously at one instant; and with some works that have been poorly designed despite the good intent.<br><br>While some PAP wards had seen upgrading within 15 years since the estate were raised, some other PAP wards seem to see no works being done since the estate was lived in more then 20 years ago.<br><br>It begs the question, who is in charge of the upgrading program ?<br><br>Is such program decided and managed at the Town Council level, or is it decided at the Ministry of National Development level ?<br><br>If Town Council has the responsibility to decide and managed such upgrading works - within their Town Council's own surplus budgets or otherwise - why should the Ministry impinge on the rights of the Town Councils by passing Ministerial directives and guidelines that restrict the Town Councils ?<br><br>If this is not political wayang taking place, and perpetuated by the Ruling Political Party to indirectly prevent Opposition Town Councils from being more effective in meeting the needs of its own constituents.</span><br><br></div>
