So any attempt to relax on this fundamental tenet will only undermine the existence of our nation.<br><br>Minister Teo Chee Hian must have realized that there has been a compromise in the instance of Mervyn and has intended to amend the law to toughen the punishment.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is not the case of support or against Melvyn and certainly not the case of one's right to migrate.<br><br>For his case, up to his last and final call-up for NS, he was still a Singaporean and was served with the enlistment notice. Therefore, the conscription law applied to him there and then. But he choosen to ignore the call up. He broke the law- simple and clear cut.<br><br>A simple anology would be: A boy committed a crime and left the country before caught, came back many years later and was brought before the law. Simple and clear cut as this.<br><br>As for a child of 3 years old leaving Singapore, when he reaches a certain age, the govt will contact the parents for a security deposit and notification of the boy's NS liability upon reaching 18 (if he is still abroad). I believe there will be steps for Mindef to undertake if the parent or the child fails to response (like writing to them with first, second warnings etc). So it would not be the case where the child comes back 30 years later and being unaware that he broke the law.<br><br>It is also not the case where the govt wants to trap us and prevent us from migrating. I believe we are all free to migrate if we really want to migrate. No  govt can stop us or scare us. To do so would not be the right style of any credible govt.<br><br>For Melvyn case, there are, indeed, many grey areas. The fine seems symbolic more than punitive. Even though the law seems more symbolic than punitive, it is signalling that this is not a loophole for people to exploit. I  think the law is signalling that NS liability is important (even for Melvyn case, 30 years have lapsed).<br><br>When the govt reviews the law because of Melvyn case, what the govt is trying to do is to make the NS law more water-tight than it's existing.<br><br>Imagine, if the govt gives back Melvyn the $3000, says sorry because he is now a British citizen and he may go free. Will you see many rich Singaporeans rushing to exploit this loophole for their own benefit?<br><br>For all of you here who have served NS. Imagine, if the more our govt gives in to people like Melvyn, the more loopholes there will be for NS laibility.  Those can run away- run, those can't run away- serve. Will you not be complaining then? Will you also not be demoralised and finding ways to escape?<br><br>I am not work for the govt or speaking for them.<br></div>
