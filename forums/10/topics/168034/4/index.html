            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree with that. He is a Singapore-Born Singaporean therefore it is mandatory for him to serve NS. But however, if he isn't born in Singapore but obtain Singapore Citizenship due to DESCENT, then i feel that it is extremly unfair to punish him as firstly, he does not belong to Singapore and secondly, he left at 12 years old. And furthermore, he DOES NOT need to discharge his NS liabilities if he wants to renounce his citizenship later on, in fact, the Singapore government would automatically "cancel" him if he did not take the OATH by 21 years old.</div>
