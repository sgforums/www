              <p>I have been having difficulty understanding why Spore is often called a nanny state when our govt has never wanted to provide too much safety net like the advanced countries.  And yet these advanced countries have never refered themselves as nanny states even though they provide very good safety nets for their people.</p>
              <p>Spore provide more protection in-process like road traffic signs are clearly drawn and displayed to prevent accident whereas in advanced countries pedestrians and vehicles could share the same space as their vehicles can cross traffic islands even when they  exist.  Few no U-turn signs put up as a result.  These advanced countries while do not provide better safety in-process but they provide end-process safety net like good social welfare.  Spore is called a nanny state because it provides more comprehensive in-process protections and less end-process social welfare?  The advanced countries are not called nanny state because they provide less comprehensive in-process protections and comprehensive end-process social welfare????  Can any one enlighten me.</p>

              <p>Being called a nanny state is not about protecting you. In Singapore, the meaning is because as the "Nanny", it decides everything for you. For example, you are forced to contribute to CPF, which is your money and you cannot decide what to do with it. As the citizen, you need to get permission for everything. For example, if you're damn poor and no place to sleep, police will catch you because you have no license to sleep on the streets. If you're busking on the streets, no license? The police will come catch you too.</p>
              <p>Last time the police sent a few cars just to take down our names for playing in the soccer pitch of a secondary school without permission and that time it was school holiday, nobody playing... Take note, taking out a pen and paper to take down names requires calling for backups and a few cars because of 1 coward selfish policeman... he felt threatened by secondary school kids... lol</p>

                            was much of a debate on that. We never believed in the welfare state. MDB:

                            Well, Singapore is a very small place. And a small country does not respond

                            have industries to protect it. But in a small country you can't.(39)

              <p>Being called a nanny state is not about protecting you. In
              Singapore, the meaning is because as the "Nanny", it decides
              everything for you. For example, you are forced to contribute to
              CPF, which is your money and you cannot decide what to do with it.
              As the citizen, you need to get permission for everything. For
              example, if you're damn poor and no place to sleep, police will
              catch you because you have no license to sleep on the streets. If
              you're busking on the streets, no license? The police will come
              catch you too.</p>
              <p>Last time the police sent a few cars just to take down our names
              for playing in the soccer pitch of a secondary school without
              permission and that time it was school holiday, nobody playing...
              Take note, taking out a pen and paper to take down names requires
              calling for backups and a few cars because of 1 coward selfish
              policeman... he felt threatened by secondary school kids... lol</p>

              <p>CPF at least you can use to buy house, invest in shares or buy medical insurance. in the west, you pay over 50% of your income to the government as taxes. you decide.</p>
              <p>Government don't issue permission to use school compound, the school management does. The police are there because the school called them. in america, if the police are threatened, they just shoot, if not enough bullets then call for backup. The teenagers can also carry gun and shoot if they don't like the police, or the teachers, or their classmates.</p>
              <p>There is a different between law and order, enforced by authorities and love and care given by nanny.</p>

              <p>I have been having difficulty understanding why Spore is often
              called a nanny state when our govt has never wanted to provide too
              much safety net like the advanced countries.  And yet these
              advanced countries have never refered themselves as nanny states
              even though they provide very good safety nets for their
              people.</p>
              <p>Spore provide more protection in-process like road traffic signs
              are clearly drawn and displayed to prevent accident whereas in
              advanced countries pedestrians and vehicles could share the same
              space as their vehicles can cross traffic islands even when
              they  exist.  Few no U-turn signs put up as a
              result.  These advanced countries while do not provide better
              safety in-process but they provide end-process safety net like good
              social welfare.  Spore is called a nanny state because it
              provides more comprehensive in-process protections and less
              end-process social welfare?  The advanced countries are not
              called nanny state because they provide less comprehensive
              in-process protections and comprehensive end-process social
              welfare????  Can any one enlighten me.</p>

              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
              <p>Thanks, can I be more confident to think that the reason why their govts are not nannies because they have more comprehensive welfare safety net than us?  However, I still hear them blaming their govts for lack of jobs, rising costs, collapse property mkts, etc.  They seem like one of us in this respect.   Also it is often said that advanced education made them creative and entrepreneurial.  But I hear their prominent ceos blaming the govt for them to be fearful because of uncertainties in regulations.  I thought entrepreneurs thrive on uncertainties, right?  It is because I have never heard of any one picking up such observations to discuss that I have to choose our own turf to hopeful instil confidence in myself on such issues.  I do not like to be laughed by a foreigner.</p>

              <p><br>Without revealing names, let me just share with you how this friend owns so many properties and yet he told me he doesn't contribute to CPF. Firstly, he prefers the money on his hands so that he can grow them whenever he can grow them fast compared to the palty interests the CPF is generating. The rich is getting richer and the poor is stuck in the poor loop because they cannot make more money because they do not have the money. I could never understand the logic that if the money belongs to me, then why can't I use it? If I can't use it, then how can I say the money belongs to me? One way is you can say that the government do not trust the citizens, but hey they are willing to give sponsorships to foreign students to study here. So are you telling me that foreigners are better than Singaporean trash?</p>
              <p>Secondly, you mentioned higher taxes in other countries but you failed to mention how other countries provide free education to all and free healthcare to all. In those countries, if you find the free education lacking, then by all means go pay for a better one. But in Singapore, you no money don't even bother to sleep out in the streets, the police will come and catch you. The more you mention that, it appears that you're suggesting Singapore govenment is abusing their authority and violating the rights of Singapore citizens.</p>
              <p>In American, police man just shoot whenever they felt threatened... LOL... What nonsense is this? If you can't get your facts right, you just lost all your credibility in that statement. Do you want to do it yourself or do you want me to search for you some Youtube clips about American policemen being threatened and never shoot like you just mentioned? You can't even get the facts right.</p>
              <p>What you're suggesting about anyone can get a gun easily in America legally is not true, please get your facts right before you comment further. If you're talking about getting the guns illegally, by all means, I can even do that in Singapore, no need to go to America.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between law and order vs wasting tax papers money and abusing authority by doing something stupid that is not necessary. It makes them looks retarded plus more importantly, it wastes the tax payer's money, which is basically my money too.</p>

But they do trust foreigners through actions such as investing in their educational sponsorships. So you're infering that foreigners are more trustworthy and more important compared to Singapore citizens?</p>

              <p>BTW, I'm not condemming the policies made, I am merely reflecting that there is something on the other side of the policies that the government does not reveal.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking, overall, they did great. I would say they score good but I will say there are rooms for improvement.</p>
              <p>The biggest areas for improvement, and also why the government attracts so much heat from critics is simply because of their supression of opposition parties. The more you suppress, the harder they fight back, it's natural reaction. The more you suppress, the better you made the opposition look, suddenly they have hero status, although not on the mainstream.</p>
              <p>The other thing is housing prices because if you can't even have a roof over your head, then as a citizen, what's it good for? Might as well be a foreigner in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Things like that, can be improved.</p>
