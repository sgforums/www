              <p>Most govts only source of income is taxes and fees. except for
              those who have good natural resources like ME and Brunei. 
              Spore though do not have natural resources daringly invest
              surpluses instead of simply parking at sovereign wealth bonds of
              many countries including EU, US, Japan etc for small returns. 
              You know that many govt and banks are in trouble when these
              countries default.  Warren Buffet has recently proved to
              investment community that gold and bonds are inferior to equities
              over long term which is exactly Temasek and GIC's investment
              view.  So Spore is the only country in the world that has zero
              natural resources but could still have some investment income to
              top up the tax collection.  Spore can have low income tax to
              attract the rich because it has investment income and gst where no
              one can avoid tax.  By having a broad base, the rich cannot
              avoid the 7% tax as long as they have to consume goods and
              services.  The govt would offer gst tax rebate base on
              resonable model of spending to those lower income citizens even
              though most do not have to pay income tax at all.  Foreigners
              also have to pay GST but they cannot get gst rebates.</p>

              <p>ya but our cpf are TOTALLY UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL.  and in other countries dont impose a mandatory 20 % deduction from our salaries to accumulate money for this so called retirement fund. i thnk if by your reasoning , we should totally become a welfare state or we be better off not having this type of 'protection' at all. and to top it off our cpf is not inclusive of medical insurance and btw not every one has 136 k in their accounts. imagine a low wage worker he might only accumulate about 60 k in total over the course of his life and that is a higher estimate. from your i infer that you might just be another pap troll spreading your lies all over the place .</p>
