              <h1 class="clr">US lawyer charged in Singapore for insulting judge</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, June 2 - A U.S. lawyer was charged in a Singapore court on
              Monday for allegedly insulting a judge in an email and on his website,
              court documents showed.</p>
              <p>Gopalan Nair, who runs a law firm in California and was previously a
              Singapore citizen, was arrested last Friday and charged on Monday for
              "threatening, abusing or insulting a public servant" in an email he
              circulated and posted on his blog, singaporedissident.blogspot.com,
              official documents showed.</p>
              <p>Nair was not sentenced and will be held in custody for 7 days pending further investigations, his lawyer Chia Ti Lik said.</p>
              <p>Under this charge, Nair faces a maximum fine of S$5,000 or a jail term of one year if he is found guilty.</p>
              <p>"He is feeling okay, but he is worried about his job situation in the U.S.," Chia told reporters.</p>
              <p>Nair was in Singapore last week to attend a 3-day hearing presided over by Judge Belinda Ang.</p>
              <p>The
              hearing was to determine defamation damages to be paid by the leader of
              an opposition party to the city-state's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
              and his father, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>In an email
              sent to the media and Singapore's attorney-general, Nair accused the
              judge of being biased towards the plaintiffs during the hearing.</p>
              <p>The
              court documents showed Nair's email said "judge Belinda Ang was
              throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings".</p>
              <p>Nair
              had on Friday posted his telephone number and location in Singapore on
              his blog, daring Lee Kuan Yew and the police to come after him.</p>
              <p>Nair,
              a critic of Singapore's ruling party, stood for elections in 1991 as a
              member of the opposition Workers' Party. He was later found guilty of
              contempt of court stemming from an election rally speech and made to
              pay S$21,000 in legal costs and fines.</p>
              <p>Protests are rare in
              Singapore as the city-state has strict laws against public gatherings
              and leaders of the ruling People's Action Party have successfully sued
              opposition leaders for defamation.</p>
              <p>Singapore's political landscape has been dominated by the PAP since its independence in 1965.</p>

              <p>I do not agree that this is any insulting. Because apparently some people thought this is the equivalent of labelling someone a prostitute, it isnt.</p>
              <p>Saying someone is prostituting himself does not mean i am threatening, abusing or insulting a person mah... If I meant to insult someone, I will say "she is a prostitute"</p>
              <p>In this case I say Nair is prostituting himself because he is using himself as "sacrificial lamb" to the lees. The point I am driving is, do not see a bad word and assume it is bad, pls look at the context which it is used. Mr Nair is not calling belinda a prostitute.</p>
              <p>I do not see any threats from Nair's blog.... A little satire yes... no threats at all..</p>

              <p>Think there is a difference between speaking out against authorities and calling people prostitutes and "employee of the lees".</p>
              <p>Today if you come out and say that Wong Kan Seng is inept as Mas Selamat had escaped during his tenure etc who can fault you ? That is speaking out. Today if you come out and say that political parties shouldn't be suing one another and it is unjust for them to do so, who can fault you ? That is speaking out.</p>
              <p>However calling a judge a prostitute and accusing her of being "an employee of the Lees" is not speaking out, It is an insult and defamatory. Unless of course if he can prove it. She is doing just doing her job.</p>

I was reading up on the Democratic Primaries on the DrudgeReport, a prominent news website based in the States (they were the first ones to break the Lewinsky scandal, apparently) and I saw the headline 'Warning: U.S Blogger Arrested in Singapore over 'Prostituting' comment" So I clicked the link, and end up it's an article about the Gopolan Nair saga. </p>
              <p>For starters, the title totally takes the situation out of context.

              Opposition leader Chee Soon Juan faces jail again for contempt of
              court, this time with his sister in tow
              
              <br></p>
              <p id="z9h:9">As
              appeared inevitable, Chee Soon Juan, the much-jailed leader of the
              embattled Singapore Democratic Party, has been sentenced to 12 more
              days in jail for having “scandalized the court” and
              “obstructed the administration of justice” during a
              contentious three-day hearing to decide on damages to be awarded to
              the ruling Lee family.</p>
              <p id="z9h:12">During the
              cross-examination phase of the hearing, Chee called former Prime
              Minister Lee Kuan Yew a “pitiable figure” and Lee
              described Chee as a “near psychopath.” Chee Siok Chin,
              Chee’s sister, also a senior SDP member, was sentenced to 10
              days in jail for the same offenses. Both are free while they appeal
              the sentence.</p>
              <p id="z9h:13">Supreme
              Court Justice Belinda Ang charged Chee Soon Juan with contempt for
              accusing the court of being biased and of having prejudged the
              hearing, as well as not obeying her orders to stop particular lines
              of questioning, according to Agence-France Press.</p>
              <p id="z9h:14">Chee, the
              secretary general of the SDP,  and his sister were found in an
              earlier hearing to have defamed Lee, now Singapore’s “minister
              mentor,” and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a 2006
              article in their party newspaper, the new Democrat.</p>
              <p id="z9h:15">Chee has
              been sent to jail six times already in Singapore, four for speaking
              in public without a permit, once for attempting to leave the country
              without a permit after being invited to a conference in Istanbul for
              the World Movement for Democracy's Fourth Assembly in April 2006, and
              once before for “scandalizing the judiciary.”</p>
              <p id="z9h:16">He has
              also been driven into bankruptcy by repeated lawsuits by <a class="lingo_link" style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=970&amp;I">government

              University</a> of Singapore was terminated, allegedly for
              misappropriation of research funds. Chee later staged a <a id="z9h:22" href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=621&amp;Itemid=31">hunger
              strike,</a> saying the charges were fabricated. He didn’t
              get his position back.</p>
              <p id="z9h:23">Last week,
              in an unusual step for a Singapore court, Chee was allowed by the
              court to cross-examine both the elder Lee and his son, Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong. However, the cross examination by Chee and his
              lawyer turned into a free-for-all, with Ang repeatedly ruling Chee’s
              questions out of order or irrelevant.  Chee continued to assert his
              innocence on all charges, telling the court that “At no point
              was there a deliberate attempt to do anything that would scandalise
              the court." According to local media, he added that "There
              were many political arguments made and in the heat of the battle, Mr.
              Lee said some things and I said some things. It was in this context
              that some things were said and done."</p>
              <p id="z9h:24">The state
              prosecutor had asked Ang to deliver a “substantial fine”
              to act as a deterrent for other “like-minded”
              individuals.</p>
              <p id="z9h:25">Chee Soon
              Joon and Yap Keng Ho, another party official, are also free on appeal
              after having been sentenced to five weeks in prison or to pay a
              S$5,000 (US$3,671) fine last Wednesday in the court of District Court
              Judge Jasvender Kaur.  The two were sentenced for speaking in public
              without a permit during elections in April 2006.  Chee pleaded not
              guilty, claiming he had a constitutional right to free speech.</p>
              <p id="z9h:26">In more
              trouble for the SDP, Gopalan Nair, a former Singaporean who ran as an
              SDP candidate in the 1988 and 1991 general elections before moving to
              the United States to become a US citizen, dared the Singapore police
              to arrest him for illegal blogging after Lee Kuan Yew said in court
              that he would take action against any blogger for making defamatory
              remarks. Police took him up on his dare, collecting him from his
              <a class="lingo_link" style='border-bottom: 1px dotted; text-decoration: none; color: blue; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,"Tahoma",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 12.1333px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;' rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=677&amp;Itemid=31">hotel room</a> and taking him to jail after he wrote on his blog that “I
              am present in Singapore at Broadway Hotel, Room 708, 195 Serangoon
              Road, Singapore, 218067. The hotel telephone number is 62924661. My
              local SingTel telephone number is 83764236.”</p>
              <p id="z9h:27">He soon
              got his wish. According to an SDP news release, police descended on
              the hotel room and arrested Nair on Saturday night at about 9 pm.
              Nair has been a vocal critic of the PAP Government, bombarding the
              news media with blogs charging the Lee family with abusing the legal
              system for their own ends and of being insensitive to the plight of
              ordinary Singaporeans.  He often returns from California to take up
              the political cudgels, and, according to the SDP, “has
              expressed a desire to be closer to home to effect political changes.”</p>
              <p id="z9h:28">Authorities
              require a police permit if more than five people seek to assemble
              outdoors in Singapore. Offences under the Public Entertainments and
              Meetings Act could lead to fines as high as S$10,000.  Singapore has
              been under widespread criticism by press groups and human rights
              organizations for decades for what they term political repression and
              restrictions against free speech. The Lee family have repeatedly sued
              both local politicians and the international press for defamation on
              a wide variety of fronts, and so far have never lost a case in
              Singapore.</p>

              <p>Wow, that is interesting!</p>
              <p>Actually, GN is truely 100% a Citizen of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and a CALIFORNIAN LAWYER.</p>
              <p>No lawyer in this whole universe can deny this fact.</p>
              <p>GN is NOT A SINGAPOREAN at all now.</p>
              <p>I prefer the headline " An American Jailed for insult".</p>
              <p>That is more appropriate.</p>
              <p>Just because is is indian race and born in the pore before does not mean he is any less American than the president of USA.</p>
              <p>Altho I do not support using un-nice words to say about others like GN did,</p>
              <p>At the same time I cannot condone his action as I understand that he may have been too americanised and that is why he spoke that way? maybe. maybe not.</p>
              <p>These americans are very freedom of speech wan. That is the right given to them by their constitution where GN is used to enjoying this priviledge there, altho not so nice that he scold people like dat wan here.</p>
              <p>Poor man, he forgot he is in the pore.</p>
              <p>aiyo, back home, I am quite sure he would not be kenna like this.</p>
              <p>But frankly speaking har, what protection will USA provide to an AMERICAN CITIZEN based on their constitution or citizen rights har?</p>
              <p>anyone know how USA will render some support for him? How about his supporters in good ole mighty world leader UNITED STATES OF AMERICA?</p>
