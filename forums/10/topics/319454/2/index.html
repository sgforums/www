              <p>like I said .. his types are noted for being good at promoting themselves ....</p>
              <p>he's gonna come up with lots of "abu gharib" stories later ......</p>
              <p>you watch, he's gonna make some money out of this .... speaking engagements at leftist fringe groups, there are plenty of those in california ... book deals ... you know, those US$4.95 paper back trash they have at walmart, with a dozen glossy pictures pages in the middle .... and maybe a movie deal ... maybe they'd set it in India to avoid confusion ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>if he makes enough noise ... those same groups that's been paying chee soon juan all this while would probably start paying him too ...</p>
              <p>and he can upgrade from two star hotel in little india to the conrad next time he comes visiting ...</p>
              <p>broadway hotel huh .... he can't be doing too well as an immigration lawyer in the US, no surprise there, lawyers are 3 for $10 there ...</p>

              <p>Think there is a difference between speaking out against authorities and calling people prostitutes and "employee of the lees".</p>
              <p>Today if you come out and say that Wong Kan Seng is inept as Mas Selamat had escaped during his tenure etc who can fault you ? That is speaking out. Today if you come out and say that political parties shouldn't be suing one another and it is unjust for them to do so, who can fault you ? That is speaking out.</p>
              <p>However calling a judge a prostitute and accusing her of being "an employee of the Lees" is not speaking out, It is an insult and defamatory. Unless of course if he can prove it. She is doing just doing her job.</p>

              <p>Calling the judge a prostitute is defamatory without proof or first hand experience but calling the judge an employee of the Lees is speaking out.</p>
              <p>Admit it or not Singapore is not a democratic country. This is true and not a defamatory remark. But whether I can prove it is another question. Sometimes things are so clear that proofing is no longer needed but a lot of people think ignorance is a bliss and they continue to live in denial. Hey it isn't me why should I care. That was what gave rise to Hitler and Nazism in Germany and gave birth to World World II.</p>

              <p>Gopalan is just seeking attention. Lets see if he can out do CSJ. That is his purpose.</p>
              <p>He's  not very smart, considering that the US of A is busy at the moment. And right at this moment Osama bin Laden Inc, will be actively taking advantage of the distraction. We will see his result, around the time the new President takes office. Gopalan will be on his own.</p>
              <p>I wonder if not being able to sleep well in a DC constitute cruel and unusual punishment, a la Chee Soon Juan.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Think there is a difference between speaking out against
              authorities and calling people prostitutes and "employee of the
              lees".</p>
              <p>Today if you come out and say that Wong Kan Seng is inept as Mas
              Selamat had escaped during his tenure etc who can fault you ? That
              is speaking out. Today if you come out and say that political
              parties shouldn't be suing one another and it is unjust for them to
              do so, who can fault you ? That is speaking out.</p>
              <p>However calling a judge a prostitute and accusing her of being
              "an employee of the Lees" is not speaking out, It is an insult and
              defamatory. Unless of course if he can prove it. She is doing just
              doing her job.</p>

              <p>Saying someone "prostituting" his/her morals VS saying someone is a "prostitute"...</p>
              <p>IS A BIG DIFFERENCE , ok ?</p>
              <p>And from the way the court case acted out. I would also think Belinda is "working for the Lees".</p>
              <p>Let's face it, you really think Belinda has no fear for the Lees , at ALL ?</p>
              <p>There's already an obvious conflict of interest in the whole setup already.</p>
              <p>Unless the court is a 3rd/neutral party court , else there can be no fair judgement.</p>

              <p>Quite ironic isn't it?</p>
              <p>Gopalan challenged LKY to sue him for <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">defamation</span></strong> to what he posted on his blog.</p>
              <p>They couldn't charge him with defamation, so they decided to charge him with insulting a public servant. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>What's next? They going to charge him for jaywalking, littering, not flushing toilet to make up for the defamation suit? <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Maybe they can find fault with him in tax evasion. Wait a minute, he's a US citizen so he doesn't have income in Singapore. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So one has to question whether what he said on the blog was true. Afterall someone did said if lies are not pursued in a court, then it has the essence of being the truth.</p>

              <p><strong>TIME:</strong> <em>Couldn't you have been lighter on the oppositionï¿½not sue?</em><br><strong>LEE:</strong> <strong>No. If you don't sue, repetition of the lie [makes it credible].</strong></p>

              <p>Then both are not defamatory then.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew has been using defamatory lawsuit to help him crush opposition.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew has been using IMH and paranormal to crush ordinary dissent or anyone who tresspassed his ego or who he thought to be tresspassing his ego. Who would  prove that certain people has the ability to read mind afterall.</p>
              <p>I guess that is why CSJ said that the whole European Union consider him thugs and small time street bully. Street bully eh?</p>
