              <p>Saying someone "prostituting" his/her morals VS saying someone

              <p>IS A BIG DIFFERENCE , ok ?</p>
              <p>And from the way the court case acted out. I would also think
              Belinda is "working for the Lees".</p>
              <p>Let's face it, you really think Belinda has no fear for the Lees
              , at ALL ?</p>
              <p>There's already an obvious conflict of interest in the whole
              setup already.</p>
              <p>Unless the court is a 3rd/neutral party court , else there can
              be no fair judgement.</p>

              <p><strong>Did Goplan Nair threaten Belinda Ang?<br>Posted by Charles on June 1, 2008</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Channel News Asia, the Singapore police has recently arrested a former Singaporean for sending ‘insulting statements to a public servant’ to the Attorney General and the Solicitor General. The allegedly offensive statement has also been posted on his blog (Channel News Asia, 2008).</p>
              <p>A quick search online in Singapore Statutes throw up one possible offense that the police might prosecute him under - The Penal Code, Chapter 10 - Contempts of the Lawful Authority of Public Servants - Section 189, ‘Threat of injury to a public servant’ which states that:</p>
              <p>Whoever holds out any threat of injury to any public servant, or to any person in whom he believes that public servant to be interested, for the purpose of inducing that public servant to do any act, or to forbear or delay to do any act, connected with the exercise of the public functions of such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both (Singapore Statutes, n.d.).</p>
              <p>In his latest post, ‘Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang’s Kangaroo Court’, Nair claims that the court has been misappropriated for political means (Nair 2008). However, any references to the judge, Belinda Ang, cannot be deemed as threatening to the public servant. For the purpose of a closer examination, we have reproduced any references to Belinda Ang which was found in his blog posting:</p>
              <p>1. ‘your stooge of a judge, Belinda Ang’;<br>2. ‘The judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders’;<br>3. ‘right out of the pages of Alice in Wonderland with Belinda Ang playing the role of the Queen of Hearts before the trial of the Mouse who stole the Tarts very well indeed’;<br>4. numerous references to her as the ‘kangaroo judge’;<br>5. ‘and the judge obediently sustained the objection’;<br>6. ‘ Of course the judge permitted these insults, since after all Lee Kuan Yew and his son owned the courts and the judge as well’;</p>
              <p>While it is true that in his posting, he accuses the court and the judge of political persecution, sometimes using language that might be deemed as offensive, there was no hint or openly declared threat to cause any injury to the public servant. This is a clear distinction that one should keep in mind.</p>
              <p>While it is true that he had openly declared his address, name and laid down a challenge for the Senior Minister to serve him with a writ of summons, there are still no plausible grounds for the arrests.</p>
              <p>Given that the Singapore law society has recently announced its intentions to lobby for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be incorporated into the law books, it should seek to represent Mr Nair if the police decides to press ahead with charges. There is no time to be lost given the authorities have said they will put him on trial by Monday.</p>

              Thank you for the input.
              
              Sad to say our police seem to have lost their professional neutrality and have become a mere pawn to the power that be.

              <p>not everyone has the ability to interpret correct the words used by Gopalan Nair.</p>
              <p>I admire him for his guts.   At least, we know he means what he said and not a hypocrite.    What he said of PAP are facts which many in Singapore are too timid to voice out.   We should be thankful to him for he takes risk to voice out rather than to look at him negatively.</p>
