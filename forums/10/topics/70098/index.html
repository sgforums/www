Parliament was told last month that this might well happen, as part of a review of the Penal Code to be completed in two to three months.<br><br>But a new twist emerged nine days after Annis' sentencing on Nov 28: It transpired that the girl was 15 when the offence was committed.<br><br>District Judge Wong Keen Onn said that had he known that the girl was a minor, 'that fact would be regarded as an added aggravating factor for the purpose of sentencing'.<br><br>Yesterday, the charge still stood under the Penal Code, although the mistake over the girl's age was rectified. Other laws governing minors, such the Women's Charter, do not deal with oral sex.<br><br>Arguing against the sentence, Annis' new lawyer, Mr S.S. Dhillon, suggested that consent on the part of the girl should be a 'highly mitigatory factor'.<br><br>He also said that contrary to earlier statements tendered at the lower court, his client did not meet the girl through the Internet Relay Chat (IRC).<br><br>Annis' computer seized by the police did not show this and it was the victim, he said, who had contacted his client first after they met at a Pasir Ris chalet in March last year.<br><br>He asked, and the girl agreed, to perform oral sex on him when they met at Chinese Garden Road a month later.<br><br>'This is not a case where the appellant had preyed on the victim or he had forced her into doing something or coerced her into doing something,' he said.<br><br>He also tendered several cases in the Subordinate Courts which imposed between four months and one year on oral-sex offenders.<br><br>An appeal against two years' jail was made by Annis (centre) and lawyers Dhillon (left) and Terence Hua. -- LIANHE ZAOBAO<br>Given that Annis was a first-time offender, he suggested that 'a slap on the cheek' or 'a knock on his knuckle' would suffice as punishment rather than 'the thrashing' he received.<br><br>The CJ said there was no way the court could be guided by past cases as it all depended on the facts of each case.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">While he accepted that other countries would not view oral sex as a crime, 'there are certain offences against Asian culture'.</span><br><br>But on Mr Dhillon's argument that the two-year sentence was 'unprecedented', the CJ replied: 'That is really your strongest point'.<br><br>He halved the sentence and said that he would write his grounds soon in view of the various cases pending.<br><br>Outside the courtroom, Mr Dhillon told reporters that his client, who got married last week, was 'extremely pleased' with the decision.<br><br>'Now that the sentence has been reduced, the pressure is off him. He wants to get on to serve it, pay for his crime, go back to start life afresh,' he said.<br><br>Straits Times, 18 February 2004 Edition<br>This article will be archived on 21 February 2004<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,235754,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,235754,00.html?</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At this point, it's fair to say most of our laws are designed for punitive and deterant measures. And to follow a decades long quote: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br><br>The probable reason why lawmakers chose to review the penal code now is merely a reaction to this case and such changes will only come on a case by case basis.<br><br>I seriously doubt if a formal review of the penal code in its entirety will take place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe because Singapore is too darn boring, the "gahmen" must resort to such laws to bring in some action. One day it will reach a point where the govt makes up the action and the news, just so they can possibly give the media and the judges and the lawyers something to do.<br><br>But to take a different less weird view, I believe the law is bogus. Can anyone tell me WHY we have it? I will buy the person lunch seriously, if you can convince me of the need for such a law? Once i asked like 4 teachers why students are not allowed to dye their hair, or why they have to wear certain clothes on saturdays when they come back to school, i offered $10 to the teacher who could explain it. No one could. Lets see if things have changed. Lunch for an explanation of the law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm no expert on the teachings on Confucious, but I do believe theres nothing in the text that contains his opinions on the rights and wrongs of carnal intercourse of fellatio.<br><br>It is my opinion that there are people in Singapore, who see themselves as the "moral majority" and/or the "guardians of Asian values" and feel that it is their god-given duty to pass judgement of whats "right" and whats "not" when it comes to all aspects of Singaporean's lives and expect everyone to conform to their standards. This group transcends all religious, ethnic and age barriers, and constantly use the twin sticks of "Morals" and the law to beat everyone into toeing that line. Geez, I've no problems with how they want to live their lives, so how come they want to butt into how everyone else lives theirs and would not hesitate to wag their fingers at anyone who doesn't conform to their "high" moral standards?<br><br>It is because of such people, that Section 378 still exists, and is still enforced, being one of the 2 sticks used by these "Moral Guardians".<br><br>No doubt what the cop did to the minor was wrong, but is it not even more ridiculous that the Section still exists and is still being enforced?</div>
