THEY never say that it is illegal to collect rainwater for simple uses like washing cars and such...<br><br>BUT they dont want people to build EXTENDSIVE systems through engineering with the aim of collecting massive amount of water to meet their own personal needs...<br><br>and who are the ones who could build such a system?? RICH RICH LANDLORDS that are ever so calculative of their money.... we people live in HDB... where got land to collect rainwater?? hang buckets outside our windows???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, the principle of the matter is Â“whether GodÂ’s Gifts from Heaven should be charged by any Authorities?Â” and not if the Â“Rich LandlordÂ” is too rich to deserve GodÂ’s Gifts from Heaven.<br><br>Who are the Â“rich landlordsÂ”?<br><br>To begin with, they are basically the Property Developers Â– Private (Far East, CDL) and Public (HDB, Capital Land, etc) - that affect the lives of the average Singaporeans who purchase these developed properties - and with the average Singaporeans ending up being the final 'Landlords' - (and doubtfully rich).<br><br>While at this early stage, there is some leeway for domestic collection of rainwater, what is there to prevent a legislaton that make such domestic collections to be illegal at a later stage? Â– as has happened so often in Singapore, the Authorities implement policies at a pace of one little step at a time, and with each step enveloping the citizens with another increment in the cost factor.<br><br>What about the few industries Â– such as Hydroponics Farms, Tropical Fisheries, Orchid Farms, Wafer Fab etc Â– that are heavily dependent on water?<br><br>Should these enterprises be prevented from collecting Â“GodÂ’s Gifts From HeavenÂ”, and allow a Utility Company to monopolize the collection and sale of GodÂ’s Gifts from Heaven?<br><br>Why prevent the supposed Â“rich landlordsÂ” from making use of their property to collect rain water; as after all, such properties have already paid a very high cost in development charges to the Authorities Â– that only add up to the cost of the development?<br><br>With the high cost of land that is artificially dictated largely by URA in its release of land sold to developers, and the high development charges that follow, it will be the Property Owners (domestic and industrial) that will finally pay for the high cost of Owning and Operating the developed property.<br><br>Any Â‘engineeringÂ’ design in an HDB or Private Condominium that help to capture Â“GodÂ’s Gifts from HeavenÂ”, can only assist in some way to lower the monthly maintenance charges that can hit our pockets.<br><br>Should we not look at the overall picture of how much rainfall actually occur in Singapore throughout the year, and determine how much water goes into the soil Â– (which belongs to the state, as no Singaporean is allowed to draw water from the soil that their home is built on, except for those few remaining attap homes with wells) Â– and how much water goes out to sea, and determine what is the remaining amount going to the drains and canals leading to the catchment areas?<br><br></div>
