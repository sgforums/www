            <div class='col-md body'>It's a simple reason on why I advocate an absolute zero-tolerance anti-racism policy- it's about not having double standards.<br><br>From young, students here were advised not to be racist to people of different races and religions and were(and are) advised to not just explore the origins of their own race and religion, but others as well.<br><br>I've had Malay, indian and pan-asian friends from primary sch, malay friends in sec sch, and now many friends in poly(not to mention pple from different countries). I grew up believing that irrespective of the different colour of the skin or the origins of my friends, we belonged to the same race: the human race.<br><br>That's why when I hear pple like this PSC scholar degrading indians and other brown skinned people into something like "sub-humans" because of their poor origins and brown skin, I get really enraged. Nothing gets me up than this kind of pple who think they are more superior because they have yellow skin as opposed to brown skin.<br><br>And now this PSC scholar is only given a slap on the wrist by the PSC board, which is basically a govt. board. That only gives an impression that the govt. itself gives lip service to the cause of anti-racism and a multi-racial society. The govt is showing itself as an absolute joke and an absolute hypocritic.<br><br>When it was time to show their strength, they failed to do so. In itself, this sort of action only serves on how much this PAP govt has lost itself in its own money-driven policies and its own greed for money.<br><br>If I was in charge, I will shoot that bastard down and I would leave his body on the ground for the vultures to feed on his body.

However, in this case, i think that it is unlikely that new legislation will be needed to revoke his scholarship. This is coz the Scholarship contract very probably has a "good conduct" clause of some sort. There might even a "catch all" clause that allows the scholarship to be terminated at the discretion of PSC, at least while the Scholar is still studying.</div>

Yes.<br>I once applied for a position in a statutory board.

We try not to employ Malays and Indians, as they are trouble-makers.'<br>That was a very sad day.<br>It's even more dangerous if educators are not stopped from making racist remarks, corrupting their students.<br>One day, my eight-year-old son, who studies in a Special Assistance Plan school, told me that his teachers said: 'Malays and Indians have kutu (Malay for lice).'<br>This is not an isolated case. We must stop this trend."<br>- Haslinda Shamsudin<br><br>"A true racist is one who despises people of another race.<br>Racist jokes are, to me, harmless. Some stereotyping is factual but retold creatively. Whether one is racist depends on one's intention.<br>If we cannot even laugh at ourselves, we risk becoming a society without a soul.

The Government has continually played on fears - fears of tension, of riots, anything reminiscent of the 1960s.<br>This makes young Singaporeans more aware of their racial differences and they become more sensitive and defensive."<br>- Ho Chi Sam<br><br>"Racism is inherent in our nature, because of the need for self-preservation.<br>The danger is only when racism in thought is carried out in a provocative, senseless and insensitive manner.<br>Such as Hitler's 'Final Solution' and the 1964 racial riots.

Sorry to disturb ah but newsflash, you sound a lot like someone I know from around 60 years back and the last time I checked that fella caused a world of hurt and tens of millions to perish, so I'd suggest you take some time to google/wiki the words "Hitler", "Jim Crow", "racism" and "Final Solution" to see how much you sound like a parrot before you make yourself the poster boy for "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"</div>

Do you seriously believe that there is not a single racist involved in the decisions that are made for the good of everyone in Singapore?

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering, if I started making racist comments online and insult all malays and indians in Sg, what do you think will happen to me? And what if my identity is known, will i get sued? Will ppl say, "On the internet there is freedom of speech, let him say whatever he wants" or "crucify him!"?<br><br>Our parents and grand parents lived thru the times of racial riots and racial segregation. Today, many from our generation takes this for granted, not seeing the problems caused by lack of tolerance and communication. Do we give freedom and encourage such anti social behaviour or should we let it be known that this cannot be tolerated in multi racial, multi cultural singapore?<br><br>There are certain things that are socially deviant (examples of some of such behaviours can be found in Bar) and there are things that are obviously anti social which strikes at the very foundation of our societal structure. Also I feel that the authorities involved is very bias due to the boy's father. If it was anyone else in this forum who got caught posting racist remarks online, I'm sure that having daddy force you to type out an apology is not going to get you off the hook.</div>
