So gross. some more non-singaporean."<br>.<br>He continued: "ya. I discovered I'm so racist. at the club (under lighting in which everyone is supposed to look good), i still find indians and filipinos (dark ones) so repulsive n such a turn-off."<br>.<br>His derogatory remarks, and more, are now freely available on the Internet.<br>.<br>Something similar happened when Choo Wee Khiang, a member of Singapore's Parliament from the dominant party, took advantage of the privilege accorded to him by the House to make disparaging remarks about the same group of ethnic minorities.<br>.<br>He told his fellow legislators in 1992: "One evening, I drove to Little India and it was pitch dark but not because there was no light, but because there were too many Indians around."<br>.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really hope people will stop saying, "Everybody is more or less a racist." Thats a very gross postulation. I feel theres safety in numbers and thats why some tend to generalize of that. Or am i so wrong that indeed the majority of Singaporeans are racists? As far as I know, you're only a racist when offensive thoughts come to mind. At most, idiocrasies of certain races are just tolerated with but not viewed with scornful contempt. Or are they? Have you crossed that line?<br><br><blockquote>even minor things like slight dislike for another race's customs and rituals can be branded as racist since racist covers that aspect as well...</blockquote>This is like having a close friend who has a habit of shaking his leg which you're annoyed at. But do you hate the friend? No, you just can't accept his action. So, it doesnt mean to be racist right?<br><br><blockquote>The key point here is how much we show it and how much tolerance we are expected to exercise despite our dislikes and misunderstandings</blockquote>*Nods..*</div>
