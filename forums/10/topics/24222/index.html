            <div class='col-md body'>i have a friend who was once involved in illegal activites once. He was once a ciminal. Three years ago he was caught selling pirated vcd. But got away as warning. Today three years later he was engaged with his financee and vow to start a new and he did. He started to take part time course whilst working and he got his certificate and now currently he is having his part time diploma course.<br><br>Good things ome to an end when a week ago, a police officier came knocking at his door saying the he will be taken to court for the vcd case which he committed three years back. He was stunned and his life was totally messed up right now. He face 2 choices now, either to pay the fine or go to jail.<br><br>As his friend i personally feel that this is totally ridculous!! The police is actually charge him only after 3 years when he had already started a new life!?!? What the fuck!! i thought the legal system is actually meant to bring people back to right path and now he is throwing my friend back to where he started!!! I am aware that the police is able to take charge of a person even after years but this is not the right way to do! During these 3 years, he wasn't involved in any illegally activities anymore and now they are charge them. So what if they can't repay the fine which is 5 digit figure! They will be jailed<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK, I AM TOTALLY PISSED OFF WITH THE SINGAPORE LEGAL SYSTEM.<br>Afterall law are meant to protected the wealthy and power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To whom it may concern,<br><br>I have read your article.<br><br>Prior to committing the criminal act (in the case, selling of pirated vcd), he had a choice - to sell (face the music) or against selling it (life goes on as before).<br><br>Once he had committed this crime, he will have to bear the consequences. Ignorant about what it leads to is no defence.<br><br>He was lucky enough to have been given a warning and been given a new start. Under the penal code,once a criminal act is committed, he can be prosecuted to court for a proceeding regardless when. There is no case (guilty as charged and convicted) There is no expiration for criminal act. 3 yrs later, he still had a choice, either pay the fine or face the jail sentence, not many prosecuted could say that they had such luck.<br><br>He could have been convicted with a minimum of few months in jail, in addition with a fine.<br><br>Blessing in disguise, in my humble opinon.<br></div>
