While it's true that singapore wants to remain competitive (God forbid that other south east asian countries should overtake singapore), there should be more balance drawn between the quality of life and the growing economy. Moreover, with a reduced quality of life, sing would become less attractive to the FTs and sing gov seems to forget that FTs are more mobile than the locals.<br><br>I guess one upside is that the locals shouldn't worry so much about increasing competition in the workforce; the higher the population, the higher the number of jobs created (provided that the gov does foresee the creation of new jobs)</div>

Click here<br>Sheralyn Tay<br>sheralyn@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>FOREIGNERS thinking of applying for Singapore Permanent Residency or citizenship will soon be able to assess their chances of success online.<br>.<br>In a move that could save potential applicants waiting time and money, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is launching a free self-assessment tool at www.ica.gov.sg on Thursday.<br>.<br>The Naturalisation Eligibility Tool allows foreigners working or living here to check their eligibility based on personal information such as type of work pass held, occupation, nationality, educational qualifications and annual income, as well as on their spouse and children's details. Those overseas can also use the system, but if they lack a work pass, their results will only be speculative.<br>.<br>The system indicates Â— using a "traffic light" approach Â— if the aspirant should go ahead with an application.<br>.<br>A red light means the user has not met the minimum criteria, and is encouraged to try again when his personal status changes. Amber means the applicant can be reassessed in a year or two, while the green light (picture) means the minimum requirements have been met.<br>.<br>The online form takes about five minutes to fill and results are given instantaneously. Ms Clara Tan, ICA's head of Naturalisation, noted that other countries Â— such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand Â— have similar systems.<br>.<br>The tool is purely preliminary, she stressed. Indication of eligibility is no guarantee for approval.<br>.<br>Currently, an applicant for Permanent Resident status has to wait at least three months for a result. An aspiring citizen has to submit the forms in person and sit for an interview, during which he or she will be told of their chances of success. To go ahead, he or she then pays a $90 processing fee, with a six-month wait for the result.<br>.<br><strong>The ICA hopes the tool will improve the approval rate. Last year the agency approved 58,200 and 13,900 applications for PR and citizenship status, respectively.</strong></blockquote>---http://www.todayonline.com/articles/171658.asp</div>

It's not that these people don't want to retire, it's just that they can't afford to, if they did, they would have a reduced quality of life or forced to move to country where they can afford to live.</div>
