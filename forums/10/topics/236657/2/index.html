As much as they have their own motivations, I do not think the "powers-that-are" are worried about the falling birth rate simply because it affects their coffers- this is a real problem that will start to stain our population in the coming future.<br><br>Today's youth will not cause a greying population issue if the idea replacement rate is achieved, at which the population will more or less settle into a steady state.

Simple, we don't have enough land. The profit minded MRT is hardly able to cope with the rush hour traffic now, not to mention 45% increase. What we see now is more and more lands being used to built playgrounds for the rich FTs.  More PAPs=bad. A dual economy will become a reality - a class of working poor locals vs a class of rich expoitative pro PAP FTs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our government seems to be overly obsessed with numbers. With the current population number, Singaporeans are already gasping for air to breathe and fighting for space. I can't really imagine a proposed additional 2 million increase in population in the next 15 years.<br><br>I do agree that aging population will pose problems in the near future being a major concern(i.e. the decrease of working force, defense force, nationwide healthcare and infrastructure etc.). By allowing the influx of foreign talents/workers into Singapore, will not solve the problem but will also create other social problems which are aleady slowly surfacing now. This is not a computer game of 'Sim City' where everything is about numbers, increase tax when no $$ so that can build more buildings to attract more people to come to work/play/study and stay, so that to collect more tax. I believe there are other ways that has been discussed in other forum topics to solve the population problem but it takes time but our government seems to prefer short-cut ways.<br><br>Hail to more horrific traffic jams. Hail for more stress and competition. Hail for even more crowded public transport. Hail for the jostling for walking space in shopping centres. Hail for longer queues for food during lunch hours. The lists shall go on....<br><br>Are Singaporeans just numbers that generate $$$ to the government? I hope the government will stop playing 'Sim Singapore'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
