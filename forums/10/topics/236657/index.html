            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Singaporeans need assurance over growing population: sociologist </strong></span><br>By Hasnita A Majid, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 09 February 2007 2333 hrs<br><br>Singapore needs to assure its people that growing the population will not result in more competition for jobs, housing and places in school.<br><br>A sociologist says that such concerns within the society will have to be addressed by the government, so that tension does not arise in the community.<br><br>Within the next 40 to 50 years, Singapore plans to increase the number of people here to 6.5 million.<br><br>And that announcement has already received mixed reactions from the public.<br><br>"Our country is so small and I think 4.5 is just nice for everybody, you add in another 2.5 million...look at the MRT nowadays. At 6 o'clock, it's already jammed up. I think you're going to have a lot of social problems, a lot of people are going to be very unhappy," said one Singaporean.<br><br>"May not have enough of space unless you develop more reclaimed areas," said another.<br><br>"I'm slightly worried, but in the future if we want anything we will have to work for it."<br><br>"I think its not too healthy to have such a large population. Perhaps we should have quality population."<br><br>Such concerns should be addressed, says one sociologist, otherwise they will build up to become tensions within the society.<br><br>Associate Professor Pauline Straughn, Sociologist, NUS, said: "We should then therefore look towards this positively but be mindful that it has to be treated with great sensitivity. You want to assure Singaporeans that they are not going to be displaced or replaced, rather this would complement their quality of life and this will work towards ensuring a more stable Singapore. We have to be mindful that you have to keep in dialogue with Singaporeans, continue to engage them."<br><br>Professor Straughn says that even as the government grows the population and embarks on urban planning for the future, it must be mindful that the hardware must be complemented by the software, especially when it comes to caring for the elderly population.<br><br>Professor Straughn says: "As we progress, these changes must be sympathetic to older Singaporeans who may not be able to change as quickly. When we start to build high-rise, how do older Singaporeans adapt to it? It's not a matter of leaving an old home and going to a nice new one, but it's also a displacement of friendships, community ties, of familiarity.";<br><br>Professor Straughn adds that it's also important that as Singapore attracts more foreigners here, it should also take measures to retain its citizens.<br><br>Professor Straughn said: "I think that it's also important that we look at quality of life, from other aspects like what could make somebody choose Singapore as home and stay as home. We have to ensure that to sustain the growth in Singapore, to sustain good harmonious relations within our country, within our society, we also look into nurturing relationships, into quality of life.<br><br>In terms of housing for the future, property analysts expect Singapore's landscape to change with more taller buildings to make up for the lack of land, as well as changes in flat size.<br><br>Chris Koh, Director, Dennis Wee Properties, said: "In the area of housing, not so tight control of height restrictions and we see apartments going higher. Now you have 2 apartment per level but to house a bigger population, you'll probably be down to 3 apartments on that level so therefore I will admit that the apartment may be smaller."<br><br>The government has said it will also look into rejuvenating old estates to create more space for public housing. - CNA/ch<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>with escalating costs &amp; making living such a difficult thing to do, I wonder how the gahmen is planning to bring in the additional 2.5 million.  Already, we tokking about the greying population which in 10 - 30 yrs time, will either pass away or grow older.  And with ppl nowadays being reluctant to reproduce, the only way is to bring in foreign imports.<br><br>So, thanks har, more jobs for foreigners and more competition for locals.  So now instead of the fine &amp; beautiful city that we have wanted to call home, we are facing prospect of overcrowding, intense competition for jobs, security, homes.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Can someone tell this conman to make good his Sengkang and Punggol empty promises before embarking on another grand lie?<br><br>======<br><br>Feb 10, 2007<br>'Housing in a park' likely for estates of tomorrow<br>By Tan Hui Yee, Housing Correspondent<br><br>'URBAN REGENERATION': Future HDB blocks will have more greenery within estates which could possibly include gardens at mid-levels of high-rise blocks.<br><br>THE Housing Board (HDB) yesterday opened a vista into its estates of tomorrow - with seamlessly integrated shops and transport networks, and more.<br>A possible theme is 'housing in a park', as the HDB embarks on its makeover of older housing estates on a scale bigger than the upgrading programmes so far.<br><br>The 'next generation' housing blocks that will emerge will have water- and electricity-saving features. Already, one idea - the sky garden - can be seen at the upcoming 50-storey apartment buildings in Duxton Plain.<br><br>National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan unveiled the make- over at the Urban Redevelopment Authority's annual Corporate Plan Seminar yesterday.<br><br>He was outlining the mid-term review of the Concept Plan, the country's land use and transportation plan.<br><br>The HDB, he said, is exploring the park concept, which will increase the greenery within estates.<br><br>This will incorporate plants in podium blocks with carparks, and possibly gardens even at the mid-levels of high-rise blocks - so residents can socialise with neighbours.<br><br>He told reporters: 'It's not just gardens. It is also revamping the way HDB estates are built to make them more energy-efficient, to give them more efficient usage of, say, water resources, providing more facilities for recycling, and so on.<br><br>'It's a whole package of measures which will help transform the HDB estates of the next generation.'<br><br>This comprehensive redesign comes more than 10 years after upgrading programmes were first launched to make sure that old estates keep up with new ones. Under various schemes, the interior of flats were overhauled, precinct facilities like pavilions and jogging paths were added, and block facades spruced up.<br><br>The HDB's priority of late has been providing older blocks with lifts that stop on every floor to make them more accessible to the elderly and disabled.<br><br>Now, with these new types of HDB flats, residents can look forward to centralised chutes for recyclables, and entire precincts designed to accommodate people of all ages in different physical conditions.<br><br>The HDB also wants to see if it can allow residents to decide on communal facilities in their precincts and provide more communal spaces.<br><br>This would complement the new civic spaces around Singapore, like an area at Dhoby Ghaut now being designed by award-winning architect Chan Soo Khian. This space, URA chairman Alan Chan said yesterday, would be ready in two years.<br><br>Mr Mah, speaking to reporters yesterday, said that he expects work on 'urban regeneration' in HDB estates to start in about three to five years' time, in estates that are about 30 years or older.<br><br>The work would likely be done through the Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers) - where old blocks make way for new flats nearby - or other similar programmes.<br><br>New flats would also be built in some areas where land has already been cleared.<br><br>Havelock Road resident Chan Guan Poh, 67, was excited <strong>(What so excited about?...he may not be able to see it...why so happy? fark him)</strong> when told about the plans.<br>The retiree, who socialises with neighbours at the neighbourhood coffee shop, told The Straits Times: 'The sky garden would be one more place to go for leisure [color=red]<strong>(He should say..... one more place nearer to heaven or hell)</strong></span>.<br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>Mr Mah said the Government would not open up new estates for now as there is 'more than sufficient land' set aside for housing. </strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">He also announced that Jurong East and Paya Lebar will be developed as business hubs following the trail blazed by the Tampines Regional Centre.<br><br>Tampines, since 1991, has blossomed into a key commercial node. Banks and major retailers have set up shop there, and the malls are packed on weekends.<br><br>Jurong was chosen to inject more jobs in the west, while Paya Lebar will serve as a sub-regional centre to cater to residents in the area between Tampines and the city centre.<br><br>Mr Nicholas Mak, director of research and consultancy at property marketing company Knight Frank, said Jurong could house more headquarters of manufacturing companies, while Paya Lebar had the potential to attract small and medium-sized enterprises as the area is close to many small factories. </span>[/color]<br><br>On one hand he said we have scare land.... on the other hand.<br>This freaking guy Mr Mah said the Government would not open up new estates for now as there is 'more than sufficient land' set aside for housing.<br><br>Just see how pap play with our $$$ and feeling!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>This freaking minister had <strong>NEVER </strong>given thought of waste food were allowed to dispose into the refuse chute where loads of rats and C ockroaches are multiplying like heaven.<br>Those people living at 1st sty or lower floors will experience with tonnes of rats and C ockroaches crawling out at night for food. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>What kind of fark an educational programmes were put up to tell people to bag their waste food?......wouldn't it will be bitten by rats and there come C ockroaches and ants crawling all over the places.<br></div>

The next confirmed project after the Circle Line is finished is the Downtown Line, which will run for 40km underground and have 33 stations.<br><br>It will link Marina Bay to housing estates at two ends of Singapore. A north-western branch will join Bukit Timah, Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang, while the eastern branch will go to MacPherson, Bedok Reservoir and Tampines.<br><br>The Transport Ministry had also previously mentioned that a future line linking northern towns like Woodlands, Punggol, Seletar and Pasir Ris was also being considered.<br><br></div>
