              <p>He think SG WAS not ready for PM. that was twenty years ago. From my limited understanding of the circumstances of that time, Singapore WAS not ready for indian PM. But now, the year 2009, i am sure that singapore is ready for indian PM.</p>

              DURING that time, anyone can visualize tony tan become PM.ASK your parents will they be surprise if tony tan became PM. That is call SINGAPORE IS READY FOR TONY TAN. and he happens to be a baba.
              
              president, can. MP, can. PM cannot. OBVIOUS OBVIOUS OBVIOUS, that is what LKY said.
              
              Why don't you find out about the circumstance of that period of time, make an argument that SINGAPORE WAS READY FOR INDIAN PM.

              <p>why cannot exclude? was being a baba a major plot in the story of his book? never read his book, so not sure if including the book will make it more interesting or not. why don't you tell me how it is odd.</p>
              <p>not sure, you go find out loh. not sure you straight away assume LKY wrong ah? READ his WHOLE statement on why he feel that way. ASK him to explain why.</p>
