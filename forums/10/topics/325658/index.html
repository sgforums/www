              <p>What was CSC's, Chee Siok Chin,</p>
              <p>game plan in application to OA for travelling to Stanford?</p>
              <p>Why did she apply so late on <span style="color: #ff0000;">17 June</span>,3 months after the scheduled</p>
              <p>notification of decision  <strong><em>''no later than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">first week of March''</span></em></strong>?</p>
              <p>What is the game plan of CSC in the application for attending</p>
              <p>Stanford</p>
              <h1>Summer Fellows on Democracy and Development?</h1>
              <p>I found the incident is fishy on the timing of postings</p>
              <p>and the dates of events and letters.</p>

              <p>She posted 3 postings dated July 23,25 and 28.</p>

              <p>?Did she pretend not aware of the honorarium</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FACTS</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.Screen 1</strong></span></p>
              <p>In a posting dated <span style="color: #ff0000;">23 July Wed</span>,CSC said he appealed to Minister</p>
              <p>of Laws after OA refused her application to Stanford Summer Fellows</p>
              <p>on Democracy and Development,which will be held</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">July 28 - August 15</span>.A invitaion letter from Stanford was posted there.</p>
              <p>This invitation letter shall be not later than first week of March,acording</p>
              <p>to the Stanford Summer Fellows web.</p>
              <p>http://cddrl.stanford.edu/fellowships/summerfellows</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Application decisions will be available no later than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">first week of March</span>, 2008.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">(PS__She applied on 17 June!!)</span></p>
              <p>In this posting,CSC just complained OA refusal based on</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>But now the OA says that "none of these travels have translated into a
                      benefit to your creditors" and rejected her application to go to
                      Standford.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Then she posted the followings to indicate further the refusal  based</p>
              <p>on no monetary benefits on her creditor,ie Singapore governments .</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The Ministry responded thus: "We regret to inform you that the decision
                      to reject your travel application remains. The OA is not persuaded that
                      your attendance at the fellowship program in Stanford University would
                      result is any substantial additional benefit to your creditors."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>According to her 2nd posting,the reply from OA on her 2nd appeal</p>
              <p>was dated 11 July 2008.Pl take note on this date.see C below for link.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So,in this posting dated 23 July,CSC gave impression that she did not aware the</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">honorarium of US$2,000 that Stanford Summer Fellows would give</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">her for a lectuer and OA refusal based on no monetary benefits to</span></p>
              <p>creditor<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></p>
              <p>I think she wanted to impress reader that if she can prove her Stanford</p>
              <p>travel could give monetary benefits to creditor,OA shall allow her</p>
              <p>application.If OA further refuse her application upon her proof</p>
              <p>of monetary benefits,she can darken name of SG one more</p>
              <p>time.</p>
              <p>http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1-singapore/690-govt-bans-chee-siok-chins-from-attending-leadership-program-at-stanford</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.Screen 2</strong></span></p>
              <p>True enough.Stanford offered honorarium of US$2,000 for her to</p>
              <p>give a lectuer in the Summer Fellows.OA still refused her application</p>
              <p>despite this US$2,000 bait which CSC said would pay to SG governemnt.</p>
              <p>No hurry.I will say my stand on her application.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But i will like draw your attention on the date of offer of this US$2,000</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">honorariu</span>m.U can read from link B below that the offer of</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">honorariu</span>m was dated<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>22 July !!</strong></span></p>
              <p>This proved that when CSC posted her 23 July posting ,in link B,</p>
              <p>she already known the offer of honorarium!!<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">But she pretended not aware</span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">of the offer.What is her purposes on doing this?<br></span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong><strong>Dates of events and letters</strong></span></p>
              <p>Stanford shall give decision '' no later than the first week of March, 2008.''</p>
              <p>When did CSC apply for travel and did OA give reply?</p>
              <p>It seems from link B that Minister of Laws gave his reply on 11 July</p>
              <p>and then Stanford's offer of  <span style="color: #ff0000;">honorarium</span> came on 22 July.</p>
              <p>CSC posted first posting on 23 July,pretending <span style="color: #ff0000;">not a</span>ware of</p>
              <p>the offer of honorarium.Then,in her 25 July posting,</p>
              <p>she pretended she just know the new</p>
              <p>offer and that honorarium shall make</p>
              <p>SG gavamna allow her travel.</p>

              <p>She alreday travelled few times after declared bankcrupt.</p>
              <p>US$2,000 is just money not enough!!Is there any banker's gurantee</p>
              <p>for this 2 grains?What if she dunt pay after the trip,saying</p>
              <p>i alreday buying books on democracy and freedom of expressions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.Will her attendance help SG?</strong></span></p>
              <p>The purposes of the workshop</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>who will play important roles in their country's political, economic,
                      and social development. We anticipate recruiting a group of 25-30
                      individuals dedicated to democracy, development and rule of law
                      promotion within their home countries</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Do u think she fit the bill?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4.Stanfor's letter is very stupid </strong></span></p>
              <p>It talked about CSC's freedom and said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>the opportunity to enhance her knowledge and skills in ways that will
                      <span style="color: #ff0000;">benefit </span>Singapore and also improve her professional capacity, including
                      her ability to earn income in the future.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>OPPOSITION politician Chee Siok Chin has been stopped from
                  attending a Stanford University programme in the United States, as she
                  is an undischarged bankrupt.</p>
              <p>The Official Assignee's office, which must give permission
                  before a bankrupt can leave the country, has turned down her request as
                  the programme was deemed to be of no benefit to her creditors.</p>
              <p>The decision sparked multiple appeals from the 42-year-old and even a letter from Stanford to Law Minister K. Shanmugam.</p>
              <p>The Official Assignee's office is sticking to its stand.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee applied and was accepted into the Summer fellows
                  Program at Stanford University's Center on Democracy, Development, and
                  Rule of Law. It runs from July 28 to Aug 15 at the school's campus in
                  California.</p>
              <p> According to information put up on the Singapore Democratic Party
                  website, she was one of 27 people accepted into the annual programme.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee subsequently asked for permission to leave the country to attend the course, as bankrupts are required to do.</p>
              <p>The SDP committee member and sister of party chief Chee Soon
                  Juan was made bankrupt last year after failing to continue paying costs
                  incurred in a 2005 case that was thrown out by the High Court.</p>
              <p>She and three others had staged a protest outside the CPF
                  Building in Robinson Road in August 2005, wearing white T-shirts
                  emblazoned with the names of national institutions. Police dispersed
                  them for being a 'public nuisance'.</p>
              <p>Three of them including Ms Chee then initiated proceedings
                  against the Home Affairs Minister and Police Commissioner in the High
                  Court, asking it to declare the police action 'unconstitutional'.</p>
              <p>The case was thrown out and three ordered to pay costs amounting to around $23,700.</p>
              <p>She told The Straits Times on Friday that her request to leave the country was turned down early last month.</p>

              <p>Of course.</p>
              <p>No one should expect the opponent to give away victory.</p>
              <p>PAP, and any one of the opposition, WP, SDA, RP, and even the SDP will not make it easy for an opponent to "win". Anyone that does so, is not magnanimous, but stupid.</p>

              <td class="georgia11 padcell8" colspan="2">  I REFER to last Saturday's article, ''No' to Stanford trip for Chee's
              sister'. It contains a number of serious errors. It is regrettable that
              The Straits Times did not seek to verify the facts with us, unlike
              Lianhe Zaobao which did verify, and therefore published a more accurate
              article.
              <p>Ms Chee Siok Chin applied to the Official Assignee (OA) on June
              17 for permission to travel to Stanford University in the United States
              from July 26 to Aug 20. She met officers of our department on July 3.
              At the meeting, as is the general practice, our officers asked her
              about her previous travels and requested to inspect her passport, since
              she needed permission of the OA to travel.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> She refused to give her
              passport for verification. She was also asked how she would be paying
              for her trip. It was important to establish this. But she refused to
              answer. Our officers also asked her to verify information she had given
              previously in her income and expenditure statements. She again refused
              to answer. Ms Chee was under a legal duty to cooperate but quite
              cynically refused to do so. Thus her application to travel was
              rejected. </span></p>
              <p>Ms Chee owes a total of more than $59,000 to two creditors -
              Maybank ($15,896.44) and the Attorney-General ($43,364.17). To date,
              she has paid only $550.</p>
              <p>The ST report states that Ms Chee would be given an
              honorarium for a public speech while attending her course at Stanford
              University. She did not mention this to the OA's office during the
              interview on July 3. It surfaced only after her application was
              rejected. By then, she had clearly demonstrated her unwillingness to
              cooperate.</p>
              <p>We have checked and would like to clarify that the Minister
              for Law did not receive any letter from Stanford University, contrary
              to what was reported.</p>

              <p>Read the comments all over the internet. Those who believe SDP will believe them even if they talk nonsense. Those who believe PAP will also believe their words even if it's nonsense. Same goes to the Lee v Chee trial. When it comes to who's telling the truth, it's a no win for either side. But neutrals will vote PAP based on their merits.</p>
              <p>In years to come SDP will need alot more 'blind' loyalists than PAP has right now or it will forever be stuck because SDP cannot win over the neutrals.</p>

              <p>4.Stanford's offer of  <span style="color: #ff0000;">honorarium</span> was dated 22 July.</p>
              <p>Pl read my above posting.</p>
              <p>4.CSC posted 3 postings dated July 23,25 and 28.</p>
              <p>On 23 July posting,she pretended that she did not know the</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5.11 August hearing</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chee version:</span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>The hearing was initially fixed on 11 Aug 08. However, Judge Tan told
              Mr Chia Ti Lik, who was arguing for Ms Chee that the papers were not
              properly served on the Attorney General and that the wording of the OS
              lacked clarity.<br> <br> The Judge then set another date for the hearing to be reconvened -- a full three weeks later on 1 Sep 08.</blockquote>
              <p>In CSC words,Judge is always wrong.The seminar is scheduled end on 15 Aug.</p>
              <p>In fact,the 11 Aug hearing was purely academic also!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STimes version</span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>A hearing took place on Aug 11, but proceedings were adjourned at Ms
              Chee's request as she had just engaged Mr Chia as her lawyer and he
              needed more time to prepare for the case.</blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.Why did Judge refuse to review</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chees version</span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>When the hearing resumed on 1 Sep, Judge Tan said that it was purely an
              "academic" exercise for him to rule on Ms Chee's application because
              the fellowship period was over. He thus dismissed the OS.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>STimes version</strong></span></p>
              <p>Besides few other factors,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>On Monday, Mr Chia also complained that Ms Chee was not given the right
              to reply as the court had previously rejected documents he wanted to
              file. But he <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">admitted that this was because he had filed them </span></span></em></strong>after the
              Aug 18 deadline that had been set.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The Court see no new document and rejected the Review.</p>

              <p>I have 2 issues:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A&gt;Earliest date of application for travel and when did she apply within</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">permitted time frame</span></strong></p>
              <p>1.I remember the earliest date for application for travel to OA</p>
              <p>is 2 months before the travel.From my above posting,the earliest</p>
              <p>date is 24 May.It was useless for her to apply on 28 April.</p>
              <p>Did she want OA grant ger some favours or fears?</p>
              <p>2.CSC applied on <span style="color: #ff0000;">17 June to OA for
                                              travel</span>,according to</p>
