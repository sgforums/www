AIS is now holding bill collections, pending a clear decision by the Administrative Court on the unresolved access-charge dispute.<br><br>DTAC and True Move sued TOT Plc after the state telecom enterprise threatened to ban their three million new numbers from using its fixed-line network. TOT said the move was in response to the unilateral decisions by both companies to stop paying access charges since Nov 17.<br><br>Mr Wichian also said that AIS had prepared several courses of action to cope with the eventual outcomes of the crises it currently faced, whether they were concession amendments or findings about the nominee status of some of the Temasek-backed investors in Shin.<br><br>He declined to give details but said that if the company's contract amendments were found to have breached the law, all three major mobile operators would be in the same boat.<br><br>In any case, he said AIS would have an advantage as it still had another four years on its concession. By comparison, DTAC would have lost its right since last year and True Move would have had nothing.<br><br>Somchai Lertsutiwong, vice-president for the wireless service arm of AIS, meanwhile, said the company was broadening its mobile Internet market this year, in particular handsets with the Symbian operating system.<br><br>The company plans to spend one billion baht expanding its Edge network nationwide this year, with the aim of increasing the number of wireless data users.<br><br>''The move is aimed at increasing our value-added service revenues, including non-voice service, by 20% to 14.4 billion baht this year, up from 12 billion in 2006 and seven billion baht in 2005,'' he said.<br><br>Mr Somchai said AIS had seven million customers using Symbian phones plus two million subscribers with Edge-capable handsets. Its active GPRS users number four million.<br><br>To promote the Edge service, AIS yesterday introduced a package, enabling customers to purchase the E620 3G/Edge/GPRS data card at 7,900 baht, and receiving a new SIM card and 50 free hours of Edge service hours per month for six months.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/09Mar2007_biz43.php" rel="nofollow"> Shin CEO Boonklee calls it quits</a><br>KOMSAN TORTERMVASANA<br><br>Boonklee Plangsiri has tendered his resignation as executive chairman and chief executive of the embattled telecom giant Shin Corporation Plc. Sources said Mr Boonklee, 52, had submitted his resignation letter to the Shin board. It would be effective at the end of the month.<br><br>The computer engineer joined Shin in 1993, and has long been associated with Shin founder Thaksin Shinawatra.<br><br>But Mr Boonklee's future at the company he helped build has been in question ever since the Shinawatra family sold off its 49% shareholding in Shin to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in January 2006.<br><br>The departure is expected to be the start of a broad restructuring by Temasek of the Shin Group. Temasek, which has come under heavy pressure from the government over the possible illegal use of nominee shareholders in its takeover of Shin, plans to eventually rename the entire group and reduce its shareholdings in Shin Satellite and other group subsidiaries.<br><br>Wichien Mektrakarn, the president of Shin flagship Advanced Info Service, said he had no confirmation of Mr Boonklee's resignation.<br><br>''If it's true, then it certainly will affect staff sentiment across the group. Mr Boonklee has long been an inspiration and a role model for everyone here,'' he said.<br><br>AIS executive chairman Somprasong Boonyachai also denied knowledge of Mr Boonklee's resignation, saying only that any decision would likely be submitted to Shin chairman Pong Sarasin.<br><br>Shin shares closed unchanged yesterday on the SET at 24.60 baht, in thin trade worth 628,000 baht.<br><br></div>

However, it has not yet addressed the question of whether it breached Thai law by allegedly relying on nominees to take over Shin Corp.<br><br>A fund manager said Temasek might want to complete the share sale in November, before a court verdict on whether to revoke the licences of Shin Corp subsidiaries due to Temasek's alleged violation of foreign ownership law.<br><br>But other analysts believe Temasek might find it very difficult to find potential buyers.<br><br>"Temasek is looking for potential buyers but it may not be able to conclude the deal by November because it involves lots of money," said an analyst.<br><br>He said only a handful of Thai companies such as Siam Cement, Charoen Pokphand (CP) and Thai Beverage Plc have enough cash to acquire the Shin Corp stake.<br><br>However, Thai Beverage is unlikely to buy Shin Corp shares because its chairman Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi is reluctant to get involved in political issues. CP is also unlikely to spend a huge amount of money on such a move, said the source.<br><br>Now, the focus is on Siam Cement and Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), both partially owned by the Crown Property Bureau. But the source quoted a senior official at Government House as saying Siam Cement or Siam Commercial Bank's buying into Shin Corp "could never happen".<br><br>SCB has an indirect interest in Shin Corp, but Khunying Jada Wattanasiritham, the bank's president and CEO, said "there's no reason for SCB to buy more Shin Corp shares".<br><br>Korn Chatikavanij, deputy secretary-general of the Democrat Party, also discounted the possibility of Temasek finding any Thai buyer for its Shin Corp stake in the near future.<br><br>"Who would want to step in now? There are several contentious legal problems surrounding Shin Corp. Not to mention the case against Shin Corp at the Administrative Court," he said.<br><br>Temasek bought 49 per cent of Shin Corp from the Shinawatra and Damapong families in January this year. In a subsequent public tender for the remaining shares Temasek, through Cedar Holdings and Aspen Holdings, snapped up almost everything and ended up controlling 96 per cent of the Thai company, leaving just 4 per cent as a free float.<br><br>Temasek's senior managing director Jimmy Phoon said in a statement on Monday the share reduction plan was part of his company's original intention, to maintain Shin Corp's listing status on the Thai stock market following Temasek's public tender offer in March. But he did not say how many shares it planned to sell to keep the stocks liquid in the market.<br><br>Seamico Securities Plc said the sale was inevitable. It predicted Temasek might have to sell 51 per cent to reduce the risk from the nominee controversy.<br><br>An analyst from Asia Credit Securities said Phoon's announcement was good news. "It should promote the free float of Shin Corp shares on the market and reduce foreign investors' worries on the future operation of Shin Corp," he said.<br><br>Local telecom operator Advanced Info Service (AIS) has 48.3 per cent of its shares held by foreigners. If foreign shareholders in Shin Corp are included, the foreign stake in AIS would be 91.1 per cent, much higher than the legal limit of 49 per cent.<br><br>"If Temasek wants to reduce Shin's foreign shareholders to 49 per cent, it has to sell around 1.547 billion shares," the analyst said.<br><br>"Now we have to see if Temasek sells the shares to institutional investors or to retail investors. And what will the conditions be for the sale," he queried.<br><br>Meanwhile Karun Kittisataporn, permanent secretary of the Commerce Ministry, said in spite of Temasek's intention to sell its stake, the ministry will continue with its legal action to follow up the Business Development Department's investigation on whether Kularb Kaew is a nominee of Temasek.<br><br>"It was a separate issue. The ministry will proceed with the case," he said.<br><br>Last month, the ministry concluded its investigation, finding that Kularb Kaew was a nominee of Temasek Holdings. The case was handed over to Tung-Mahamek police station. In the primary investigation, the department found it likely Kularb Kaew was in breach of the kingdom's Foreign Business Act.<br><br>Siriporn Chanjindamanee<br><br>Petchanet Pratruangkrai<br><br>The Nation<br></div>

But the problem is, who is going to be buyer? "I have heard that Temasek really wants to sell off its stake," said an analyst. "But there is no buyer now in the market. Who really wants to put himself into trouble because of all the legal problems?"<br><br>In its statement circulated to the Thai media on Monday, Temasek said it was willing to reduce its shareholding in Shin Corp at the appropriate time and in an appropriate manner in order to ensure an orderly market.<br><br>However, it did not address the key question as to whether it had relied on nominees to circumvent Thailand's foreign ownership law in its acquisition of Shin.<br><br>Temasek's exposure in Shin turned into a giant mistake following the ousting of Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister in last month's military coup. There is growing pressure for Temasek to comply with Thai law by reducing its stake to below 50 per cent. It now holds about 96 per cent in Shin Corp from its acquisition of a 49-per-cent stake from the Shinawatra/Damapong families and from a public tender offer.<br><br>If the Singaporean state-investment arm were to reduce its stake to 49 per cent, it would realise a steep loss. The deal has been considered an almost purely political one and a unique share sale. The Shinawatra/Damapong families sold off Shin at a high premium.<br><br>Its subsidiary, Advance Info Service, Thailand's No-1 mobile-phone operator, was a cash cow at its peak. But to be competitive in an industry in which the trend is moving toward 3G (third generation) technology, it would have cost the Shinawatra family a huge amount of money to invest further.<br><br>But unlike other deals, the buyer was a state enterprise of Singapore while the seller was the family of Thailand's then-prime minister. If the deal had been conducted by others, the story would have been less scrutinised or less political.<br><br>Over the past several months, despite rising criticism on the deal - particularly on the nominee issue - Temasek kept silent, hoping that after the general election earlier set for October 15, Thaksin would have won and made a political comeback. Then Temasek could have muddled through the criticism.<br><br>However, the bloodless September 19 coup has totally changed the political landscape, and the Shin deal has featured prominently in public debate again.<br><br>Earlier, the Supreme Administrative Court ordered its lower court to take up the Shin case filed by Rangsit University law lecturer Sattra Toa-on. He alleges that relevant state agencies - including the Information and Communications Technology Ministry, TOT Plc, the Prime Minister's Office and the Transport Ministry - had been guilty of malfeasance in not revoking Shin concessions after the company was sold to Temasek in January. In his filing, iTV, Shin Satellite and Advance Info Service are considered national assets, which should not be sold to foreigners.<br><br>Another factor that triggered Temasek to ponder a retreat is the Commerce Ministry's probe into Kularb Kaew Co as to whether it is a nominee of the Singaporean company. The case has now been passed to the police for further investigation.<br><br>Temasek now realises that if it prolongs the controversy, it might face further damage from the investigation.<br><br>There have been several protests against the deal and the exposure of the Singaporean government's investment arm in Thailand. Therefore, Temasek earlier expressed to Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont its willingness to come to an amicable settlement of the deal. The Thai side reportedly would like Temasek to reduce its stake in Shin to below 50 per cent.<br><br>If Temasek were to sell off its Shin group shares, it would face a loss of about Bt21.83 billion as it would be forced to sell at a much lower price than their acquisition cost. Shin Corp shares closed yesterday at Bt34.75 - a Bt14.50 loss compared its public tender offer of Bt49.25 per share.<br><br>Temasek has apparently learned its lesson about the Shin deal the hard way. Its officials were reportedly upset about the deal, feeling that they had been tricked into the takeover.<br><br>Beyond the tangible damage, the consequences of Temasek's retreat in Thailand may spill over unpredictably into similar deals done by Temasek in other Asian countries which might come under scrutiny for its business practices.<br><br>In the final analysis, this controversial deal will finally lead the Thai authorities to deal with a clearer legal framework on the nominee issue.<br><br>Jiwamol Kanoksilp<br><br>The Nation<br></div>
