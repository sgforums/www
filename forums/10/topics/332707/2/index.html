              <p>Are singaporeans too selfish and self centred that they never spare a thought for others? Are are they really ignorant of wat is happening in our country? The people in control are taking us people as idiots and fools by giving us stupid and lame excuses for all their price hike and stuffs like that, but no one really dares to have any action against them? We really need all those elites who are highly educated to help us fight against them as they will have the knowledge and speech power to argue with them...but sad to say...all these elites might be too busy making good money to buy BMWs and Condos...too busy to care about other poor people who are having difficulties making a living...getting a meal...those old people collecting cans...beggars... Wat have all the years of education done to people? only just to make money and care for oneself?</p>

              <p>although tw democracy is not yet perfect,</p>

              <p>would there be people to check and question Ah Biah who is above
              all?</p>
              <p>channel 8 show asked a TW political commentator and he said tw
              president is given too much power. Many top ranking officials are
              assigned by him and these blokes feel that they owe their happiness
              and wealth to him and thus, what do you happened?</p>
              <p>Absolute power corrupts Absolutely , that is a well-known
              phrase. but is people convinced or understand this sentence?</p>
              <p>With freedom to question, bad people can be indicted.</p>
              <p>Without freedom to question , you can go to the zoo and visit
              your kangaroos.</p>

              <p>What you guys are talking about is not new at all.  </p>
              <p>Presidential systems have been observed to fail utterly resulting in totalitarian regimes. The President becomes an absolute dictator.</p>
              <p>Similarly, Blair was also criticised to have exercised too much absolute power as Prime Minister. There is nothing new at all.</p>
              <p>Democracy is but just something to keep the proletariat content while people in power exercised and enjoyed its benefits. </p>

              <p>my 17 year old cousin told me, since the world is all bushit, why have moral education and ask people to obey the law and be honest when real top guys with power are most probably not clean and not honest because of selfish motives, where self comes 1st ? He thinks that maybe when people behave , the rich and powerful can control them and make them think that being honest is the right thing to do and to teach their own children the same so that there will be an endless supply of honest people to work for the boss who is not honest.</p>
              <p>I told him, i have no idea.</p>
              <p>I also wonder what tricks of life does the filthy rich teach their children. What kinds of values they must teach them so that they can also become bosses ?</p>
