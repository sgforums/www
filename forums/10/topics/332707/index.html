              <p>It is your country.</p>
              <p>If you have to depend on some elite to speak up, you have to wait long long.</p>
              <p>The elites here are approving the price hike cos they are the shareholder of the all price increase company.</p>
              <p>So, do you wonder why the elite never speak up ?</p>
              <p>The only concern for the people living here is about petty issues like not being graceful enough to return their tray after they finished their food.</p>
              <p>This is what the national media and the people in power care about.</p>

              <p>This is a problem in every country.</p>
              <p>Look around you. No country is perfect. Singapore included. <br>What matters is our resolve to change things and not be mindless sheep. Partake in your local community, make a difference, help your fellow Singaporean.<br><br>I have many gripes about Singapore as well, and much of what my fellow Singaporeans do upset and dismay me. But this is a result of a change which happened so quickly, the landscape changed from kampung to skyscraper, but the 3rd world mentality lingered. <br>This is our greatest challenge yet, but change needs time. <br><br>Its easy to break down kampungs and build glittering malls. But its not easy to change decades old of old generation mindsets and practices. But with every generation, we'll work hard to change it. <br>If not, well, then it will be as time is to every civilisation and nation who fail to evolve. We'll become extinct. Simple as that.</p>

              <p>Are singaporeans too selfish and self centred that they never spare a thought for others? Are are they really ignorant of wat is happening in our country? The people in control are taking us people as idiots and fools by giving us stupid and lame excuses for all their price hike and stuffs like that, but no one really dares to have any action against them? We really need all those elites who are highly educated to help us fight against them as they will have the knowledge and speech power to argue with them...but sad to say...all these elites might be too busy making good money to buy BMWs and Condos...too busy to care about other poor people who are having difficulties making a living...getting a meal...those old people collecting cans...beggars... Wat have all the years of education done to people? only just to make money and care for oneself?</p>
