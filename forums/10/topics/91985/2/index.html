            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe: Nice refute. And I am glad there is no names calling this time.<br><br>First, I do not claim Singapore to be perfect either (and is in fact far from it). But I just like to tear down any perfect picture of U.S.. People like to describe it as paradise and I hate that. It has it's share of it's problem.<br><br>So, that means I will not counter everything statement you made because a number of the criticism about Singapore are true and you did not challenge my every statements (i.e. Singapore and U.S. are both bad but in different ways).<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Here are just some additional points to back some conclusions you doubt.<br><br>*Turn-up rate of U.S. - Source - quote from source below: "The voter turn-out rate stood at 69.3 percent in 1964, declining to 61.3 percent in 1992, and hit a record low of 54.2 percent four years later." Note that last figure - 54.2% turn-up rate in 1998.<br><br><a href="http://www.ncpa.org/pd/govern/aug98g.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncpa.org/pd/govern/aug98g.html</a><br><br>Again, Singapore is not better. But, U.S. isn't that great as some may think. Just look at the voter's turn up rate. Noted that information is slightly old but I don't want to spend too much time on this.<br><br>*Tax - Singapore tax is much lower for the average person due to it having alot more brackets. U.S. tax starts with 16% and jumps to 26% almost immediately. U.S. medical benefit sounds good officially, but when you do not get the chance to see the doctor . . . . . . . . . . . (Comments from a U.S. Friend actually)<br><br>*Medical - can't find the paper now. But this has been much talked about by my colleagues in U.S. during any conversation on health care. If you have worked in U.S. before, you know how important health insurance is.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Anyway, as long as the message that U.S. is not as perfect as some may like to think is received, I am fine with that. I will not argue with you whether U.S. or Singapore is better here with you. That, by itself, is a very huge topic and I do not want to be thread-jacking.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The US is by no means perfect. Fundamental flaws exisit in their society such as lack of gun control, no universal access to medicare, a large population of poor and disenfranchised. Sure there is lobbying and representation by interest groups -- but frequently there are still two sides lobbying every major issue.<br><br>The one thing the U.S. has going for it is patriotism. Rich or poor, black or white, educated or ignorant -- almost every American believes his/her country is the greatest country on earth, and is prepared to defend America and its interests to the death if required. Every American truly believes that if someone really wants to make something of themselves that that can and will be achieved. Every American knows that you can fight city hall if your case is just, and generally believes that justice will be served when called upon -- and if it isn't it will the second time or the third time. Patriotism isn't just born in you -- it's instilled and when it's as instilled as it is in Americans its because there is a good reason.<br><br>Almost none of that is true in many parts of the world, and little of that is true in Singapore where you can never be sure of justice if it isn't in the government's interest. So before you slag the US, take a look around you. Imperfect as America is, if you have the deep conviction that you are as prepared to defend your country and beliefs as almost every American is -- then you can walk the walk without just talking the talk.</div>
