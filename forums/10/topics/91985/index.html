They are increasingly turning to America to emulate its freedoms, and rights to participate in all aspect of governance. The basic rights of citizens being upheld to the highest pinnacle of constitutional laws allow spirits to soar to the greatest height. Given maturity of system, there is no problem at all to criticise or take the Presidents to task. Can we say we are mature and should be left to think like adult instead of being subject to so many controls and little freedoms to decide or check on government. Anything wrong with giving these basic freedoms if communalists and communists are no longer a threat ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Many people don't vote</strong></blockquote>How did you come to such a conclusion - that American Democracy suffer from a "low turn up rate" and that "Many people don't vote" ?<br><br>Do you think that Democracy as practised in Singapore Politics produce a higher turn up rate in the participation of the political process in Singapore ?<br><br>Singapore Citizens are required by LAW to participate in the election process, failing such participation they shall lose all subsequent rights to be involved with any and all future election processes - what is the percentage of the Singapore population that actually get the opportunity to participate in the process ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai:<strong><br>I don't admire Americas justice system - Frivilous lawsuit like suing Mac Donald for overeating are even allowed. Laywers, once engaged cannot be dropped even both parties want to let it rest (in some cases if a certain agreement is signed)</strong></blockquote>Allowing frivolous lawsuits does not equate with the acceptance by the Court to proceed further into hearing and due process of deliberation.<br><br>Does it not allow justice to the lowest income group, whom may not have sufficient finance to pay for all the charges imposed - as practised by the Singapore Courts - to hear the merits of a case ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai:<strong><br>I don't admire Americas tax system - 26% or higher income tax with at least 10% GST and other state taxes </strong></blockquote>At least with such taxes, an American will enjoy the benefit of a health care and social welfare system.<br><br>While Singapore's Personal Tax is also about the same percentage, and the 5% GST is payable across all economic activities, how much of these public collected taxes will find its way back to benefit the Singapore Citizens ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai:<strong><br>I don't admire Americas social safety - walking alone out on the street is generally very unsafe </strong></blockquote>If you want to attract attention while walking in a supposedly unsafe area, you are only inviting trouble to yourself.<br><br>Are the streets in Singapore any safer, when a 16 year old can lose his life due to some petty staring incident ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai:<strong><br>I don't admire Americas foriegn affair handling - "I am big, you listen to me. If the international law fits me, everyone must respect it. If the international law do not fit me, it is outdated" </strong></blockquote>Will you allow Singapore to be ruled by the overwhelming majority that vote against you ?<br><br>The Singapore Government pulled Singapore out of the alliance of countries that believe and practise Socialist Democracy, when the majority in this political movement decided that the Singapore Government do not sincerely practise the principles of Socialist Democracy, but lean more towards authoritarianism - with a dark shade of dictatorship.<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai:<strong><br>I don't admire America civil sector finance - The country is in debt. The only reason they can get away with it is because they are big and powerful </strong></blockquote>How does big and powerful help a country to get out of its debt ?<br><br>The liberal finance sector of the US economy, that allow a Central Banker total independence from the Executive Branch, reveal its dynamism in coping with the huge debt incurred by the Executive Branch.<br><br>With the closed economy and political systems of  China or India, can they out perform the USA ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai:<strong><br>I don't admite America free medical system - It is free, but you can wait for years before it is your turn to see the doctor. In the end, everyone goes to private medical and it is so expensive that medical insurance is one of the most important item in employment contract. </strong></blockquote>Where do you get your information from - concerning the state of affairs with the US Medical System ?<br><br>Singapore's PUBLIC medical system is not free either, and any medical procedures can easily wipe out one's savings, and scare the insurers from renewing one's policy.<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai:<strong><br>The list goes on......<br><br>In general, there is nothing great about America. Not that it do not have it's merit. But when someone compliments America, I just have to do the opposite and ask what is so great about America Democracy? I see so many flaws there. </strong></blockquote>There is nothing great about any country or person, except when one wants to believe in such greatness.<br><br>However, if one can only desire to nit pick, split hairs, and seek ONLY the flaws of a system in microscopic details, can one see anything else that is greater then one's narrow view ?<br><br>Can you differentiate the "tree from the forest" ?<br><br></div>
