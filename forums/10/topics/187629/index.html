            <div class='col-md body'>1. The Chinese asked that this be an official state visit, this administration refused. A political slap in the face.<br><br>2. Then there was the FLG Heckler, Dr. Wenyi Wang, She obtains a press pass because she works for a real newspaper (Epoch Times), one that vigourously defends Falung-Gong. She successfully gave a 2 minute speech before being tackled.<br><img src="http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2006/POLITICS/04/20/china.protester.ap/story.protester.02.ap.jpg"><br><br>Normally, visiting Chinese diplomats demand that they are not allowed in to press events and host countries oblige. I'm sure the Chinese had already put in a request to have the pass denied before the event was held, they always do.<br><br>Must be a setup.<br><br>3) They introduced the national anthem as that of "<strong>Republic of China</strong>" by not referring to "<strong>The People's Republic of China</strong>" but using the name for Taiwan instead. Another HUGE slap in the face and I can't believe it was an innocent mistake unless the people in charge of protocol really are that inept.<br><img src="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/04/images/20060420_p042006sc-0103jpg-515h.jpg"><br><br>4. At the end of the arrival ceremony, Bush grabbed Hu's arm to stop from going the wrong direction... like a nigger boy.<br><img src="http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/RT_BUSH_HU_060421_ssh.jpg"><br><br>At first, I assumed that Bush was trying to prevent Hu from falling off something. As it turns out, Bush was herding Hu like an errant child for going in the wrong direction. Or was he????<br><br>Look at the secong pic above. There is only one way to get off that platform, so what "wrong" direction was Bush trying to prevent Hu from following????<br><br>5. Apparently, Cheney put up sunglasses just before the ceremony (the Heckler then appeared) and just before Hu's walking the wrong direction. Coincidents or a signal ?<br><br>6. Both Condi and Dick are caught snoozin' during Hu's visit.<br><img src="http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/nm_condi_cheney_060421_ssh.jpg"><br><br>They later said they were reading notes... X-ray vision ?<br><br>7. Then during the lunch.. they were sitted at a <strong>Table 14.</strong> WTF, talking about protocol and understanding cultural taboo at a state affair...  Intentional ?<br><img src="http://www.centurychina.com/plaboard/uploads/Bush-Hu_Lunch_Table_%2314.jpg"><br><br>It's a Circus, obviously an intended cheap insults to the Chinese. No other foreign leader has it this bad.. as far as I could remember.</div>
