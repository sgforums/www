            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wife says sorry, but...<br>Owner demands $18,000<br>By Crystal Chan<br><br>November 23, 2007       </strong><br><br>THEY caught the person who scratched their Mercedes Benz on video. The next day they found an apology note on the windscreen. It was supposedly written by the culprit's wife.<br><br>Mr Ang Shuenn Guan with the CCTV system he fixed up in his parents' flat. Picture: FRANCIS LEE<br>But that was not good enough for businessman Ang Shuenn Guan, 37, and his wife.<br><br>They made a police report, but were later told that the culprit would not be charged. Instead, the man received a stern warning from the police.<br><br>Now they are thinking of hiring a lawyer to try to recover the cost of spray-painting their car. They bought the car last year for $220,000.<br><br>Another neighbour also had his luxury car scratched by the same person.<br><br>The Angs said that they found a 30cm scratch mark on their car in an open carpark near Block 636, Hougang Avenue 8, on 11 Apr this year.<br><br>They made a police report and then spent $4,500 to install a closed-circuit camera at Mr Ang's parents' unit. His parents live on the third floor while his flat is on the seventh.<br><br>The culprit struck again a month later. He was captured on camera but the Angs did not know who he was. They then asked other car owners in the neighbourhood.<br><br>One of them, Mr Lim Chin Seng, said his black BMW had also been scratched. He, too, installed a video camera in his car to nab the culprit.<br><br>On the police advice, the Angs lodged a magistrate's complaint on 5 Jun. The vandalism was considered an act of mischief and police cannot arrest the culprit or investigate the case without a magistrate's authorisation.<br><br>On 11 Jun, the couple filmed the man in the act.<br><br>When confronted, he initially denied it. But they claimed that he confessed after being told he had been caught on camera.<br><br>Mrs Ang, a clerk, said: 'He immediately apologised and wanted to settle the matter privately. We didn't want to drop our case as we had evidence.'<br><br>The Angs made their fourth police report the next day and handed the footage to the police.<br><br>Earlier that morning, Mr Ang found the note on his car windscreen. The couple contacted the wife to ask for compensation of about $18,000 - $5,400 to spray-paint and $13,000 for renting a Mercedes S280 for 11 days.<br><br>They showed us quotations for the spray-painting and rental.<br><br>Mrs Ang said: 'She said she couldn't afford that amount, so it was a deadlock.'<br><br>The Angs put off the spray-painting.<br><br>But the culprit did pay Mr Lim's repair bill.<br><br>Last month, the police wrote to the Angs saying that the culprit had been issued a stern warning.<br><br>SHOULD HE BE PROSECUTED?<br><br>When contacted, a police spokesman said they decided to do this after consulting with the Attorney-General's Chambers. They declined to comment on why he was not charged.<br><br>Lawyers said this could be because the incident appeared minor.<br><br>Lawyer Singa Retnam said: 'The incident involves private property so he could have been let off to avoid wasting resources on a prosecution.'<br><br>But lawyer Kirpal Singh feels car owners should be entitled to legal protection, especially if they leave their cars in a public place.<br><br>When contacted, the culprit's wife said: 'I'm trying to settle this matter privately and the police have already investigated.<br><br>'I'm getting a lawyer to write to the Angs. I don't wish to talk about this incident anymore.'<br><br></div>
