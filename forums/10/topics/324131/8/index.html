              <p>Seriously, if you don't mind paying high price for oil, and continue paying higher oil price and the subsequent increases in everything, by all means. I am not stopping you or anyone else. Some people in Singapore are rich enough to pay and even use money to light up their ciggerettes, and don't give a damn on the suffering of others.</p>
              <p>What i am doing is for other billions around the world including my fellow citizens who are made to suffer such increases. Why should oil, a staple, which is sustainable at $60/barrel by OPEC, should peak at $147/b and even soon to $200/b?</p>
              <p>While we still have strength to fight, we better do so before we are all starved to death. By December 08, if we do nothing, it will be too late as the price increases in everything else will make many, not only me, begging on the streets and depend on charities. Entire national treasuries can be wiped out by those who do not own oil as a natural reserves, and agricultural food producing countries will fight back by raising their prices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world produces 17billion of barrels a day. Assuming Iran ordered through intermediaries the entire lot of 14.5 billion at $80/b then, ( less their production) on Jun 07, it will only cost Iran only US$34billion for that month's output. Others will have no oil and scream, or pay higher, which Iran will then sell at $90/b. The world will pay, as they need it.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, each month, Iran uses its reserves of est US$250billion to take control of output. Iran never loses, for it continues to sell at higher prices each day, and making more. Even if other Opec countries try to sell cheap, Iran just buy them all up, say thank you Opec, and sell back to the market at higher prices. Thus, the anomaly unprecedented spike within a few short month!</p>

              <p>So your point is that the single web link is the solid proof that Iraqis is being "murdered" by the US because of invasion? That website provides no information, on who killed the Iraqis EXCEPT saying that the numbers of death were more than what was announced ever since the war began. HELLO number of deaths doesn't equal murdered by US.<br>Number of deaths is just a statistic to show the death rate that had increased ever since US step in. Terrorists over there enjoy killing people who believes in different religion did you take into consideration? Or you just take a number of deaths = fault of US? lol so funny</p>

              <p>Let me take you on a <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">brief</span> chronological journey into the deprivations of the Iranian leadership.</p>
              <p>1.) Iran exports 2.5million barrels of oil a day. At $80/b for the last 5 years, each yr they would have a state revenue of $70 billion dollars -US$70,000,000,000 on oil alone. Setting aside $50billion in their treasury, it would mean a <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">war chest of US$250billion</span> to play in manipulation of international affairs.</p>
              <p>Social spending is atrocious - WTO rank them 93rd on health care alone. Population of 70million, with an area of 1.6million sq km, there are still slums, beggars and poverty. Thus, much of it's money is not into social spending, but it seems for other nefarious purposes. ( 12million below poverty line)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>How they spend their money is their business. Wat has it got to with u ? They wanna spend the money buying trillions of ping pong balls then dumping into the sea has nothing to do with u.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>2.) I will not touch on their nuclear ambition debacle for it is already widely known.</p>
              <p>3.) The spike in oil prices began in 2005. Oil only average around $40/b but shot up to $50/b. This was also the same time the Bushrer Nuclear Power station in Iran was completed and the row over suspected nuclear weapon production began.</p>
              <p>4. )June 2007, oil shot up to $80 and by July 08, it peaked $147/b. At June 07, Talks between Iran and the west over the nuclear weapons issue had broken down.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>They build a nuclear power station is their right and their own business. Forcing them to stop building is being nosy and a show of poor human right record. During tis time, US dollars depreciate a lot and everybody points it out including OPEC. But u seems to be oblivion to tis fact.</p>

              <p>Guessing is pointless because someone can guess completely the opposite. There is no shred of truth in it. Then how ?

              <p>U r just dreaming la ! If it is true, we will agree with u. But u fail to establish it as truth. U r just making him a scapegoat for your own problems.</p>
              <p>I don't know why people give the moral high ground on the Iraq war. If US really wanna help the people, why not attack North korea where the people r dying ? Why not help africans when the peoople r still massacaring each other ? Why Iraq ? They r not starving, they r all educated and they have a better sense of security than now since they don't blow themselves up.</p>

              <p>Its good that you care about the deaths, but future is what they want. They don't want to live life in terror, getting tortured and buried in places no one knows, daughters being sexual assualted by powerful officials of Iraq pre-war.</p>
