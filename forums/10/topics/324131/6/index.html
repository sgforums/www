              <p class="MsoNormal">Here is one interpretation of 1973 oil crisis:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>...<span style="font-family: Verdana;">In
              1973, the powerful men grouped around Bilderberg decided to launch a
              colossal assault against industrial growth in the world, in order to
              tilt the balance of power back to the advantage of Anglo-American
              financial interests.  In order to do this, they determined to use their
              most prized weapon -- control of the world's oil flows.  Bilderberg
              policy was to trigger a global oil embargo in order to force a dramatic
              increase in world oil prices.  Since 1945, world oil trade had, by
              international custom, been priced in dollars.  American oil companies
              dominated the postwar market.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sharp sudden increase in the world
              price of oil, therefore, meant an equally dramatic increase in world
              demand for US dollars to pay for that necessary oil....</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">...<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">On
              October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria invaded Israel, igniting what became
              known as the "Yom Kippur" war.  Contrary to popular impression, the
              "Yom Kippur" war was not the result of simple miscalculation, a
              blunder, or an Arab decision to launch a military strike against the
              state of Israel.  The entire constellation of events surrounding the
              outbreak of the October war was secretly orchestrated from Washington
              and London, using the powerful diplomatic secret channels developed by
              Nixon's White House National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Kissinger
              effectively controlled the Israeli policy response through his intimate
              relation with Israel's ambassador to Washington, Simcha Dinitz.  In
              addition, Kissinger cultivated channels to the Egyptian and Syrian
              sides.  His method was to simply misrepresent to each party the
              critical elements of the other, ensuring the war and its subsequent
              Arab oil embargo.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Kissinger,
              who is by then Nixon's intelligence "czar", consistently suppressed US
              intelligence reports, including intercepted communications from Arab
              officials confirming the buildup for war.  Washington scripted the war
              and its aftermath, including Kissinger's infamous "shuttle diplomacy,"
              along the precise lines of the Bilderberg deliberations of the previous
              May in Saltsjoebaden, some six months before outbreak of the war.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arab
              oil-producing nations were to be the scapegoat for the coming rage of
              the world, while the Anglo-American interests responsible stood quietly
              in the background...</span></span></em></p>

              <p>1.Crude jump from $80 to $147 within a few months.</p>
              <p>2. Efforts to bring price down to $142 was immediately wasted when the price shot back up at $147 just last friday.</p>
              <p>3.Who benefits from the sale of crude oil?</p>
              <p>4. Why should we, the race of human beings sharing the same planet, be made to pay <span style="text-decoration: underline;">skyrocket prices</span> for a NATURAL Earth daily staple resource when there are still huge deposits still avaliable under the planet?</p>

              <p>Tis is stupid. U actually believe the president of Iran to be so powerful and smart to buy oil when the price is low an sell them back when it is high ? If he do tat, then he is a brillant president, making a 100% investment profit in a year and deserves to continue as president. Every country is for themselves. Whether he has nuclear weopon has the same probability as Iraq has nuclear weopon. They don't, and tis time even US says they r not ready yet. And even if they do, why USA can have nuclear weopons while Iran cannot ? Double standard to ensure they r always military inferior ? Why should iran obey USA when they owes them nothing.</p>
              <p>Oil is a natural resouce. So is land, water, wood, granites, sand, diamond, gold, platinum, silver, chrome, jade and many other minerals. Why don't u demand free diamond from africa as well ? The resource is in his country and they have the right to sell them at watever price they can get. U don't like the price ? Don't buy. Spiral out of control ? Too bad. Wat to do ? Just because they sell their product too high, u want to invade them. Wat is the difference between u and a robber ? Why don't u just go rob the bank</p>

              <p>US is the trouble maker. Invade Iraq and kill innocent Iraqis..</p>
              <p>Dammit! How long US gonna invade Iraq?!</p>
              <p>So who's the trouble maker? Iran? nope..  US can have Nuclear Plant.. Why Iran cannot have ? maybe US scared of IRAN thats why they don't allowed Iran to have a Nuclear Plant? lol..</p>
              <p>The world gonna end when US or Israel declare war with Iran and Iran got alot of allies.. :) So who's the Trouble maker? and also, Israel(U.S BESTFRIEND) or U.S itself will attack Iran if Iran don wanna end its Nuclear Plant. So who's the troublemaker? Why force Iran? They have the right to build their own Nuclear Plant. Its their country and they just wanna use it as another alternative way of energy source. Does Iran gonna declare war with US or Israel? Nope! They only declare war if US or Israel start  hitting missles or bullets to their country.</p>
              <p>and yes.. Israel is occupying Palestine territory.. :) and how do you feel if Malaysia occupying our country without any permission ? Please take note.. Israel occupy Palestine territory with VIOLENCE..Killing thousands of innocents.. Still don't know? Because our COUNTRY , OUR PEOPLE, don't know the situation NOW in Palestine! So people, do watch some videos about Palestine-Israel crisis.</p>

              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Before the Hebrews first migrated there around 1800 B.C., the land of Canaan was occupied by Canaanites.</h4>
              <p>“Between 3000 and 1100 B.C., Canaanite civilization covered what is
              today Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and much of Syria and
              Jordan...Those who remained in the Jerusalem hills after the Romans
              expelled the Jews [in the second century A.D.] were a potpourri:
              farmers and vineyard growers, pagans and converts to Christianity,
              descendants of the Arabs, Persians, Samaritans, Greeks and old
              Canaanite tribes.” <em>Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright, “Their Promised Land.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">The present-day Palestinians’ ancestral heritage</h4>
              <p>“But all these [different peoples who had come to Canaan] were
              additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And that parent tree
              was Canaanite...[The Arab invaders of the 7th century A.D.] made Moslem
              converts of the natives, settled down as residents, and intermarried
              with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that
              we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin.” <em>Illene Beatty, “Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">The Jewish kingdoms were only one of many periods in ancient Palestine</h4>
              <p>“The extended kingdoms of David and Solomon, on which the Zionists
              base their territorial demands, endured for only about 73 years...Then
              it fell apart...[Even] if we allow independence to the entire life of
              the ancient Jewish kingdoms, from David’s conquest of Canaan in 1000
              B.C. to the wiping out of Judah in 586 B.C., we arrive at [only] a 414
              year Jewish rule.” <em>Illene Beatty, “Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">More on Canaanite civilization</h4>
              <p>“Recent archeological digs have provided evidence that Jerusalem was
              a big and fortified city already in 1800 BCE...Findings show that the
              sophisticated water system heretofor attributed to the conquering
              Israelites pre-dated them by eight centuries and was even more
              sophisticated than imagined...Dr. Ronny Reich, who directed the
              excavation along with Eli Shuikrun, said the entire system was built as
              a single complex by Canaanites in the Middle Bronze Period, around 1800
              BCE.” <em>The Jewish Bulletin, July 31st, 1998</em>.</p>

              <p>The world gonna end when US or Israel declare war with Iran and
              Iran got alot of allies.. :) So who's the Trouble maker? and also,
              Israel(U.S BESTFRIEND) or U.S itself will attack Iran if Iran don
              wanna end its Nuclear Plant. So who's the troublemaker? Why force
              Iran? They have the right to build their own Nuclear Plant. Its
              their country and they just wanna use it as another alternative way
              of energy source. Does Iran gonna declare war with US or Israel?
              Nope! They only declare war if US or Israel start  hitting
              missles or bullets to their country.</p>
              <p>and yes.. Israel is occupying Palestine territory.. :) and how
              do you feel if Malaysia occupying our country without any
              permission ? Please take note.. Israel occupy Palestine territory
              with VIOLENCE..Killing thousands of innocents.. Still don't know?
              Because our COUNTRY , OUR PEOPLE, don't know the situation NOW in

              <p>Or maybe you think you can save them through other means than war, maybe you can share with us?</p>
              <p><br>You think you can trust anyone with a nuclear bomb? Especially a country like Iran whose leader has final say, and its citizens just have accept fate.</p>
              <p>No matter how crazy/evil/brutal US is, it has a lower probability of making insensible decisions like Iran. I would rather have the nuclear bombs safeguard in countries having advance technology and better economy than country like Iran. Iran has less to lose if they just go crazy dropping bombs on your head, unlike coutnries like US, China, Israel who has more to lose, eg. infrastructures, technology, economy.</p>
              <p>Ajen instead of focusing on how many deaths toll caused by Israel, why not focus on the history of Middle East? Go read up you history, and see for yourself how the Muslims treat the Jews. They been ganging up to bully Israel over centuries, and they are still at it.

              <p><br>Gold, silver, diamonds and platinium are some of the more rare minerals of earth. It is limited in quantities and are difficult to extract. Hardly humans use such minerals and are considered a luxury. Thus the high cost charge to them for there is only a limited market.</p>
              <p>But oil is a different thing altogether! It is a daily staple just like water. Everything uses oil, from the machinery that extracts to the egg seller in the market to transport his eggs to the market using his van. The market is immensely huge for oil.</p>
              <p>It's not like oil is rare. While the easy days of poking a hole in the ground and a geyser of oil at $1 per barrel will spring forth will be over within est 40years time, there is absolutely no reason for the high cost of oil at $147 a barrel to extract it deep underground. There are still huge deposits underground, with the antartic region still untouch.</p>
              <p>Therefore it is a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY to charge crude oil at $147 per barrel even after production costs, just looking at the vast amount of oil and market for it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What Iran had done is to buy back whatever Opec had tried to sell cheaper crude oil in the market, created an artificial demand in the market, thus raising oil prices, and then sell oil back at the inflated price.</p>
              <p>Each time Opec, espacially Saudi Arabia, tried to sell cheap, Iran buys all of their oil up. Iran has the funds, a lot of it left untouched due to international sanctions and not allowed to buy anything else ( except medical and food items), thus they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">covertly</span> use international finance institutions to purchase. At this point of time, it is suspected Venuzela, which hates US is in league with Iran. All these because of their naked ambition to own nuclear arms, which the world had demanded a stop, a halt to nuclear  arms proliferation, not nuclear power stations which Iran already own several operational stations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You claimed I am a robber, alluding i intend to rob Iran of their wealth. But in actual fact, who are the robbers? Isn't Iran robbing us all, the human race with no natural resource oil, of our wealth? Why should I be paying such high prices for a natural resource staple commodity, which in turn affect all other staples well?</p>
              <p>Should i just stand by, and allow Iran to rob me and my fellow human race blind, and die off one by one due to hunger and starvation soon to come when oil hits even higher prices? Or should I, and fellow like minded humans, who still have strength left, to fight for billions others for oil to be an affordable price?</p>
              <p>The war in Iran requires only 1 million soldiers. It doesn't need more than that, so if you fear to fight, stay home, hide under the bed and reap the benefits when the war is won. Just support this justified war.</p>
              <p>Diplomacy had failed. War is the only solution. I too, am afraid to die, but in the end, i rather receive a bullet dying for a justified cause - saving billions other, than to slowly die of starvation and watching every other man, woman, and child fall onto the wayside in hunger.</p>
