              <p>Guys, guys, this is not about USA or whichever country. The issue is HIGH PRICE IN OIL LEADING TO SUFFERING OF BILLIONS in the world!</p>
              <p>Oil should never be more than $60 a barrel, according to Opec. So who is driving up oil prices?</p>
              <p>Some say financial groups. But where does their money comes from? The answer lies in Iran, with their treasury that has billions unspent due to international sanctions. They want to make nuclear weapons in a world that is trying to limit nuclear weapon proliferation. Israel has nuclear arms, but did they cry 'death to US and Iran daily? NONE!</p>
              <p>Can Iran be responsible with WMD? NONE. They do not recognise any international treaties, and had even sanction the holding of hostages on their soil as a govt entity. Dare you trust them with WMD? NO!</p>
              <p>Right now, their only weapon to get the world begging on their knees is to buy back cheap oil with their funds through their subsidiaries and sell back at a higher price, making more money and making more  people in the world suffer as a result!</p>
              <p>I am not asking for vigilante action on Iran. I am seeking political representation to wage war on Iran, either multilaterally as a UN force or unilaterally led by a few countries in organised warfare to save the lives of billions of people in the world!</p>
              <p>I am a responsible Singaporean by birth through Singaporean citizens and by occupation in this country, and am not a US citizen or hold a green card. Whatever US had done, i am not interested. I am only interested in making the price of oil fall to reasonable rates such as $60 a barrel, so that others requiring fuel will not raise their prices to operate which in turns pass on to us.</p>
              <p>Iran is the cause of our suffering and the Iranian leadership MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE, which can only be ejected through a war!</p>

              Israel without doubt possess nuclear weapons but it has never threatened neigbouring countries unlike Iran whose President publicly announced Israel has to be wiped off the world's map.
              
              Israel's came into being after winning the 6 day war in 1967 against its Aarb neighbours,its army is among the smallest but its pple are resilient and highly resourceful and their military and technological advancement are prompted by their survival to stand against many neighbours who harbour intentions to swallow Israel.Iran is a typical revengeful and evil regime with many fanatics who supply suicide bombers to Iraq and provide insurgents to create instability in Iraq so US will be kept busy

              <p><br>Price of oil did not rise when Iraq was attacked or during the US occupation. It rose at the start of war for a few days and climbed back down.</p>
              <p>But NOW, within a short span of a few months, oil price skyrocketed from $80 a barrel to $147 a barrel! Who is responsible for these movements? Who have that kind of money to move the market? Who would want to make others suffer to achieve their aims?</p>
              <p>The answer is Iran. Eversince diplomatic and sanctions pressure applied on Iran to stop nuclear proliferation, it had played every card on the trick to evade inspections and delays. Now that the pressure is even more, their only solution left is to play the oil card. Buy up low price oil, create the demand, other small players jump in, then sell the oil at a higher rate.</p>
              <p>It will continue as it did last week, when oil fell to $142 a barrel, but immediately as if by magic, it hit $147! Who could manipulate this market? Use your 'blane'. Iran is the answer. And Iran will not stop, to hell with the world, like a spoilt child, it wants to force the world onto their knees to give it the right to nuclear arms.</p>
              <p>Are you going to trust them with WMD when they behave in this manner to get what they want? Will you go on your knees to beg another equal human?</p>
              <p>I will not, and am prepared to volunteer myself for war. I am a republican and will kneel before no man. By my arms will i get rid of those who sought to make others kneel. If you don't want to fight, it is fine with me. Just give support to your elected representatives to push for a war on Iran. War is the only solution when diplomacy fail. Just ask Neville Chamberlin of England 1939.</p>

              <p><em> It
              never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and

              Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus
              open all Central Europe to Bolshevism.</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In order to carry out this plan of allowing Germany to drive eastward

              hoodwink the English people into accepting this as a necessary, indeed,

              <p><em> The Chamberlain group
              were so successful in all three of these things that they came within
              an ace of succeeding, and failed only because of the obstinacy of the
              Poles, the unseemly haste of Hitler, and the fact that at the eleventh
              hour the Milner Group realized the implications of their policy and
