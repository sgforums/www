              <p>Did the Shah blame the US or himself for losing his throne?</p>
              <p>President
              Carter did not heed  the new Iranian govt's demand for the Shah to
              stand trial in Iran. This had resulted in the Iran hostage crisis.</p>
              <p>If the US wanted to get rid of the Shah, she  would  have install  a pro- US regime, definitely not Khomeini. It was the Shah's unpopularity in his own country that eventually led to his own downfall.</p>

              <p>There is still not enough evidence to conclusively show that USA secretly supported the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>
              <p>But it is clear that USA wanted to set the Soviet Union against the Afghans in 1979.</p>
              <p>The evidence for that is from this interview with Zbigniew Brzezinski:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="q"><em> Question: The former director of the CIA, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robert Gates,
                  stated in his memoirs</span> ["From the Shadows"], that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">American intelligence
                  services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the
                  Soviet intervention.</span> In this period you were the national security
                  adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this
                  affair. Is that correct? </em></p>
              <p><em> Brzezinski: Yes. According to the official version of history, CIA aid
                  to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet
                  army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But the reality, secretly
                  guarded until now, is completely otherwise Indeed, it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 3, 1979
                  that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the
                  opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul.</span> And that very day, I wrote
                  a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention...</span></em></p>

              <p>What happened in the past is of no concern to most. What concerns most is that the price of oil has shoot up rapidly, too rapidly to be a natural occurence, making billions around the world suffer!</p>
              <p>Oil can be extracted at $1 per barrel with all costs and taxes included in. Just poke a hole in the ground and oil gushes out. The world has no complains over its steady climb over the years. They had fork out an average US$65/barrel over the years. The world had prospered and many lives were uplifted with the technology that oil fueled.</p>
              <p>Oil is a NATURAL commodity. It BELONGS to our human race. There is no reason for it to be sold above $65 per barrel, which in turns cost everything on Earth to spiral with it, causing suffering and misery to the middle class and the poor.</p>
              <p>What Iran had done as proven by my analysis is that it had played a major part to jack up the price of oil, as a means to force and paralyse the world to agree to their terms of owning nuclear weapons in a world hell bent on stopping nuclear proliferation.</p>
              <p>Through its intermediaries, they had buy up all avaliable oil with their obscene wealth and sell it back at higher prices. Already, thankfully, there are stock brokerages that see through their actions and had rejected their advances. Price of oil today had drop to US$134/barrel today from last Friday $147/barrel. These stock brokers are human as well, realized the stupidity to help push the price of oil up and suffer in return just like the rest of us.</p>
              <p>Therefore, do tell your friends and them to tell their friends, not to buy up oil stocks. Money can be made in several ways, but oil stocks will end up anhilating our world's human race, spread misery and pain to billions.</p>
              <p>Already i had written to several NGOs to spread information and  blacklist companies that sells or buys oil stocks in the market. They too are awaiting for the US investigations to seek out such companies. These companies will lose their credibility through our blacklist and their brokers will never ever get a trading position again in their lifetime. Be smart, do not touch oil stocks before you are blacklisted. If you know of any Iranian clients, divest them quickly. They may have money, but the world has more money. Don't spoil your career. Money can be made, but not at the suffering of billion others.</p>
              <p>Iran can wipe out Israel, destroy US or the rest of the world all they want. But they have to do it using peaceful means, not to harm billions of innocent civilians who only want peace and prosperity, if not rich, at least just 3 square meals a day.</p>
              <p>But what it is doing now is killing us all, and starving us to death soon. For that, I am ready to shed my own blood to stop them, so that billions other may live.</p>
              <p>If you are rich, price of oil will fall once the war is won, you will stand to gain. You and your sons don't need to fight. There are billions in the world, and only need a million soldiers in a legal military sanction operation to win the world. Do not obstruct this solution to ease the suffering of the world.</p>
              <p>Condaleeza Rice will be here in Spore soon over the N.korean affair. Please write in to your MPs to appeal for war on Iran. You can use my analysis, and let them send it to the Foreign Affairs Minister, through the approval of our PM, to wage war on Iran. Get US to support, and other countries as well. This is our chance to get the ear of US, the country with the largest military power in the world, to help save billions other. </p>

              <p>Let it be known that US and the free world will always give Iran a chance at diplomacy. If it fails and Iran continues to be belligerant in aquiring Nuke weaponery, then war is the only option. US and the free world cannot be blamed.</p>
              <p>Protecting itself against Israel is only a lame excuse. Iran wants to control the world, at least the middle east, through its brand of theocracy as proven over the years with such weapons, espacially to get Saudi Arabia in line. There is a bigger picture than you can possibly imagine in the ambitions of this persian ethnic group. Iran can do whatever it wants for all i care, BUT THEY CANNOT use the suffering and misery of billions around the world to achieve their aims!</p>
              <p>I had nowhere said oil should be free. Please DO NOT PUT WORDS INTO MY MOUTH! I only want oil price to be rationalized. If you missed my 'chronological' analysis post, go read it again and come back. No point in a circular arguement.</p>
              <p>Iran must be stopped and war is the only solution left. Dealing in oil stocks is like dealing in slavery, for it destroys the lives of billions in the world through the rise in price of foodstuffs to match the rise in fuel. Thus oil price cannot, must not be allowed to shoot beyond the limit of human endurance. We share the same world. We share knowledge and technology. We share our resources. We are one race on Earth - human race. We will pay accordingly, but not to the point where we exist or fail to exist because of high oil prices, the commodity that fuels our technologies, when there are still vast deposits underground and undiscovered.</p>
              <p>Our human ancestors in US overthrew slavery in the 1800s. So too shall we overthrow high oil prices created by Iran to starve the world! Iran leadership will be and must be destroyed in order for billions others to live! We fight for freedom - freedom from starvation!</p>
              <p>PS: oil price had drop to $129/b today from $134/b yesterday and $147/b last friday. Our fellow humans in the stock brokerages are beginning to be more human now, thankfully. BUT WAR WITH IRAN IS STILL INEVITABLE, for the suffering it had caused to the world in the past one year!</p>
              <p>I will not stop in sending my analysis to organisations, espacially international Unions of pension funds, and who are human and care for billions of others till the price of oil drop to $60/b, sustainable by OPEC itself as revealed by Saudi Arabia, the head of Opec, by cajole or by force of war! Our human race will not be enslaved or manipulated by Iran! </p>

                  STILL INEVITABLE, for the suffering it had caused to the world in
                  the past one year!</p>
              <p>I will not stop in sending my analysis to organisations,
                  espacially international Unions of pension funds, and who
                  are human and care for billions of others till the price of oil
                  drop to $60/b, sustainable by OPEC itself as revealed by Saudi
                  Arabia, the head of Opec, by cajole or by force of war! Our human
                  race will not be enslaved or manipulated by Iran! </p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;">Oil is a NATURAL commodity. It BELONGS to our human race. There is no reason for it to be sold above $65 per barrel.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I heard this argument long time ago, when the control of the world oil supplies switched from the major oil companies to the oil producing countries. Guess who said this, The American!</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Why $65, if “Oil can be extracted at $1 per barrel with all costs and taxes included in”?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Through its intermediaries, they had buy up all avaliable oil with their obscene wealth and sell it back at higher prices. Already, thankfully, there are stock brokerages that see through their actions and had rejected their advances.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Who are these intermediaries? Who are operating the current stock brokerages of selling futures of such Natural commodity? If you have answers to these you should know who has been playing the market and pushed oil prices up to where it is. There is no physical shortage of oil, is there?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;">If you are rich, price of oil will fall once the war is won, you will stand to gain. You and your sons don't need to fight. There are billions in the world, and only need a million soldiers in a legal military sanction operation to win the world. Do not obstruct this solution to ease the suffering of the world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is a funny para. Why should we fight for somebody’s war.<span> </span> Besides, I am not rich.</span></p>

              <p><br>I do not believe in the policy of 'beggar thy neighbour', despite my hardline approach. The middle east is a largely barren land, more desert than agricultural plots.

Such monies will help in their developement and uplift their lives. BUT selling this staple commodity higher than $65/b is robbing us of our own developement and starving us!

              <p>Furthermore, at below $65/b ( US$396 billion a year total output), there is more than enough money to research on better equipment to bring up underground oil and for other earth friendly fuel mixture alternatives. At more than $65/b, we will all die of starvation even before the effects of climate change will.</p>
              <p>It had always been the rich who opposes strongly to change. They have the funds to block efforts, simply because of their selfish desire to protect what they own. But this oil hike affects the middle class and the poor like me more than it affects the rich. Thus either we fight for ourselves or we, the middle class and the poor, will all die of starvation. Leave the rich alone, and hope that they may have a conscience, and voluntarily support the war, either with their approval, funds, and sons. It is not the best option, but with this crisis, there are limited options. Do nothing, you and i will soon die. Go to war, i may die, but you and others will have a chance to live with better sustainable oil price.</p>

              <p>My concern is the price of oil and the effect it is having on billions of people around the world, with Iran reponsible as the cause of our misery.</p>
              <p>Without removing this root cause, we will all be dead from starvation to care about anything else.</p>
              <p>Iran will not give up on its nuclear ambitions to rule middle east with its theocracy. Diplomatic talks are nothing more than a delay, a deadly delay as more and more middle classes slip into poverty and the poor dying on the streets. WAR WITH IRAN IS INEVITABLE! </p>

              <p>Israel had never coveted one inch of any sovereign middle eastern countries, nor do israelis chant 'death to iran', burn effigies of middle eastern nations' flags.</p>
              <p>Israel only act when their people are threaten, such as the rhetoric despicable iranian leaders chant, play and bully Israel to wipe them out on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>Today, Iran has no nukes and yet thrashes Israel blatantly, despises its neighbours and even funded terrorist organisations, overtly and covertly with their oil wealth. When the Iranian leadership obtains nuclear weaponery, how much more daring will they become?</p>
              <p>With nukes, there is no need for missiles as a delivery platform. A van with a nuclear warhead smuggled along porus national boundaries, or through bribes, parked in Ridhyah, Cairo, Washington DC or Tel Aviv, is enough to bring these nations to its knees.</p>
              <p>The world was right to stop nuclear weapon proliferation. The only dictatorship or theocratic state that owns nukes is China. The rest of the world that owns nuke are democracies, with a proper check and balance on its use.</p>
              <p>Iran will stoop to nothing to aquiring nukes, even at the expense of billions around the world starved. They must be stopped! The despicable iranian leadership MUST GO!</p>
