              <p>Don't you follow the development in the US yesterday? Against the principle of free trade, the US have bailed many failed banks and financial institutions and kept interest rate artificially low.</p>
              <p>What does this imply then?</p>
              <p><br>More dollars are to be churned out to prop up those failed institutions. These dollars are not going to disappear right away. They will be spent and circulated in the global economy, adding to the already excessive liquidity.</p>
              <p>Where will these new dollars go?</p>
              <p>Those who collect dollars now, including Singapore, Asian nations, have nowhere to spent or invest while the dollar keeps falling because the US is blocking foreign takeover of businesses and financial institutions. They instead go to Oil and Commodities to hedge against further dollar depreciation, pushing up food prices and inflation. It then came back to hurt the American people who are failing to pay back their debts to the ailing banks. Then the US will need to print more dollars to prop up those poor banks again. Vicious circles.</p>
              <p>Every finger will point to the US now for causing the crisis until she accepts the truth and allow Sovereign Wealth Funds, including Singapore and China, to buy out US businesses. The excess dollars from Singapore, China, and the Arabs will flow back to the US, ending the crisis.</p>

              <p>Hmm... how about the whole world speculates ? The common man with some spare cash and invest in oil as he believe it is gonna rise ? 1/2 a year ago it is already pretty clear tat oil and commodities r worth investing. Heck people r investing in them now. Furthermore, u completely exaggerate the amount of money Iran has. Your argument on who has the money to invest really holds no water at all.</p>

              <p>He is incapable of holding a proper debate. His only rebuttal method is mass link of sites which he thinks is very reliable, not missing out that he is one of the youtubers who enjoy watching videos of speech by people, who are neither with fame nor rich.<br>But yet he expect us to agree with him on the information provided by his links and his youtube video.</p>
