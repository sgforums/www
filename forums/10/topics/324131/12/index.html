              <p>20 Unknown vans parked in each city. First 3 gets blown off, 3 cities made unhabitable, thousands dead. Retaliate and the other 17 will go off. With that scenerio, you think the country dare retaliate back? Nukes are the ultimate blackmail weapons in the hands of madmen. And reading the news, i am sure you see alot of madmen ruling countries.</p>
              <p>I agree with you point on the fear of democratic states being no angels. Hitler was also elected to office in Germany.</p>
              <p>Nuclear weapons should NEVER have been invented. But it was. We has seen its awesome power. That is why it is vital each and every human on Earth must prevent its PROLIFERATION! More so with dictatorships or populist playing to the gallery nations.</p>
              <p>At least those nations with nukes had never threaten any nation with nukes. But Iran, even without nukes had threaten to wipe out an entire nation of humans and considered the rest of the world as infidels.</p>
              <p>We all seek peace, but dare you trust the Iranian leadership?</p>

              <p>Well, you conceded my point without resorting to the i've been brainwashed by the PAP government or insulting my parentage for that amount of decency, especially on this forum i thank you for that.</p>
              <p>But i disagree with you on the part on nuclear weapons, because it's the most effective thing ever invented to stop wars. It discourages any more World Wars simply because no matter how many tanks, planes and legendary generals you got, all it takes is 1 nuke to finish it. It is that fear that stops war on a global scale.</p>
              <p>Your scenario neglects the fact on how technically difficult it is to build a nuclear bomb,  compact it to be moved by a van, mass producing it and being able to position 20 of it in cities without being detected. </p>
              <p>You also forget the political ramifications once you set one off. Know why it's never a good idea to give in to terrorists demands? Simply because you know you give in once you encourage others to do it again. And all the major powers in the world knows that, that's why they would never tolerate any countries to make that first step and would never be held ransom. They would much rather Iran be reduced to a radiated wasteland than give in.</p>
              <p>And i don't quite get why you think the Iranians are so different from the rest of the world. They have families just like us and they want the right to exist and be respected. The only reason they would ever build a nuclear weapon and denonated it is when they decide they have nothing left to lose which is what you're suggesting we do.</p>
              <p>Regarding threats, the Cuban Missile Crisis? How many times some general in India threaten to nuke Pakistan and vice versa? By continuing to threaten them and imposing economic sanctions we only encourage religious radicals to take over and hastening the chances of your scenario happening.</p>
              <p>I don't know how much i would trust the Iranian leadership frankly, but i can be sure i would trust them more than i trust americans.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Let's bring everyone here into a lesson on Iran leadership:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The political system of the Islamic </span><a title="Republic" href="/wiki/Republic"><span style="color: #000000;">Republic</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> comprises several intricately connected governing bodies. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1) <strong>The Supreme Leader of Iran</strong> is responsible for delineation and supervision of the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Supreme Leader is <em><strong>Commander-in-Chief</strong></em> of the armed forces, controls the military intelligence and security operations; and <strong>has sole power to declare war or peace</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Who supervise the Supreme Leader?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1) The Assembly of Experts elects and dismisses the Supreme Leader on the basis of qualifications and popular esteem. The Assembly of Experts is responsible for supervising the Supreme Leader in the performance of legal duties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Now onto the President of Iran...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1) <strong>After the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supreme Leader</span>, the Constitution defines the </strong></span><a title="President of Iran" href="/wiki/President_of_Iran"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">President of Iran</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> as the highest state authority.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2) </strong>The President is elected for a term of four years and can only be re-elected for one term. Presidential candidates must be approved by the </span><a class="mw-redirect" title="Council of Guardians" href="/wiki/Council_of_Guardians"><span style="color: #000000;">Council of Guardians</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> prior to running in order to ensure their allegiance to the ideals of the Islamic revolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">3) The President is responsible for the implementation of the Constitution and for the exercise of executive powers, <strong>except for matters directly related to the Supreme Leader, who has the final say in all matters</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">4) Unlike many other states, <strong>the executive branch in Iran does not control the armed forces</strong>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Iran's current president, </span><a title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad" href="/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad"><span style="color: #000000;">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. It seems like </span><a href="/users/242785"><span style="color: #000000;">xtreyier</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> is pissed off with Ahmadinejad but he has limited knowledge on how the political system of Iran works.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although In 2001, Khamenei (current supreme leader)  famously remarked that "this cancerous tumor of a state [Israel] should be removed from the region," i<span style="color: #000000;">n 2005, Khamenei responded to President Ahmadinejad's alleged remark that Israel should be "wiped off the map" by saying that "the Islamic Republic has never threatened and will never threaten any country." Moreover Khamenei's main advisor in foreign policy, Ali Akbar Velayati, refused to take part in a Holocaust conference. In contrast to Ahmadinejad's remarks, Velayati said that the Holocaust was a genocide and a historical reality.</span></p>

              <p>Iran Political Reality</p>
              <p>-------------------------</p>
              <p>Thanks Roy for your Iran political leadership responsibility lesson. Only in a perfect world does perfection exists. BUT we do not live in a perfect world. Iran may devise the perfect system, but it is humans, flawed, that seats on those position. Even Hitler, Mugabe, Idi Amin, Kim Ill Sung devised 'check and balances' to placate their citizens and the world on their rule. But are such systems infallible in reality?</p>
              <p>The no2 man in Iran had voice destruction to a nation of humans, DEATH to a population of est 8 million innocent lives, just because they are of an ethnic group that is different from them. He had voiced not once, but several times, even as recent in 2nd June 2008 in the presence of international foriegn affairs ministers in Iran.</p>
              <p>Yet, he had never been censured once. Why is he allowed to behave in this manner? What happened to the leader's 'advisors'? Is the leader deaf?</p>
              <p>We all can only conclude that what the no2 man had done, was done with tacit approval from the leader himself. Welcome to the reality of Iranian politics.</p>
              <p>As further proof of their genocidal ways, their Shahab missiles were inscribe with "Israel must be uprooted and erased from history”. Do you think for a moment anyone have any doubt on the 'peacefulness' of the No.1man, the man capable to launch a war, in Iran?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Price hike</p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>If you had read yesterday's straits times, in the business section on oil news, you may have missed a single line phrase in the report on US energy watchdog's observation on the current market. This watchdog monitors and tracks the supply of oil and its use in the international market. It found out more oil was being kept in storage than to refineries. Simple phrase, but deep in meaning. Oil is being hoarded.</p>
              <p>By the process of elimination, you will find out who stands to gain from oil's storage and the capability of that country to do so. The answer lies with Iran again, and its buffoon sidekick Venuezela.</p>
              <p>Most oil stock players do not have the license nor the capability to take and store oil upon delivery. You will need a huge tract of land as well as the attendent securities. US and China, major importers, already have their own strategic reserve stocks. Europe, while need oil, do not require huge stocks. Asia has its own oil under the ground. So who is buying and keeping the stocks to play the real supply market? Iran!</p>
              <p>They are doing it in the process of 'open' secret to let US know of their capability to blackmail the world, make billions around the world suffer, including US citizens, so that US will stop preventing Iran from producing nuclear weapons.</p>
              <p>For their willingness to make us all suffer inorder to achieve their aims, it is an inhuman and despicable act. Billions of middle class and the poor are nothing more than pawns in their game.</p>
              <p>I say NO! to their atrocities against humanity. And I say NO! to them owning nuclear weapons. No one will be safe from them. I may starve and die from high prices, but the next generations will face a far greater threat - death from nuclear holocast from  a mad and inhuman Iranian leadership authorities!</p>
              <p>War is the only solution left. War is the only answer they respect. Then by the sword and the spillage of my blood, with others likeminded, in a legal authorised military expedition,  must the Iranian leadership be bowed and quartered so that billions may live in peace! </p>

              <p>2. Iran may not be democratic or its leader is the gold standard for any governance. But it is stupid to prevent a war tat is not likely to happen by starting the war.</p>
              <p>3. The oil belong to iran and they can sell at watever price they like. If u think they charge too high, then attack brunei first because they export oil too at tis price. Just because it is natural doesn't mean it has to be cheap. Gold, platinum, jade etc r not cheap. Why expect oil to be ?</p>
              <p>4. Almost everybody had claimed tat the oil is due to speculation from the general public. If u wanna find out who is the culprit, it can very well be the singaporean beside u  who r investing in commodity called crude oil</p>
              <p>5. If u wanna look at history, history shows british, US and israel not acting nicely either. Why does countries like china parkistan etc have the right to have nuclear power plant but iran can't ? Why they have nuclear power but iran cannot ? Israel has never deny it had nuclear asrenal as well</p>

              <p>I am disturbed by your ignorance  on the issue of Iran, but will not blame you if you choose to live a fantasy life looking through rose tinted glasses.</p>
              <p>1. Iran is a member of Opec, which is a cartel and like all cartel, it controls the price of oil. Although overtly it claims to let market forces determine the price, in actual fact, they practise controls by the amount of barrels as a measure to obtain the prices they want - meaning if the price they feel is too low, the limit production, creating demand, and if the price is too high, they expand production, which Saudi Arabia tried to do, but what was rejected by Iran not once, but several times. And each member of the cartel adheres to the wishes of its members. The more money they make, the better off each is and to hell with the world!</p>
              <p>2. Our technologies are built around the use of oil and its byproducts. Should inventors such as Edison realise that fuel will rise to $147/b, he would not had invented the light bulb! But unfortunately, our industries and technologies such as the awesome 4 stroke cycle internal combustion engine, were built requiring fuel, which then was less than a US$1 in the world. There is yet any feasible and mass marketable technology that uses alternative energy for our factories and manufacturing to re-tool, even if companies had the massive money to switch.</p>
              <p>Simply put, should oil rise to US$3000/b, and your salary is only S$2000/mth, would you still dare say Iran has the right to sell fuel at any price they wish?</p>
              <p>You may be filthy rich, but do spare a thought for others who are not. The apex at the top of social life is small and supported by a larger mass of humanity, such as the middle class and the poor at the bottom. If this base is not taken care of, you will have no supporting structure and will only fall hard to the ground in time!</p>
              <p>3. You do not seem to understand the difference between nuclear power station and nuclear strike capability. The world has no issue with Iran making its own nuclear power station so long as it maintains it securely and safely. But the world WILL NOT ALLOW Iran to own nuclear weapons, more so with their provened war mongering and intimidation of other states'  kind of leadership. The world must stop nuclear proliferation. The first step is to stop nations from aquiring them and the next, a more difficult step, isto disarm those that currently have nuclear weapons. Human beings don't need more WMD to go for MAD! ( Mutually Aided Destruction).</p>
              <p>4. There is no concrete evidence that the sun will die out in a billion years time. But by using logic and reasoning, scientist had been able to deduce the time frame on the lifespan of our sun. Similarly, Iran would be stupid to show overtly to the world that they are making billion of lives miserable. The world humans would have their leaders' heads on a pike if they show their hand in the manipulation of oil price.</p>
              <p>Thus they can only do it quietly and hidden, but such craftiness on a massive scale can not be hidden. Already there are evidences of their fingers on the cookie jar, based on logic and reasoning. If you have no wish to accept it, its your life, but others who are more discerning will be able to see through Iran's duplicity. </p>
              <p>5. Dealing in oil stocks is akin to promoting slavery, the demeaning of precious life itself. With the price above $65/b, it had caused many to go into poverty, and the poor dying of starvation.</p>
              <p>I am poor by choice, and not by circumstances, but there are many whom are poor by circumstances outside of Singapore in the world. They are bright and should have a chance in life, through education by escaping the poverty trap. But with high price of oil which increases all commodities of life, the poor do not stand a single chance! Whatever they earn, it goes into buying bread. Those who can't afford bread, they die in the streets. This is what high price of oil is doing to our fellow humans whom are middle classed or poor.</p>
              <p>Please do not deal in oil stocks. Alone, i cant do enough. With your help and awareness to your friends and they to their friends, we can make our world a better place of opportunity for all.</p>
              <p>I will shed my blood and do the fighting on your behalf if you do not wish to go to war with Iran. But you can help by telling your immediate friends and they their friends to stop dealing in misery and suffering to billions of other humans in the world.   </p>

              <p><br>PohAP, I had already replied to you on this matter. Please do not make me repeat again.</p>
              <p>I am a Singaporean and am fully aware of what those 'activists' are doing. I hold no quarrels with anyone who seek to realize political ambitions, only that he or she must offer credible and capable alternatives than the present administrators, and try to convince fully for our support.</p>
              <p>We are no longer as uneducated as our previous generations of the 60s. Thousands of students have to sit for the GP exams, which makes them study about the world around them to make them more aware of the 'big' picture.</p>
              <p>And we are now looking at the bigger picture of skyhigh oil prices and its effect on the middle classes and the poor, not only in Spore, but around the world. If we do not take care of this critical issue, we will all be dead from starvation to care about who administers our country.</p>
              <p>To wage war is not a lightly taken issue. It needs a critical mass of humans who are prepared to volunteer their blood on a justified cause. No government on Earth will just go to war easily, even if price of oil were to shoot to US$500/b, unlike countries such as Iran whom answers to no one, save themselves.</p>
              <p>There are many in the world whom are suffering the effects of high oil prices. No sane man would want to die from the bullet, even myself. But there are no longer any solutions left in the standoff created by belligrant Iran. Either we die from starvation later, or take our chances with the bullet, so that billions more may be saved with rational oil prices.</p>
              <p>And this is the bigger picture we MUST look at. We want freedom - freedom from hunger and poverty inflicted upon us all by Iran! and not for some petty full freedom of expression in local politics. I humbly apologise if i had offended anyone. My offence came from my grumbling empty stomach.   </p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Iran is a member of Opec, which is a cartel and like all cartel, it controls the price of oil. Although overtly it claims to let market forces determine the price, in actual fact, they practise controls by the amount of barrels as a measure to obtain the prices they want - meaning if the price they feel is too low, the limit production, creating demand, and if the price is too high, they expand production, which Saudi Arabia tried to do, but what was rejected by Iran not once, but several times. And each member of the cartel adheres to the wishes of its members. The more money they make, the better off each is and to hell with the world!</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Iran is a member and there r many members in OPEC. By wat u had said, then we should attack all members of OPEC, not iran solely</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Our technologies are built around the use of oil and its byproducts. Should inventors such as Edison realise that fuel will rise to $147/b, he would not had invented the light bulb! But unfortunately, our industries and technologies such as the awesome 4 stroke cycle internal combustion engine, were built requiring fuel, which then was less than a US$1 in the world. There is yet any feasible and mass marketable technology that uses alternative energy for our factories and manufacturing to re-tool, even if companies had the massive money to switch.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Light bulb uses electricity. In edison's time, they use coal more. Never plan to use alternative fuel... whose fault is it ? The oil user countries or the oil producing countries ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Simply put, should oil rise to US$3000/b, and your salary is only S$2000/mth, would you still dare say Iran has the right to sell fuel at any price they wish?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Iran is not the only seller of fuel. Why push the price of fuel to Iran's fault solely ? If such a hypothetical example comes about, either it means we r in WW3, end of the world or 200 years into the future where all fuel runs dry. In any of such cases, attacking iran won't solve anything</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You do not seem to understand the difference between nuclear power station and nuclear strike capability. The world has no issue with Iran making its own nuclear power station so long as it maintains it securely and safely. But the world WILL NOT ALLOW Iran to own nuclear weapons, more so with their provened war mongering and intimidation of other states'  kind of leadership. The world must stop nuclear proliferation. The first step is to stop nations from aquiring them and the next, a more difficult step, isto disarm those that currently have nuclear weapons. Human beings don't need more WMD to go for MAD! ( Mutually Aided Destruction).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>All the while Iran is claiming they r making nuclear power, not nuclear weapon. There is no evidence tat shows they r making nuclear weapon. US is diplomatically attacking iran because they wanna build a nuclear power plant</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Similarly, Iran would be stupid to show overtly to the world that they are making billion of lives miserable. The world humans would have their leaders' heads on a pike if they show their hand in the manipulation of oil price.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The world leaders do not know but u do ? How do u know ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Dealing in oil stocks is akin to promoting slavery, the demeaning of precious life itself. With the price above $65/b, it had caused many to go into poverty, and the poor dying of starvation.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Then call people not to speculate in oil, not call people to attack iran. Attacking iran will make the price shoot even higher</p>

              <p>In reply to your question, this is personal. If what that political party had done which harmed us all, starved us all, ANYONE would DARE go against them.</p>
              <p>But had they done so to us?</p>
              <p>I am not here to comment on freedom of expression. I only seek freedom from hunger and poverty for my fellow men, here in Spore and the world.</p>
              <p>PohAP, if you want to drag me into petty local politics, please desist. As i had mentioned, there is a bigger issue involved. Iran is happy to have a 10% elite ruling class luxuriating in wealth and the rest back to the middle ages as nomads, with technology not touching them.</p>
              <p>The rest of the world are infidels to them and we deserve not an ounce of concern. The only solution to make them care is WAR! </p>

              <p>actually xtreyier can you post some links to where you're getting all this supposed info about the Iran conspiracy?</p>
              <p>Frankly i do not agree with you at all regarding this matter and i'm more inclined to believe that America is responsible for the oil prices, they definitely have the funds and i could picture them pushing the oil prices to benefit the corporations over their own people. I'm not saying it's the truth, but it's definitely a more believeable scenario.</p>
              <p>Or we're simply just running out of cheap oil, which tops my list of believable scenarios.</p>
              <p>Letting the oil prices rise beyond control would only benefit OPEC in the short term. It has happened before during the 1973 oil embargo</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis</p>
              <p>It was meant to teach the West a lesson for supporting Israel but it backfired badly on them when it encouraged countries to be more efficient, seek alternative oil sources and spark interest for renewable energy. OPEC learned their lessons after this.</p>
              <p>You are letting your beliefs blind you. Threats of extermination are thrown around less often in a Pre school, it's just alpha male posturing. I believe Iran just wants nuclear power to avoid being carved up like Iraq , which is only fair. Not to say i can't see the possible messed up stituations that could arise but i can see their reasoning.</p>
              <p>Like what Royfang has kindly put up, their government is a lot more mature than what you would like to believe. But rational voices simply cannot be heard when their country cannot even get dialysis machines because of the economic embargo imposed upon them.</p>
              <p>Seriously Poh Ah Pak, could you not try to turn this thread into about the PAP? This is about global issues and it's a lot bigger than Singapore.</p>
