              <p><br>If there was clear cut evidences on Iran manipulation on oil prices, do you think i would still be here? The war on Iran would had been long over and oil price back to $80 per barrel!</p>
              <p>I do not just make claim without reason and logic. Many times, for the ordinary laymen, we have to read between the lines, and figure out from numerous seemingly unrelated sources to search for clues and analyse each data. No one or country will just lay everything on the table for you find. You have to search.</p>
              <p>Let me take you on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">brief</span> chronological journey into the deprivations of the Iranian leadership.</p>
              <p>1.) Iran exports 2.5million barrels of oil a day. At $80/b for the last 5 years, each yr they would have a state revenue of $70 billion dollars -US$70,000,000,000 on oil alone. Setting aside $50billion in their treasury, it would mean a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">war chest of US$250billion</span> to play in manipulation of international affairs.</p>
              <p>Social spending is atrocious - WTO rank them 93rd on health care alone. Population of 70million, with an area of 1.6million sq km, there are still slums, beggars and poverty. Thus, much of it's money is not into social spending, but it seems for other nefarious purposes. ( 12million below poverty line)</p>
              <p>2.) I will not touch on their nuclear ambition debacle for it is already widely known.</p>
              <p>3.) The spike in oil prices began in 2005. Oil only average around $40/b but shot up to $50/b. This was also the same time the Bushrer Nuclear Power station in Iran was completed and the row over suspected nuclear weapon production began.</p>
              <p>4. )June 2007, oil shot up to $80 and by July 08, it peaked $147/b. At June 07, Talks between Iran and the west over the nuclear weapons issue had broken down.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/22/iran.ewenmacaskill">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/22/iran.ewenmacaskill</a></p>
              <p>-an indication of things to come by Iran.</p>
              <p>5.)Jan 08 saw the new year started with price rice in non-oil related staples - food. And soon everything else followed, for oil had a touch in everything. It is a daily use staple. Opec kindheartedly tried to increase output, but someone put a stop to it.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14036">http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14036</a></p>
              <p>6. ) By April, the world was suffering. Opec listened, but again, someone refused.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=226002&amp;s=b&amp;i=&amp;t=Iran_rejects_calls_for_OPEC_action_over_oil_price">http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=226002&amp;s=b&amp;i=&amp;t=Iran_rejects_calls_for_OPEC_action_over_oil_price</a></p>
              <p>7.) This is an intelligence report gathered from a credible agency that does paid biz as advisors for MNCs and investors. I didn't want to reveal my sources initially, but i hope i did not put the author at risk.</p>

              <p><br>If there was clear cut evidences on Iran manipulation on oil prices, do you think i would still be here? The war on Iran would had been long over and oil price back to $80 per barrel!</p>
              <p>I do not just make claim without reason and logic. Many times, for the ordinary laymen, we have to read between the lines, and figure out from numerous seemingly unrelated sources to search for clues and analyse each data. No one or country will just lay everything on the table for you find. You have to search.</p>
              <p>Let me take you on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">brief</span> chronological journey into the deprivations of the Iranian leadership.</p>
              <p>1.) Iran exports 2.5million barrels of oil a day. At $80/b for the last 5 years, each yr they would have a state revenue of $70 billion dollars -US$70,000,000,000 on oil alone. Setting aside $50billion in their treasury, it would mean a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">war chest of US$250billion</span> to play in manipulation of international affairs.</p>
              <p>Social spending is atrocious - WTO rank them 93rd on health care alone. Population of 70million, with an area of 1.6million sq km, there are still slums, beggars and poverty. Thus, much of it's money is not into social spending, but it seems for other nefarious purposes. ( 12million below poverty line)</p>
              <p>2.) I will not touch on their nuclear ambition debacle for it is already widely known.</p>
              <p>3.) The spike in oil prices began in 2005. Oil only average around $40/b but shot up to $50/b. This was also the same time the Bushrer Nuclear Power station in Iran was completed and the row over suspected nuclear weapon production began.</p>
              <p>4. )June 2007, oil shot up to $80 and by July 08, it peaked $147/b. At June 07, Talks between Iran and the west over the nuclear weapons issue had broken down.</p>

              <p>-an indication of things to come by Iran.</p>
              <p>5.)Jan 08 saw the new year started with price rice in non-oil related staples - food. And soon everything else followed, for oil had a touch in everything. It is a daily use staple. Opec kindheartedly tried to increase output, but someone put a stop to it.</p>

              <p>6. ) By April, the world was suffering. Opec listened, but again, someone refused.</p>

              real trouble at that time, they had borrowed a lot of money and they

              because it would alienate the US, <strong>to advocating higher prices.</strong> </em></p>

              <p>3. On point 6, Iran can sell oil at higher prices why not? they can buy more missiles...</p>
              <p>4. Iran has other spending such as weapons acquisitions, various research works, even if they do have that fat purse, they will be buying oil at a much higher premium than the amt they sold. isnt it more convenient that they should just stop production all together,this will certainlty spike prices and yet, Iran has not even slowed its production significantly.</p>
              <p>5. if anyone is to be blamed, blame the US, it is the mess they created,<br>-overleverage causing subprime that cripples its own economy, then print more money<br>-invasion of IRAQ. disrupting oil production</p>
              <p>Infact why the oil spiked is still a mystery, until we can say on hindsight, we can only speculate... IMO though, this oil bubble is like the commodity and technology we have in the past, its part of the economic cycle.</p>

              <p>If a bomb was dropped on Xtreyier's house with his family members still inside, Xtreyier may add 'No' before 'War on Iran please!'.</p>
              <p>Forget about morality. Capitalist-wise, fact is the U.S. has run out of resources to wage another big war since there are already too many dollar bills flooding the world. Each bomb means that the U.S. would have to print more money to build and fly a bomber (oil involved again) to drop it on the innocent Iranians. Then each cent of the money spent will add more to the sea of falling dollars.</p>

              <p>Thats why i said "TS is using his intuition, you can say he is guessing." You probably just filter through huh? Im not using my analogy to justify a reason for war. Im asking poh ah pak to be open to probability and not just base on history as a solution to everything.</p>

              <p>Fat lie or not. At least we know the Iraqis now at least have the chance to recieve proper education, safer neighbourhood and freedom.</p>
              <p>No one is perfect, same goes to US for making such accusations that turned out to be false. But because of this war, you are able to differentiate the real threat the world is now facing, that is terrorism. People die its inevitable, but the sacrifice made can save x times the lives of their future generation of Iraqis.</p>
              <p>Just look at China, they are even preparing for a terrorise attack drill for the Olympics.</p>
