              <p>Since i had started on a campaign for war on the Iranian leadership, the price of oil had dropped from $147 to $128/b last week. Today it had risen back to $130.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, just perhaps, many had done very well to bombard pension funds, SWFs, speculators on oil to stop propping up oil which is casing suffering, pain and recession in our world. They had shown heart finally. Someone, however, is still hell bent on pushing up oil prices. Or it could be some speculators are still being heartless.</p>
              <p>Throughout this thread, i had proven how critical oil, a staple item is. We are unable yet to re-tool our machineries for yet avaliable technologies using alternative energies.</p>
              <p>To have oil at above $65/b now is a crime against mass humanity, causing factories and transportation to close down, billions jobless, humanity starved with the rise in everything else to match fuel rise.</p>
              <p>The days of peak 'surface oil' will soon be over. But there is still evidence of massive amounts of oil under our geological ground. Even Antartica is stilll untapped for surface oil.</p>
              <p>The world needs time to switch, time to save up funds, time for research into alternative energy and time to educate on not to waste our planet's resource. But with oil prices at current price, there is not enough time for anything else but humanity to starve!</p>
              <p>Furthermore, oil spiked anomously within months! - a clear indication of man's manipulation. It was blamed on India and China's industralization demand. But India and China did not simply industralized overnight! It had been growing since the 80s and for the past 30 years, oil had averaged only $65/b. With that prices, there were new oil fields discover in Russia and Myanmar, and several other places on our planet. So how then can such a reason of 'industralization demand' be true?</p>
              <p>So please, help spread the word, not to deal in oil stocks. There are many other ways to become rich, but dealing in oil is dealing in the misery and suffering of our world!</p>
              <p>Iran is the cause of our suffering. Humanity needs to go to war with Iran. The price of oil will rise perhaps for a few short months, but it will eventually fall to rational levels, as it did in the past with the Iran-Iraq invasion, US-Afghanistan terrorism war, US-Iraq war, etc.</p>
              <p>I have nothing against the iranian citizens, only with their dictatorial and facist obscenly wealthy leadership that is willing to murder the world and even their own kind for supremacy.</p>
              <p>When war is declared, the iranian citizens will be given sufficient time for the rich to fly to safer countries, the poor to hide under ground or move to safer areas. They must locked up their homes, and no soldier will rob even a chair of their belongings.</p>
              <p>Once the war and bombings stopped, reconstruction will begin, and the iranian oil wealth will be re-distributed back to the iranian citizens. The war is not about robbing Iran, but to rationalise oil price, so that the iranian citizens and the world inhabitants can share a win-win situation on oil price for the sake of progress and continuation of our human race on planet Earth.</p>
              <p>But for those who harbour or fight against the world, will be treated as combatants and dealt accordingly. We will fight, otherwise, we will all starve. The iranian leadership must be stopped!!!</p>

              <p>Extremist? Far from it. NOT one foot will step on Iran soil other than a legally approved military expedition to eradicate the Iranian leadership.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are not the only ones suffering from high oil prices. The rest of the world is suffering as well. Diplomacy is but a game of delay for Iran while the middle classes and the poor starve. This war is not about religion, politics, or anything else, but oil, which is a staple item for the world, kept and manipulated high for Iran which is playing its deadly nuclear weapon obtaining game.</p>
              <p>At least i call for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">legal military sanctioned action on Iran</span>, which is not a light matter, and needs to be debated within human race' leaderships. There may be others who are not as rational as me, and might do stuff which hurt their own countries and citizens instead of finding out who are the actual ones to be blamed, in seeking for a solution to their suffering.</p>
              <p>The only solution is WAR WITH IRAN! I am not asking you to fight. There will be billions other who are suffering now and prepared to go. I and others likeminded will fight on your behalf. You can hide first and later when the war is won, you will survive to reap the benefits. Support the war now, or we will be thrown back to the dark middle ages of using candles, animals as machines, and kept stupid the way the nomadic Iranian leadership wants the world to be!</p>

              <p>1st you are trying to inflict terror by supporting this so called war... Doenst that make you a terrorist? An extremist does not mean that its about religion, race etc. Its about an idea of their own and going to do the extreme to get whatever it is to fulfill that idea... It really sounds like you...</p>
              <p>And the bold statement is back to you... How can you really be 100% confirm its the Iranians fault in the increase of oil??? It seems more of the world actions put together that causes this... Dont forget the fact that our oil is too depleting... Lesser oil + more demand = higher prices...</p>
              <p>As I've said, do more reseach... Dont just blame it on one source...</p>
              <p>You say if we dont attack iran then we will be thrown back to the dark middle ages? Come on... Look at what you are saying? If there's a war, Iran will stop distributing its oil = hike in oil price than ever before... Look at it strategically, dont be so stupid and irrational to go on all out war... Know the consequences of war first before going for one...</p>
              <p>from your statements, it seems that you have a personal vendetta against the iranians and i am sure it didnt started with oil prices... As i have said, you are in your own world, Go get help!</p>
              <p>I will never support war! esp this one...</p>

There won't be enough money in our treasury to continue to support us forever! No point bankrupting our next generations' future, because they may find a way to beat the oil noose.</p>

              <p>IF NOT,  then i will stay silent, stop my campaign, and would rather starve to death THAN to see my fellow citizens taxed to the hilt to support the poor like me, when the actual cause of our suffering is the Iranian leadership! There won't be enough money in our treasury to continue to support us forever! No point bankrupting our next generations' future, because they may find a way to beat the oil noose.</p>
              <p>White soul, i respect your entitlement to your views. You had your say, i had mine. Now let others think. You call me stupid or whatever, but the facts are self evident.</p>

              <p><br>yes, oil prices have increased, but have i have said many times, what is the strong proof that Iran is SOLELY responsible for oil price hike? This is not proven and you want to attack Iran?</p>
              <p>There are many factors too that cause the price hike in oil... And you are too stubborn to look at it objectively.... There's no fact that points out that Iran is the SOLE cause for this...</p>

              <p>By your defination, US WW2 allied soldiers are nothing more than terrorists, our very own Force 136 are terrorists. You are also further insulting our own army, sworn to protect our citizens from external harm, as a terrorist organisation!</p>
              <p>We are already under attack by Iran, through its manipulation of Opec and oil prices. Many in the world are already suffering the effects of high oil prices. How long more must we bow before the Iranian leadership's despicable attempt to destroy the human race through starvation?</p>
              <p>The difference between me and Mas is that while Mas is prepared to kill just about anyone, man,woman and children, for an extremist view, outside the laws of humanity, i am not prepared to do so, as i had explain already in my earlier posts. </p>

              <p>TS, are you doing an survey online on behalf of government?</p>
              <p>I can tell you no one will believe that US want to attack Iran because of all these rubbish. Iranians are living fine under the leadership of the current democrati-elected government. Iran has learnt the lesson of Iraq, knowing that Iraq invaded by US because they don't have weapon of massive destruction to protect their oil. If US want to go against the world and launch another war again, they will incur even more casualties compare to Iraq war.<br>Anyway, glad that Bush is out soon.</p>

              <p>First i am branded a terrorist. Now i am alleged as working on behalf of the government.</p>
              <p>Let me clarify once and for all. I act on my own and am fully and solely responsible for my own personal views based on what i perceived and research from credible sources. I am here only excercising my freedom of expression, which seems to be an exclusive right only for the anti-PAP group here. Last time i log in, this site is Sgforum, and not Anti-PAP forum.</p>
              <p>I only seek 2 freedom - freedom from poverty and freedom from starvation, not only for myself, but for my fellow poor and middle classes here in Spore and the world. I leave the other freedoms for you and other experts here to propound.</p>
              <p>I have no solution to the oil price rise other than those i proposed. Should one day the national concensus is for war with Iran and are looking for recruits, they know where to find me.</p>
              <p>It doesnt matter if i am sent in as a frontline assualt commando if found capable, or as a latrine digger for the hygiene of our troops. But there must be action that will elevate our sufferings and safeguard our future and our next generations future as well as those of billions around the world suffering under Iran leadership's manipulation of high oil price.</p>

              <p>You and some here seem to be the experts here, so i will leave it in your expert hands to present such views to others. I am not interested in who rules the country or against anyone ruling the country or how this small little red dot is run by the law.</p>
              <p>I am poor and with only minimal education. I am more keen on finding out where my next honest meal will come from, caused by the suffering inflicted by Iran, pushing the lower middle classes into abject poverty.</p>
              <p>If Iranians are happy with their leaders, as alluded by Display_Name who call the rest of the world as infidels and frequently open about wiping out and murdering an entire ethnic group, man, woman and child off this planet, manipulate Opec to raise oil price making the world suffer, then i have nothing else to say about the author of such a post.</p>

              <p>Hey xtreyier,</p>
              <p>i'm kinda still waiting to see where you've been getting this info about Iran. Because i'm interested in knowing what sort of website could give you these sort of ideas, and quite frankly it's pretty messed up.</p>
              <p>It makes you feel special does it? Such beliefs. Makes you feel like you're some holy warrior that somehow sees a way to save the world while anyone else who doesn't see it that way is pitied by you because they can't perceive the Great Truth? The more we point out you're wrong the more you feel like you're being persecuted for saying the unpleasure truth and by holding on to your beliefs it makes you feel special ?</p>
              <p>It'd be interesting now to note that you now have more in common with those you wish to fight so much in Iran. Congratulations.</p>

              <p>There is a delicate balance between oil and food prices. Thus oil producing nations and food producing nations must find that delicate balance. Rising up one staple, the other staple will rise and everyone else in the world will suffer, espacially the working middle classes and the unlucky poor.</p>
              <p>Some countries such as the gulf states ( except Iran who doesn't care about their own people or anyone else) are using their wealth to buy land in food producing nations, to produce only food FOR THEMSELVES. But at what costs to other humans for nations that don't own oil and food? Are these humans such as me not worth a life, live on grubs and worms? What freedom is the world talking about? </p>
              <p>Our technologies are built and manufactured using oil and its byproducts for energy. The world has yet to find an alternative commercially viable energy resource. Must the world's non-oil producing nations suffer in the hands such of the terrorist national leaders of Iran and their manipulation of oil stocks, even when there are still vast ambiotic deposits under our planet?</p>
              <p>We are all the same race, and have a right to live and a fruitful life. There will be NO vigilante action, but If we are denied such right, then we would have to fight as one nation or several nations. And our leaders must stand up for our rights, or we will perish as a nation and a human race.</p>

              <p>In the Straits Times report yesterday 24 Jul 08, within the business section, you would have read a report from the US task force on going investigation on the oil price hike. If you are the discerning type, you would have glean some supporting facts on Iran's manipulation of oil prices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Oil demand.</span></p>
              <p>According to the task force, oil demand grew only 3.9% last year. Now, how do you explain oil price skyrocket to est 220% (US147/b) from avg of US65/b?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Speculators are selling rather than buying</span></p>
              <p>If the speculators are selling more than buying, then why did the price of oil rose from $65 to $147 within a few short months?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. US$250billion, NOT million, in commodity futures market.</span></p>
              <p>According to the commissioner of Commodity Futures Trading Commission, there was a presence of $250 billion that was not there just a few years ago. Where did these money came from?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Oil supply</span></p>
              <p>The task force claims that 'sluggish' output resulted to demands for oil not met. However, Opec, through its chairman, Saudi Arabia, had continuously wanted to raise output, but one member rejected, not once, but several times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had asked the questions, you think about it. If you want my answers, there are:-</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.</span> It is utter nonsense that demand for oil at only 3.9% will result in a 220% price increase. Such actions smack of market speculation. Consumer demand may had increased, but a consumer have only so many hours to play with his toys.</p>
              <p>a.)Simple Example, factory A produces cathode ray tube tv and requires 1000 barrels of oil to manufacture last year. Factory B produces flat screen TV and requires 1000 barrels of oil to produce this year. Total it seems that 2000 barrels of oil demand is present today. But such logic is flawed, because the consumer would had bought flat screen and the CRT TV would had gone bust.</p>
              <p>Thus there was still only 1000 barrels of oil required! There is such thing as consumer demand, but such demand replaces obsolete technologies making them close shop, and thus no oil required for them.</p>
              <p>b.) Claims that there more people being affluent, eg, China, but the fact is that there are many more being pushed into penury.</p>
              <p>c.) Claims that there are more births, but there are also human mortalities.</p>
              <p>So how much is 'consumer demand' at fault?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.</span> Self explanatory</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.</span> Speculators do not have such funds to play oil futures as shown in my previous posts. Hedge funds do not have so many billions to play with, nor do they stake their entire funds into commodities, the most riskiest of all stocks to play! SWF are even worse, for they answer to the electorate and will play small sums. So who is left? Every country needs oil and would be stupid to run up the price of oil. Only Iran ( whom answers to nobody except their absent God) has the motive and capability to inject the market with BILLIONS!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.</span> The members who reject calls for output are none other than Iran and his silly sidekick Venuezela.</p>
              <p>I am aware that the truth is uncomfortable. I too wish all these are not true. But we cannot live in denial. Its ok if we alone suffer, but we, whom are humans with emotions, cannot, will not, and must not turn a blind eye to others who are living in misery and suffering over the high price of oil and the effect of starvation caused by it.</p>
              <p>Help tell others about the atrocity caused by Iran. And should oil price continue to rise above $65/b, the only solution left is War. I stand ready to fight on your behalf with a legally authorised military expedition to fight for our rights to live as a human and not as dogs to Iran!</p>
