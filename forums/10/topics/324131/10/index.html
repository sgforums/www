              <p>Hmm... how about the whole world speculates ? The common man with some spare cash and invest in oil as he believe it is gonna rise ? 1/2 a year ago it is already pretty clear tat oil and commodities r worth investing. Heck people r investing in them now. Furthermore, u completely exaggerate the amount of money Iran has. Your argument on who has the money to invest really holds no water at all.</p>

              <p>I would agree readily on your speculation 'that the whole world speculates'. But we are talking about 1000 barrels per stock lot, and even at $80/b, that would be US$80,000 for just one lot. Who would dare such risks for one lot?  US$80,000 can buy you several other better ROI lots. That leaves out a significant portion of the world, to invest in oil. Today it would be US$143,000 per lot. It would shot to US$200/b. Do you yourself dare put such money in today? Or have such money?</p>
              <p>2.5million a day is what Iran produces, and it is state owned. that would be US$70billion, not million, at US$80/b for one year. Since 1979's independence, it has been 29 years. Go figure how much they have in their treasury, with a population of only 70million people and how much social spending they truly spend on the people. Even with a first world treasury, they have very much lower rankings in almost all areas of social spending as compared to first world economies.</p>
              <p>I completely exaggerate or do you completely live in a fantasy world see things through rose tinted glasses? </p>

              <p>Aiyoh... u think the gov spend 0 on their country ya ? U think they don't have army, dont buy weopons, don't pay their staff, don't build schools, don't build mosque, don't build roads, don't build TV station, don't build radio, don't build police station, don't build fire department, don't build hospital etc etc etc. Iran is not as rural as i think.</p>
              <p>29 years ago, oil is not at 80 per barrel. They also went a nearly 10 years war with iraq. And finally, singapore itself has a higher GDP than 129 billion in a year (2 times your 70 billion) while Iran is much bigger with more people than singapore.</p>

              <p>1. As the US govt will be investigating, you will know for sure who these 'financial speculators' and their relationship.</p>
              <p>2. The average price of oil for the past 29 years is $65/b, from 1979 to 2006. Thus they would still have earned a state revenue of US$60 billion, not million, per year on just oil alone. Assuming 40% is used for savings, it would be $24 billion a year and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">US$700 billion, not million, in the kitty today after 29 years,</span> excluding dividends earned which they would most surely be invested. </p>
              <p>3. Your GDP estimates are disputable. Spore's GDP for 2007 is US$172 billion while Iran stands at US$278 billion. They have other resources and manufacturing production output as well, such as being the 2nd largest natural gas producer in the world, and agricultural production. In terms of wealth, we are no where compared to Iran. But in other areas, we are definately far ahead.</p>
              <p>4. How many billions would it take to provide for 58million people and 12 million living below poverty line? How much can they spend on military when they cannot purchase western arms and have to make their own? What is their international ranking in terms of social spendings? Disreputable at best.</p>
              <p>Thus Iran do have the capability and wealth to move the oil market on a daily basis. </p>

              <p>Since i started the threat, perhaps i make the conclusion?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Iran is the cause of everyone in the world's suffering from the effects of high oil prices. If not for them, oil would have been sustainable at US$60/barrel, according to Opec.</p>
              <p>They have the motive and the capability to move the market and are responsible for the anomalous spike in the price of oil. Their purpose is to force the world to let them own nuclear weapons, in a world that is determined to stop nuclear proliferation, more so with irresponsible leaders such as they had shown themselves to be.</p>
              <p>Should we still not make war on their leadership, we will all die of starvation. Either we fight now or we will starve to death later when agricultural nations fight back against rise in oil prices by raising food prices.</p>
              <p>By destroying the Iranian leadership and redistributing its wealth back to the citizens, Iran will no longer have the capability to manipulate international affairs that will kill us all. Others seeking to profit from the misery of others will not dare such attempts again, for there are people who are prepared to fight for a just cause to save billions other. Price of oil will stabilise at sustainable levels, with controls on speculation.</p>
              <p>Win the war, and take our chances with terrorism, with a 50% chance to survive terrorism, or die later doing nothing, which is a 100% chance of sure death, espacially for the common people and their next generations.</p>
              <p>For those who are rich enough to pay high prices or hide under the table types, prefer to be bought by Iranian agents to form anti-war lobbies and websites, there is no requirement for you to join the fight. You can hide away and when the war is won, to reap the benefits. This war requires not everyone to fight. Just everyone to support a just cause, shed blood so that billions other around the world may live and not starve. </p>

              <p>The oil price hike follows on from a combination of concerns over a
              weak US dollar, surging oil demand and fears about supply disruptions
              in the Middle East and Africa. Renewed militanyt activities in Nigeria have threaten to cut oil supplies.</p>

              <p>While there are concerns that Israel may be planning to attack Iran's nuke facilities only, the threat to oil supply disruption again comes from the Iranian leaders to block the Strait Of Hormuz, limiting oil export from other Arab nations in the Gulf.</p>

              <p>Sanctions were imposed on Iran long ago for overthrowing the Shah and for sponsoring terrorism. The latest sanction is just an expansion of the sanction already imposed.</p>
              <p>There was a cold  war but not a nuclear war. No nuclear superpower wants to make the first strike. There's no victory in a nuclear war.</p>
              <p>Iran is special because it's nuke plan is for destroying a nation but that nation probably already have enough nukes to wipe Iran off the map.</p>
              <p>If Israel decides to unilaterally strike Iran's nuke facilities, it's to save the Israelis as well as the ordinary Iranians from extinction.</p>
              <p>You can criticise Israel and the US as much as you want. Don't skip the fact that during the Arab- Israeli wars, Iran supported the Arabs. In the Iraq-<em>Iran</em> war, the Gulf states supported Iraq. When Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Kuwaitis and the Saudis asked Uncle Sam for help.</p>
