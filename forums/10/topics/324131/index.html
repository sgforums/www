              <p>There is no use saving fuel or oil price will drop, simply because Iran, the bad belligrant boy of the middle east hell bent on making nuclear weapons, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is buying up oil when the price drops, creating a demand, then sell back when it is high.</span></p>
              <p>They have such resources because they have a hell lot of money in their treasury. They don't bother about social spending, and faced international sanctions. So with these monies, they use it to push oil to stratraphoric heights! And it will continue, bleeding the rest of the world dry due to high prices increases due to the use of it in almost everything we need, from manufacturing to food.</p>
              <p>Thus, the evil Iranian leadership and those iranians who support nuclear arms MUST BE STOPPED!  They are the ones responsible for our woes and suffering. War is inevitable!</p>
              <p>Objectives of war:</p>
              <p>-----------------------</p>
              <p>1. Destroy the Iranian leadership</p>
              <p>2. Take control of the country's wealth</p>
              <p>3. Distribute the wealth to the iranian citizens through social spending.</p>
              <p>4. Install a more responsible leadership in Iran, in tune to the world.</p>
              <p>Phases of Operation</p>
              <p>------------------------</p>
              <p><strong>(D-day -181 days)</strong></p>
              <p>a. Source out every iranian subsidiary overt and hidden dealing in oil purchase.</p>
              <p>b. Source out an Iranian exile capable of leadership in Iran</p>
              <p><strong>(D-day -1 day)</strong></p>
              <p>a.Freeze all assets of Iran and fuel dealing iranians or their accomplices.</p>
              <p><strong>(D-day)</strong></p>
              <p>a. Declare war on Iran.</p>
              <p><strong>(D-day +7)</strong></p>
              <p>a. Infiltrate Iran and destroy all SAM sites.</p>
              <p><strong>(D-day +14)</strong></p>
              <p>a. Destroy all airfields and military installations by air</p>
              <p><strong>(D-day+28)</strong></p>
              <p>a. Troops take command of Teheran and seats of government</p>
              <p>b. Install exile leader.</p>
              <p>c. Send 30,000 troops to each of the 30 iranian provinces and quell discontent.</p>
              <p>d. Initiate social spending for the iranian people - education and employment. Set up a constitution based on secular rule with full rights to all.</p>
              <p>e. Stabalise oil price. </p>
              <p><strong>(D-day +365)</strong></p>
              <p>a. Pullout from Iran and let Iran determine its own future, so long as it does not intend to kill the rest of the world.</p>
              <p>Russia will voice opposition, but only voice, as oil price increase also hurt their social spendings.</p>
              <p>Venezula is a nutcase and has no military might.</p>
              <p>As i propose this war, either multi-lateral as an UN force or unilateral, as a few countries led, I volunteer to be the on the frontlines as a footsoldier, even to destroy the SAM sites if i am found capable enough.</p>
              <p>There is no point living this life facing unending increases needlessly, not only for myself but my fellow citizens as well, as well as future generations. Iran is the cause of our suffering, so IRAN MUST DIE!!!! </p>

              <p>There can be no peace if the Iran leadership continues to blapheme and use God to justify their actions to their citizens. The time for talk had been long over!</p>
              <p>How long do you want to continue to pay through your nose and be a slave to Iran?</p>
              <p>Like a toothache, war is a painful situation that will heal in time. If you don't take steps to extract the tooth, your pain will be forever.</p>
              <p>Alone, i am useless. But i am prepared to go to the frontlines with likeminded others to make a difference. Whether i live or die is immaterial. Others must be able to live a life i had before the oil prices skyrocketed and made lives miserable for everyone else. The iranian leadership must die so that billion others in the world may survive!</p>

              <p>Demand of oil from US is contributing to the hike in price. Their subsidy on oil isn't making it better. That reminds me of a certain northern neighbour too. Duh.</p>

              Fully agree with xtreyier..iran's devil regime has to be destroyed b4 the world get destroyed.Its nuclear ambitions is meant to threaten world peace and if I'm not wrong the Bible predicted that the end of the world will start with Middle East.
              
              Iran's president and government are extremely arrogant and their display of firing of missiles infact implies they fear being attacked by Isarel or U.S,Iran must definitely be stopped if not by 2010 they can definitely produce the nuclear bombs.When US starts carpeting bombing them togther with Israel,Iran will be like another Iraq,we expect to find president Of Iran hiding in another man's hole.

              <p><br>China will become the next superpower of the world and China understand that in order to become the next superpower, they will need plenty of oil and resources. Currently the average Chinese consume about 2 barrels a year, while the american is consuming 25 barrels.</p>
              <p>They are only extracting oil from existing well, which can only statisfy a small fraction of what they are consuming. However the democrat has not given the green light to drill new wells and pump oil from proven oil reserves in Alaska.  </p>
              <p>From what I read, USA is importing about US$700b or 5 billion barrels of crude oil per year.</p>

              <p>I dont see why Russia, India and Japan are the problem. In fact, I would have think that Japan will need to engage China more because China will eventually become the world largest economy, especially for the automobile industry. While Russia on the other hand, need allies against the america because of the missile defence program which America is promoting in Europe.</p>
              <p>As for india, they will be too busy with their internal politics and Pakistan.</p>
