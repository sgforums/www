Everything is possible.<br><br>Remember the Yishun MRT incident? We prevented that. But why on earth did they choose this MRT station? Why didn't they choose a station that will disrupt us? That's the uncertainty that we can't match. We always think they will choose something that will cause the maximum destruction, but their choice has shown that they don't work this way.<br><br>No matter how alert we are, someone will definitely get through.

It is undefined and cannot be left to personal interpretation by public servants who might be beholden by employments to bosses to observe strict and accountable principles of justice.</div>

Everything is possible.<br><br>Remember the Yishun MRT incident? We prevented that. But why on earth did they choose this MRT station? Why didn't they choose a station that will disrupt us? That's the uncertainty that we can't match. We always think they will choose something that will cause the maximum destruction, but their choice has shown that they don't work this way.<br><br>No matter how alert we are, someone will definitely get through. We can't predict that. We can limit that, through intelligence. But how far can intelligence go? We can have checks, but can you limit creativity? A normal ball point pen can trigger a bomb.<br><br>In everything, there's lose, there's gain. We lost lives, but we gained experience. We know how to deal with this situation if it happens again.

They complain about wire taps on Al Qaeda and torture of terrorists for information. I hope they learn another hard lesson for their stupidity.<br><br></div>
