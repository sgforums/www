Internally generated goodwill should not be capitalised and internally developed intangible assets should be capitalised only where they have a readily ascertainable market value. </a><br><br><a href="http://www.frc.org.uk/asb/technical/standards/pub0108.html" rel="nofollow">FRS 11 sets out the principles and methodology for accounting for impairments of fixed assets and goodwill. It replaces the previous approach whereby diminutions in value were recognised only if they were regarded as permanent. Instead, the carrying amount of an asset is compared with its recoverable amount and, if the carrying amount is higher, the asset is written down. </a><br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/PagesfromSIA_AR_9900.png"></div>
