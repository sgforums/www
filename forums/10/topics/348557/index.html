              <h1>Dismantling the myths of the PAP system</h1>
              <p><strong>By Fang Zhi Yuan</strong></p>
              <p>For far too long, the autocratic regime and its sycophantic
              mouthpiece have dominated political discourse in Singapore. They have
              been the ones to set the agenda for the populace to believe in with no
              questions asked.</p>
              <p>In the face of the worst economic recession Singapore has ever
              experienced, let us revisit the myths which has been propagated and
              perpetuated about the necessity and merits of the “PAP system” of
              governance in order for them to maintain their political hegemony.</p>
              <p>The 5 myths below have been often repeated ad nauseaum till they are
              deeply etched in the collective consciousness of Singaporeans:</p>
              <p>1. Singaporeans owe a debt to Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP from transforming Singapore from a third to first world country.</p>
              <p>2. Singapore needs to open its doors to the global economy in order to enjoy years of uninterrupted economic growth.</p>
              <p>3. Singapore cannot afford to spend more to help needy Singaporeans to prevent going down the slippery slope of welfare.</p>
              <p>4. Singapore needs a strong one-party state to ensure social stability and economic progress.</p>
              <p>5. Only the PAP knows how to govern the nation. The opposition is
              irresponsible and will fritter away our precious reserves by the
              billions if they were to come to power one day.</p>
              <p>Now let us dissect and dismantle the myths one by one.</p>
              <p>1. With due respect to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, he has put together a
              capable and formidable team in the early years of Singapore’s
              independence to kickstart our economy, but he can hardly take the
              credit all by himself.</p>
              <p>The true architect of Singapore’s success story is Albert Winsemius,
              a Dutch economist who was a long-term Chief economic adviser to
              Singapore from 1961 to 1984, playing a major role in the formulation of
              Singapore’s national economic development strategy.</p>
              <p>With his help, Singapore attracted big oil companies like Shell and
              Esso to establish refineries here. In the 1970s, Singapore was
              upgrading its industrial capacity to use higher technological methods,
              including electronics. He personally went to persuade large Dutch
              electronics companies like Philips to set up production plants in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>He also proposed that Singapore could be developed as a financial
              centre, as well as an international centre for air traffic and sea
              transport. Over the next twenty years, these predictions proved to be
              accurate.</p>
              <p>Singapore also owed its success to the PAP Old Guards like Mr Goh
              Keng Swee, Mr Toh Chin Chye, Mr E W Barker, Mr Ong Pang Boon and Mr Hon
              Sui Sen who were Lee’s “lieutanents” in office and a docile,
              sensible, hardworking and thrifty citizenry willing to work hard and
              save up for the sake of the next generation.</p>
              <p>Under British colonial rule, Singapore is already a major trading
              entrepot in the region by virtue of its unbeatable strategic position
              at the tip of the Malay Peninsula thereby giving it leverage to control
              shipping traffic passing through the Straits of Malacca, one of the
              busiest sea lanes in the world.</p>
              <p>To attribute Singapore’s success over the years solely to Mr Lee
              Kuan Kew is not only a travesty of truth and justice, but an insult to
              our pioneers and ordinary Singaporeans on the streets who have given
              their sweats, blood and tears to build our nation to where it is today.</p>
              <p>2. As a small island with no natural resources, we are heavily
              dependent on external trade for our survival and prosperity. It is true
              especially in the early years when political stability, social cohesion
              and economic openness are key factors propelling us ahead of our
              competitors.</p>
              <p>However, our vulnerabilities become clearly exposed now in the
              current global economic turmoil when Singapore becomes the first
              country in Asia to slip into recession and is poised to be one of the
              worst performing economies in the near future.</p>
              <p>Singapore will be more resilient if we have a higher domestic
              consumption, a more diversified economy and vibrant home-grown
              enterprises to cushion the fallout from the loss in exports and trade.</p>
              <p>The deficiencies of our economic model are caused by the narrow
              mindset and myopic view adopted by the PAP to pursue growth at all
              costs in the shortest possible time.</p>
              <p>Our domestic consumption is low compared to other developed Asian
              economies because of high cost of public housing and ordinary living, a
              mandatory pension scheme requiring citizens to contribute 20% of their
              monthly salary to it and relatively low wages kept depressed by the
              influx of cheaper foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Our economy is heavily focused on a few “winners” like the
              manufacturing and electronics sectors in the past, the pharmaceutical
              and life sciences industry now and the gaming industry in the future.</p>
              <p>Gigantic state-linked companies such as DBS, Capitaland and NTUC are
              squeezing the life out of local startups and enterprises with
              their virtual monopoly over the economy rendering them
              both unimaginative and uncompetitive.</p>
              <p>We have already moved past the initial stages of developing our then
              labor-intensive fledging economy and we need to rethink our current
              economic blueprint now in order to compete on a different level
              with other developed countries where creativity, passion,
              entrepreneurship and a willingness to take calculated risks are
              essential and pivotal qualities for success in a new world order.</p>
              <p>3. Under the combined propaganda machinery of the PAP and SPH,
              “welfare” has become a dirty word in official parlance. We have been
              told repeatedly to be self-reliant and not to depend on the government
              for cash handouts, but isn’t it the responsibility of the incumbent
              government of the day to care for the people who voted for them into
              power in the first place ?</p>
              <p>The welfare system of Western countries have often been used by the
              regime to obsfuscate the issue. It is both irrational and unreasonable
              to equate “welfare” for Singaporeans to the promotion of a welfare
              state. Singaporeans do not expect the government to support them for
              the rest of their lives after retirement.</p>
              <p>All we ask for is for the government to make the present living
              conditions more bearable for us by reducing the cost of living and to
              be more generous with the distribution of aid to needy and vulnerable
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We do not expect the regime to be as generous as the Hong Kong
              government to give its elderly citizens a monthly allowance amounting
              to 80% of their last drawn pay. Much more can be done to alleviate the
              hardship and suffering of our senior citizens who have contributed to
              the nation-building process during their productive years.</p>
              <p>The Singapore government is filthy rich by first world standards. It
              is not as if it is a pauper, why is it so stingy in rendering financial
              assistance to the poor ? Would it rather spend billion of dollars to
              bail out distressed banks which went eventually to lining the pockets
              of its rich executives or help its own citizens ?</p>
              <p>4. In the early years of Singapore’s nationhood, a strong government
              is crucial to bring about political stability and social harmony so
              that we can focus on developing the economy to uplift the lives of our
              people.</p>
              <p>The regime has conveniently corrupted the definition of a “strong”
              government with that of a one-party state. A strong government can
              exist in the presence of a sizable opposition in Parliament to check on
              the ruling party while a one-party state though appearing “strong” on
              the surface, has inherent deficiencies caused by the over-concentrating
              of power in the hands of a few.</p>
              <p>The only reason why the regime appears strong on the outside is that
              the key decision makers belong no more to an inner clique of a
              particular family of which even ordinary MPs without any portfolios are
              excluded. Only one center of power exists to give the orders, the rest
              simply follow behind like blind sheeps thereby giving the facade of a
              clear sense of direction and purpose in the formulation and
              implementation of policies.</p>
              <p>The Finance Minister Mr Tharman gave Singaporeans a glimpse of how
              the PAP system worked when he remarked in Parliament in response to an
              opposition MP’s question that they work on a system based on “trust”.
              What was not mentioned is how much trust he has in the system itself.
              Is it a 100% trust ? Ask yourself whether you ever trust anybody in
              your life including yourself completely without any doubts.</p>
              <p>A self-serving totalitarian state which do not hesitate to make use
              of the police and media to suppress dissenting voices from its own
              people is not a strong government. On the contrary, it is a weak
              government precisely because it is unable to stand up to external
              challenges and defeat them based on its own strengths and merits alone
              without resorting to foul play.</p>
              <p>A strong government is one which can face up to the challenge of any
              opposition without resorting to ‘fixing’ them. A strong government is
              one which is fully accountable to the people and is not afraid of being
              scrutinized. A strong government does not hide things from the people
              and is completely honest, transparent and above board. A strong
              government does not make use of state instruments like the police and
              media to suppress political dissent because it knows it owes its power
              to the people who voted for it. And lastly, a strong government does
              not sue its critics to silence them because it has faith in its own
              ability to win them over by their reasoning and argument. By these 5
              counts, the PAP does not qualify to be a strong government. It is no
              more than a weak, pathetic and cowardly bully which makes use of its
              position as the incumbent to quash its political opponents.</p>
              <p>History have shown us that such “strong” states like the U.S.S.R and
              Nazi Germany did not last long while others like South Korea and Taiwan
              only manage to avert a similiar implosion like the former by making a
              peaceful transition to democracy.</p>
              <p>If a one party state has worked for Singapore in the past, that’s
              because it has only benefitted a small of group of people with links to
              the regime. It is not going to work now and in the future where a rapid
              changing geo-political landscape will require a diversity of ideas and
              views to cope and tackle the problems which may surface . A one party
              state stifles creativity, innovation and passion in the population and
              will ruin us politically, socially and economically in the long run. </p>
              <p>Can we expect the regime to check on itself ? Time and time again,
              we have been proven otherwise. There is a serious lack of
              accountability and transparency from the Singapore government in spite
              of its frequent lame attempts to ingratiate itself with these
              attributes as defining yardsticks for its rule.</p>
              <p>5. As the present financial turmoil has shown us, we do not need a
              profligate opposition to fritter away our precious reserves. A
              substantial proportion of it is already missing. I guess most
              Singaporeans would prefer the sum of $58 billion lost by Temasek to be
              spent on helping the poor and needy rather than go to make a few
              hundred millionaires out of Merrill Lynch’s employees.</p>
              <p>What we really need is not the empty promises made by the PAP to
              safeguard our reserves, but a proper calibrated system of checks and
              balances to guide the modus operandi of the government and a real
              opposition in Parliament to ensure accountability and transparency from
              the government.</p>
              <p>The regime’s glaring deficiencies is exposed for all to see with its
              inept handling of the Temasek fiasco. We are talking about the loss of
              $58 billion dollars and more of our reserves and not a single question
              is asked in Parliament. The perpetuator of this disaster did not have
              to face the music and the state media even have the gall to suggest she
              ran for political office in the future !</p>
              <p>In other developed countries, an independent Commission of Inquiry
              will be called immediately to probe into the loss. The regime will
              never risk eroding further whatever little public trust and confidence
              they have left by revealing the full extent of losses incurred by
              Temasek and GIC because it has been using the reserves all along to
              frighten Singaporeans from voting the opposition into power.</p>
              <p>The myths of the PAP system are fast being dismantled on a daily
              basis with alternative news sources from the internet. Even the
              mainstream media is finding hard to spin fairy tales on behalf of the
              regime without appearing ludicrous itself. The regime can continue to
              believe in its own propaganda, but less and less Singaporeans,
              especially the young are taken in by them.</p>
              <p>Eventually, Singaporeans will become so averse to the one-sided
              reports carried by the mainstream media that they will be completely
              switched off, preferring to read only what they want to read on the
              internet even though its factual accuracy cannot be independently
              verified and that will finally send the myths of the PAP system
              into their death throes.</p>
