              <p><br>1.) In Singapore, a nation of well known savers, had kept banks in the black and healthy. But it is unhealthy to the economy as no one is borrowing funds for expansion and create employment, more so MNCs and SMEs!</p>
              <p><br>Thus the banks must market more attractive terms for them to loan and expand. Speculation MUST never be supported such as creating property bubbles, but if the CBF principles are applied, MNCs and SMEs are in a good position to take loans to create better products for exports, and most critically, create employment for the many here in Singapore - mid management for citizens, and low wage for foriegners vital to keep labour costs down for product exportations.</p>

              <p>If hoarding persist, then more money will have to be printed for circulation, diving down the current value of hoarded money. There will be ways and means to make the rich turn less miserly and be more socially responsible.</p>
              <p><br>2.) 95% + of Singaporeans are employed. Thus, it is the social responsibility of us all to help the 5%+- unemployed. We cant expect these 5% to spend, for they have no salary to spend on. But the employed has, and must continue to remain employed and contribute to our society, whom had benefitted many thru social spending.</p>
              <p><br>It would be ridiculous and too much to request the 95% employed to spend beyond their means, as wages had been reduced but soon to increase if our recovery is sustainable, with cooperation and hardwork from all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But we have a choice to save some  and spend wisely, on cheaper products, which the onus lies on MNCs and SMEs, down to the foodstalls, to creatively packaged their products cheaper and keep living, recreation costs down.</p>

              <p>Where is the Government's responsibility to ensure lower operating costs and cost of living by reducing fuel tax, COE, ERP, and the high vehicle taxes even as ERP has been so extensively implemented ?</p>
              <p>Where is the Government's role in reducing costs to families when it will encourage the women to return to the work force, but will impose a $400 levy that is equal to the minimum wages that the foreign maids have to be paid - costing the family a total of $800 per month when it could have been only $400 ?</p>
              <p>Where is the Government social responsibility to keep costs down for everyone - including businesses - by lowering the sales prices of land for development, lowering the stamp duties, lowering the development charges as a percentage of the project costs, and most of all to be more transparent in its costings of HDB sales prices ?</p>

              <p>Can the spending of 4.5 million people save the world's economy ?</p>
              <p>Is it not obvious the grand standing efforts of a X-rated Fraud that will misleadingly claim itself to be an insignificant nobody - (as if a nobody can be significant) - will hope to draw attention to its silliest ideas ?</p>
              <p>Can the Keynesian practices be a 'One-size-fit-all' panacea for the Global Economy - as propounded by the resident X-rated Fraud ?</p>
              <p>What has the X-rated Fraud offered and developed further - beyond the mentioning of only the word "Keynsian" in its text ?</p>

              <p>So by denying citizens the right to withdraw from their CPF, government is not hoarding money? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think you can't answer it, that's why you sweet under the carpet and tell everybody it's off topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, there is a misnomer in you using Keynesian Theory for consumers, Keynesian spending is related to government. I think if you really want to learn economics suggest you pick up an Economics textbook rather than getting patchwork information from Thomas Friedman's novel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Else go to a proper university and study economics before you start crapping in here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It's recession now, you think workers with their paltry income have alot to spend? Moreover those gainfully employed might need to look after a family member who is currently unemployed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Keynes's theory, there are some <a title="Microeconomics" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Microeconomics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">micro-level</span></span></a> actions of individuals and firms that can lead to aggregate <a title="Macroeconomics" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Macroeconomics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">macroeconomic</span></span></a> outcomes in which the economy operates below its <a title="Potential output" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Potential_output"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">potential output</span></span></a> and growth. Some <a title="Classical economics" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Classical_economics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">classical economists</span></span></a> had believed in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Say's Law" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Say%27s_Law"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Say's Law</span></span></a>, that supply creates its own demand, so that a "<a title="General glut" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/General_glut"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">general glut</span></span></a>" would therefore be impossible. Keynes contended that <a title="Aggregate demand" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Aggregate_demand"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">aggregate demand</span></span></a> for <a title="Good (economics)" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Good_(economics)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">goods</span></span></a> might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high <a title="Unemployment" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Unemployment"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">unemployment</span></span></a> and losses of potential output. <strong>Keynes argued that government policies could be used to increase aggregate demand, thus increasing economic activity and reducing unemployment and </strong><a class="mw-redirect" title="Deflation (economics)" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Deflation_(economics)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>deflation</strong></span></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Keynes argued that the solution to depression was to stimulate the economy ("inducement to invest") through some combination of two approaches: <strong>a reduction in interest rates and government investment in infrastructure. Investment by government injects income, which results in more spending in the general economy, which in turn stimulates more production and investment involving still more income and spending and so forth.</strong> The initial stimulation starts a cascade of events, whose total increase in economic activity is a multiple of the original investment.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>One can only wonder if this is not the result of the PAP educational system that had deliberately skewed the contents of the books in social studies, and the de-toxing of syllabus that encourage critical analytical thinking.</p>
              <p>It is certainly not possible for the X-rated Fraud to have been a beneficiary of the new PAP efforts in Year 2002 - in which attempts were made to revamp the education system to produce creative and thinking minds for Singapore's Future.</p>

              <p> Does the PAP Government ever allow "Market Forces" to effectively determine the equilibrium in the distribution of scarce resources in Singapore - or has it not been a fraudulent attempt to present an image of progressive actions but will surreptiously move events by their determined efforts to influence events to a deliberated and prescribed outcome ?</p>
              <p> Singapore wage is one where the PAP Government will insist to be determined by the NWC - formed by a tripartite of Employers, the NTUC, and Employees.</p>
              <p>This tripartite arrangement is already in favor of the Government position when it occupy an extra fourth seat in the previous three seat NWC.</p>
              <p>Is the outcome not already pre-determined - when the Employers cannot afford to offend a touchy PAP government filled with its own opinionated talents, most of whom are unproven political appointees taken from academia and are themselves "works in progress" in their insecure positions ?</p>

              <p>Perhaps the pseudo-intellectual within the X-rated Fraud has failed to recall that the PAP Government had destroyed the careers of several generations of younger Singaporeans, when the PAP Government manipulated the NUS intake quotas for the different faculties in response to the needs of the industries and societies - instead of allowing "Market Forces" to determine where our young talent is best to be deployed.</p>
              <p>Has it not been a fact that those applying for medicine will find the quota for that year has been reduced, while the quota for the engineering faculty had increased; and a year later the pendulum will swing in another direction to meet some other ambitious PAP pipe dream to train technocrats or bio-engineers for the New Industries ?</p>

              <p>On the contrary US is in so much trouble because it spent too much. its economy is made up of 71% consumer spending and distributing its fiat currency. Its only a matter of time before countries stopped lending it money and thats when the shit hits the fan</p>

              <p>Does a X-rated Fraud that is adapt in the Art of Deception need to be explicit with its pseudo-intellect expressions ?</p>
              <p>It should count its own good fortune that its pseudo-intellect has only limited its own damage due to its preference to be vague and economical in expressing the little that it knows about Keynesian Economics, and had simply made superficial nonsensical remarks that lessen the gravity to the effects of its expressed ignorance.</p>

              <p>With the X-rated Fraud repeatedly exposed for its dishonest methods - that even extend to cheating its government of a 50 cents parking coupon that it will admit only when caught - can it be trusted for what the expressed remarks from a mind that is constantly suffering a "constipation of ideas" ?</p>
              <p>What has the X-rated Fraud mentioned that could possibly allow anyone reading its thread to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">know what i say am right</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>In its typical style, it will turn itself into a self-denial state - to completely ignore all the clearly elaborated and substantiated arguments that were made by several readers who bothered to correct its nonsensical thread.</p>
              <p>It is characteristic of the pseudo-intellect within a X-rated Fraud, who will impose on others that anyone who will not agree with its verbiage, must be "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">just not in you to agree with someone else</span></em>" - and - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">thus your attempt to mislead others with your post</span></em>"</p>
              <p>What has the bankrupt mind of a X-rated Fraud offered - by way of any reasoning and tackle the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">attempts to mislead others with your post</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been the repeated performance for the exposed X-rated Fraud to simply whine in its own misery, and slink away from any confrontation to debunk those who it had claimed to attempt to mislead his self-deluded existence of a "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">wider audience</span></em>" ?</p>

              <p>How much lower does the X-rated Fraud need to sink to further confirmed its status of being a pseudo-intellect ?</p>
              <p>It is brilliant for Singaporeans to speand their money and not save by visiting their private clinic doctors more frequently, and not forgetting to also visit the divorce cases lawyers more frequently too as it will encourage more X-rated X'tra Marital Affairs.</p>
              <p>What will the X-rated Fraud have Singaporeans do to engage the services of local architects and engineers - to build new houses that sap the savings that are already too little for one's old age ?</p>
              <p>Even for the younger generations - can they accept the X-rated Fraud suggestion to engage local architects and engineers to build dream homes - when the younger generations cannot even plan their future with employment contracts that feature time limits renewable every 3 to 5 years ?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the X-rated Fraud will encourage Singaporeans to spend more, and need not be thrifty to have meals in Food Courts, but to visit restaurants, even as the restaurants must charge food prices at least 2 or 3 times higher then a meal at the Food Court</p>
              <p>Obviously the X-rated Fraud is still living in its own "Disini Fantasy World" to think that the corner "Mom &amp; Pop" shop still exist, when these have been muscled out by bigger players that have been encouraged to enter the local retail scene.</p>

              <p>What is the worth of a personal guarantee from a known X-rated Fraud, who will cheat on a 50 cent car park coupon - and will deny that Singaporeans have been abused by a Government that insist on monopolising the local political stage ?</p>
              <p>The government retains almost 36 to 40 per cent of Singaporeans' monthly wages - and will hoard it till one reaches age 85.</p>
              <p>Can Singaporeans spend any more from their remaining monthly wages - when their future is made uncertain as the Government imposed low wages, low bonuses, and lowered CPF, and also forcing Singaporeans to accept that iron rice bowl cannot exist and change to short term 3 to 5 year contracts ?</p>
              <p>Can Singaporeans spend any more from their remaining monthly wages and to be less thrifty in a Singapore where the Government do not believe in social welfare - not even allow one's own CPF monies to be released to support those retrenched ?</p>
              <p>Can Singaporeans spend any more from their remaining monthly wages when the government has imposed low wages to compete with the labor costs of Third World Countries, but will allow a situation that positioned Singapore with the dubious honor of being amongst the top ten First World Cities with the highest Cost of Living ?</p>
              <p>Only the X-rated Fraud will insist on Singapore to contribute more but will not demand any from the Government to ease the sufferings of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Only the X-rated Fraud will turn a blind eye to the many policy changes that the PAP Government can make to lessen the burden on Singaporeans, and allow the money to circulate within Singapore.</p>
              <p>Only the X-rated Fraud will not allow its brilliance to see the necessity for changes to take effect on a range of Government actions that begin with trimming the excess or surplus budget funds from being continuously sent to the GIC and Temasek Holdings - and have both losing billions of money extracted from Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It is simply pathetic that the X-rated Fraud is only interested in its desire to make its grand standing performance with its hollow bankrupt ideas that have been flowing from its pseudo-intellect.</p>
              <p>If it can only stay quiet long enough, it can hear the ocean sound that roars through the vast cavity that exist in its skull.</p>
