              <p><br>Do you fear LKY? I don't think any singaporean fears LKY. Many Singaporeans just feel helpless facing LKY. You argue with him chances are you will lose, this guy is very well read and he had seen the world. You don't agree with him, but you can't do anything to him, there are enough people who voted him in to power while you continue to wonder from what platform can you voice your disagreement. You can talk and complain anywhere you like but nothing will be changed as a result. You can criticise him but  when you quote wrongly or say the wrong thing that really affect his reputation, you kenna sued till you don't see daylight.</p>
              <p>Under what circumstance would LKY send his secret agents to come after you in the middle of the night, or how does LKY threaten you, share with us.</p>

              <p>who says the PRC people respect the HKgers? Their relationship is that of a business. HK need the PRC tourists to boost their economy so they went all out to attract them, and you see many HKgers even learn to speak Mandarin. To the PRC people HK remains the pearl of the east, a modern and well developed city just returned to the motherland, a place they must see and visit, so they visited HK by the millions. What is there between HK and the mainlanders that you are jealous about?</p>

              <p>I'm never sure if people are just venting or asking for an explanation. Since this is a simpler topic, here is  your answer Catknight.</p>
              <p>Looking at it from a group dynamic point of view. Humans have a basic response as a gregarious communal group. In times of good, you'd share and the sharing of food etc created bonds. This would be reflected in expressions of goodwill, kind looks, friendly hugs, good wishes etc. So the behavior extends from a previous act of goodwill.</p>
              <p>In the modern society it has become etiquette to express goodwill etc without the initial act that created a bond. It's kind of a shortcut, as a kind of promise that there will be an act of goodwill after a time. We are kinder to people who express those expressions of goodwill even though most times it is baseless as it did not follow from an act of goodwill. Because of our human nature we still "recognize" the debt.</p>
              <p>We now come to the point where someone will express goodwill then ask you for an act of goodwill. Human nature persuades us to give them it. This is purely a social trait but some people abuse this human trait in business. They behave nicely towards you and that predisposes you to give them advantages that are to your own disadvantage. This has become the common business practise and the person who gives out an act of goodwill based on expressions of goodwill is considered a fool.</p>
              <p>Business people understand this.</p>
              <p>You may be upset that someone talks to you nicely and flatters you then after you've given them an advantage, they don't return the "favor". You actually have been fooled by their expressions of goodwill to perform an act of goodwill. As you see, business and social niceties don't mix.</p>
              <p>The Chinese admire the Hong Kongers as they see this as a "technique" for doing business. The Singaporeans are offended because they see this as an abuse of their good nature.</p>
              <p>In reality, we just have to learn business and social etiquette are not the same. And we have to understand how they are different. And we have to recognize when it is used to our own disadvantage if we want to become better adapted to this world where money means so much.</p>
              <p>Will we lose our humanity in becoming better businessmen? Most likely. The Jews have a belief that it is okay to do "business" with non-Jews but remember to treat other Jews as you would "family" and that allowed them to become great businessmen without losing their humanity. But outside their own religion they garnered the reputation of being cold blooded businessmen. This likely predisposed others non "family" not to come to their defence when they were persecuted.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying this as an excuse, I'm not passing a moral judegement, it's simply what I observe and I hope that by sharing this, I share with you my understanding of how this works.</p>
