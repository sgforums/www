Wait a moment, yes no doubt 70%++ of the Singaporeans are ethnically Chinese, please do not think we are dying to kowtow and sell Singapore off as your colony.<br>I noe, most ppls these days are capitalistic and everyone think of money and opportunities. There is nothing wrong for the Chinese to aspire for better life and pay, thus working overseas. Just like Singaporeans working in Europe. BUT the question now is there are some PRC blacksheeps taking advantage of our PR, visa system and come here to take part in illegal trade like prostitution. Of course for the sake of our well-being, the govt must instill laws to stop this problems. Do you expect us to give leeways to the PDMMS so they can survive here? There are mani temp jobs out there, why the PDMMS wants to carry on onli the sex trade? If the issue is not serious, why do u think the govt wants to instill such laws. We do read news of police in China clamping down on sex trades rite, so why dun the "Chinese population sympathize with the prostitutes"? If you choose to think Singaporeans are being too harsh on your citizens, why not take a trip to Geylang area or the heartlands to see for yourself?.................<br><br>Another thing to point out. You said Singapore treat u badly. Take a look at NTU, NUS, u see throngs and throngs of your country men. Just in case u aren't aware.........Our govt provides free education, hostel, monthly allowance, laptops to YOUR ppls to come HERE to STUDY. They are doing it eventhough there are still many local students unable to go primary sch to study. Mine u, the uni fees are rising like rocket, it stands now at $6200 a year, now......now..... who is at the suffering end. THE LOCALS!!! While your country men can laugh all the way to the Bank without an worry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans should also take part of the blame. Quite a number of these PDMMs went into prostitution becos they were cheated by unscrupulous agents here. There are lots and lots of foreigners brutally exploited here in Singapore. Here are some examples:<br><br>http://english.people.com.cn/200202/01/eng20020201_89751.shtml<br><br>http://english.people.com.cn/200207/09/eng20020709_99414.shtml<br><br>http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/12/07/singap12125.htm<br><br>See the number of maids and other foreigners cruelly exploited by these low lifes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is pretty obvious this thread is getting out of point with everyone letting their emotions get the better of them without looking at the matter constructively. We live in a Globalized World people, we aren't marooned on a freaking island. People come, people go. That is just how the world works and we have to change with the times. We will see people of different colour, race and creed who will seek to become part of us and it is essential that we welcome with open arms - those who would bring benefit to our country. I have always been a proponent of the foreign talent scheme. I recongnise that these individuals would be my prospective competitors, but at the same time, I believe that competition would just push me to do better and at the same time bring about much needed talent into the work force. For example, Chinese teachers from China, there have come to Singapore and contributed in raising the standard of Chinese amongst our young. So here u have study mamas and Chinese Nationals ploughing their trade in vice, but what abt Chinese Nationals who have contributed to this country?  The worst thing that can happen to Singapore is that we just cocon ourselves into our comfort zones and refuse to accept the radical changes that are taking place around us.<br><br>Of course, with the influx of people from abroad, there needs to be a efficient mechanism to only grant resident status to those deserving. I believe the problem we're facing now is that we are allowing people who have no means to support themselves during the tenure, into this country. Without the neccessary skills, coupled with their neccessity to provide for themselves, these individuals would turn to vice and other illegal trades.<br><br>I think we should stop all the xenophobia plagueing this thread, it is just disgraceful that a country that pride ourselves as first world have individuals whose opinions would sound chummy to a bunch of red necks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quincey, I get ur point.......I am not trying to be xenophobic. I noe the importances of foreigners working in Singapore and their contribution. In the world of globalisation, ppl tends to move around to work and live. But wad I am unhappy is that why some individuals just can't see how the prostitution problem, how it is affecting our society in terms of their operation in the heartland. Wads wrong with clamping down on vice? Is Singapore deliberately doing harm to a particular nationality? Did we pick on onli a particular race, religion, sex? I'm sorry for being a little aggressive.<br><br>It is time we face the music and wake up our idea............ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
