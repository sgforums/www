Of course, in a majority when differences exists, they become noticable and when something like this takes place, such differences become even more apparent.

One question which crossed my mind when I read abt the protests was why are we allowing individuals without the neccessary qualifications to survive in this country entry in the first place? Do we have in place the neccessary guidelines and checks which would ensure that these individuals would be able to support themselves while in Singapore? I guess there is a need for re-evaluation here. I think what we need is to ensure any foreign students or their guardians who enter Singapore be able to accomodate themselves through their course of study.

Shame on you!<br><br></div></blockquote>Eh dreameryb, I noe that wad that guy say is veri fastistic in nature and should be condemned. But...........can u see the facts and explore the truth behind the entire saga. I noe u are a Chinese nation, but can u please be more impartial and be more fair in your judgement? No BODY FORCED THE PDMMS OR CHINESE FEMALES TO COME HERE TO TAKE PART IN PROSTITUTION. They are well aware of the fact that doing these acts is illegal and they still choose to do it, who is it to blame? Did u watch the channel U talk show discussing the PDMM issue. My god! One PDMM even have the Cheek to claim that all PDMMS are not involved in ANY FORM OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES and that SINGAPORE MUST BE REPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WELL BEING HERE!!! Wow, Singaporeans dun even get these freebies and they are brazen enough to coerce us to give in to their demands!<br><br>"NAZI FANATICS"-- It is more of a fustrated ranting.<br>Do all folks remember a news article on newpaper on a Singaporean girl going to China for exchange programme. She wrote some negative experience on HER PERSONNEL BLOG SPACE. One of her China counterpart copy and paste her comments on a university forum and it caused a ruckus. Oh my, how hypocritical the Chinese are.......... Next time u can't even share a few private moments with them, or they may "stab u from the back". LOL!<br>Those that are familiar with Chinese military forums/websites will noe how creative they can be in calling other race or countries with racist and degratory slurs!! Now they are expecting us to respect those PDMMS that commit crimes here? How hypocitical!!!</div>
