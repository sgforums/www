Sorry i very blur???</div></blockquote>want to know,<br><br>I was justly qouting the what the board of enquiry might ask, that's why the all those quotes are in brackets...... I'm in no way saying that and board of enquiries are common in SAF.<br><br>In fact SAF has improve alot on safety training over the few years. The tortures of standing in attention for long hours or duck squatting on countless flights of stairs are over. Even during training, we have to follow a set of Training Safety Regulation (TSR) to ensure safety.<br><br>Accidents and Injuries cause are usually human error. But it's common in every job you take that involves being physical. You can't just blame the army for everything. No one could foresee a recce scout skid on his motorbike and breaking his ankle. Just like no one could foresee a guy having a bike accident in PIE and breaking his ankle.(choy!)<br><br>SAF can put alot of rules and regulations to protect her troops, but the main responsiblility still lies in the troop himself. He must he ensure his own safety.<br><br>Of course if investigations show that it's the negligence of the troops superiors to ensure safety, SAF will definately come hard on them.<br><br>Okay to answer your question. If the troop are injuried, they will be temporary downgraded and if they recover, they'll be back in action. if the troop has permenant injury, he will be permenantly downgraded and reduce to being a clerk in HQ, armstoke assistant, store assistant or CSM's helper. if the injury is serious, he might be allowed to take medical leave for a long time.<br><br>okay this is totally out of topic...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> if you wanna ask questions, start a topic instead... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Its damn useless though, a slight bump of the rifle will throw the bolt forward because the catch is very very very weak.<br><br>My biggest beef with the SAR 21 is still the lousy positioning of the fire-select switch.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you wanna compare the sar 21 with the m16, i'll say that the better gun would not be any of them... they both have their advantages... the m16 is easier to maintain and parts are easier to find in the arms market... but the lack of zeroing makes the sar 21 an easier gun to use... downside of the sar 21 is that it's scoping is quite fragile, so take care of it, u lucky dudes who get to use it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by Viper52:<br>[b]<br><br>The SAR80 is indeed a more sturdy firing platform due to its weight. But the way its designed, I couldn't hold it my BMT OC taught me to hold it like the M-16 we used in BMT(which was unusual but REALLY made the M-16 a much more accurate weapon), which to me negated the extra stability of the SAR80. And while the weight is an advantage at the foxhole part of range, it was a DEFINITE disadvantage at the rundown    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I was from a log unit and had to use the SAR80 for two years. Had to say that i agree with Viper. I found the SAR80 to be very accurate when you are resting your arm on something to stabilise the rifle. I did better with the SAR-80 in the range than with the m-16, in anycase.<br>However, it was a bitch to run down the range with, but not due to the weight. it's just that the cross-section of the rifle is almost square, and it has no handle, so it makes it cumbersome to grab hold of (unless you have a hand the size of a gorilla's), and this was one main drawback i found with the SAR-80. This problem kept surfacing repeatedly, even when you are casually handling the rifle, like during guard duty. The M-16 was much handier to use.<br>All said though, i found the rifle quite reliable. very little fouling even though we had quite a few extra range sessions close to my ORD, and in my two years of using it, and after all the range sessions, it never jammed once.<br>Please keep in mind that i was from a log unit, so the rifle never went running through the mud or water or stuff like that, so my views are, admittedly, a little skewed. My two cent's worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well... wad i heard about the difference btw M-16 and SAR-21, besides the factsu guys mentioned, is the usability. SAR-21 although is a 'better' gun, its designed more for FIBUA (Fighting In Build Up Area aka Counter-Ts). If u bring SAR-21 to field.. i think cannot make it... the zeroing will go off very fast. But the pro pt is the SAR-21 is fuckin durable... Try b4 use 3/5 Tonner roll over it, yet it still can have perfect zeroing. wonder wad happens if u do that wif M-16.... If continuous usage in jungle warfare, the gun "die" very fast.<br><br>Dats wad i heard from my bro in NS. I dun use guns in NS...i use water hose nia(guess where i posted to.. LOL).<br><br>BTW guys, if i kena downgrade after a Op to PES E half wae thru my NS, will i kena recalled back to serve my remainin yrs? Cos maybe end of this yr me going Op for slipped disc. I scared i MC until ROD den yrs down the road they call me back serve NS. Dats wad happened to my fren....... Any comments?</div>
