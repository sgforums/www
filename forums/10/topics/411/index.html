Also, though it may be longer than the SAR-21, the barrel length is probably shorter because it isn't of a bull-pup style design.<br><br>Also, you have to compare the standard SAR-21's weight of 3.82kg, to the standard G36's weight of 3.6 kg. You can't compared the standard SAR-21 to the G36c. Its like comparing big apples to small oranges.<br><br>From what I know about the SAR-21, only two things I don't like about it so far is that the backup iron sights are rather crude and will be probably quite useless should the optical sights go kaput, and the plastic magazines. I'm wondering how hardy the magazines are, and how they're inserted into the magazine well; as in are they slotted straight in like the M16, or are they put in one end first then the other, like in the AK47. Also, I would like to know if they can accept the standard M16 magazines if they need should arise. If not, I don't think it would be good if SAF should start getting more involved in UN peacking missions or other joint missions, as M16 magazines are the NATO standard. Does anyone here know such details?<br><br>Btw, the offical H&amp;K site is <a href="http://www.heckler-koch.de/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heckler-koch.de/html/index.html</a>  and the official SAR-21 site is <a href="http://www.sar-21.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sar-21.com/</a><br><br>Should be able to find plenty of information on both weapons there.<br><br>Anyway, here's a pic of an SAR-21:<br><img src="http://www.sar-21.com/images/SARStandard.jpg"><br><br>and here's a pic of an H&amp;K G36:<br><img src="http://www.hecklerkoch-usa.com/pages/military/images/g36.jpg"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Bummer!!<br><br>-The charging hander is a "flip-out and pull" type. I felt it's rather flumsy. cocking a rifle needs some force and it's might give problems and inconvience during the heat of combat.<br><br>-butt's pretty heavy, but I guess most bullpup's are like that.<br><br>-Wonder it have "quick load" mechanism like the M-16's "empty mag, take out mag, insert new mag, ease-spring, fire". I dunwant to cock the rifle again everytime I load a mag.<br><br>-I wouldn't worry about the laser sight, the optical sight looks more fragile than the laser sight, but it's good to know that there are rubber covers to protect the lens (like camera). I heard things get messy if it rains or fogs, bummer!<br><br>-Though the rifle's heavier than the M16, it's feels just as light, probably due the the lower center of gravity and the length. it's like you'll feel that the carbine is light than the M16, but the actually fact is both weights the same.<br><br>-The mag fits into the rifle like the m16, you'll need to slot it in till it "clicks". the mags are not M16 compatible, Bummer! Although, they are plastic, they're tougher than you think. They are like some sort of "industry plastic", like those they use in car bummers. The bottom of the mag can be open to clear dust I think.<br><br>-Heard 7SIR's using it now. Some other NS unit might be too, I dunno. but BMTC will be the last to convert....<br></div>

Fully interchangeable.<br><br>As someone who has fired the M-16 and SAR-80, and handled the SAR-21, I would say the difference in weight is quite obvious, though its not necessarily a bad thing. It does feel "beefier" than the other 2 weapons, and looks to me like its a sturdier firing platform than the M-16 or SAR-80, though I've never actually fired it.(Don't ask me why I didn't take up CIS offer for a free trip to Mandai to test-fire the SAR-21 in AA2000, I still wondering why too)<br><br>I've read a web article of a US SWAT test for the SAR-21, apparently it scored very high marks, and its lack of zeroing requirement is rated very highly, even after dropping the weapon and having it passed round to various shooters. So maybe this might answer your question.<br><br>I really can't remember the URL of the article, or if was from a book, I'm sorry to say   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

If I recall correctly, the magazine release for the SAR-21 is at the back of the magazine well, so I would assume that it would catch onto something on the back of the magazine, whereas the M16 magazine catch holds onto the groove on the side of the M16 magazines.<br><br>About the SAR80, I've been trying find out stuff about it over the internet but info about it as hard to come by and is usually very sketchy. All I know about the two locally produced rifles, the SR88 and SAR80, is that they are derived from the AR18/AR180 design and they were meant as a replacement for the M16, due to licensing issues from Colt. Since they already had a working design (two in fact), why didn't they totally replace the M16s with them and instead only did a half-job? Was it the cost, or flaws in the design, etc? And will the introduction of the SAR21 result in just another rifle that is issued only to some units, which would probably create a logistics problem? And yes, I'm wondering why you didn't take up the offer to test fire the SAR-21  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Apparently, almost everyone who has reviewed the SAR-21 thinks rather highly of it and to be honest, its quite a well thought out design. (AK style gas system, bullpup layout, etc) I still think they should have designed a select-fire lever that was as easy to operate as the M16's one though...in a combat situation being able to switch from semi-auto to full-auto should be something that is done in the blink of an eye and normally not require removing either the firing or supporting hand from the gun. (the H&amp;K style fire-select lever comes to mind...its better than the M16 one IMO)<br><br>Laksa:<br><br>I agree with you....I think would rather be issued an M16 over the SAR80 anytime, since the M16 has been proven to be rather reliable. The SAR80, Ultimax100, SR88, and all other Singapore-designed weapons are supposed to be on the whole, well-designed and reliable though. If I recall correctly, the SAR80 has been adopted by at least one country (either European or Middle Eastern) as its standard issue rifle. I can't remember the exact country and can't find the website I got this info from though...sorry about it.<br><br>hunter:<br><br>Why was the SAR80 only issued to logistics unit?

Does anyone know if the SAR-21 uses the older M193 5.56mm round, or will the SAF be gradually upgrading to the M855/SS109 5.56mm round, which is now the NATO standard?

            <div class='col-md body'>this is what i feel about the SAR 80: its much more sturdier during firing to the m-16 and it is rumoured to be 'more' accurate than the m-16 according to those who had used the rifle for their marksmanship range. the major flaw is at its foresight tip---&gt; doesn't glow at night! so its practically useless once the sky turns dark, not forgetting its weight!<br></div>

Not sure if the casing ejection port has a deflector to prevent hot casings from flying into the face of left handed shooters like the M-16A2/A3 but I would think so.<br><br>The charging handle looks deceptively flimsy, but let me assure you, I repeatedly yanked that thing pretty hard when I checked it out, it seemed sturdy enough<br><br>You're right about cycling manually after the magazine is emptied. Unlike the M-16/AR-15 the SAR21 has no ease spring feature, after the mag is emptied, the bolt remains locked at the open position, a new mag is inserted, charging handle pulled again to return the bolt. Again, while I would think it would slow down *slightly* the shooter compared to the ease spring, it would make it easier for lefties. (FYI I'm a leftie by day but a rightie at the range, whatever that means...). Ergonomics wins out.<br><br>I can't remember how the mag catches, my memory's a little fuzzy in that score.<br><br>My other gripe on the SAR21 fire selector is the retention on the full auto function, I would have thought a 3-round burst function would be more useful. As for fire selector, I don't recall any problems using it with my right hand.<br><br>Strange that no one has mentioned the ability of the SAR21 shooter to fire with both eyes open. I tried that out when fiddling with the SAR21, and it took me all of half a minute to learn how to focus my eyes to use that function. To those who haven't tried it, let me tell you, I can really see how having both eyes open while shooting could make a difference when using the weapon<br><br>I don't have the SAR80 specs on the top of my head, I do have a couple of small arms books in Singapore which cover both the SAR80 and U100.<br><br>As to why SAR80 over SR88, I don't think there was a competition. They were designed in different time frames, I think the issuing of SAR80s to log units could have been a trial which wasn't satisfactory in terms of performance, so it wasn't issued on a wide scale. The SR88 came at a time when there was a rethinking on assault rifle design, so that could have been the limiting factor there.<br><br>Chamenos: I've read as early as the mid-1980s that the U100 was chambered for M193 AS WELL as the SS109, so it would be surprising if the SAR21 was not so chambered. While we'r on new ammo, if anyone has read Blackhawk Down, you might have noticed some comments by the Rangers and Delta about the inability of the new ammo(SS109?) to "drop" the enemy. Reason was that the ammo was designed to go through body armour and kill the wearer, and when facing the "unarmoured" Sammies, the rounds simply went through without doing much initial damage, and often the hit Somali would be able to pick himself up and run off even after being hit. To quote one of the Delta in the book after seeing the umpteen Sammy he hit pick himself up, dust himself off and run off, "When he hit an enemy, he wanted him(enemy) to stay down." Food for thought?<br><br>The SAR80 is indeed a more sturdy firing platform due to its weight. But the way its designed, I couldn't hold it my BMT OC taught me to hold it like the M-16 we used in BMT(which was unusual but REALLY made the M-16 a much more accurate weapon), which to me negated the extra stability of the SAR80. And while the weight is an advantage at the foxhole part of range, it was a DEFINITE disadvantage at the rundown    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>The most "famous" export customer of our small arms is Croatia, they took delivery of significant stocks of SAR80s and U100s in 1991 when they fought the Serbs/Yugoslav army from '91-'95. I've also seen Filipino soldiers with U100s.<br><br>Nathan: SAR21 is not too bad, you just have to get used to it due to its different layout. Once used to it, I think you'll like it. Think outside the square you live in    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 20 May 2002).]</div>
