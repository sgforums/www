            <div class='col-md body'>Just read an article in Oct 2002's issue of Jane's International Defence Review entitled "Small arms ammunition advances bit by bit."<br><br>I want to share with you an interesting portion from that article: "There have been several reports from troops in Afghanistan regarding the lack of lethality of the SS109/M855 cartridge, particularly when it is fired from an M4 (US) or M8 (Canadian) carbine. This was also observed in Somalia. For the SS109/M855 to achieve lethality, it must be moving at a velocity of over 732m/s when it strikes its target. At this velocity and above, the bullet penetrates a short distance and then begins to yaw as its spinning slows and it tends to return to its normal stable state, which is base forward. As the bullet yaws, it comes apart at the cannelure, scattering fragments and causing a relatively large wound channel. In practical terms, this translates to approximately 200m with a bullet fired from an M16 or similar rifle with a 558mm barrel at approximately 914m/s.<br><br>"When fired from a carbine, however, the SS109/M855 bullet leaves the barrel with a velocity of only about 790m/s. Therefore by the time it has travelled downrange only 50m, it has already dropped below the velocity threshold for enhanced would ballistics. The net effect is that troops equipped with M4 or M8 carbines are using weapons that are only marginally more effective ballistically than a 0.22 Magnum at anything other than close-quarters battle distances."<br><br>Just goes to show that "advances" in the field of arms and ammunition may not necessarily be progress!</div>

After reading the JIDR article, I have a better understanding now. In fact, the article went on to say that the American SF has turned to a match grade round made by Black Hills that fires at 5g bullet at 792m/s from an M4.<br><br>In turn, that would mean that the actual effective range of a 5.56mm depends on velocity not only in the sense of energy delivered on impact, but on whether it has enough velocity left to tumble in its target and fragment. Thus, the effective range can be much less than the range at which the bullet maintains a flat trajectory, in this case 50m from an M4, or 200m from an M16.<br><br>As you noted also, a German 7.62mm NATO round does not fragment as spectacularly as a 5.56mm round (are you using Cushaw's 1990 report on terminal ballistics here?), but being a larger bullet, it does great damage in its own right without depending on whether it fragments, thus it would have a greater effective range. On top of that, it's ability to penetrate most foliage and building material, and still retain significant energy, is also significant.<br><br>The problem of over-penetration is a problem with ALL cartridges, including the 5.56mm. If a bullet, even a hollow-point, does not pass through enough tissue to fully "dump" its energy by tumbling or expanding or fragmenting, then it would not have the necessary terminal effect.<br><br>So, if someone is shot in the arm through muscle tissue rather than the bone, he might still retain signicant combat ability. Even in this case, I believe that the greater calibre of the 7.62mm round together with its greater weight would have more impact than the small, light 5.56mm round.<br></div>

My cousin also another scout, got stung by bees in Brunei and then was deemed unfit to continue (he is allegic to bee stings) as scouts. In war time, it will be too easy to ignore all these injuries when greater stakes than some individual physic pains are at risks.<br><br>BTW, one must see the mini series "Band of Brothers" to understand the horrors of wars and the human sacrifices....</div>
