            <div class='col-md body'>You should know who owns the whole of SG network. It doesn't matter who I stick with.<br><br>Next, in the newspapers it was mentioned that when ODEX wanted Singnet to release the IP address info, Singnet didn't give because there were no court orders to do so (and rightly so, because their T&amp;C said they won't do it without court orders).<br><br>ODEX promptly produce the court orders, and Singnet handled the details over. So it was something like an agreement. ODEX produced the relevant court orders, Singnet would just hand it over.<br><br>While it's true that Singnet didn't even put up a fight, the T&amp;C are plain and clear enough they would do so as long as the relevant documents are there.<br><br>There's also a judging issue. All 3 cases were handled by different judges. If I didn't read wrongly, none of them mentioned anything about the Copyright Act, which Judge Lau mentions in the PacNet case.<br><br>If that was true, then the Copyright Act wasn't even factored in at all, if any. Thus, it would make no sense for Singnet to fight over it at all. Same for the Starhub case, though they did try to help but failed.<br><br>Next issue which has been mentioned by LazerLordz, is the lack of Data Protection Act here. So long as anybody has court orders, and it's stated in the company's T&amp;C that they will cooperate when the court orders are shown, it's enough.<br><br>The last issue, which not many people know, is that all connections from Singapore to the Internet has to use a proxy. This proxy is not your ISP proxy, but rather, a national proxy.<br><br>This has its own implications in this case, but not so much and not of much importance and makes no sense, if any.</div>

The judge questioned literally everything, copyright and privacy issues. There was nothing to question about privacy, we have no such things here. Then to the copyright issues.<br><br>He took into account that ODEX wasn't the sole licensee for most anime sold here, so he rejected ODEX demands. Plus the fact that ODEX was using copyright laws to pressure users, Judge Lau decided that this factor will have to be considered.<br><br>So, the question is, did other judges even took this into consideration? If judges can turn a blind eye to certain laws, I can see why Singnet and Starhub could lose so easily.<br><br>Also, the judge noted that the tracking method used by ODEX wasn't really so effective, as most users have pointed out, thus the case was rejected, together with the copyright factor.<br><br>Judges play an important role in this ODEX case. We have one judge that looks at everything, we have 2 others that probably didn't even bother.<br><br>Now that ODEX is considering to appeal, we just have to be prepared for the worst. Judge Lau may have made some questionable points, but that doesn't mean ODEX won't win, solely because of the T&amp;C and because we have no privacy acts here.</div>
