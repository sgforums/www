            <div class='col-md body'>As government seems to be very parsimonious towards helping citizens despite their suffering taxing and cost recovering system of government which brought about S$200 billion surpluses.<br><br>Under such dire circumstances, people should consider setting up a self-help fund as suggested by some forumers at youngpap.<br><br>Alternatively people could jointly identify worthwhile charity funds which are neutral to political institutions or parties so that they could donate S$1.00 per month or per annum depending on financial ability to start such a voluntary people self-help movement. From small scale if significantly publicized it could grow when more people spread by words of mouth will make it so.<br><br>It can be started as some kind of "people self-help fund". Donation as a start can be small.<br><br>Even if the amount is S$1 it is good enough for the purpose is not to collect big amount for any major project but to signal a start of people self-help project.<br><br>Eventually over time it will become a good self-reliance or self-help fund of the people by the people without political influence by the MPs or anyone connected to the government, If carefully set up thus maintained with integrity and good corporate governance there will be more people supporting it.<br><br>WHO CAN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE FUND<br><br>Initially those who are destitute e.g. driven out of their flats by HDB by PS or hospital who cannot pay subsistences or utility or medicare will be able to apply for nominal sum of help from this fund for the period of emergency up to 2 weeks.<br><br>If the amount of assistance is not enough the fund could contact more people including philanthropists in other countries or send circulars to community organizations to seek further assistance.</div>

Those exceeding the thresthold incomes slightly can be the target of assistance while those who exceed more or requiring assistance nevertheless can be helped in more flexible way than direct financial assistance. These details can be worked out to make the fund truly practical and meeting the real needs of ordinary families in need of help.<br><br>I foresee the most important criterion for success will be the truly altruistic set up of such a fund - to meet the needs of families which could not cope with the present rising costs and nevertheless for a variety of reasons like unemployment or temporary set-up etc were left out due to rigidity of government policies etc.<br><br>All these criteria need to be deliberated by the council with details suitably worked out.<br><br>Only when carefully set up and established will it move. If not it cannot appeal to the large society enough to make them support the $1 pm or S$1 pa methodology of donation which will gain momentum and level of support.<br><br>Let us all continue to work out such principal objectives criteria and details with the contributions and participation by all.<br></div>

The issue of tax deduction will be less important to such donor.<br><br>But the significance of such a donation is immense because such a fund is set up to bridge the gap not being filled by existing government assistance and the actual needs of families in both the lower and middle income groups who for diverse reasons or reality of life are unable to meet their heavy commitments due to dropping incomes, unemployment or other setbacks.<br><br>So with such objectives which will be well established in the constitutions, such a fund will receive good support of the ordinary citizen provided we are fortunate to have sufficient dedicated volunteers to kick-start the fund.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The state cannot pay for entire family expenses. VWOs too are unlikely to do so.<br><br>The principle of people's self-help fund will have to be set up such that it will evaluate and take into account fundamentals of such a scheme which is more towards relieving hardship and not totally taking care of expenses on dollar-to-dollar basis.<br><br>The rationale of setting up a people' self-help scheme can be seen from our various forumers' postings regarding the current system of government which is one based on taxing and recovering all possible costs of government services with people being left to fend for themselves on two fronts - paying more and more and receiving less and less so every one will have to cope with rising daily subsistence expenses.<br><br>Such a fund set up will be targeted initially on deserving ones falling within such categories with some flexibility to be of help.<br><br>Details of current assistance amounts required may be quite deterring but if people understand the objective of the scheme they may respond better and offer community help based on $1.00 per month or per annum which may not be too much but when pooled together can be sufficient to launch a self-help project of national significance.<br><br>As for how to raise funds and who to target and what amount to help the needy all are important but can be worked out when we have the right no. of people and good set-up objectives and methodology worked out.<br><br>When we come to the bridge we will cross it rather than be deterred by such considerations.<br><br>Indirectly, such a fund will find a way out of the current dilema created by a government which is self-centredly managing for their own ego and superficial success irrespective of the problems faced by the people due to their taxing and profiteering system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zaxis,<br><br>I can see that you are concerned with final details of assistance like who are the deserving recipients and the amounts to be dispensed to help such deserving families. These are important detailed considerations.<br><br>At this point we have not got started and cannot yet answer all such issues and questions which are valid.<br><br>However we need to get enough support - popular support with sufficient volunteers - before we can address these.<br><br>For the start-up phase we need to get two important initial goals to be accepted by all volunteers and work towards these first -<br><br>(1) Create a People Self-Help Fund which will be popularly supported by the people because of its strong and worthwhile objective which will help to reach out to help solve the immense social problems caused by the current taxing and fullest cost recovery governing system.<br><br>Such a scheme will have immense challenges in meeting the dollar and cents needs but without starting there is no knowing what the people could do for themselves. There are many major issues such as determining who are the deserving recipients. Before we go into such details we need to put up good strong and clear criteria for such a scheme to get support and started.<br><br>Therefore I have set up the above-stated two initial goals and hope that all interested will subscribe to them and get going when we get enough volunteers. Get more friends and people to come in and sign up to become volunteers.<br><br>If we cannot even decide on initial goals or even get enough volunteers at this stage, it will be difficult to talk about such issues or get some such movement going.<br><br>lWith strong initial goals we can move next to have meetings and we will be able to overcome lmitations of existing schems for one reason or another which could not help adequately address our immense social problems.<br><br>(2) Make the donation amount such that it is affordable to every citizen so that it will become a self-sustainable people's self-help scheme without which citizens will be forever at the mercy of the present system of government.<br><br>Once we get past these two initial goals we will seriously draw up the mechanics on how to arrive at the deserving cases and the amounts to be dispensed in such  top-up assistance we have in mind.<br><br>We must remember not to lose sight of our initial goals otherwise we may get bogged down too early by detailing considerations.</div>
