It is a chance for those who are sincerely interested in contributing something towards self-help or gotong royong to take one step forward to serve the community in a meaningful way than merely contributing monies.<br><br>By adding values to our fellow citizens' lives that will become our way of playing a role.<br><br>We are not interested in politics or politicking and all these will be spelt out , and adopted and followed and practised in deed and spirit by all our volunteers of 15 forming the council.<br><br>So for such a reason I will recommend having a good start with more members and 15 is a mere guidance.<br><br>I will leave it to the committee or council to decide based on such challenge of building a truly People's Self-Help Fund.</div>

But seriously, have they regarded themselves as people's servants and be subjected to their queries for any lack in performance.<br><br>I am not a minister so I do not owe citizens a duty to serve them nor do I need to boast my abilities. I only need to post my views and suggestions objectively without fear or favor. Where government policies have gone wrong or created problems to the people, I will say so.<br><br>It would appear that due to self-centredness or certain lack of maturity whenever ministers are criticised by the newspaper critics like mr. brown or oppositions, people mentioned by you as walking the talk on nkf or any failures of duties they would get upset and many a time they would resort to threatening critics with defamation suits etc.<br><br>Citizens have to endure this kind of high-handedness and arrogance and are being prevented to raise issues and were being threatened or intimidated by such uncalled for high-handedness or abuse of power.<br><br>Let's be honest, how then do you expect these people, newspaper columnists or oppositions or mr. brown whom you cited as people who walk the talk to suit your convenience to give their views or stand for elections given all these threats and hypocrisy.<br><br>Go and conduct a national survey and find out how many people are put off by such hypocrisy and double-talks as stated in the foregoing.<br><br>PM Lee himself in his inauguration speech in 2004, has actually openly invited citizens to take an active part by giving their views and opinions on government actions and policies and said he would be worried if citizens are having no views for which he said he could be more worried.<br><br>Surely you are not going to engage in such hypocrisy or calling the critics whiners and quitters and challenging them with libel suits or telling them to walk the talk when clearly these people are doing what PM Lee has actually invited them to which is also what you are trying to stop.<br><br>So please do not confuse people with double talk. You should check with him on his inauguration speech and see for yourself whether it is the PM who has invited them to take an active part in offering views and suggestions on government performance. Whether the government is able to see the contributions of ideas and suggestions of view the criticisms as a cup half empty and half-full, it is a matter of mindset. I think you are the one the government really has to worry about as you will be the one running down citizens' active participation with all your hypocrisy and double talk.<br></div>

It is also my business if I am writing to Straits Times without payments as I may get a kick out of such letting off of steam or just to get something off my chest especially with so much hypocrisy and false pretences of government ministers who are trying to get all kinds of benefits for themselves while majority of citizens are still suffering from dropping wages and struggling with the rising costs of living to no end.<br><br>It is sad that the government does not understand people's problems and continue to play with words and hypocrisy without answering for their mistakes and failures.</div>
