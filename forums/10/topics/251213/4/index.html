Question is whether it should be a free for all as it will draw in people who are not having financial difficulties. I remembered visiting temples during my younger days where free food was provided on special occasions, and anyone who visited was free to join in and eat.</blockquote>The PSF is needed because it provides an alternative solution to help the poor and middle class (the new poor) who are unable to survive the economic game with a government obsessed with building up the country for the rich and foreigners.<br><br>Many who cannot retire or get three meals a day will have help from such fund which in return will be served and supported by such people who receive help to pay back in whatever way they can once they are put back on their feet.<br><br>In this way PSF will go on and generate growth as a way to work for the majority of citizens in whatever way and means they can.</div>
