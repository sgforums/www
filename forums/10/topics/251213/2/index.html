            <div class='col-md body'>The laws aside in forming groups... When even the thought of these self-help funds/groups based on race, income levels, secret, societies, unions etc exist and grow, it is an impending sign that times are bad/going to be very bad and that people have somehow lose faith in the 'great' government to take care of its people as it so trumpets e.g. to be world's first with more jobs, better pay,  big private properties, more millionaires, foreign talents, investments you see in the tabloid each day. It must all be a lie. Well, secret societies, the water margins etc, were formed to take care of their own kind during the ancient times in China where there were despot emperors, or during war and famine when the social situation were unstable. More people forming communities within their own would somehow disintegrate the so called inclusive society we live in. It is just like, I do not trust this society will take care of me, I need a smaller group of people like myself whom we can take care of one another. Something like a brotherhood. It is a regression to the past...the 1960s. And now we have the greater ministers fattening their pockets even further, justifying from black to white their higher pays/perks and all the extravagent benefits, the gap is just going to get bigger and there will be groups very isolated, and  a growing discontented masses,  just many waiting for something to happen. ,Perhaps groups can print their own money and used it amongst themselves in a town, or lookup to a robin hood godfather to be more powerful than the laws  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> etc. Must see what variations they morph to be? <strong>apply National Council Social Service, apply MCYS, apply IRAS.<br><br>then police lic.<br><br>double tax deduction system.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong>[/quote]</div>

The charities are Children of Singapore Foundation, Children's Lukaemia Foundation, and Club Sunshine Ltd, which was previously known as Kids-In-Distress Foundation Ltd.<br><br>All three charities were set up by Rajendren Rajamani, 24, whom the office of the COC has filed a police report against.<br><br>The COC has been observing these charities since October 2006 and has determined that the intentions of the three charities were not 'exclusively charitable'. The COC's office is unable to comment further on this as the case is being investigated by police.<br><br>Also denied charity status is the Kidney Fund Organisation (KFO), which has been prohibited from fund-raising on the grounds that it was not 'exclusively charitable'.<br><br>Out of the $110,000 in donations collected by KFO last year, 75 per cent was used to pay a commercial fund-raising company Amanah Fitrah, which is owned by KFO's vice-president.<br><br>The vice-president's wife is the president of KFO. The third trustee is an employee of Amanah Fitrah. The COC said that there was a serious conflict of interest in the set-up of KFO and that it would continue to monitor this organisation.<br></div>

We will make our fund's objectives clear, methods of fund raising creative and popular and constitution well designed to prevent malpractices.<br><br>We need truly altruistic founder members to build a truly People's Self-Help Fund. So we should not be easily discouraged by such past malpractices because we are not and will not be the same.<br><br>Please keep in touch here and when we do have enough volunteers we will meet.</div>
