              <p><strong>A dent in Singapore's financial hub dream</strong><br> By Megawati Wijaya
                          																	<br> <br> SINGAPORE - When the United States and Europe showed early signs of financial 
                          																	distress last year, Singapore came to the rescue of a handful of big investment 
                          																	banks hit by subprime mortgage problems. But as the financial contagion 
                          																	spreads, the island nation's open economy is emerging at least in the short 
                          																	term as one of the region's biggest losers from the crisis.</p>
              <p>Â Despite the island state's emergence as a regional financial hub and its 
                          																	limited exposure to the toxic securitized financial products which have blown 
                          																	big holes in Western banks' balance sheets, Singapore's economy is in a bad 
                          																	way. That's because its economic growth is still highly reliant on commercial 
                          																	trade, with merchandise exports representing over 220% of gross domestic
              product (GDP), according to a Credit Suisse research report.
                          																	<br> <br> Typically, around 20% of those shipments are destined for US markets, making 
                          																	Singapore's economic growth highly correlated to America's performance, 
                          																	according to the same research. As such, Singapore is already technically in 
                          																	recession, where a slump in exports pushed quarterly growth into negative 
                          																	territory for the second quarter in a row.
                          																	<br> <br> Third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 6.3% from the previous 
                          																	quarter, a steeper decline than the 5.7% contraction in the previous three 
                          																	months. The Ministry of Trade and Industry revised down its full-year economic 
                          																	growth forecast for the second time this year, recently trimming its projection 
                          																	to "around 3%" from 4% to 5% previously.
                          																	<br> <br> Swiss investment bank UBS sees the economy growing at 3.5% this year, but 
                          																	recently revised down sharply its 2009 forecast from 4.8% to 1.5%. Meanwhile, 
                          																	inflation earlier this year reached a 26-year high and consumer prices are on 
                          																	pace to rise between 6% and 7% this year, according to the Monetary Authority 
                          																	of Singapore (MAS). The Straits Times Index also fell to its five-year low of 
                          																	below 1,600 in the last week of October from the comfortable 3,500 in the 
                          																	beginning of the year.
                          																	<br> <br> "The direct financial exposure of Singapore financial institutions to the US 
                          																	sub-prime mortgages is relatively small," said Anand Srinivasan, associate 
                          																	professor of finance at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business 
                          																	School. "However, the indirect impact of a worldwide recession is bound to be 
                          																	large."
                          																	<br> <br> Singapore's National Trade Union Congress has (NTUC) warned that retrenchment 
                          																	will rise next year as business continues to deteriorate.
                          																	<br> <br> However, Singapore's ability to maintain a position as a global financial hub - 
                          																	already the world's largest private banking center next to Switzerland - will 
                          																	also likely require a rethink in the wake of the crisis, some analysts say. 
                          																	Srinivasan believes the sudden demise of global investment banks, in which some 
                          																	of which Singapore's government-linked <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JK06Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">investment</span></span></a> arms recently took major 
                          																	stakes, will have a negative impact on previously money-spinning proprietary 
                          																	trading and hedge fund activities here.
                          																	<br> <br> Meanwhile, the decline in stock market wealth across the globe means the need 
                          																	for wealth managers and private bankers will decline in the months, if not 
                          																	years, ahead. One Singapore-based relationship manager at a major bank who 
                          																	requested anonymity said that the funds he has under management have dropped by 
                          																	30% in the past two months.
                          																	<br> <br> Singapore is world renowned for its banking confidentiality and has on occasion 
                          																	stood accused of managing <a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JK06Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">money</span></span></a> of suspect origin. One former US Treasury 
                          																	Department official says that in recent years Singapore finance authorities 
                          																	sent out a small fraction of the number of alerts about potentially suspect 
                          																	financial transfers compared to their counterparts in Hong Kong.
                          																	<br> <br> The current global financial crisis has underscored broadly the need for 
                          																	greater regulation of banks and financial institutions, not just in the US and 
                          																	Europe, but worldwide. Should Singapore delay or resist the reforms called for 
                          																	in the West, it could have an impact on the island state's financial hub 
                          																	ambitions.
                          																	<br> <br> According to Srinivasan, more regulation and transparency of counterparty 
                          																	exposures is needed to prevent future financial contagion of the like recently 
                          																	spread from securitized sub-prime mortgage products.
                          																	<br> <br> "The development of a financial hub is something that takes a long time, as it 
                          																	requires a core of investors, institutions, laws and so on," said Srinivasan. 
                          																	"I think Singapore is on the way to becoming a financial hub, but the crisis 
                          																	would neither help nor hurt this move."
                          																	<br> <br> Others believe that Singapore could actually emerge from the crisis stronger 
                          																	and better positioned with Wall Street's collapse. "Banks in Singapore earn 
                          																	their income mostly through loans, and they don't <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JK06Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">invest</span></span></a> out their books," said 
                          																	Eric Sidharta, a relationship manager at a local bank. "In fact, the crisis may 
                          																	result in a stronger internal control and management processes. Banks that 
                          																	adapt best and fastest will survive," he said.
                          																	<br> <br> <strong>Winners and losers</strong><br> Whether Singapore's homegrown DBS, one of Southeast Asia's largest commercial 
                          																	banks, will emerge stronger from the recent turmoil is in doubt. Thousands of 
                          																	retail investors lost their holdings when Lehman Brothers-linked financial 
                          																	products offered and managed by DBS failed after the US investment bank 
                          																	collapsed.
                          																	<br> <br> The bank said 4,700 of its customers in Singapore and Hong Kong had invested a 
                          																	total US$360 million into the products, which are now deemed worthless. Angry 
                          																	investors have accused the bank of misrepresenting the products' risk and have 
                          																	asked the bank or government to refund their money. DBS Hong Kong has said that 
                          																	it will return 100% of investors' investments, while the bank's Singapore 
                          																	office has said that it will deal with the failure on a case-by-case basis.
                          																	<br> <br> A large number of investors in the Lehman Brothers "high note five" product in 
                          																	Singapore have yet to receive any reply from DBS Bank after waiting three to 
                          																	five weeks after filing complaints that they were "missold" the notes, 
                          																	according to Gerard Ee, who was appointed by DBS as an independent external 
                          																	consultant to oversee its process of handling customer complaints.
                          																	<br> <br> The Monetary Authority of Singapore has said it too would look into the 
                          																	"misselling" complaints. It has promised an imminent review of the structured 
                          																	products industry and hinted at new regulations requiring better descriptions 
                          																	and labeling of products and better training for professional relationship 
                          																	managers.
                          																	<br> <br> "There will be increasing rules and regulations on investment, which in a way 
                          																	will limit the banks' revenue stream in the short term," said Sidharta.
                          																	<br> <br> The multi-billion dollar question is how Singapore's two major government 
                          																	investment arms, Temasek Holdings and GIC, have fared amid the global financial 
                          																	meltdown. Both investment firms have historically been criticized for their 
                          																	lack of disclosure, but in line with Singapore's broad financial hub ambitions 
                          																	have recently moved towards greater transparency in their reporting.
                          																	<br> <br> Temasek announced in a release in August that it recorded a record <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JK06Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">profit</span></span></a> of 
                          																	$12.8 billion for the fiscal year which ended in March. The investment company, 
                          																	with $134 billion in assets, said it had as of March spread its investments 
                          																	near evenly between Asian and non-Asian markets. Financial service-oriented 
                          																	investments represented 40% of Temasek's portfolio, according to the same 
                          																	company statistics.
                          																	<br> <br> Significantly, Temasek highlighted its December $4.9 billion capital infusion 
                          																	in US investment bank Merrill Lynch and also noted that in July it invested 
                          																	another $3.4 billion into the ailing firm, which collapsed in October. The 
                          																	sovereign fund also invested $2 billion in Barclays and raised its existing 
                          																	stake in Standard Chartered Bank to around 19%.
                          																	<br> <br> GIC, which invests well over $100 billion in assets worldwide and is believed 
                          																	to be among the world's top five sovereign wealth funds, had as of March 
                          																	allocated nearly 70% of its total investment to positions in the US and Europe. 
                          																	Last year, it provided a $6.88 billion capital lifeline to Citibank and an 
                          																	additional $9.7 billion to Switzerland's UBS.
                          																	<br> <br> GIC said in a report from its chief investment officer on the firm's activities 
                          																	through March 2008 that by mid-2007 it had made a "modest reduction" in its 
                          																	exposure to public equity markets due to perceived "market excesses". GIC also 
                          																	said it invested in "several external funds that invested in mortgage-related 
                          																	securities and corporate leverage <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JK06Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">loans</span></span></a>, where selling by distressed holders 
                          																	had created compelling value".
                          																	<br> <br> With the more recent global collapse in banking shares and evisceration of 
                          																	major financial institutions exposed to those same sub-prime products, 
                          																	financial analysts estimate both Temasek and GIC are likely sitting on 
                          																	multi-billion dollar paper losses for the fiscal year scheduled to end in March 
                          																	2009. Neither investment firm releases quarterly results of their investment 
                          																	activities.
                          																	<br> <br> Nonetheless some local analysts believe the investments in distressed financial 
                          																	assets will bounce back over the medium term and eventually contribute to 
                          																	solidifying Singapore's position as a global financial hub. Srinivasan notes 
                          																	that the stakes were bought when markets were already significantly off their 
                          																	peaks and that "the time range for judging such investments should be between 
                          																	5-10 years".
                          																	<br> <br> He notes that leading US investors like <a id="KonaLink5" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JK06Ae01.html"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid green; color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; padding-bottom: 1px; background-color: transparent;">Warren </span><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid green; color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; padding-bottom: 1px; background-color: transparent;">Buffet</span></span></a> and other major sovereign 
                          																	wealth funds have recently committed capital to distressed financial assets. 
                          																	"Are all these people stupid? I don't think so," said Srinivasan. "In bad 
                          																	times, people with cash can take advantage of bargain basement prices of assets
