            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't dare to talk about fee hikes, Increased cost of living and reduced wages?<br><br>I think what WP and SDP said are indeed sensible, If I next time live in a GRC or SMC contested by them.. I'll definitely vote them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>WP said Why because we don't vote PAP we don't get upgrading YET we pay like $2,000/- per year? Then for those getting upgrading, Why must pay between $450 to $600? It's like government give you $1,000 next thing you know you're paying them back $2,000<br><br>SDP said everytime people forget about fee hikes, True that. Now the hikes are pretty held-back, After that they will probably hike this hike that and say first world country all have this and those normal political crap<br><br>PAP say Opposition here for 9 days say what residents want while they themselves here for like 5 to 15 years.. Who will know what the resident want? The obvious answer to oblivion people would be PAP.<br><br>Why this situation? Newspaper is govt-controlled, So opposition's movement all these years not given due credit except their own newsletter. Note, Their newsletter not sold everywhere <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think in a certain view, Opposition party can also take PAP to court.. Why? MM Lee said We need a first world government and opposition to advance, Obviously referring that we don't have a first world opposition.. That is clear defamation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And like also, Our ministers earn so much.. Yet we have families struggling with expenses and few to no help given or simply take too much time. All this money earned by MP every week, Can obviously be reduced right? I mean.. Are they there to help or are they there to listen, write letter and collect their bonus money from attending these sessions?<br><br>I think in order for PAP to survive the next 2 to 4 elections where young singaporeans who actually know what is going on to decide, They're gonna have to make themselves suit our needs rather than us facing it..<br><br>Time to cut the pay of government officials <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was particularly amused while watching the news on 5 last night.<br><br>I felt that instead of watching current affairs, i had stumbled onto the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>JAMES GOMEZ SHOW</strong></span></span>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Almost 75% of the news was covered by James Gomez. Like it or not, he is now no. 1 news material in SG.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Aside from that, the most obvious theory on why the PAP is conducting their electorial character assassination is that they don't have any dirt on the rest of the candidates. So once Gomez offered himself as the sacrificial lamb, the PAP are biting, hook line and sinker; even MM Lee is broadcasting the 'liar syndrome' by spending much of his time smearing the WP by association with the James Gomez Saga.<br><br>Only Khaw Boon Wan has answered on the mean testing issue, and unsatisfactorily too. Why aren't other MPs addressing it?<br><br>The whole episode is beginning to stink of fear. Fear that the WP is indeed a threat and could very well wrest Aljunied from George Yeo and expand on their existing Hougang powerbase.<br><br>This tiresome mudslinging by the PAP is starting to show: Yahoo and Asia1 polls about the James Gomez case indicate 20% believe he did it deliberately, 40% say it's time to move on and the remainder say it's becoming boring.<br><br>Sure, those figures could be vastly inaccurate, but it does reflect a certain response from the public. This 'bicycle-thief'  tactic may have worked in past elections, but the general public is now better-educated and more open.<br><br>The truth is they want to hear the Ruling Party answer for the transport fee hikes, rise in costs of living and loss in wages.<br><br>Instead, all they have seen are cracks in the armor of the once-invincible Ruling Party.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: blue;">PM LHL has resorted to saying that if we do not vote the 'right' people, EXXON-MOBILE and Shell may re-locate their investments elsewhere. Imagine the panic WP must be creating when our PM actually believes that losing a GRC will mean a complete lost of confidence by foreign investors....</span></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: red;">Mah Bow Tan has performed a somewhat embarrassing political U-turn in DENYING information from the HDB to SDA's Edmund Ng. </span></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>MM Lee has begun to show is tempermental and unsavoury side by blasting local reporters for asking benign questions about minister's pay and voting issues, claiming that their 'slurs' and 'implications' will not 'intimidate' him. A clear lack of patience and understanding with the younger generation, even after the no-holds barred forum on CNA. </strong></span></span><br><br>Is this the same party that claims Chee Soon Juan is vindictive but are themselves bordering on gangsterism?<br><br>Is this the same party who says they have delivered on ALL their promises but are now deliberately sidestepping every issue and distracting voters with the JAMES GOMEZ SHOW?<br><br>Is this the same party that preaches intergrity but is unwilling to stand firm on their own challenges?<br><br>What kind of example are they trying to demonstrate?</div>
