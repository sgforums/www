              <p><strong>The decline and fall of Nepal's last king</strong><br> <br> Gopal Sharma<br> Reuters North American News Service<br> <br> Jun 11, 2008 09:16 EST<br> <br> KATHMANDU, June 11 (Reuters) - <strong>Not long ago he was revered
                                                          by some as a Hindu god, waited upon by thousands of royal palace
                                                          retainers. His face adorned banknotes and the national anthem sang
                                                          his praises.</strong><br> <strong><br> Now Nepal's former King Gyanendra is vilified, has lost his crown
                                                          and is being forced out of his palace.</strong><br> <br> A specially elected assembly voted overwhelmingly to abolish the
                                                          239-year-old monarchy two weeks ago, leaving Gyanendra to go down
                                                          in history as the last king of Nepal. Gyanendra will now move to an
                                                          old royal hunting lodge just outside the capital until he has a
                                                          chance to find a permanent home.<br> <br> Addressing a first-ever press conference at the Narayanhiti royal
                                                          palace in Kathmandu on Wednesday, Gyanendra vowed not to leave the
                                                          country but stay in Nepal and work for the people.<br> <br> The 60-year-old businessman-turned-monarch has only himself to
                                                          blame, many Nepalis say, after an ill-judged power grab in 2005
                                                          when he dismissed the government, jailed politicians and declared a
                                                          state of emergency.<br> <br> Gyanendra was apparently fed up with Nepal's corrupt and squabbling
                                                          politicians and decided only he could rescue the country from a
                                                          deadly Maoist insurgency.<br> <br> The attempt backfired, and <strong>he was forced to back down the
                                                          following year after weeks of street protests that ultimately
                                                          sealed his and the monarchy's fate.</strong><br> <br> CHILD KING<br> <br> As a three-year-old boy Gyanendra was thrust on the throne in 1950
                                                          when his grandfather briefly fled to India, in the midst of a power
                                                          struggle with the country's hereditary prime ministers, the
                                                          Ranas.<br> <br> When King Tribhuvan returned a few months later, Gyanendra
                                                          retreated once more into the background, building a fortune in tea,
                                                          tobacco and hotels and getting involved in environmental
                                                          conservation.<br> <br> Then, nearly seven years ago, his more popular brother King
                                                          Birendra and eight other members of the royal family were shot and
                                                          killed by the crown prince, who then turned his gun on
                                                          himself.<br> <br> Gyanendra was back on the throne, and like many of his
                                                          predecessors, he was brought up to believe he knew better than his
                                                          subjects what was best for Nepal.<br> <br> The massacre had broken the mystique of a monarchy once revered as
                                                          incarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu, while Gyanendra's seizure of
                                                          power unleashed the wrath of the people.<br> <br> "I think he is getting what he deserved," said 48-year-old labourer
                                                          Suntali Khatri, breast-feeding her two-year-old daughter next to a
                                                          building site. "He could not ask for more."<br> <br> OVER-AMBITIOUS?<br> <br> Gyanendra went to school in Darjeeling, a hill station in eastern
                                                          India, and graduated from Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.<br> <br> Mohan Prasad Lohani, who taught him English in university, said he
                                                          was an irregular student -- more interested in politics than
                                                          studies. "He had his own notion of how things should change. He was
                                                          very ambitious," he said.<br> <br> That ambition could have been his downfall, analysts say. And it
                                                          has been a dramatic fall from grace.<br> <br> In the past two years, the government has seized thousands of acres
                                                          of royal lands, nationalised more than a dozen of his palaces and
                                                          sacked his priest in a purge of palace employees.<br> <br> Virtually confined to his palace, the king had his annual allowance
                                                          cut, been hit with tax demands and requests for unpaid electricity
                                                          bills. He has seen his face replaced by an image of Mount Everest
                                                          on the country's banknotes and praise of him purged from the
                                                          national anthem.<br> <br> But royalists who have met him said he has taken it all calmly, and
                                                          he looked composed and even smiled during his address to the
                                                          press.<br> <br> Some royalists argue that the hasty abolition of the monarchy could
                                                          backfire and leave the country without the anchor it needs in times
                                                          of change. But royalist parties won just four seats in the
                                                          601-member assembly in April.<br> <br> While many Nepalis liked the idea of a constitutional monarchy, few
                                                          like the idea of being ruled by Gyanendra or his unpopular son
                                                          Paras, who has a reputation as a playboy and a reckless driver.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In a situation like ours, however,
                                                          <strong>there is no realistic chance of an opposition party winning

                                                          introducing new ones—to make it impossible for opposition parties
                                                          to win any significant number of seats.</strong> It is just not
                                                          realistic or intelligent to attempt to change the election system
                                                          that the PAP controls <strong>by going through the election system

                                                          important to seek an alternative path to make our elections free
                                                          and fair. <strong>The only solution is for citizens to exercise
                                                          their rights through peaceful mass protests to compel the PAP to
                                                          accede to the people’s demands for a free and fair election
                                                          system.</strong> The immediate reaction of Singaporeans would be
                                                          that public protests in Singapore are banned. In such a case how
                                                          are citizens going to organize a mass movement? The answer is
                                                          through the use of non-violent action (see below).</span></p>

                                  inside the various busses, and order them out of the area. There wasn't
                                  time, he said, for police to identify the brawling teens."</p>

              <p>Yes,this is a traditional event that is tolerated in Norway.</p>
              <p>But somehow - if the International Schools' students here(AIS,CIS,GEP etc) is interested in this,they may be of significant help which we can organise a mass scale version of this which even though have no violence motiff,can already be of a great fear to Lee Kuan Yew and his PAP lackeys because it shows the mass people's power(in the russ case's - too much of a quantity for the police to control) of toppling the Government later on.</p>
