              <p><strong>Inside Higher Ed, 8 Jul 2009, Scott Jaschik</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Rights for Some People </strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Should someone who teaches human rights back human rights for all people?</strong></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br> </span> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>That's the question being raised
              by some students at New York University's law school, who are upset
              that a visiting professor in the fall semester, slated to teach human
              rights law, is Thio Li-ann of the National University of Singapore, an
              outspoken opponent of gay rights. Thio has argued repeatedly and
              graphically that her country should continue to criminalize gay sexual
              acts.<br> </strong></span> <br> In a speech to lawmakers in Singapore, Thio said that gay sex is
              "contrary to biological design and immoral," argued that gay people can
              change their sexual orientation, said that anal sex is "like shoving a
              straw up your nose to drink," and rejected arguments based on a
              diversity of sexual orientations by saying that "diversity is not
              license for perversity." (The text of her talk is here, and YouTube
              video is available in three parts -- here and here and here.)<br> <br> NYU OUTLaw, a group of gay and lesbian students at the law school, last
              week sent an e-mail message to all students drawing attention to Thio's
              statements, saying that <span style="color: red;"><strong>it
              was crucial to "raise awareness of anti-gay statements made by an NYU
              visiting professor" because "it is important for LGBT students and
              allies to be aware of her views in order to make fully informed
              decisions regarding class registration."</strong></span><br> <br> The letter does not call for the invitation to Thio to be rescinded.
              Ethan Park, co-chair of the group, said that the organization wanted to
              gather reactions before deciding what it was going to ask NYU to do,
              and that discussions were taking place electronically as students are
              scattered for summer internships.<br> <br> "One of the options would be to take a strong position and demand that
              the law school rescind the appointment, but others say that this could
              be an opportunity to teach about why we have somebody at the law school
              who promotes hatred," he said. Park said that the group has been
              receiving many strong reactions from students and alumni. He said there
              is widespread anger over Thio's appointment, but a range of views about
              what to do now.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>In an e-mail interview, Thio said that those who are attacking her are engaged in political correctness.</strong></span><br> <br> "Everyone is entitled to their opinion, free conscience, free thought
              -- that is a cardinal principle for every academic community. I hold to
              it, in my own law school, and I would expect the NYU law community to
              do so as well. We can be united in commitment to this principle,
              without slavishly bowing to a demanded uniformity or dogma of political
              correctness set by elite diktat. I cannot say I am impressed by this
              ugly brand of politicking which I hope is not endemic," she wrote.<br> <br> Thio added that she "was encouraged when the president of an NYU
              student organization committed to free debate wrote to welcome me and
              to point out that the negative, prejudicial and frankly, hostile views
              expressed are not representative of everyone in the student body. While
              I am disappointed at the intolerant animosity directed at me by
              strangers who do not know me and have decided to act on their own
              prejudices, forged from whatever sources, I am nonetheless glad that
              there are still some at NYU, who uphold a commitment to academic
              freedom and who entertain dissent with respect. As a recent NYU
              graduate, a Muslim friend of mine said, one must have courage in the
              face of bullying."<br> <br> On the substance of her views on gay rights, she argued in the e-mail
              that plenty of Americans may agree with her, and those who don't have
              no right to impose their values on other countries.<br> <br> She wrote: "Do some Americans by appropriating the rhetoric of human
              rights assume they can impose their views on another sovereign state?
              Is there a human right to sodomy? Is this a core right or a contested
              one? There are countervailing views that this is the wrong way to
              characterize the issue -- so do students who dislike this view refuse
              to engage with dissenting views? Or seek to censor views they disagree
              with? That's hubris. I think certain Americans have to realize the fact
              that there are a diversity of views on the subject and it is not a
              settled matter; there is no universal norm and it is nothing short of
              moral imperialism to suggest there is. Correct me if I am wrong, but
              there is no consensus on this even within the U.S. Supreme Court and
              American society at large, even post Lawrence v. Texas." (The court
              case is the 2003 Supreme Court ruling that barred states from
              criminalizing consenting sexual acts between adults of the same sex.)<br> <br> Thio will be teaching at NYU under a program that brings legal scholars
              from all over the world to the campus as visiting professors. John
              Beckman, an NYU spokesman, said that faculty panels review and select
              candidates based on "a record of excellent scholarship and fine
              teaching." He added: "Professor Thio was selected on the basis of her
              published academic scholarship, not on the basis of the statement she
              made to the Singapore Parliament as a member of that body. We believe
              that she will make a valuable contribution to our global classroom and
              to the intellectual life of the law school when she is here this fall."<br> <br> Beckman also noted that the law school at NYU "has a long record of
              opposing discrimination based on sexual orientation, and we are well
              known for being a supportive home for an activist lesbian, gay,
              bisexual, and transgender community. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Many
              in our faculty, staff, and student body will be in sharp disagreement
              with Professor Thio on the content of her speech, and we expect there
              will be a dynamic exchange on these issues."</strong></span><br> <br> Cary Nelson, national president of the American Association of
              University Professors, said that he would not advise NYU to rescind the
              invitation to Thio to teach there. But he said that it would be
              legitimate to raise questions about whether she should be teaching
              human rights.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>"Academic freedom protects you
              from retaliation for your extramural remarks, but it does not protect
              you from being prohibited from teaching in an area where you are not
              professionally competent, and there are doubts on whether she has the
              competency in human rights," Nelson said.</strong></span> He said
              that there is in fact an "international consensus, save a few countries
              like Iran" that gay people should not be treated as criminals.<br> <br> Nelson also said that in a tenure decision, he would judge a candidate
              -- however offensive his or her views on unrelated subjects -- only on
              a question of whether the person's scholarship and teaching in his or
              her discipline met appropriate standards. But in a hiring decision
              (whether for a visiting or permanent position), he said, it is
              appropriate to consider other factors, and the reality is that it's
              impossible to know what professors are really thinking when they vote
              one way or another.<br> <br> Professors can appropriately ask prior to appointments, he said,
              whether hiring someone whose views on certain subjects are "poisonous"
              could limit "the department's ability to do its business."</p>

              <p>Did "<em>Chee kicked away Chiam in a coup"</em> ?</p>
              <p>Has the noisy pussy been taken in by the <em>Drama Queen</em> of Speaker's Corner ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The saga of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party">Dr Chee Soon Juan and SDP </a>is well documented in the Wikipedia, and if Chiam See Tong has found the facts to be inaccurate, he would have protested and asked for the details to be updated.</p>
              <p>Nothing has been done since the information was placed there for more 9 years and new contributions are added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SDP was founded in 1980 by Mr <a title="Chiam See Tong" href="/wiki/Chiam_See_Tong"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chiam See Tong</span></span></a>, a British-educated lawyer who had contested several elections as an independent candidate since the mid 1970s.</p>
              <p>However the rise of the SDP was not to be, as differences soon emerged between Chiam and Chee. In 1993, three months after joining the SDP, Chee was accused of using his research funds to send his wife’s PhD dissertation to the <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">United States</span></span></a>. Dr Chee had asserted, and still does, that this was not the case as his wife was an employee in the same department at <a title="National University of Singapore" href="/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">National University of Singapore</span></span></a> at that time and was working with him, sharing and collaborating in their research, and that the funds were legitimately used. The <a title="National University of Singapore" href="/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">National University of Singapore</span></span></a> decided to sack Chee.</p>
              <p><a title="Chee Soon Juan" href="/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chee</span></span></a> claimed this was a political vendetta plotted by the ruling party as his supervisor Mr <a class="new" title="S.R. Vasoo (page does not exist)" href="/w/index.php?title=S.R._Vasoo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">S.R.

Supporters of Chiam left the party and formed the <a title="Singapore People's Party" href="/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore People's Party</span></span></a> in 1994, which Chiam took over from <a class="new" title="Sin Kek Tong (page does not exist)" href="/w/index.php?title=Sin_Kek_Tong&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sin Kek Tong</span></span></a> as the secretary-general in the 1997 general election.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The SDP</span> decided to strip Chiam See Tong's membership after the latter had gone to the Singapore Press Club and denounced the SDP</strong> and the <a title="Central Executive Committee" href="/wiki/Central_Executive_Committee"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Central Executive Committee</span></span></a>. Had he lost his membership, under the law, he would also have to lose his seat in parliament. The courts ruled that his dismissal was unfair and that he should be allowed to remain as a member of the SDP.</p>
