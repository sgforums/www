I say proud because these idiots often tend to hide in their own shell and rarely can we see them flaunt their stupidity as proudly as you seem to be doing. </span></span></p>

Did you know we have to feed their entire families too including his wife!</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;    " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It does not cost a bomb to employ one Gurkha. That is just being stingy. There is over 4 million in Singapore excluding the Gurkhas themselves and Singaporeans incomes are known to be much higher than most. If you spread the amount they pay for taxes, you are barely paying a dollar. And frankly the tax the Government takes from you does not entirely goes to paying the Gurkhas. Maybe if you looked at the budget for the year, you’ll see how widely dispersed your tax is.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;    " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

After they are released from their serve, their pension is about $600-800 which I am sure is not enough to feed his family. The only one essential benefit they have is that housing is provided for by the Government which I am sure they would not be able to afford considering their pay.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;    " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
