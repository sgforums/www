            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with some forumers here that we are living in a multi racial country and by using Gurkhas because they are a neutral force and hence more suitable for handling situations such as racial riots.<br>Is that the only Gurkha duties?Well guys, things are not as simple as that.<br>If we really need to have them in Singapore, i think we should have a neutral department to command the Gurkha.<br>What if the person in power misuse his power to command the Gurkhas to do something nasty against our own people?<br><br>View your comments please!!!<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Posted by Gopalan Nair at 3:02 PM<br><br>The Gurkhas, men from Nepal have been an integral part of the British Army since the early 18th Century, forming The Brigade of Gurkhas. They have served with distinction in various theaters of war, firstly against the Afghans in the North West Frontier, then the First World War in Gallipoli, Palestine and France and in Burma, Malaya, North Africa, Italy and France in the 2nd War. The Gurkhas unlike regular British troops in battle, charge at the enemy at close quarters, with drawn kukris (Gurkha swords) instead of fixed bayonets and with their customary shrill piercing cry "Aayaaoo Gurkhali" translated as "The Gurkhas are coming" in Hindi and Gurkhali, a cry so piercing and terrifying that hearing the cry alone can cause the enemy to flee in terror. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>They have a unique way of carrying their weapon the 0.762mm, SLR rifle, based on the FN Belgium design, which they carry horizontally while marching, carried by the handle grip, whereas all other soldiers carry it by the pistol grip, which makes the rifle vertical during marching. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>It has been said that during the Falklands War, 400 miles east of Terra Del Fuego, or Cape Horn, South America in the Atlantic, after the Gurkhas landed, <strong>it was sufficient for the RAF to drop leaflets over enemy Argentine positions, merely saying that the Gurkhas have landed and are sharpening their Kukris, for the conscript Argentine army to flee for their lives.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  True or fiction, I cannot tell.<br><br>Anyhow, let me come to the point. The British fought almost a 30 year war against the separatist Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. Various British Army units were dispatched to Northern Ireland for this war. <strong>But not once, did the British Army deploy the Gurkhas. The reason was that the British felt that although it was a war, the enemy was also British, since Northern Ireland was part of Great Britain and therefore it was morally wrong, repugnant, to deploy Gurkhas who were in essence foreign mercenaries against their own people, the Irish. This was a moral decision from which they did not waiver as it was unacceptable in the minds of the British for foreigners to fight against their own.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Whatever one could say about British injustices, one cannot possibly begrudge them of having honor integrity and moral principle in this, their stand.<br><br><strong>But Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, does not appear to have the same moral compunction that the British have on this point. Just the opposite. </strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> On the contrary, the Singapore Army does not have any Gurkha units. Strange, since one would have thought that if you are going to have Gurkhas, where else to employ them other than the Army to fight foreign enemies in the event of external aggression. Lee Kuan Yew does not appear to worry too much about foreign enemies, and he is quite satisfied that Singapore's conscript army can very well deal with external aggression.<br><br>In Singapore, on the other hand, the Singapore Police Force has a Gurkha Contigent, which appears to have grown in strength from numbering about 200 in it's first days to over 2000 strong today. The police force's duty being the enforcement of law and order within Singapore, it would appear that <strong>Lee Kuan Yew, in deploying Gurkhas in the Police Force appears more afraid of what Singaporeans would do to him, rather than what foreign enemies would do to Singapore! </strong> From this, one could guess perhaps, that <strong>Lee Kuan Yew knows that large numbers of Singaporeans hate him and hate his family so much, that they may, at the slightest provocation rise up in arms and revolt, which would mean the end of the Lee family's iron rule over Singapore, and if this happens, he will be able to rely on the power of the Gurkhas to quell such a rebellion. </strong>Otherwise why the need for Gurkhas in the Singapore Police Force? Why does he not trust his own Singaporean police to do the job? And why are there not Gurkhas in the Singapore Army where they belong?<br><br><strong>This is a case of fear. Fear both ways. Lee fears his people, so he deploys the Gurkhas. The people fear him and what the Gurkhas might do to them if they rebel. A country that carries on in a state of fear. One can only be sorry both for Lee Kuan Yew and the people of Singapore.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>Surely there can be a better way to live.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Singapore Dissident<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/02/singapore-gurkha-brigade-british-army.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/02/singapore-gurkha-brigade-british-army.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From wiki...<br><br><blockquote>Their presence as a neutral force was important because local police officers were often perceived for being (or were even expected to show) bias towards their own ethnic groups when handling racial disturbances, further fuelling discontent and violence. Officers who attempt to carry out their duties impartially and in full accordance with the law also face social backlash from their own ethnic communities, a difficult situation which can even lead to physical harm to individual officers.<br><br>In his autobiography, then Prime Minister, now Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew recounted the use of the Gurkha Contingent as an impartial force at the time when Singapore just gained independence. He wrote:<br><br>"When I returned to Oxley Road [Lee's residence], Gurkha policemen (recruited by the British from Nepal) were posted as sentries. To have either Chinese policemen shooting Malays or Malay policemen shooting Chinese would have caused widespread repercussions. The Gurkhas, on the other hand, were neutral, besides having a reputation for total discipline and loyalty."<br></blockquote>It sums everything up...</div>

That's why it is possible to stage coups. In Singapore, a coup is never a possibility.</div>

Gurkha was initially recruited by the British East India Company to fight wars, then they became part of the British Indian Army. Today, the British Gurkhas are not treated as mercenaries but are fully integrated soldiers of the British Army, operate in formed units of the Brigade of Gurkhas, and abide by the rules and regulations under which all British soldiers serve. Similar rules apply for Gurkhas serving in the Indian Army.
