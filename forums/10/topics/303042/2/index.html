            <div class='col-md body'>The observation that army generals are shuffled to prevent a military coup is very insightful. I have no doubt it is the correct one. Not sure if there is an incentive seeing how we don't have natural resources to steal and sell.<br><br>I think the fear that the Gurkhas may be or become a private army is valid. However I wonder if there are enough of them to qualify and isn't there a concern that they may be the ones conducting the coup? (reputation for loyalty aside).<br><br>I tend to see them as third party bodyguards, without local affliations, rigorously trained, rotated regularly, closely monitored, long hours with little or no private/social life. ie The kind of life even us hard working singaporean citizens would not put up with.<br><br>I also hate to point this out but if the government was attacked by a foreign terrorist group, fewer citizens will die in the initial attack. That sounds pretty cold and I don't mean to cheapen the Gurkha's lives but still, something to consider:<br><br>Fewer citizens dead = less hostility to the attackers = more room for diplomacy.<br><br>And no, I don't know how much they are paid.<br><br>Edited: Also agree with Fatum</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, that is true.. they live in their own community and are discouraged (practically disallowed) from fraternizing with the local community.<br><br>they are mainly asked to return to back to their home country.<br><br>in fact, there is a UK body set up to take care of these gurkhas. apparently, the amount they are paid does not necessarily take care of their future requirements after retirement.<br><br>if i am not mistaken, they are forced to retire a relatively young age. so those junior soldiers would barely get to make ends meet after retirement.<br><br></div>
