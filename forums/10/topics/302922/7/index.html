You want simplistic answers, go to a church or a temple. Get a religion.... in fact the one at suntec city has the most simplistic answer of all... believe in Jesus and you will prosper beyond your wildest dream... how more simplistic can you get?<br><br>... if you don't prosper, don't blame Jesus... you lack the faith.<br><br>You don't believe they preach that, go to their website... http://www.newcreation.org.sg/<br><br>... and if you can believe, good luck to you..
