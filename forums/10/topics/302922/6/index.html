            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, this Andrew guy claims he is a consultant.<br><br>I have been to his website, and seen him displaying proudly a letter from PSA confirming him as their external consultant.<br><br>Let me just put some things in perspective.<br><br><ul>PSA has many high-value confidential systems. These are in-house systems that are high-value and will not be outsourced to external parties. Only less important systems are outsourced to external parties</ul><br><ul>In PSA, a consultant is equivalent to a contractor, and these contractors include indian programmers</ul><br><ul>In PSA, an external consultant is never valued. They are only used for low-level, low-value jobs</ul><br><br>So in summary, if Andrew wants everyone to think he is something like a Deloitte or IBM Consultant, then I would like to correct the perception, because a consultant in PSA is nothing more than a programmer.</div>
