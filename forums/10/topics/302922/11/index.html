            <div class='col-md body'>Again, I urge anyone who has even the slightest faith in Andrew's market knowledge and predictive powers to ask him a simple question:<br><br>If you are confident of a market crash, are you currently in a shorting position?<br><br>If not, why are you not following your read on the market? Do you lack confidence in your own analysis?<br><br>I recall a personal story that happened a few months back. My mom had then just met this "investment guru" who was always apparently spot on in his choice of investments(like Andrew, he only claimed victories after the market had reacted). So anyway, my mom requested I have lunch with this man.<br><br>If you recall correctly, the price of crude was hovering just below 80 dollars a barrel for several days. One of his many "students" was just asking him if she should invest in crude when I arrived. I was fascinated to hear him break down that question into many fundamentally sound points. He spent about 20 minutes pointing out the fundamental reasons why crude would never rise above 80. In fact, he downright predicted that it would fall back to 60 soon.<br><br>I was quite impressed really, until I finally got a chance to ask him a question.<br><br>"How much are you investing, shorting the crude market?" i asked.<br><br>His reply shocked me. "I never short. It's too dangerous."<br><br>Now, I never look down at a man who makes a wrong read on the markets. Everyone does it. In fact, a good trader is one who is right 65% of the time. That's a lot of bad reads. The thing that shocked me was that he wasn't acting on his read. This is such a telling fact that can only mean one thing. He's not confident of his own predictions.<br><br>If a man is not confident of his own predictions. Why the hell are you listening to him? Sure enough, the price of crude rose that very week. And we all know it has yet to come down to 60.<br><br>That's the thing about listening to "investment gurus". They may give you advice, but do you know if they're actually confident enough to invest according to their own advice?<br><br>By the way, Andrew is a fundamentalist. I have no idea why he's talking about trends. Apparently, TA is only good when it can be used to make fun of his opponents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the only reason you guys have trouble seeing the value of bailing out foreign banks with local money is really that you are currently unable to see beyond the short term.<br><br>National funds are long term players. They play the long game.<br><br>Consider a simple game of monopoly. There are limited land slots on the board. By the time we hit mid-game, the land is worth more than it's stated value. Why is it so? It's because it's virtually impossible to buy that land without some form of leverage, thus multiplying it's true value many times over it's stated value.<br><br>Same thing with investing in big foreign banks. To the casual observer, the government might be senselessly pumping in huge amounts of money into a foreign asset. But one might ask themselves...if they banks weren't in the trouble they are currently in now, would we even have the CHANCE to buy a stake?<br><br>Buying in now is like overpaying for a slot in the monopoly game. It may not turn a profit yet, but at least we're now in the door. The opportunity came knocking, and we would be fools not to take it.<br><br>Remember, when the market's doing well, there is no way we're gaining such a huge stake in the big foreign banks. The fact that it is only in bad markets that such opportunities appear is the reason you're all thinking the gov is buying high to sell low. It's a classic example of confusing cause and effect.<br><br>The kicker is, if Andrew is what he claims he is, HE MUST KNOW THIS. So either he is deliberately misleading everyone to garner doubt in the current administration, or he really is the incompetent faker I picture him to be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cute<br><br>considering i've never promoted speculation(you have, by the way...with that thai baht fiasco)<br><br>I've hardly ever even talked about futures. You sure like to put half truths into other's mouths.<br><br>As for the so called "threat"....you can take what you want from it. One thing you can't do is say I never warned you.<br><br>All I've ever advised ppl to do was to calculate the odds before investing(and also to disregard everything you say). U on the other hand have...<br><br>1) promoted the importance of insiders information<br>2) downplayed the importance of knowing the odds<br>3) predict the market crashes every other week<br>4) played around with charts to make everyday seem like doomsday(out of context charts tend to do that)<br>5) outright lied about things that forumers have pointed out<br>6) proven you know less about gambling than the stock market.</div>
