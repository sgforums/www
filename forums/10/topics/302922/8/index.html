            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, we haven't seen the last of the sub-prime woes and it's effect on the market.<br><br>Bernanke tries to perform some witchcraft economics by reducing interest rates during a credit crunch. Probably in response to China's incessant desire to maintain and undervalued RenMinBi. Lower interest rates during a credit crunch would fuel spending. Don't know whether his motive for monetary expansion is to prevent the US economy from going into a recession or to depreciate the US dollar against the RMB.<br><br>Credit Crunch:<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_crunch" rel="nofollow"><br>It is often caused by a sustained period of lax and inappropriate lending, which results in losses for lending institutions and investors in debt when the loans turn sour and the full extent of bad debts becomes known. These institutions may then reduce the availability of credit, and increase the cost of accessing credit by raising interest rates. In some cases lenders may be unable to lend further, even if they wish, as a result of earlier losses restraining their ability to lend.<br></a><br></div>
