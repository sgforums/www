            <div class='col-md body'>sigh here we go again.<br><br>For those who have just joined in(I see a few), and apparently seem swayed by Andrew's "expertise", let me bring you up to speed.<br><br>Andrew has claimed quite a few crashes this year. Only twice has it really dipped a little right after he claims it would. The first time was in july/aug i believe, when EVERYBODY knew it would dip, due to the subprime. The second was an offhand comment on the SGD against the thai baht(it sounded more like a joke because the justification he gave was a bus ride of sorts).<br><br>In both cases, he claimed to have traded himself according to the advice he gave. Unfortunately, these claims were made AFTER the crash itself. He considers these claims to be good enough as proof that he made money from it. That is not correct. If we are to assume that he really made the trades, we must also assume he traded based on his outlook that the market would crash everytime he made the 'crash' prediction, which was often. Looking at it this way, Andrew definately lost money, so either way, he is not to be believed.<br><br>Andrew is apparently the author of a book on the dangers of gambling. It is currently unpublished(and probably never will be). He has a vested interest in sounding like a genius to the public when it comes to uncertain games like the stock market, which is slightly similar to the gambling games in the casino(i say slightly, because it is actually quite different from the casino games).<br><br>Speaking of casino games. Andrew's only claim to knowledge about them seems to be that he has read a few articles regarding gambling addiction. Bearing in mind that he is writing a book from the position of an expert on casinos(and me being somewhat one myself), I have in the past asked him many offhand basic questions about how casinos work, and details about various games. He has thus far drawn a blank.<br><br>As I have pointed out in the past, even Andrew's credentials are questionable at best. The only credentials he posts on his websites appear to be those in the role of IT consultants. He draws our attention to the thai worded contract he also posted(who reads thai? we need verification), and claims it was a contract in the position of trading.(he doesn't openly come out and say it. He was a manager of sorts in a trading company, but he implies it.) I should of course point out again that being a director in a trading company doesn't necessarily mean you get to trade, or have any experience in trading at all.<br><br>Now, here's the part of the main argument between Andrew and I that I'm surprised Andrew doesn't want to bury in the past. Andrew has repeatedly said the stock market must be traded in a calculative manner, and not with the heart/emotion. That is actually correct. Unfortunately, he contradicts himself everytime because he doesn't even know what he's saying. If you remove yourself from emotion and rumors, and trade solely on calculated risk, odds are the only things left to consider. Andrew disagrees on this solely because I was the one who said it.<br><br>Andrew has also in the past leaked a little more than he wished to. He has claimed that one of the tactics that made him profitable in the past was insider trading. Now, I know that the professionals around here know as well as I do that insider trading is not always illegal in the market, but he was hardly in the position to be making the legal transactions. So Andrew really has 3 choices in this matter.<br><br>1) He was trading with valid information, and that was illegal<br>2) He was trading with rumors that turned out to be correct(which competent trader does that?)<br>3) He was just bullshitting<br><br>I could go on and on about the various nonsense that Andrew tries to constantly pull off. The misquoting. The downright misrepresenting of facts. The name calling. Andrew is, for all purposes, definitely not acting like a professional.</div>
