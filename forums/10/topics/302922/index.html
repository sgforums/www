It looks like it will get a lot worse before it gets better possibly with big casualties and by the time it gets better, many people would be badly hurt financially.<br><br>... the crisis had led to a crisis in the stock markets, which would wipe out even more money from the financial systems.<br><br>... with a deteriorating trust in money, what would happen is that, those with goods and commodities, will not be willing to sell you at the same price, they would want more money or they might not even want money but would prefer to exchange other goods or services with you.<br><br>... while all these are not the Sg despots fault, they made policies that put Singapore under great financial risks.<br>1.
