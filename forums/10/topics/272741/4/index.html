Intellectual Property Protection... Existing Infrastructure... and most importantly... COST...<br>One impt reason why we are getting so much FDI in the past is becos of our location...<br><br>With the monetary mindset that our govt has... I'm afraid that once we become old and useless and unable to contribute economically to the country, we will end up like the aunties and ah soh in the food court, cleaning up after the rich and unable to retire comfortably due to rising hogh cost of living and the stagnant pay increase...<br><br>Singaporeans are valuable in our own way.... We are bilingual and more importantly..we are pretty highly educated...   Tat is why Sporeans are getting more and more mobile.... The govt recognises this and thus in my opinion, tried to use debts to bind the citizens ... Tat is why they increase cost of living via GST, approve transport fee hike...etc... By making things more expensive, and keeping the wages stagnant..<br><br>People are forced to take up bank loans to pay for HDB...Car..etc... Thus they are binded by debt to slog away their life in Singapore... By eroding weath accumulation... Singaporeans can;t migrate even if they want to..<br><br></div>
