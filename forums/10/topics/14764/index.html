If people can understand it, then it is good no matter what language is used.<br><br>However, I feel that the approach the government takes is correct. If you go U.S.A and tell the waiter that you want a roti, she won't understand you.

            <div class='col-md body'>If the word kiasu is derived from singapore....then lets make other words in the language Singlish be found in the dictionary as well.  Singlish is our identity, a language that binds singaporeans together.  Lets use Singlish!!</div>

True there might be some embrassing moment, but issit to say that speak true English will definetly not be in the situation.<br><br>blurfreak :<br>i am glad someone think like me, like theywant to face out dialect. I feel it will be a lost of 200 yrs of culture in singapore.<br><br>pixie :<br>my qn to u is whose standard do we follow, the US, UK or the ozzies? Unless they are to set a gobal standard which the world will follow, if not why should will follow their standard which in other parts of the world still do not understand.<br><br>The Rest :<br>Singapore have come this far, with the hurdle of singlish might i add so i dont see why out the sudden the world fail to understand us.

            <div class='col-md body'>A few months ago, this topic came up in English class. We were supposed to write an argumentative essay and of course my reaction was... I SUPPORT SINGLISH!<br><br>If you ever notice, people from different countries speak English in their own slang. It's not just English, the Chinese from different countries also speak differently. So why can't Singlish be accepted? I'm glad that so many people here support Singlish, as what some people had said, it's our identity! We should stick to it and fight for its presence(although its presence is already strong enough  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">).<br><br>On the other hand, I have to agree with the government, we have to learn proper English. I think proper English should be taught so that we won't "malu" ourselves when trying to write a formal letter. Other than for formal purposes, I think Singlish can be used. I guess I have made my point...<br><br>------------------<br>Follow your heart and do what you think is right... If anything goes wrong, blame yourself and no one else... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
