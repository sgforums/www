So many people look only from their own view points. So many people think their ways are the right ways, are they PAP people, apparently not, because these people are anti PAP but they all behave the same. In Vietnam, I saw how the Singaporean SIA manager scolded the local employees; in China, I heard how Singaporeans criticise the locals; in Indonesia, well don't have to go there, just see how Singaporeans treated their maids... the story can go on...<br><br>and many of these people criticize others for discrimination, but they are the one who are discriminatory against even their fellow Singaporean. If even Singaporean Chinese and Indian who don't speak english are feeling discriminated in Singapore, the PRC and those from bangala, madras...cannot expect to be treated better if they don't speak english. sigh....

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Deathbait,<br><br>I'm sorry I did not make myself clearer.<br><br>I did not mean to say self reflection is bad.<br><br>Bear in mind the "why don't you look at yourself" is used as an emotive appeal for empathy and understanding. To work, this requires and depends on sufficient parallels in the subject party. The purpose is to to adjust a negative emotional mindset that may be blocking an intellectual appeal or to create a mindset where the intellect may resolve it in a biased manner in accordance with your intent.<br><br>It was not used appropriately against the anecdotal evidence because as in example 1. the reader could empathize with the stabbed person's family.<br><br>You can argue that you did not intend that effect or that meaning. I accept that. I am not arguing that it was what you meant. I'm highlighting the effect.<br><br>This tool can also be abused, as in to imply to bystanders that the other person is incapable of empathy, which is a basic human trait vital to our own protections. This dehumanizes the other person, changes the subject, does not look like an outright criticism, confuses bystanders etc. To accomplish this successfully, you require to draw parallels that the entire crowd of bystanders can emphatize with.<br><br>It can also serve to obfusicate the issue by creating the empathic link then purposely creating confusion as to what conclusion you are taking us towards. In the meantime, action is put on hold. Used this way it's intended effect is to delay action.<br><br>Your use had the 3rd effect on me and seemed pointless. I was bringing it to your attention in case it wasn't what you intended.<br><br>I apologize for being vague. I end up making no sense when I edit for brevity or sounding long winded I edit for understanding, or simple minded when I edit for vocabulory.<br><br>Edited: or illiterate when I type in a hurry.<br><br>Thank you for letting me clarify.</div>
