            <div class='col-md body'><br>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_Commission" rel="nofollow"><strong>Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</strong></a><br><br>The <strong>Trilateral Commission</strong> is a private organization, founded in 1973 at the initiative of the heads of the Council of Foreign Relations and of the Bilderberg Group, among them David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. It consists of approximatively 300-350 private citizens from Europe, Pacific Asia (Asia &amp; Oceania), and North America, and exists to promote closer cooperation between these areas.<br><br>Membership is divided into amounts apportioned to each of its three areas. Members who gain a position in their respective country's government leave the commission.<br><br><strong>The organization has come under much scrutiny and criticism by political activists and academics working in the social and political sciences. The Trilateral Commission has found its way into a number of conspiracy theories, especially relating to the Round table groups.</strong><br><br>The North American continent is represented by 107 members (15 Canadians, 7 Mexicans and 85 US citizens). The European group has reached its limit of 150 members, including citizens from Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.<br><br>At first, Asia and Oceania were represented only by Japan. However, in 2000, the Japanese group of 85 members expanded itself, becoming the Pacific Asia group, composed of 117 members: 75 Japanese, 11 South Koreans, 7 Australian and New Zealand citizens, and 15 members from the ASEAN nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand).
