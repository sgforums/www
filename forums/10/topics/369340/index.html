              <h3>Brookes Business School</h3>
              <div id="parliamentary-question">
              <h4>Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament</h4>
              <p>Mdm Halimah Yacob, MP for Jurong GRC</p>
              <h4>Question</h4>
              <p>(a) What steps have been taken to stop Brookes Business School from
                                  continuing with peddling fake degrees after the Royal Melbourne
                                  Institute of Technology reported to the Ministry in 2007 about them?;
                                  and (b) What was done to alert the public so as to contain the damage?</p>
              <p>................</p>
              <p><span class="lineno">4</span>..On the Member’s specific questions,
                                  RMIT had written to MOE in April 2007 to report that the Brookes
                                  Business School was falsely associating itself with RMIT on its website
                                  and offering RMIT’s external degree programmes. In the same letter,
                                  RMIT had also informed MOE that it had obtained an undertaking from
                                  Brookes Business School to remove all references to RMIT under its
                                  programmes and collaterals, to notify affected students, and to refrain
                                  from any such activities in the future. RMIT had indicated that it
                                  would initiate legal proceedings against Brookes Business School if the
                                  undertaking was not honoured.</p>
              <p><span class="lineno">5</span>..Subsequently in June 2007, MOE issued a
                                  warning to Brookes Business School for carrying misleading information
                                  on its website and other publicity materials. RMIT was kept informed
                                  and as MOE did not receive further indication from RMIT, considered the
                                  matter to be resolved through private action between the parties
                                  concerned. We also understand that no legal proceedings have been
                                  initiated by RMIT against Brookes Business School over the past two
                                  years.</p>

              <p>2.I think less students would choose Brookes from April if MOE tell the public about  RMIT's complaint.</p>
              <p>3.Nowadays,civil servants shall not just look at the In Box of e mail and In box on</p>
              <p>their desk.They should pro active to serve the public.They should sound the warning.</p>
              <p>This incident will not enhance reputation of SG in education..</p>
              <p>How can they assume" THE CASE is closed" when they have not received</p>
              <p>any complaints.Have they read newspaper and web site abt Brookes advertisements,</p>
              <p>if there is any?</p>
              <p>4.I am pity with all students who put their truths,time,money and hopes in SG education sys!!</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Lionnoisy,</p>

              <p>First and foremost, you must understand that</p>
              <p>MOE works in way that they will address the problem and give the public an answer once everything is clear, in the meantime, as usual, investigation is going on with court cases coming soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is our strategy and tactics to delay such issue as we know that normal Singaporeans will tends to forget about important issuesas time goes by, therefore on behalf of MOE and all the staffs, we like you to remain silent till further notice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Within we remain</p>

              MOE should step in to regulate the private school industry....not just leave it to CASE otherwise why we have education ministry for?
              
              Does Singapore Medical Council &amp; MOH regualate private doctor practice?  Does MHA regulate those night spots etc?  Does MOT regulate both private &amp; public transport service?  Why they never leave it to Case?
              
              
                  
                  CASE only play a general role to protect consumer interest..they dun really care abt the quality etc &amp; they are not the experts..MOE is the expert in education but they seems to prefer to keep quiet.
                  
                  At one point, Singapore aims to improve on its education image by attracting foreign uni such as NSW.  But the other end, MOE is abandoing the student when they get into trouble.  Either MOE banned all private school or they must step in.

              <p>Should we be surprised that this issue is raised by the ever noisy pussy that is so loudly proud of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Will such a situation exist in Australia - where make believe educational institutions are registered to con students with false degrees ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, only in a make believe First World Country that the desparately Third World Elite Leadership to be successful - will allow such a situation to exist.</p>
              <p>If licenses to operate had been given, how extensive was the process made to verify the authencity and qualifications of the parties involved ?</p>
              <p>It is surprising that the noisy pussy failed to be as intense in its noisy making as it would have been - if the same had happened in OZ.</p>

              <p>Cause most Singaporeans believe and trust the gov too much. Like the NKF and Ren Ci saga, everyone think that SG govt is so efficient so there must have check in place to ensure that the money goes to the people in need. But see what happened?</p>
              <p>Same goes to the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/parliamentary-replies/2009/07/brookes-business-school.php">Brookes Business School</a> incident. Singaporeans thought the MOE would have already checked that the school is okay to allow it to operate here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, too bad, it's just another one more item to add on to "its an honest mistake, let's move on". Time to increase the poor minister of education salary to motivate him to work harder? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
