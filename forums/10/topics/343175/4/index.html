              <p><br> I do agree that Singapore will probably go down badly when LKY dies
              but not for the same reasons.</p>
              <p>Too much people here believe that LKY and the PAP is the cause
              for all our problems. As long as he dies or PAP breaks up we'd
              all be better off. How many times already have humanity
              thought the same thing when they overthrown dynasties and
              empires?</p>
              <p>I am eagerly waiting for him to die, just so i can
              see people celebrate and rejoice at the death of the
              tyrant/dictator/sociopath for about a week and then realise
              horribly we now have to solve the problems the previous
              government was actually solving for us. We have to be actually
              responsible for our choices good or bad and not be able to
              blame someone else for it.</p>
              <p>What a joyful surprise that would be.</p>
              <p>We won't need LKY to ruin Singapore for us, i'm sure the
              hundreds of people who think they can do better than him would do

              <p>Dont forget Singapore government is the biggest employer in the countries. Any wrong votes may ruin their career since the government are able to know who you have vote with the serial no bar code on the voting paper. Vote is not confidential in Singapore if they want to trace it. ;)</p>
