              <p>In the past, life was simple and i do agree ppl are easily contented with things .... I am 25 this yr and hey i have my fair share of poverty too .. But those who are born like 1990 and above yeah is having pretty good life now .. But u need to put into consideration how technology has improve and how fast pace is the working life nowadays compare to the past.</p>
              <p>About the fact that someoen banging the keys on the keyboard is an indication of being good life ? Ok, let compare the past and now .. How many shops are there for rent in the past (i mean during our parents generation) Not much i will said .. Econmy is not realli that good then. </p>
              <p>Its almost impossible to see streets hawker nowadays .. Cos there's much more employment compare in the past and now .. Having a shop now also doesnt mean u are having a good life too .. Who know that person is making a loss for all u know.</p>
              <p>Thru out the years life has improve for us but it has reach a point whereby the ERP and stuff are getting from bad to worst.</p>

              <p>my point is merely: compared to our forefathers, kids have it really really good. So good that many do not even know what real hardship is.</p>

              <p><br> I'm actually the same age as you but i don't see why technology has
              anything to do with it besides making us less tolerant of
              discomforts. In the end it really depends on your perspective on
              what is fast paced or not, but i'm sure it's not going to beat my
              grandfather carrying ricebags everyday under the hot sun and heavy
              rain.</p>
              <p>The problem is we are going have to face the fact that
              we're not going to be able to make the kind of jump from poverty to
              fortune the way our grandparents did. It's a physical fact rather
              than the incompetence of the PAP government.</p>
              <p>It's just like doing Pull ups in NS, in BMT the amount of pull
              ups you can do will greatly increase but once you pass out you will
              start to realise each additional pull up is going to take more
              training and effort than the previous one.</p>
              <p>Right now we are already close to our limit, where each % of
              growth is taking vastly more effort than the previous. There is no
              such thing as unlimited growth.</p>
              <p>Whether something is bad or worse is a matter of perspective. I
              enjoy taking walks and i feel cars are hardly a neccessity in
              Singapore so the ERP hardly affects me. I like my job and my
              colleagues, and i enjoy being able to treat my relatives to the
              occasional lunch.</p>
              <p>I control my spending and make sure there is a clear line
              between need and want. I don't have problems getting food or drinks
              and my water and electricity is uninterrupted. I don't just live
              within my means, i live below my means.</p>
              <p>When you think something is bad, you make it easier for you to
              accept information to support the belief that it is bad giving the
              impression that it is worse. So whether you feel life in Singapore
              is getting harder or not is whether you want to believe
              that it is</p>
              <p>That's my take on it.</p>

              <p><br> I'm actually the same age as you but i don't see why technology has
              anything to do with it besides making us less tolerant of
              discomforts. In the end it really depends on your perspective on
              what is fast paced or not, but i'm sure it's not going to beat my
              grandfather carrying ricebags everyday under the hot sun and heavy
              rain.</p>
              <p>The problem is we are going have to face the fact that
              we're not going to be able to make the kind of jump from poverty to
              fortune the way our grandparents did. It's a physical fact rather
              than the incompetence of the PAP government.</p>
              <p>It's just like doing Pull ups in NS, in BMT the amount of pull
              ups you can do will greatly increase but once you pass out you will
              start to realise each additional pull up is going to take more
              training and effort than the previous one.</p>
              <p>Right now we are already close to our limit, where each % of
              growth is taking vastly more effort than the previous. There is no
              such thing as unlimited growth.</p>
              <p>Whether something is bad or worse is a matter of perspective. I
              enjoy taking walks and i feel cars are hardly a neccessity in
              Singapore so the ERP hardly affects me. I like my job and my
              colleagues, and i enjoy being able to treat my relatives to the
              occasional lunch.</p>
              <p>I control my spending and make sure there is a clear line
              between need and want. I don't have problems getting food or drinks
              and my water and electricity is uninterrupted. I don't just live
              within my means, i live below my means.</p>
              <p>When you think something is bad, you make it easier for you to
              accept information to support the belief that it is bad giving the
              impression that it is worse. So whether you feel life in Singapore
              is getting harder or not is whether you want to believe
              that it is</p>
              <p>That's my take on it.</p>

Our time, energy and life is sucked out of us by the farmers, like batteries, just like eggs and milk are from chickens and cows.

              <p>Try talking to the same old folks after you gain their trust that your white shirt and white pants are just your school uniform.</p>
              <p>Many older generation have not forgotten the skewed REFERENDUM that LKY forcefully pushed through despite the concerns from a far greater number of Singaporeans that were doubtful of our position in a merger with the Federation of Malaya.</p>
              <p>The failure of Singapore to be part of Malaysia is a failure of LKY efforts to ensure that Singapore will be an equal member despite all his assurances given to Singapore simply to see to the success of his wilfull insistence that Singapore must be part of a Federation of Malaysia.</p>

              <p>Too much people here believe that LKY and the PAP is the cause for all our problems. As long as he dies or PAP breaks up we'd all be better off. How many times already have humanity thought the same thing when they overthrown dynasties and empires?</p>

We have to be actually responsible for our choices good or bad and not be able to blame someone else for it.</p>
              <p>What a joyful surprise that would be.</p>

              <p>Because the big picture is ultimately comprised of small stuff. If you ignore the small stuff, why would you be shocked when you realise you keep getting the same big picture over and over again?</p>
              <p>Where do you think the rich fucks get their money from in the first place? Their ancestors worked harder than everyone else and got the fruits of their labour. The problem has always been us ignoring the small things that make up the big picture.</p>
              <p> You keep blaming the elites over and over again, they climbed to their position supplying us with what we wanted. I'm not going to blame Macdonalds for being fat because they know how to satisfy our tastebuds.</p>
              <p>This monetary system is what WE wanted, because the majority of us are able to get a fair trade of our labours under this system, we don't want to carry heavy sacks of gold and silver in order to purchase stuff. It is a birth of convenience, hardly intentionally designed as a tool of control but there will always be opportunistic individuals who know how to use it to manipulate others.</p>
              <p>Surprise, surprise. We ARE animals, we are still governed by instincts that are relevant in our ancestors' times. There's no point pretending we are not.</p>
              <p>I recognise that i've got instinctive needs i got to satisfy from time to time and i satisfy them. What we understand as happiness is merely triggering the chemical release from our brains to give us that buzz.</p>
              <p>The problem is the more buzz we get, the lesser the high we obtain each time. That is the source where all the constant dissatisfaction that is prevalent in ALL mature societies come from.</p>
              <p> We crave so much that high we can get from striking the lottery but the feeling after you've spent it could be the worse thing you would ever experience.</p>

              <p>This monetary system is what WE wanted, because the majority of

                  we don't want to carry heavy sacks of gold and silver in order
                  to purchase stuff. It is a birth of convenience, hardly

              <p>Surprise, surprise. We ARE animals, we are still governed by

              <p>I recognise that i've got instinctive needs i got to satisfy
                  from time to time and i satisfy them. What we understand as
                  happiness is merely triggering the chemical release from our brains
                  to give us that buzz.</p>
              <p>The problem is the more buzz we get, the lesser the high we
                  obtain each time. That is the source where all the constant

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">That was in the past, when the people who created their wealth was not subservient to the people who created the money to represent the wealth. We didn't choose the fractional reserve system, not as if we had a choice or even knew how it works. Be honest, do you really think that the average person is interested in how the system works when that is the only thing he knows, and takes it as a given? The intent to enslave is there. If not, then why is money being created as debt in a seemingly never-ending cycle, while no one dares to bring up the subject in the mainstream? What we dont know cant hurt them? Why arent governments creating their own national currency as value instead of debt? Why are governments letting rich central banker fucks, whom do not contribute one bit to the real wealth of the world (unlike farmers), create the money to represent that real wealth and then make life hell for that farmer? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They're elites because they can manipulate us to desire what they want. Want to get more power? Stage a crisis, the people will desire more security and give up their liberty. Old story. If you want to condemn that line of thought as "conspiracy theories", then just look in the fashion world. If a particular designer wants people to buy his clothes, then he'll market his goods with Hollywood, at fashion shows, in advertisements in order to condition people to want them, even if it doesnt do them one bit of good. People are more malleable than we think. Thats why we have concepts like impulsive buying, consumerism and materialism. Its the same thing really, social engineering.</span></p>
