            <div class='col-md body'><p>aiya don need to complain about our PAP. When singaporeans can stand out/voice out as a whole then we can start talking. the press plays an important role but i believe education plays an even more important role. Do u remember when u voice out in class our teachers will scold us and it has become a habit of not voicing out anymore. and gradually we accept what the government says whether we like it not.. My lecturer once walked out of the class he is teaching because he said that we are like dead fishes who just listen and listen and listen. even when he said we are stupid we just kept quiet. its only when i visted him in his office and asked him to explain why he made that claim then he told me he did it on purpose because he wanted someone to stand out and object. but no one did!! a very gd example.</p></div>

              <p>how many kids above 12 do not have a mobile phone, some kind of

              there will always be the have-nots, but reality is, many kids
              nowadays (including many living in 2 to 3 room flats) have a maid
              to fend for them.</p>
              <p>the fact that you are banging notes on your computer and not out

              <p><br>I'm actually the same age as you but i don't see why technology has anything to do with it besides making us less tolerant of discomforts. In the end it really depends on your perspective on what is fast paced or not, but i'm sure it's not going to beat my grandfather carrying ricebags everyday under the hot sun and heavy rain.</p>
              <p>The problem is we are going have to face the fact that we're not going to be able to make the kind of jump from poverty to fortune the way our grandparents did. It's a physical fact rather than the incompetence of the PAP government.</p>
              <p>It's just like doing Pull ups in NS, in BMT the amount of pull ups you can do will greatly increase but once you pass out you will start to realise each additional pull up is going to take more training and effort than the previous one.</p>
              <p>Right now we are already close to our limit, where each % of growth is taking vastly more effort than the previous. There is no such thing as unlimited growth.</p>
              <p>Whether something is bad or worse is a matter of perspective. I enjoy taking walks and i feel cars are hardly a neccessity in Singapore so the ERP hardly affects me. I like my job and my colleagues, and i enjoy being able to treat my relatives to the occasional lunch.</p>
              <p>I control my spending and make sure there is a clear line between need and want. I don't have problems getting food or drinks and my water and electricity is uninterrupted. I don't just live within my means, i live below my means.</p>
              <p>When you think something is bad, you make it easier for you to accept information to support the belief that it is bad giving the impression that it is worse. So whether you feel life in Singapore is getting harder or not is whether you want to believe that it is</p>
              <p>That's my take on it.</p>
