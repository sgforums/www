Like LTA can afford. Singapore is a country by which is a fast paced one. If LTA increase the waiting time, LTA is gonna to face a backlash from the public. Not only tat, investors from other countries who like SG coz of its can-do attitude will not want to come to SG coz most of them view that easy accessiblity is a must to set up companies and factories. If the waiting time is increased, the public will have to take other transport modes like bus, taxi, car, etc. If the public do that, they noumber of cars on the roads of SG will increase tremendously despite of the COE and road tax. Thus, backfiring the attempts by the govt. to stablize the no. of cars on the road. This in turn will lead to an increase of petrol consumption. This will lead to a higher price of petrol and a more accelerated rasie of gobal warming. In view of the recent oil price hike, this move is not recommended as it will impact the taxpayers more. Who wants a more polluted and hotter SG?<br>I recomend that 1)the LTA to bulid more seatings on the train platforms so that there will be more space for ppl to seat. 2)In the Sunday Times a few weeks ago, some one wrote iin a comment that Singaopreans are like preparing a race or something when the train is about to arrive the platform. I urge Singaporeans to be not kiasu or kiasi when the train in approaching the platform, as this will lead to the pushing forward motion that may cause ppl to fall on to the tracks. 3) As the weather in SG is hot, LTA can install fans to circulate the air on the raised platforms as the heat may lead to fainting. 4) I urge Singaporeans to be more considerate when others are not feeling well. Ask them whether they need to seat, if so give up the seat on the platform.  The station masters can pitch in when ppl are about to faint by provideing water for them to drink as some faint due to lack of water.</div>

Its determine by the cost of crude oil from Nymex and Brent.<br><br>3) Bulding more platform chairs will increase cost for commuters. not exactly feasible. How many of us use them anyway?

Pending approval from LTA<br><br>Problem<br><br>1) How come these people who faint or get dizzy or trip (or watever reasons that cause them to trip over the platform), only does it when the train enters the station???<br><br>My recommendation is...<br><br>1) Increase MRT waiting time so that these people who are tripping can trip before the MRT arrives. The current arrival rate is too high thats why, theres a high level of accidents.<br><br>2) 1 hour waiting time looks good. 200 people can trip and fall and escape with bruises and not die. People who are really thinking of committing sucide will get so bored waiting for the train and think of alternative methods. AND MRT FARES WILL GO DOWN BECOZ WE NEED ABOUT 3 TRAINS for the entire system only!!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Regards<br><br></div></blockquote>crap loh. what will happen to people during peak hours? one train in one hour is definietly not enough. trains coming every 3 mins during peak hours can't pack everyone in, what makes u think every one hour works?!</div>

A loud blip will make everyone around look at him as some kind of alien creature.<br><br>Face is important to keep. It will work. The blip can come with a dialectic or some other sharp message to add culture to our station. Hahaha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few more tips:<br><br>Re-make all the roads to add speed humps every 10 metres to prevent speeding, and add road spikes with sensors to deter the adventurous.<br><br>Also, introduce Pay as you Use Cars, in which you top up a pre-paid card and use it to activate use of the car, so you can only use what you can afford, just like the scheme for PowerSupply! How ingenious!<br><br>Cars are to be fitted with automated speed reductors to force the vehicles to brake when they approach junctions. This is in line with the Traffic Police's advice for all motorists to slow down at intersections.<br><br>MRT trains will enter stations at 3 km per hour under manual control to allow the driver to stop the train immediately if someone with suicidal tendencies jumps onto the tracks.<br><br>Subliminal programming to be broadcasted over the PA system to deter passengers from jumping onto the tracks.
