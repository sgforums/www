              <p>hey folks , there is an issue i'd like to raise out so that our people will know who to vote for: As everyone knows that , education is the most important thing is singapore , without a high qualification , no one can go far to succeed , since it is important , our government should make education more cheaper &amp; affordable to our citizens , i just don't understand , why is it that more foreigners are being enrolled to our polytechnics , ITEs and universities? Our singapore students , with the minimum GPA to be qualifies ARE NOT EVEN CONSIDRED!!!! Well i think that its time for us to look into this issue and introduce more vacancies to such courses in the unis and polys , make those students who are under appeal cases take an attitude test , or a test related to the course that the school is going to offer to that particular student ( just like how private schools work) so that the institute will know how well in the understanding of this course this student has , if he/she has good understanding , they should just give these students a chance to pursue their studies further.....</p>

              <p>hey folks , there is an issue i'd like to raise out so that our
              people will know who to vote for: As everyone knows that ,
              education is the most important thing is singapore , without a high
              qualification , no one can go far to succeed , since it is
              important , our government should make education more cheaper &amp;
              affordable to our citizens , i just don't understand , why is it
              that more foreigners are being enrolled to our polytechnics , ITEs
              and universities? Our singapore students , with the minimum GPA to
              be qualifies ARE NOT EVEN CONSIDRED!!!! Well i think that its time
              for us to look into this issue and introduce more vacancies to such
              courses in the unis and polys , make those students who are under
              appeal cases take an attitude test , or a test related to the
              course that the school is going to offer to that particular student
              ( just like how private schools work) so that the institute will
              know how well in the understanding of this course this student has
              , if he/she has good understanding , they should just give these
              students a chance to pursue their studies further.....</p>
