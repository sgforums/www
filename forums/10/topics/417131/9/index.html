              <p>I want to refute parn..</p>
              <p>with the direction the pap had set for themselves in recent years, I think it's very difficult to change things from the inside. sometimes it is just impossible(y) hard.</p>
              <p>I think competing with pap head on is a good start. it gives the electorate something to choose which benefits them and singapore as a whole. so far gerald's views were commendable. I am not saying all his opinions are good, but so far he had refute some of pap's failed policies properly and suggested some good ones.</p>
              <p><br>for example regarding education, I do agree our system is just too robotic. M&amp;R. I think that is the mantra for students even up till jc (uni even). memorise and regurgitate. although schools had tried to improve by providing a much more holistic education, they can only do that much when the overarching education system is robotic in nature.</p>
              <p>quite a number of my friends all commented that they seriously have no idea what they are going to do in the future, because they had not found their niche (or interest) even after having examinations for a wide variety of subjects. even ccas had not piqued their interest.</p>
              <p><br>of course. society at large do not get represented by a small group of people but the trend now in singapore is that some of pap's policies are seriously degrading the meaning of being a citizen of singapore (please go read up yourself I lazy to type wall of text).</p>
              <p>I don't wish for opposition to get a resounding mandate this coming elections however I do wish that they do get a substantial amount of votes so they can force pap to work along with them to improve the lives of citizens here.</p>

              <p><br>Anyone can come up with a better solution than Gerald, and anyone can even write a better book than Gerald.</p>
              <p>One important question is, for a guy who talk so much shit on his book to cheat money out of rebels (Not that I disagree, but in fact I support cheating money from rebels), HAVE HE GAINED THE POWER TO MAKE ANY REAL CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE?</p>
              <p>If he haven't, then he's just another bullshit talker like you and me in here. We can talk until the cow come home also our lives will still be the same.</p>
              <p>If he's sooo passionate about serving the people of Singapore, he should join PAP and he will immediately gained that power to do good and fight for the benefits for the people in Singapore from within the PAP.</p>
              <p>Becoming an opposition and putting hopes on his rebellious dreams of toppling the PAP, will only make him unworthy of my votes and many other smart citizens who shared the same sentiments as myself.</p>
              <p>People like him who are childish and want to bear hatred and grudge against PAP, should not even be given a chance to lead or gain power. Because you will never know when his childishness might get the better of him and he is most likely to misuse and abuse the power which he has gained, for the goodness of himself and the worst for the people who have granted him that power.</p>
              <p>Only smart people should lead the country, not smart people like him should never be given the opportunity to lead even a group of boys scouts. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>It is understandable that the Government should not HASTILY lend a helping hand to people in need. If the Government extend a helping hand to the people in need, then everyone will want to become the people in need and seek help from the Government. The mindset of the people will be degraded, and together with the weak-minded Government.</p>
              <p>It's a true fact that Singaporeans are more resilient to change and adapting themselves to other work cultures around the world, and that's really what makes Singaporeans so successful outside Singapore. They just never bothered to look back and thank the Government for creating the competitive environment in Singapore which forces Singaporeans to be self-reliance and able to exist as an independant workforce by themselves in whatever companies they are working with.</p>
              <p>Singaporean workers are very much sought after by companies outside Singapore for this reason alone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is always a very positive side to the very negative side of every situations, and you just need to clear your mind and heart and hatred first before you could even identify and be thankful and grateful to the very positive side in your situations.</p>
              <p>And how many people actually can envisioned themselves in such true manner?</p>
              <p>Really, none of the people in here or in sgforums are able to envision success within themselves, and this is really the sad thing which you need to focus to change first before you continue to drown  yourself in the midst of your own emo-ism.</p>

              <p>Not true.</p>
              <p>PAP ideas for the country helped to steer the nation forward in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
              <p>However, we began to see effects of their weaknesses once it entered the 21st century. GDP got grow but what about society improvement?</p>
              <p>It does not come only through improvement of public toilets, hand rails, rain shelters, lifts and more beautiful parks. Those are just municipal issues.</p>
              <p>But the social issues have to come into mind as well.</p>
              <p>Our education system did not prepare us well for the 21st century globalisation expectations. For example, for the past decade, the government should try to plan for how to cope with a rising number of local graduates, but instead taking in more foreigners to compete directly with us, causing much social issues to the people. </p>
              <p>Competitive environment yes. But can it be like Hong Kong which does not involve much government intervention. PAP mindsets often look down on the weak and poor and segregate them from a young age. As if to look for who can be the potential cleaners for tomorrow in Singapore, as demand is not there. It cannot be PAP must expect that Singaporeans must work faster than ever to compete. This must come from the people themselves, like in Hong Kong, so as to justofy a free market capitalistic economy and a true democratic nation. I feel that we have been so fast paced because PAP want us to do so. That if you can't cope, you will be expected to be fucked for life! This kind of PAP influence sounds very communist to me.</p>
              <p>I'm aiming for a zero increase in prison guards over the next 20 years in the prisons of civil service, because an increased in them to control crime rate is a very sad thing as it also means crime rate is expected to increase.</p>
              <p>I'm aiming for no such thing as people turning to crime because of poverty and if ever, PAP or opposition, is ruling at that time, they will be held responsible if criminal activities have to surge due to rising living costs and rising elitism.</p>

              <p>The truth is that the PAP has done nothing in the last 5 years worth being re-elected for.  Escaped prisioners, reduced wages, increased house prices, over crowded MRT, flooding etc etc etc.  Too many foreigners isn't the only problem.  It just because the government has control over all of the mainstream media that you never hear both sides of the story.</p>

              <p>Public housing!</p>
              <p>Will you want to risk your HDB flat (an asset) loses it's value? After being an Opposition ward.</p>
              <p>You need lots of Balls to vote against the ruling party.</p>

              <p>I agree with your reasoning and I would like to add on.</p>
              <p>It really depends, opposition will make the value drop but who really needs the value to be so high in the first place? Those people are those that want to sell but the resale market is also not cheap, and you have to put half of your flat selling profits back into CPF so I think it is really quite pointless to worry over value of a home.</p>
              <p>Home is a place who citizens stay and die in, not a commodity to fleece others with and also not a goodbye present for those who are planning to escape Sinkapore.</p>
              <p>Moreover, having high value houses with no money to retire and no jobs makes no sense also.</p>
              <p>National Pride is at stake here, please be very clear about this.</p>

              <p><br>Before anything can happen, maybe PAPist will declare the election to be void through some technical fault or try to frame some opposition winner and disqualify him or her.</p>
