              <p>Go and read his book "Singapore Version 2.0 Alternative Proposals For A Better Singapore"</p>
              <p>I agree that there's public safety from crime generally until 2 months ago. But safety as a result of strict laws must always commensurate with safety due to elimination of poverty.</p>
              <p>I do not ever want to hear local people turning to crime to make a living as a result of lack of assistance from the government. I warn that if I ever were to hear of innocent people committing crime as a result of being sidelined, I will do something!</p>
              <p>People need help for financial assistance had better be helped by government unless they themselves too greedy that they gamble or speculate heavily. If people can't cope with societal expectations, do help them!</p>
              <p>But I still think that the PAP system of government will be better replaced so as not to continue such unhappiness with society despite PAP efforts to improve society.</p>
              <p>I mean Lee Hsien Loong's proposals of the education system of not chasing the pinnacle this National Day Rally is long overdue and should have been done 20 year ago!</p>

              <p>There are ways to be better through creativity</p>
              <p>Unfortunately our PAP education system does not foster creativity</p>
              <p>It only teaches you to work hard and study to score for exams</p>
              <p>That's not much creativity</p>
              <p>And hard work does not necessarily mean creativity</p>
              <p>I'm sure Human Resource specialists can tell you that</p>
              <p>And if you say this, when PAP won the first time in 1959, people would be wondering if their lives were better under Singapore than they were under UK</p>
