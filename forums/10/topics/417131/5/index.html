              <div class="entry-content">
              <p>In his speech to the PAP Conference on 27<sup>th</sup> November, PM Lee said that Singaporeans could expect a good Budget because government revenues had been better than expected.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party is not surprised by this.  <strong>The real question is why 
                      Singaporeans have not benefited for so many years from excessive 
                      government surpluses all these years.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The way the Budget is presented makes it difficult to discover what 
                      the true state of government finances are. </strong> The Finance Minister first 
                      reports what is called the primary balance which is the difference 
                      between operating revenue (the amount raised in taxes and user fees) on 
                      the one hand and the sum of operating expenditures and development 
                      expenditures on the other.</p>
              <p>The Minister then adjusts this balance for special transfers (the 
                      main item is GST credits) including top-ups to endowments and trust 
                      funds.  This results in what is called the basic balance before the net 
                      investment returns contribution is added in.</p>
              <p>The net investment returns contribution is up to half of Temasek and 
                      GIC’s income in any year. <strong>Again we are not told the exact percentage and
                       any capital gains (or losses) on their portfolios are not included. </strong>After adding this in Minister Tharman forecast a deficit of about 1.1% 
                      of GDP for 2010.</p>
              <p>The question is whether this is in any sense a meaningful indicator 
                      of the government’s fiscal position. Since the primary balance does not 
                      include interest income, investment income and capital grants yet 
                      includes development expenditure, the Reform Party contends that it 
                      clearly is not.</p>
              <p>The Yearbook of Statistics 2010 shows that the general government 
                      surplus (which is more comprehensive than the government surplus since 
                      it includes extra-budgetary amounts) was $18 billion in 2005 and 2006, 
                      $35 billion in 2007 and $22 billion in 2008. In 2009 the government 
                      deficit (the general government figure was not available) was $4 billion
                       but according to the Monthly Digest of Statistics for November 2010 
                      this has been reversed this year and up to October the surplus was about
                       $16 billion for the first six months. If one could crudely extrapolate 
                      from that then one might expect the total surplus for the year to be 
                      around $32 billion. To arrive at a rough estimate as to what this means 
                      for the ordinary Singaporean, if I divide the surplus by the number of 
                      Singapore citizens (roughly 3.2 million as of June 2010) then that gives
                       a figure of $10,000 which could theoretically be distributed to every 
                      Singaporean man, woman and child without reducing the Government’s net 
                      asset position.  And do not forget that is not just a one-off windfall. 
                      A  similar sum  could have been distributed in every year except 2009.</p>
              <p>In fact the government’s statement of assets and liabilities as at 31<sup>st</sup> March 2009 shows a net asset position of over $300 billion (if it is 
                      assumed that the entire Government Securities Fund is a liability to 
                      bond-holders).  And that would appear to be before two important 
                      elements:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The equity in our Sovereign Wealth Funds (Temasek and GIC)</li>
              <li>The value of the land to which the government holds the freehold which comprises about 80% of Singapore’s area.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Singaporeans have learnt to expect that in an election year there 
                      will be some exceptional transfer payments and tax credits (which will 
                      be subsequently more than clawed back through increases  But what my 
                      analysis highlights is just how generous the Government can afford to 
                      be. Or to put it another way how much higher both consumption and 
                      investment could have been if the government had aimed to balance its 
                      budget rather than run surpluses close to  10% (and sometimes 
                      considerably more than 10%)  of GDP in most years . Furthermore this 
                      surplus does not take account of:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The income earned by our investments in Temasek and GIC let alone any capital gain on these investments; and</li>
              <li>Any change in the value of the government’s holdings of land. Land 
                      prices have risen strongly in recent years yet that is not reflected in 
                      the government’s net asset position.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>The Reform Party would like to know why there is such a lack of 
                      transparency in the budgetary process and it is so difficult to get 
                      information as to the government’s true fiscal position.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore we want to know why the PAP always talks about the danger
                       of bankrupting Singapore and no money being available to fund 
                      investment in our people when in fact the government’s net asset 
                      position is so inefficiently large. The Reform Party is a liberal free 
                      market party and not a socialist party. We believe that these assets can
                       be put to much more productive use if they are in the hand of the 
                      private sector. In addition we believe better returns can be earned by 
                      investing more in our people than can be earned in low-yielding foreign 
                      government securities. Therefore we want to see:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Cuts in taxes and fees across the board especially on the lower-income segments</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Universal health insurance from a reform of the current Medisave, Medishield and Medifund system</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Universal free and inclusive education up to secondary level</strong></li>
              <li><strong>More investment in reforming the education system and making it relevant to the broad mass of our population in a 21<sup>st</sup> century knowledge-based economy</strong></li>
              <li><strong>More generous income support for working low-income families with children</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Control of CPF returned to the individual and right to withdraw employee contributions at 55 restored</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Basic old age pension to be funded through CPF but to be paid to 
                      everyone who has worked for minimum number of years even if they do not 
                      have minimum sum in CPF account.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Privatization of Temasek and GIC and distribution of shares to Singapore citizens</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>We will have no difficulty in answering the question we are frequently asked, “How do you intend to pay for this?”</p>
              <p>So the Reform Party calls upon Singaporeans not to be deceived by the
                       usual hand-outs that will come with next year’s Pre-Election Budget. 
                       Not even if these amount to several thousand dollars, as is entirely 
                      possible. You are being short-changed.</p>
              <p>PM Lee said at his speech that “<strong>Provided Singaporeans support
                       the Government and its plans, we can do it. We will make this one of 
                      the best countries in the world to live, work, bring up families and 
                      retire in.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Don’t be fooled. Despite so many years of record surpluses, the PAP 
                      has failed to raise the living standards of the median Singaporean 
                      significantly since 1997. We can do better for you. Support the Reform 
                      Party and take your country back!</strong></p>
