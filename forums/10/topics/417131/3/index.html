              <p>A lot of young people are now underemployed or being paid so low they have trouble paying bills, all this is a tinkling social time bomb, when their family members fall sick, their savings will be depleted, some might fall into debt also. Hospitals never treat anyone for free, they will sent a sort of more civilised ah longs to chase after you for unpaid medical bills also. The next generation will not have the money to Pay and Pay as their CPF is also locked up til the day they die.</p>
              <p>Already, young people are already drawn to gangs as the gangs exploited their feelings of alienation and anger at a country which ignored their dreams and instead sidelined them for thousands of foreigners for which the ruling Pay and Pay hope will become their obedient but brainy supporters instead of disgrunted locals.</p>
              <p>A party which exploited fellow countrymen for their own party survival, there's no moral ground at all to vote for a party like that, at least in my opinion.</p>
              <p>A party which always repressed opposition parties with lots of draconian rulings and laws, to preach their own brand of twisted policies to further obscure people from the truth, why it is so that oppositions never really have a presence in the parliment? For what reasons did they curtain peoples' right to free speech since they could easily catch even people who posted offensive remarks on the net? All this added by a biased press media have solidified their claims of being competent and being of right only to rule as they fit to.</p>
              <p>Do other countries not also a have a safe environment with opposition parties aplenty sitting in the parliment with earnest attitude in their demeanour to serve their country well? Did those countries collapse like a pack of cards when a ruling party lost the election? Does our country have a real robust democratic system that works or it is just a "North Korea" system masquerading as a legitimate system?</p>

              <p>Actually PAP will not be toppled by few rebellious traitors who are only concerned for their own well-being and instigate to destroy the peace and prosperity of other Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Only useless losers who are also society failures, will complain about the government, parents, workplace, because they are unable to handle these situations in their lives and take control of their lives. They just sit there like Buddha and wait for people to come and give them everything they expected to get.</p>
