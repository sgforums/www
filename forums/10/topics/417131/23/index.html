Don't destroy the future of Sinagpore just being ignorant or opposing for the sake of opposing.

              <p>Dear angel17030, can you tell us where you staff from ? foreigner or Singaporean? If you are an employer, are you willing to pay someone higher than 2.5K/mth if he or she is a Singaporean? You sounded that you are even smarter than our PM. May be you want to share with us (Sinagporean) what have you contributed to Singapore and Singaporean? Or what have you been benefited by the current Government?</p>

              <p><br>Dear Angel,</p>
              <p>Am I obligated to tell you? how much are you willing to pay me for infos.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Mods here dun like survey, so I am not giving any comments.</p>
              <p>Finally, I am sure smarter than the PM, in fact the PM is the most stupid person around, look at his pathetic life, even go toilet also must be undercontrol. His whole day life is already pre planned by his secretaries, when to go home, when to wake up, when to eat etc etc..stupid, aint it. I am smarter, because my life is more colorful, do what I like and still can get him to serve me.</p>

              <p>Dear Demon Bane, do you have children? What exactly you are not
              happy with Singapore? Once a friend told me that he is so happy to
              be here as his daughter could come home alone at 10pm on public
              transport. Don't destroy the future of Sinagpore just being
              ignorant or opposing for the sake of opposing. May be you want to
              share with us (especially the homemakers that with children) what
              kind of Sinagpore you think is the best for our next
              generation?</p>

              <p><br>Yes that is the root of the problems/financailly and physically a married couple with kids are facing. Couple with cost of living burden...making life difficut but still can survive without or little saving to spare. Little saving to spare only.</p>
