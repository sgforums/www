              <p>If you losers have the real brain to think, you would've gone out and just take on any job you can find, to get some money going into your bank account and to upkeep or increase your financial strength bit by bit.</p>
              <p>Say if you can earn $1500 per month and you can saved $1000 per month if you had gone out to work in some shit job, then I will tell you that for every month that you were jobless, you are actually losing $1000 in potential savings every month!</p>
              <p>Smarter graduates will increase their savings by $1000 every month and they would've increased their financial strength by $6000 just by working in shit job for 6 months. LOSERS like yourself who preferred to wait for better jobs to come along, WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE $1000/MTH and $6000 AT THE END OF 6 MONTHS!!</p>

              <p>I would love to really see some real statistics of how much  low paying jobs, how much jobless people, how much people now being under-employed etc, right now the PAPist are trying gloss over everything. Very bad, they are totally dishonest if the country is really doing well, why did they rob people out of their CPF? If the country is really doing well, do we really need to import so much people?</p>
              <p>I might be a low pay earning loser but I don't think I'm stupid to let those PAPist pigs lord over us.</p>

And you labout minister, please remember who you are, if you dun rise cost of living, who is going to pay your million dollars salary!! Mark it up</p>
