            <div class='col-md body'><p>how many rich are there? how many poors are there? if pappy wants to win votes from the poor they have to start segregating them by income, property type own, and otther luxuries they may have. though one good way is thru IAS but see peopl can also cheat and evade tax, worse misude company funds. so IRAS comes in very important. tax should be lifted on all those classified under the poor category. for them life and expenses is tough enough already. as for those rich ones gahmen can tax them they cannot do anything anyway. balancing this i think they will know that there are many more poorer people out there then you know. if not why you see so many grumble. don;t do things for should lah. step up security, curb corruption this are things standard a gahmen of any country should do. and also opposition only comes out during election of course lah, you thing they have funds to come out everyday meh, everywhere meh. the only way they can stand a chance to fight with their limited funds are when election nearing and they can see how the areas are deployed for the battlke election. from what i see i will just draw a tortise on my vote, otherwise just make my area a walkover to save my time.</p></div>

              <p>Told you long ago liao, i am neutral, if i see something not right, i will go against it, but no all govt policies are bad, some are real good, like upgrading of skill, education and knowledge are good. Even if one day, oppositions managed to take over PAP, i hope that they can still carry on some of good PAP policies, throw the bad ones away...but dun end up selling sentosa away hor</p>

              <p>What's the point of having a few seats owned by opposition? In general, will there be any difference to making and amending policies? Unless the opposition won 20% of the seats, I dun see any real influence they can do to the entire system. Is there anyway the opposition can grab that many seats? Not in the near future.....PAP is still the most successful political party in the entire world !</p>
              <p>P.S. I'm neutral in politics.</p>
