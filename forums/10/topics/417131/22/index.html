              </span></p><p>The incumbents ''messed'' up big time by pandering to MNCs' interests and later found out that the escalating costs would have them (MNCs) leave for cheaper' labour n operating costs in neighbouring countries. So they decided to quick-fix my importing cheap labour and unfortunately the fallout is that of Singaporeans'' wages being ''compromised'' to accomodate these MNCs, employers.</p>
              <p>Whose mistake is this? This is definitely not citizens fault. It is ineptitude and mismanagment on the part of the govt. Instead of admitting to this ommission to act, to rectify, shifting blame has been the way of the incumbents. Instead of looking for long-term solutions that would be equitable to citizens and beneficial to the nation, they have resorted to this quick-fix or rather ''bandaid' measures. The real beneficiaries are employers n the govt lah.</p>
              <p>Why should Singaporeans allow or be quiet when these MIWS, top civil servants are paid astronomical salaries and still put up with such a mess?</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>Excepting a few with specialized skills most of these foreigners are here for economic reasons and are paid low wages and endure woefully, undignifying working conditions.</p>
              <p>It ("foregin talent" policy) epitomizes the incumbents stance and that is of avarice and venality!</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>It is shameful and disdainful that the incumbents brag about being a first world nation but the reality is the surreptitious stance of straw-clutching policies (lax immigration and requirements for PR/citizenship).It was and is all for political expediency and lest one forgets – GDP $$$!</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>Off late, no one from the incumbents uses the word ‘talent". Is this not telling of what these self-serving type(s) are?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are paying a very high price (economics,social etc etc) for bleating away like sheep and on the altar of the real ( as opposed to hypnotic apathy and blind allegiance which sadly is so ingrained in the Singaporean psyche) it will all sooner or later collapse like a house made of cards.</p>
              <p>Most the Mps n … are not citizen-centred but simply yes-man/woman who simply parrot/regurgitate … Yes, I may be construed as a cynic. However it does not detract from what is true. Two jarring egs would suffice – why not even one from the ruling party favoured the minimum wage n not one of them ever spoke or queried about the actual costs of a HDB unit?</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>Mah Bow Tan self-praised himself for this bullshit of an ''asset enhancement package"(upgrading , but in reality window-dressing for the owners (HDB are the REAL OWNERS) and it is going to cost ''tenants'' increases in conservancy and property taxes for these so-called ásset enhancement. In other words, HDB dwellers are actually financing the upgrading programmes not of their choice but a choice that was made by HDB.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are BEING stupid to continuously hold on to this erroneous belief that they ''own'' their flats. They are simply paying rent for a 99-year lease. The title deed to each unit belongs to HDB. Singaporeans are sleep-walking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is stupidity to assume or equate academic acheivements with that of intelligence or talent. One does not have to be a scientist to analyze/ derive at an answer/conclusion. LHL in his new year message remarked sth to this effect that ''Singaporeans come first" Is that so? Is that how the policies and so on manifesting themselves? Credentials is not credibility.</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>The incumbents know and the fear that politically the "good" times for themselves (inclusive of harvests in terms of $$$) would all grind to a halt with the inexorable political awakening (slow though it is) and now they are desperate to cling onto power at any cost(s) and still benefit in the short-run while they are in power. It will work for them as long as the one-party system is in place.</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>Lest it be forgotten – they got away and the likelihood of them getting away is still possible as long as the system is such that it perpetuates/favours a one-party rule. The political landscape needs transformation and not simply window-dressed changes (NcMP n GRCs is the most stupid and useless and it is mere political device that favours the incumbents. It is a travesty of democracy).</p>
              <p>What is urgently needed is for a multi-party or two-party system and it is not a question of whehter one candidate can perform or whether is perceived as capable. Perception is real only in one’s head. The icing on the cake is not the cake. The real cake is the tasting (aka delivery).</p>
              <p>Can one assume/consider that the incumbents delivery has been equitable, transparent, accountable, responsible. Intuitively, it does not feel so. Also, the one-party rule is inherently flawed in so many ways. We do not have an Ombudsmen, independent bodies/institutions,/independent media n ….add on. LHL is lying thru his teeth and believe me, after the elections Singaporeans are going to be islands in a sea of strangers.</p>
              <p>These self-serving incumbents are pawning Singaporeans future away fro short term gains with policies/??? that simply is unsustainbale for long and even if they are, it is to the detriment of each native Singaporean. It simply does not augur well for the future.</p>
              <p>Hope Singaporeans can see what is as it is and not be lulled into seeing, interpreting .. with clouded lens of the past or allow bigotry/prejudices to distort understanding. It is not the candidate that matters, it is the delivery and the (one-party) system is so utterly flawed that these anomalies will never end till there is a system (two-party or ...) that forces delivery, forces transparency and so on so forth.</p>

              <p>Scenario1:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i once saw people on a sinking ship fulla holes in the middles of a huge ocean...fulla holes.no one wanted to repair it even though it was sinking....then some people founded some material to repair the holes on sinking ship.then some found a dinghyand floated it in the middle of the huge ocean.</p>
              <p>so some started patching up the ship with material and found it was difficult because they didnt have the right engneer or people with knowledge to fix it.then some decided to climb into the dinghy b4 the ship sinks.</p>
              <p>so the situation ended where one group of people climbed into a small dinghy in the middle of the ocean.the other stayed back on sinking ship scratching heads trying to know how to fix the holes on sinking ship with water gushing out of the many holes.</p>
              <p>results:people in dinghy were found 1 month later dried up like ikan bilis.</p>
              <p>sinking ship sank a bit at a time until there was no way get materials to fix the holes underwater.everyone died on it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>scenario 2:sinking ship had people and no one cared much n pretended ship would fix itself somehow...everyone died  as ship slowly sank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>captain of ship was dry n comfy all the while until he was on the roof top of his sinking ship a few metres from circling sharks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>solution:</p>
              <p>1)either u get experts to fix the holes on sinkin ship.</p>
              <p>2) build another brand new ship b4 old ship eventually sinks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>At the rate things are going, it's just a matter of time before redrawing boundaries will be totally useless when they find that the majority of people are switching sides en masse.</p>

              <p>I dunno la. A lot of singaporeans complain, complain and complain. In the end PAP still in power. Its time to bring back power to the people, we are mature enough to chart our future. We don't owe anything to LKY and his PAP generation. It is PAP's job to serve us the citizens and ensure we prosper. We are sick of being told what to do by PAP and how to behave. It is time to make PAP serve us - the citizens. So vote for opposition and make sure PAP's 2/3 majority is diluted.</p>
              <p>Vote for PAP and you will have no voice at all, you will be a slave to the singaporean economic machinery where you will work 12 hours a day until you day of impending stroke. Vote for PAP and soon you shall see your jobs and your children's jobs being robed by PRC and India immigrants. Vote for PAP and sooner you shall see your children can't afford to buy housing and have to live in yer cramped up HDB apartment with their wife, child and pet dog. Vote for PAP and you shall see yer yearly increment in salary not sufficient to pay for the rising oil price and rising GST diverted to pay the high rolling salaries of PAP ministers.</p>
