              i have no partisan  view today. No worry, just speak from my heart.
              this is my 2 cents thoughts on policy making. How to pick the best options ,
               ie the best policy for middle term to long term benefits of SG. 
              
              i hope this can help u to decide which party is the best to run SG in the future.
              i hope u can judge each Party in OVERALL. Just look at bright side(some policy u like) of Party A or just look at dark side(some policy u dunt like)of Party B is not responsible to your next generations.
              
              i will assess each option  by three aspects,ie 
              A.COST, 
              B. BENEFITS,
              C.RISKS.
              
              IN EACH ASPECT, I FURTHER CONSIDER THE FOLLOWINGS--
              1.FINANCIAL TERMS--DOLLARS AND CENTS
              2. ECONOMIC IMPACT
              3. POLITICAL IMPACT
              4. SOCIAL IMPACT
              
              
              DUNT ADOPT GOOD POLICY. ADOPT BEST POLICY.
              1. Good policy usually mean painless to people. human being cant produce no pain policy. we have to assess the OVERALL  pros and cons of each option.
              %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
              now i talk about different aspects in COST  in each option.
              1.FINANCIAL TERMS--DOLLARS AND CENTS
              2. ECONOMIC IMPACT
              3. POLITICAL IMPACT
              4. SOCIAL IMPACT of BENEFITS of each option.
              
              A.COST 
              A1.FINANCIAL TERMS--DOLLARS AND CENTS
              Is the policy sustainable in long term?Will the capital expenses and future annual expenses is affordable? do we need increase tax to implement it? or do we need reduce other expenses to implement this policy.
              The rule of thumb is THIS GENERATION EARNS. THIS GENERATION SPENDS.
              LEAVE NO DEBT TO FUTURE GEN, NOR DIP INTO RESERVE left by forefathers.
              
              US leave billions of debts to next gens is very mean.
              
              A.COST 
              A2.ECONOMIC IMPACT
              How each option will affect current and future econ performance?
              eg if manufacturing is reducing, can the workers eligible and like to work in other fields. further, how is reducing manufacturing affect the up streams and down stream industries, eg transports, catering, finances, insurance, R and D etc.
              
              A.COST
              A3. POLITICAL IMPACT
              what would be people reactions to each options?
              eg many People angry with casino.(but dunt forget many IR workers are local)
              
              A.COST
              A4.SOCIAL IMPACT
              how is social impact of each option. IR will create more gamblers. This is sure.
              but SG on the other hand, can get frequent gamblers who go to Genting and casino ships switching  to play in SG casino. this reduce out flowing of SG money.
              For any options, what is social cost, and also benefits,if any.
              Can SG absorb the social cost/ At what costs?
              Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£
              now i talk about different aspects in BENEFITS in each option.
              1.FINANCIAL TERMS--DOLLARS AND CENTS
              2. ECONOMIC IMPACT
              3. POLITICAL IMPACT
              4. SOCIAL IMPACT of BENEFITS of each option.
              
              B.BENEFITS
              B1.FINANCIAL TERMS--DOLLARS AND CENTS
              how each option can generate revenues for government and how people can be benefits from each option. a low tech factory sure can pay low salary to workers. but a high tech factory or services which need skilled and professional workers sure can pay more.
              
              B.BENEFITS
              B2. ECONOMIC IMPACT
              how is the spinning effects of each options? IR can bring in more tourists (and some criminals, to be honest ).how are up and down stream industries can be benefited?eg hotels, Foods and restaurants,tour guides  etc
              is Disney land or Universal Studio  better?
              How to compare with other options,if any.
              
              B.BENEFITS
              B3. POLITICAL IMPACT
              how is each option let government get more trusts and confidences from people?
              Some dunt like casino, but some like becos he want to work as dealers etc.
              many need earn a living!
              
              B.BENEFITS,
              B4. SOCIAL IMPACT
              how is each option improve the people in physical standard of living, as well as more civilized.
              $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
              now i talk about different aspects in RISKS in each option.
              1.FINANCIAL TERMS--DOLLARS AND CENTS
              2. ECONOMIC IMPACT
              3. POLITICAL IMPACT

              C.RISKS.
              C1.FINANCIAL TERMS--DOLLARS AND CENTS
              How is the worst case of each option. Can we afford to pay or do we need  increase tax or reduce other expenses?
              How is the possibility of running out of budgets,like YOG.
              if we DOUBLE TEACHERS, will there be enough students?
              
              C.RISKS.
              C2. ECONOMIC IMPACT
              how will any option affect the targeted mainstream industries , as well as up and down stream industries?If we ask foreign construction workers go, will we have enough local workers to build HDB and how much is salary of local workers?
              further, if we sell HDB at cost or cost plus, more local workers sure will push up new HDB price.
              
              C.RISKS.
              C3. POLITICAL IMPACT
              how is each option will affecting people's trusts on government ?
              
              C.RISKS.
              C4. SOCIAL IMPACT
              how is each option will has adversary social impact ? Can SG rectify the damages?
              $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
              SUMMARY
              no option is perfect. we have to strike the balance of all factors I mention above.
              Like casino may create more gamblers. but will few thousand local workers working in IR now can get other jobs?

              x for your effort to do research and discuss.
              
              yes u are right, but there is a catch which SG HDB dunt have.
              HDB owners after MOP ,minimum occupation period ,can sell to eligible buyers WITHOUT PAYING tx for your effort to do research and discuss.
              
              yes u are right, but there is a catch which SG HDB dunt have.
              HDB owners after MOP ,minimum occupation period ,can sell to eligible buyers WITHOUT PAYING ANY SINGLE CENT to HDB.
              BUT HK HOS owners have to pay huge amount.
              
              HK HOME OWNERSHIP SCHEME--HOS--owners NEED TO PAY PREMIUM WHEN OWNERS ELIGIBLE TO SELL IN OPEN MARKET. 
              HOS=å±…å±‹è¨ˆåŠƒï¼Œ
              pay land premiumè£œ åœ°åƒ¹ã€‚
              
              1.what is paying  land premiumè£œ åœ°åƒ¹?
              u have to pay back the discount u enjoy!the worse is the amount depending on current price prices. 
              Eg, in 1998 as u tell us. the full market value is HK 1 millions, 30% discount.
               the buyers so called enjoy 300,000 discount in  1998.
              
              2. But after the MOP---like HDB minimum occupation period,owner can sell in TWO MARKETS. in HK call GREEN FORM AND WHITE FORM.å±…å±‹ç¶ è¡¨,å±…å±‹ç™½è¡¨
              one market is very restrictive, the buyers have income ceiling etc.å±…å±‹ç¬¬äºŒå¸‚åœº
              owner need not pay any money to government.
              BUT the price in this market is much lower than full open market, !
              
              3.
              another market is owner can sell to anyone, include foreigners,
              But the CATCH IS HE HAVE TO PAY THE DISCOUNT HE HAD ENJOYED.
              the worse is the land premiumè£œ åœ°åƒ¹ is based on current market price, not the value 
              in 1998!! So, he had to pay current market price 2 millions x 0.3 =HK 600,000 to government before he can sell in nonrestrictive market!
              After paying HK 600,000 in CASH, not MPF(=SG CPF), he can sell to anyone at 2,000,000.
              BUT as u know, 2 mil less 600,000=1.4 mil! then less any loans .
              So, 1998 he enjoy discount HK D 300,000 , 2011 , he pay HK  600,000!
              is it a good deal?

              <p>Oh my gosh!! it the Lion again...Roar Roar Roar!!! 5 years one time.</p>
              <p>I went to my voting station early in the morning after my joggin, as a Taiwanese becoming a citizen here, I wanted to vote for PAP, cos they made this possible for me, very easily, I get my citizenship. Not many countries in this world allow a diploma holder to get citizenship so easily. But then, I have to take into the account that my Dad is a singaporean, my grandma is also a singaporean, only my late mother is a taiwanese.</p>
              <p>As I was about to cast the vote, I look out and saw a group of PRC gals and guys walk by, laughing and giggling, they were here to cast their vote, must hv got their citizenship. To this communist chinese, voting is sound like a very funny game, a playground for them. They will shouting and laughing till i told them to shut up, even the officers there also keep quiet. Then they stared at me like not happy, but i just walk away, go to my BM and drove off. I then realised that I voted the wrong one, cos at that moment, these PRC makes me think of why not having some stranger in the parliament, just like what is happening here, even citizens of singapore also got taiwanese like me,  PRC and india indians, why not in the parliament, further more opposition are singaporeans. I hope I voted the right party.</p>

              <p><br>Hi and dear Lion,</p>
              <p>I think u must sleeping in the den for too long, PRC is still very much communist minded, it just that their economy had open up to embrace demorcracy, but the ruling is still base on communist doctrine, in their country, there is no election, for them, voting is something very new and funny for their youngster.</p>
              <p>In taiwan, tho our politician are corrupted and cunning, but we never raise housing prices, get in foreigners, increase essential food items, they are corrupted in terms of foreign corporate corruption, state corporation corruption and business corruption. But never does taiwan put pressure on it citizens, more of their own personnal problem, and when they are caught, they apologise and go to jail, Singapore govt is different, it is not they are clean, they use a different way of taking by looking it as legal, thru CPF, thru HDB, thru taxation such as GST ERP and so on, however in the end, they also apologised, but they dun go jail leh. Why?</p>
