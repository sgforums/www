              <p><br>Yeah this is 20th century thinking about the education system</p>
              <p>No wonder many Singaporeans can't cope with the globalization of the 21st century</p>
              <p>Expectations rose at a very steep pace more than ever</p>
              <p>Majority of us did not really prepare well for the global age</p>
              <p>Why? Because of our education system imposed on us</p>
              <p>That's why the spurs are not stuck to our hides and our dictator had to say that's our problem</p>
              <p>That's our fucking problem!</p>
              <p>After Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye left PAP, the social system declined gradually for about 25 years now!</p>

He said:<br><br></div>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">But I cannot blame the present generations, because<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.</span></span></strong><br><br>So the result is that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating. </span></span></strong></p>

Are we a soulless society? Maybe we are, but it is heartening to see great men like Dr Toh Chin Chye made passionate dreams for Singapore. Both in the development and building of modern Singapore, Dr Toh was instrumental in making the Singapore we know today. Dr Toh is truly one of the founders of Singapore.</div>

              <p>I agree that there's public safety from crime generally until 2 months ago. But safety as a result of strict laws must always commensurate with safety due to elimination of poverty.</p>
              <p>I do not ever want to hear local people turning to crime to make a living as a result of lack of assistance from the government. I warn that if I ever were to hear of innocent people committing crime as a result of being sidelined, I will do something!</p>
              <p>People need help for financial assistance had better be helped by government unless they themselves too greedy that they gamble or speculate heavily. If people can't cope with societal expectations, do help them!</p>
              <p>But I still think that the PAP system of government will be better replaced so as not to continue such unhappiness with society despite PAP efforts to improve society.</p>
              <p>I mean Lee Hsien Loong's proposals of the education system of not chasing the pinnacle this National Day Rally is long overdue and should have been done 20 year ago!</p>

              <p>What have these rebels done for the people? They are capable to do many things on for the people, but they aren't doing it because they think it's silly of them to do so or their selfish arrogant pride gets in their way of doing something for the people.</p>

              tried to improve by providing a much more holistic education, they
              can only do that much when the overarching education system is
              robotic in nature.</p>
              <p>quite a number of my friends all commented that they seriously
              have no idea what they are going to do in the future, because they
              had not found their niche (or interest) even after having
              examinations for a wide variety of subjects. even ccas had not
              piqued their interest.</p>
              <p><br> of course. society at large do not get represented by a small group
              of people but the trend now in singapore is that some of pap's
              policies are seriously degrading the meaning of being a citizen of
              singapore (please go read up yourself I lazy to type wall of
              text).</p>
              <p>I don't wish for opposition to get a resounding mandate this
              coming elections however I do wish that they do get a substantial
              amount of votes so they can force pap to work along with them to
              improve the lives of citizens here.</p>

              <p><br> Everybody can write storybooks nowadays, but not many people can
              earn that right to make their story into a reality.</p>
              <p>If Gerald Giam is so good like what you have claimed, why he
              cannot join PAP and then earn that right to make his story into a
              reality?</p>
              <p>Obviously he does not have the people's interests in his heart,
              he placed his pride above the interests of the people and PAP have
              no use for such prideful individual who do not know how to place
              the people's interests above his priorities.</p>
              <p>So Gerald Giam is not smart enough to realise his dream for the
              sake of the people, he is only concerned about realising his dream
              in his own prideful way.</p>
              <p>Do you really think you want to place your support at the hands
              of such prideful and selfish individuals?</p>
              <p>I would not, I would rather place my vote at the hands of people
              who have already earned their rights to do good for the people and
              who can do good for the people.</p>
              <p>That's why opposition people are not very smart people and they
              are selfish and not really as people orientated as they project
              themselves to be.</p>
              <p>Don't be fooled by sideshows please, focus on the politicians
              who are in power to make real changes for you and vote for the
              politicians who have already earned their rights to make real
              changes for you.</p>
              <p>That is the wisest choice that people should take for the sake
              of their future generations.</p>
              <p>And it definitely makes more sense than to waste your votes on a
              bunch of prideful, selfish, arrogant individuals who happened to be
              very good storytellers in reality.</p>
              <p>What have these rebels done for the people? They are capable to
              do many things on for the people, but they aren't doing it because
              they think it's silly of them to do so or their selfish arrogant
              pride gets in their way of doing something for the people.</p>
              <p>You reap what you sow, if you can't be bothered to sow good
              deeds for the people, then you can never reap any support from the
              people.</p>

              <p><br>Easiest way for him to climb through the hierarchy and gain real power to be able to implement real changes to benefit the people.</p>
              <p>The best way to make changes to a successful ruling party is to join them and make real changes in them from the inside out.</p>
              <p>Is that not the reason why he desire to be a politician in the first place?</p>
              <p>Ohh....does he has other more important reasons that are beneficial to himself more than the people he is going to represent?</p>
