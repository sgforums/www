              <p>If i have to vote for the opposition , i will do so...not becos i believe in the opposition, it's just to prevent things from spiralling out of control. Government brought in Foreign Talents, but do u think these are foreign talents? I think they are Foreign Trash.</p>
              <p>I'm not against foreigners, but i'm against foreigners who think Singapore government owe them a job. They start to demand this and that. Some foreigners even say, PR's  are being given out so easily. Some foreigners have this mindset that the government owe them jobs.</p>

              <p>Singapore belongs to SINGAPOREAN not foreigners!!!!. They can come to work, eat and sleep but they will never call this home. They only come to enjoy what been built over the years by SINGAPOREAN and they will run at the first sign of chaos.</p>
              <p>I am not against foreigners but I am against those STUPID Singaporean who are so simple minded to give jobs at the expense of foreigners.</p>
              <p>By calling these ppl 'FT' do not change the status of them who many comes here to seek riches from their poor countries.</p>

              <p>The word ”talent” is a misnomer, an anomaly, a deception n it was couched by the incumbents to hoodwink the population and most importantly those foreigners who come here.</p>
              <p>Labelling them as talent is a pyschological ”placebo” that the incumbents (knew) and know that it will work. Hence, the labelling! It is being exploited (cos of ignorance and weaknesses within one) and one must be intelligent to see thru the bluff.</p>
              <p>Excepting a few with specialized skills most of them are here for low wages and woefully undignifying working conditions. This deceptive policy (”foregin talent” policy) epitomizes the incumbents stance of avarice and venality!</p>
              <p>It is shameful and disdainful that the incumbents brag about being a first world nation but the reality is the surreptitious stance of straw-clutching policies (lax immigration and requirements for PR/citizenship).It was and is all for political expediency and lest one forgets – GDP $$$!</p>
              <p>Instead of admitting to the mess up of over reliance on MNCs and mismanagment they continually shift blame on Singaporeans. Obsession with GDP growth and greed is the undoing.</p>
              <p>Off late, no one from the incumbents uses the word ‘talent”. Is this not telling of what these self-serving type(s) are?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are paying a very high price (economics,social etc etc) for bleating away like sheep and on the altar of the real ( as opposed to hypnotic apathy and blind allegiance which sadly is so ingrained in the Singaporean psyche) it will all sooner or later collapse like a house made of cards.</p>
              <p>the  82 Mps n … are not ''talents'' but simply yes-man/woman who simply parrot/regurgitate … Yes, I may be construed as a cynic. However it does not detract from what is true. Two jarring egs would suffice – why is that not even one from the ruling party favoured the minimum wage n not one of them ever spoke or queried about the actual costs of a HDB unit?</p>
              <p>It is stupidity to assume or equate academic acheivements with that of intelligence or talent. One does not have to be a scientist to analyze/ derive at an answer/conclusion.</p>
              <p>The incumbents know and the fear that the ”good” times for themselves (inclusive of harvests in terms of $$$ via GDP- pegged wages) would all grind to a halt and the inevitable end is palpably nearing with the inexorable political awakening (slow though it is) and now they are desperate to cling onto power at any cost(s) and still benefit in the short-run.</p>
              <p>Lest it be forgotten – they got away and the likelihood of them getting away is still possible as long as the one-party rule n its insidious stultifying effects remains as such. The political landscape needs transformation and not simply window-dressed changes (NMPS is the most stupid and useless and it is mere political device that favours the incumbents.)</p>
              <p>What is urgently needed is for a multi-party or two-party system and it is not a question of wheter one candidate can perform or whether he/she is perceived as capable. Perception is real only in one’s head. The icing on the cake is not the cake. The real cake is the tasting (aka delivery).</p>
              <p>Can one assume/consider that the incumbents delivery has been equitable, transparent, accountable, responsible. Intuitively, it does not feel so. Also, the one-party rule is inherently flawed in so many ways. We do not have an Ombudsmen, independent bodies/institutions,/independent media n ….add on.</p>
              <p>These self-serving incumbents are pawning Singaporeans future away fro short term gains with policies/??? that simply cannot be sustained for long and even if they are, it is to the detriment of each native Singaporean. It simply does not augur well for the future.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, as long as they remain unthinking, undiscerning and susceptible to the propanganda via shitty times, mediacorpse n channel noise asia would do well to remember that these lame media seems to be conniving, colluding and worse of all excerbating matters with thier one-sided views/analysis and ….</p>
              <p>Hope Singaporeans can see what is (the reality of such regressive policing) as it is and not be lulled into seeing, interpreting .. with clouded lens of the past or allow bigotry/prejudices (inherent in most of us) to distort understanding!</p>
