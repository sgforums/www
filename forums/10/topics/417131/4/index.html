              <p><br>Then can you tell me what is causing these people to have such fears of retrenchment?</p>
              <p>Lack of confidence in their own work? Or did they realised that they will face difficulties in looking for another job because they weren't skilled enough at their job?</p>
              <p>Not everyone will have job insecurities even if they shared the common job position and job scope within a company.</p>
              <p>And why is that so? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>Only abnormal people would be confident at their job when they know nuts, but are you sure you want to degrade the discussion by going there? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>You cannot be the sole breadwinner of the family if you are earning only $1500, probably won't be able to keep anyone alive until they are 40s.</p>
              <p>Low income families usually would have both husband and wife working to substain the family expenses, and nobody would earn only enough to substain the family expenses as savings has and will always be an important factor in a family.</p>
              <p>There's no need to find out the figures for retrenchment and work inefficiency, why would you need that figure for anyway? You mean you need to prove to me that more people would be affected by retrenchment and thus it is a common fear?</p>
              <p>Like I have mentioned before, retrenchment is across the company and the fear is not as bad being fired for work inefficiency. People understands that retrenchment is beyond their control and is not related to their work efficiency. But people's job seeking confidence will be greatly affected if they were to be fired for work inefficiency.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you have already forgotten the real reason why you were discussing about retrenchment and job inefficiency because you were too focused on these two topics.</p>
              <p>If you are talking about retrenchment, then let's imagine this fear of retrenchment will exists in the hearts of every worker in the company. But for some workers with job inefficiency issues, they will have this job inefficiency fear on top of the common fear of retrenchment.</p>
