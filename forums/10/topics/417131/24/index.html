              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <p>Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de Souza, Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann:<br> <strong>HOME MINISTER K. SHANMUGAM</strong><br> <br> Before he became Home Minister, PAP member of parliament K. Shanmugam 
              had an affair (with a woman) that led to messy divorce proceedings. His 
              angry wife, who was out for blood, was called in by Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong who asked her not to make the divorce too messy because he 
              wanted to make Shanmugam a minister. <br> <br> Now, what does the Holland-Bukit Timah team have to say about the moral 
              values of K. Shanmugam or a Prime Minister who attempts a cover up? Does
               Shanmugam have an agenda in parliament as a womaniser? Will the voters 
              of Nee Soon GRC approve Shanmugam's sleazy ways? I she safe to have 
              around your daughters? Will Shanmugam's teammates Mr Lim Wee Kiak, Ms 
              Lee Bee Wah, Mr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Patrick Tay question their 
              own leader's morals?<br> <br> By the way, to Director of the Criminal Investigation Department, 
              Assistant  Commissioner of Police Hoong Wee Teck who said after tracking
               down a blogger online that those who made  remarks  online and think 
              that they can hide behind the Internet's anonymity will  be found out, 
              please remember you work for the Singapore people, not PAP politicians. 
              When your boss, Home Minister Shanmugam asks you to use police resources
               to track down this blogger, will you stand up for your country Mr Hoong
               and say police resources cannot be used for non state security issues? 
              These are merely personal matters brought up thanks to Dr Vivian 
              Balakrishnan and his team.<br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de Souza,  Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann:<br> <strong>TRADE AND INDUSTRY LIM HNG KIANG</strong><br> <br> Anyone wondered why Mr Lim took four years to become minister of the 
              same ministry where he was CEO of its largest unit, HDB, before he 
              entered politics? An unusually long time to understudy your own area 
              isn't it? The Ministry of National Development is mainly made up of the 
              HDB. We like Mr Lim Hng Kiang and prefer not to bring up here what 
              really happened to delay the rise of the high-flying minister. If it 
              comes out somewhere else, you have only Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and his 
              team to thank, Mr Lim.<br> <br> But don't the voters of  West Coast GRC deserve to know the whole story, Mr Lim? Will you come clean to them? <br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de Souza,  Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann: <br> <strong>PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG</strong><br> <br> Anybody remember what happened to his first wife? How can a medical 
              doctor of about 30 years old die from a heart attack in a hospital after
               childbirth? We think everybody knows the real story by now.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de  Souza,  Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann: <br> <br> <strong>PRIME MINISTER'S BROTHER LEE HSIEN YANG</strong><br> <br> What can we say about Lee Hsien Yang? Is there anybody in Singapore who 
              does not know about his mistress in Australia? This fellow cannot get a 
              proper job in the private sector so the only ones who will give him the 
              money he needs to support his mistress are government-linked companies. <br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de  Souza,  Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann: <br> <br> <strong>PRIME MINISTER'S SISTER LEE WEI LING</strong><br> <br> <br> Dangerous woman. Once she turns her sight on you, you are doomed. <br> 1. She complained about her boss Dr Shorvon and then took his job.<br> 2. She complained about Philip Yeo and EDB and he lost his job. Now the 
              fellow is sitting in Spring Singapore looking after small business. <br> 3. She complained about Dr Walter Woon and he lost his job as Attorney-General.<br> 4. She complained about John Hopkins medical school (because Shorvon 
              went there and they rfused to kick him out) and then see what happened 
              to them in Singapore.<br> 5. All the while she writes articles in The State Times portraying 
              herself as the only caring doctor in her hospital, scolding the others 
              publicly. <br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de  Souza, Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann:<br> <strong>WIFE OF FORMER TRANSPORT MINISTER, HELEN YEO</strong><br> <br> We like Yeo Cheow Tong. Too bad he cannot control the greed of his wife.
               She has a whole website on her unfortunately named after her husband. 
              See www.yeocheowtong.com<br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de  Souza,  Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann: <br> <br> <strong>FORMER MINISTER S. DHANABALAN</strong><br> We like Mr Dhanabalan. He is the victim here. Why not somebody ask him 
              the true details of the slap he received from Lee Hsien Loong over Mr 
              Dhanabalan's objections to younger Lee's approach on the whole "Marxist"
               affair. Lee Kuan Yew confessed that Mr Dhanabalan resigned over the 
              "Marxist" affair but that is only half-truth. The government leaders who
               initiate defamation suits over any statement have never brought a 
              defamation suit against author Dr Ross Worthington who<strong> </strong>got the 
              broad picture right but the details wrong in his book Governance In 
              Singapore. The State Times was enlisted to focus on the details which 
              were wrong, red herrings. There is no defamation suit because in court 
              the correct details of the incident will come out. The slap did not 
              happen in the Cabinet room. Not even Lee Hsien Loong is that stupid.<br> <br> Mr Dhanabalan is a serious Christian. He can be economical with the 
              truth but he cannot lie when asked a simple question,  "Did Lee Hsien 
              Loong ever strike you?" Every time he was asked a general question about
               it, he gave a general answer. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de  Souza,  Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann: <br> <br> <strong>FORMER SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE CHAN CHOO SEN</strong><br> <br> Under this sleazy man, the whole of Joo Chiat became a sleazy area of 
              karaoke places and prostitutes until the residents complained to the 
              Prime Ministers' Office. Anybody asked who was the biggest patron of 
              those sleazy bars?<br> <br> <br> <br> Let's get personal, thanks to Vivian Balakrishan, Christopher de  Souza, Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann:<br> <br> <strong>FORMER ENVIRONMENT MINISTER DR AHMAD MATTAR</strong><br> <br> This man was gay!  He was married but also had openly gay relationships.
               What a bunch of hypocrites in PAP to talk about gay people bringing a 
              gay agenda when they had a minister who was gay?  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> More revelations to come about more cabinet ministers and PAP members of
               parliament, present and past, all thanks to Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, 
              Christopher de Souza, Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann. However, this blog will
               be removed immediately when this dirty team of politicians apologise to
               the nation. This is Dr Balakrishnan's first time leading a GRC and 
              already he turned to dirty tricks and smear tactics. What more to come 
              from these four smug dirty politicians?<br> <br> <br> For the record, this was the cunning way that Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, 
              Christopher de Souza, Liang Eng Hwa and Sim Ann raised the fact that Dr 
              Vincent Wijeysingha is gay, by pretending that they were really 
              interested in something else he said (wink, wink! but you know he is 
              gay, right, wink, wink). They hope conservative Catholics and Muslims 
              will vote for PAP if they can raise the personal profile of Dr 
              Wijeysingha:<br> <br> Monday 25 April, Dr Balakrishnan and his GRC team issued a statement  on the matter. <br> The PAP statement, which was undersigned by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan  and 
              candidates Liang Eng Hwa, Christopher de Souza and Sim Ann, reads as  
              follows:</p>
              <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“A video has been posted on the  
              internet showing Vincent Wijeysingha participating at a forum which  
              discussed the promotion of the gay cause in Singapore. </em></div>
              <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “The discussion at the forum also  touched on sex with boys and whether the age of consent for boys should  be 14 years of age.</em></div>
              <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “In the video, Wijeysingha was  introduced as being from the SDP. </em></div>
              <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “In addition to other comments,  Wijeysingha stated: ‘I think the gay 
              community has to rally ourselves.  Perhaps one outcome of today’s forum 
              would be, for those of us who are  interested, to come together to 
              further consider how we can address the  377 issue as well as further 
              rights issues in relation to gays and  lesbians.’</em></div>
              <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “We believe that candidates should  be upfront about their political 
              agenda and motives, so that voters are  able to make an informed choice. </em></div>
              <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> <strong>“The issue is not 
              Wijeysingha’s  sexual orientation. That is a matter for him. (But isn't 
              this your way of bringing this up in the first place, Dr Balakrishnan? 
              You are setting the agenda.)</strong></em></div>
              <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “The video raises the question on  whether Wijeysingha will now pursue 
              this cause in the political arena  and what is the SDP’s position on the
               matter. <strong>(Just an excuse and a sideshow. Nobody is fooled by this 
              trick, Dr Balakrishnan. No wonder you dropped it so quickly after SDP 
              clarified its position. You had achieved what you set out to do, pont 
              out that Dr Vincent is gay.)</strong>”</em></div>
