              to all forumerâ€“i urge you tell your your children and grand children who do u vote for tmr! then ask them 5 and 10 years later .do u make a right choice tmr!
              Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£
              
              it seem Opposition and supporters just zoom on the demerits of all policy. Have they also weighed the benefits of the policy?
              
              Have they also considered the demerits of alternatives policy, if any, in various aspects?
              let us take manufacturing as example.
              
              MANUFACTURINGâ€”why TAN JEE SAY â€˜s theory are wrong.
              TAN JEE SAY â€˜s theory are based on wrong assumptions and his target just kick out many foreigners at all costs.he says SG is short of land,manufacturing is a sunset industry. . This is not true.
              
              4.MANUFACTURING in fact should not has blooming in Spore. But PAP just make it happen . look around, how many friends and relatives, ex-class mates, exâ€“NS buddies working in
              MANUFACTURING directly, and how many in upstream and down stream
              of manufacturing, like transport, catering,insurance, legal, finance etc to support manufacturing.
              
              5. With due respect, many Sg people are ignorant about SG!
              Do u know SG have plenty of land for nest generations? In short, there are plenty of land equal to four to seven CHANGI AIRPORT waiting for next generations to develop.changi East and Tuas View Extension, Marina East and South ,Tekong Island etc. http://www.onemap.sg/
              
              many are ready for development now!
              
              6. Can we turn so many land now occupied by manufacturing into services and schools as Tan proposes?Can the current manufacturing workers eligible and like to work in services and schools? If manufacturing reducing, tax revenues drop. But SG need to pay for DOUBLE TEACHERS, DOUBLE HEALTH CARE WORKERS , as proposed by Tan. Show me the money!
              .
              
              7.what are the best alternatives uses land now occupied by manufacturing ? Flying kites, model planes, SAF EX ground?
              since SG have ample precious resources in land, why dunt SG create more jobs?
              
              8 SUNSET INDUSTRY AND RATIO IN GDP
              today ST A12 reports TAN JEE SAY saying manufacturing had declined from 27% of global GDP in 1970, to 17% in 2009.he calls it sunset industry. the drop in ratio was caused by rising figures in other industries, like aviation, tourism, health care ,entertainment etc.
              But the absolute figures in manufacturing is sure increase by many folds in real terms.
              
              9. Is it stupid not to get a share in mega pie in manufacturing?
              Global GDP 2009 is US$58.26 Trillion. 17% is 9.9 trillions.
              SG is able to produce capital intensive and knowledge intensive manufacturing.
              Look around at your home, working places, on the streets etc.
              do the objects in life fall from sky? NO. All are made in factory!
              SG produce part of hi tech electronic stuff, oil products, recently Rolls Royce blades of engines, many drugs factories etc
              
              10. If any MNC want to invest FIXED INVESTMENT (not those fly by night financial investment) over US $1000 million or 1 billion,there are less than 20 cities are eligible for
              their factories. they need to see political , social and economical stability, military defense capacity, tax incentives, labour skills, trade unions ,water supply etc.
              Why world largest solar panel factory is here? S$2.5 billions!
              http://www.recgroup.com/recgroup/operations/REC-in-Singapore/
              
              11.80% of NURSE ARE FOREIGNERS
              Local young people have too many choices and really not many can stand this job.
              If we increase the salary to attract more local , do u want we get local to work as nurse just for sake of money?
              TAN JEE SAY â€˜s proposal to double no. of nurse will import more FT!!
              
              12 how much u pay local to build HDB? 3k or 4k?if more local build HDB, cost of HDB cost will go up.
              opposition says new HDB price shall be based on cost or cost plus. then,
              price of HDB will go up!!
              
              13. In the past decades, SG people have done good deeds by employing thousand of third world workers. Their children then no need go to beds with empty stomach!Out of current 900,000 foreign workers here, I think 500,000 are low skilled , eg construction workers, cleaners, factory workers etc. if SG ask them go, they may not get a job elsewhere. their children have suffer hunger again.
              
              
              Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£
              to all forumer-
              CURRENT PAP POLICY MAY NOT BE PERFECT, ARE U SURE OPPOSITION POLICY IS BETTER? think hard. your vote will decide the future of your children and grand children.
              
              -i urge you tell your your children and grand children who do u vote for! then ask them 5 and 10 years do u make a right choice tmr!

              <p>A netizen Kojakbt has sent an email to Foreign Minister George Yeo to
                   enquire about India’s recent call on Singapore to open up its job 
                  market to allow more Indian “FTs” to work there.</p>
              <p>The shocking 
                  news made the headlines in the Economic Times of India a few days ago, 
                  but was not reported in the Singapore media (read more <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/India-presses-Singapore-to-open-up-services-sector/articleshow/6623486.cms">here</a>)</p>
              <p>An
                   official from India’s Commerce Department told the Economic Times that 
                  India is trying to “take advantage” of the second review of the 
                  agreement to “get more in services and are exploring all possibilities.”</p>
              <p>In
                   addition to the medical, health-related and education sectors, India is
                   asking to expand the existing list of 127 occupations by which Indian 
                  “FTs” are allowed entry into Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>“The additional 
                  list has to include chefs, physiotherapists, nurses, school teachers, 
                  nutritionists, professionals in entertainment and hospitality sectors,”</strong> said Amit Mitra, another Indian official.</p>
              <p>PAP
                   leaders have always insisted that foreign workers are only employed in 
                  sectors “shunned” by Singaporeans such as the construction and marine 
                  industry.</p>
              <p><strong>Morever, India is now requesting Singapore to allow 
                  Indian “FTs” to take up jobs in its accountancy and hospitality sectors 
                  whose jobs are readily taken up by Singaporeans</strong>.</p>
              <p>Without the 
                  government acting as a “gatekeeper” to moderate the inflow of 
                  foreigners, it is difficult for Singaporeans to compete directly with 
                  them as many are willing to accept a pay much lower than locals 
                  especially if they come alone without having to raise a family here.</p>

              <p>Dear George,</p>
              <p>I read with dismay this news article from The Economic Times of India:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/India-presses-Singapore-to-open-up-services-sector/articleshow/6623486.cms">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/India-presses-Singapore-to-open-up-services-sector/articleshow/6623486.cms</a></p>
              <p>It
                   stated that India has asked Singapore to open up more services to allow
                   a greater number of Indian professionals to work in Singapore’s 
                  accountancy and hospitality sectors. This is currently being negotiated 
                  under a bilateral FTA between India and Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>Besides 
                  requesting Singapore to take deeper commitments in medical, 
                  health-related and education services, it is reported that they also 
                  wanted to ask for expanding the existing list of 127 occupations by 
                  which professionals are allowed entry into Singapore. They wanted the 
                  additional list to include chefs, physiotherapists, nurses, school 
                  teachers, nutritionists, professionals in entertainment and hospitality 
                  sectors!</strong></p>
              <p>I would urge the Govt to think twice about opening up the
                   Singapore’s market further in the way India is asking for. If this is 
                  implemented, it will have severe consequences to our already beleaguered
                   PMETs. Many over 40s PMETs are slowly being pushed out by the cheaper 
                  and younger foreigners. Even the younger Singaporean professionals have a
                   harder time getting a job these days. If you really care for 
                  Singaporeans, don’t let this happen.</p>
              <p>By the way, even though this 
                  news wasn’t reported by our mainstream media, it has already been picked
                   up by online sites such as Temasek Review. It’s making rounds in 
                  Singapore blogs and sites and most Singaporeans are not happy about it:</p>

              <p>Contrary to public perception, Filipino professionals and highly skilled workers outnumber domestic helpers in Singapore.</p>
              <p>President Aquino said many Filipinos in Singapore work as accountants, financial managers and advisers.</p>
              <p>“There
               has been a transformation on the composition of our OFWs here,” he told
               Manila-based reporters in an informal gathering at the Shangri-La hotel
               Thursday.</p>
              <p>“Many professonals have come here. We have a lot of engineers, a lot of them women.”</p>
              <p>Aquino ended his productive three-day state visit here yesterday.</p>
              <p><strong>Of
               the 177,600 Filipinos in Singapore, a sizeable number, or 106,600 are 
              professionals, while the remaining 71,000 are domestic helpers, 
              according to data from the Philippine embassy.</strong></p>
              <p>Presidential 
              Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma said problems regarding 
              domestic helpers are “adequately” addressed by the embassy, the 
              Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Labor and 
              Employment (DOLE).</p>
              <p>“No major concerns… that’s not being handled adequately by the embassy, DFA and DOLE,” he said.</p>
              <p>“And
               I think the most significant fact is, the balance is now in favor of 
              more professionals and highly skilled workers. So, in general, the 
              problems have become less in number and in magnitude.”</p>
              <p>“No 
              complaints so far. The ambassador (Minda Calaguian-Cruz) also didn’t 
              mention anything. Their Trade Union Congress is a very strong entity 
              here,” Aquino said.</p>
              <p>“I would assume that they would also be 
              informed of their rights. So, until I see proof to the contrary I would 
              have to presume that things are all right here.”</p>
              <p>Coloma said the 
              condition of Filipinos working in Singapore has improved tremendously as
               a result of the continuing cooperation between the two countries.</p>
              <p>Coloma said around 108 Filipino associations are operating in Singapore, including the bayanihan centers.</p>
              <p>“This is being sustained by the two countries, the Philippine and Singaporean governments,” he said.</p>
              <p>“And I think this is the reason why there is a significant drop in the problems of OFWs in Singapore.”</p>
              <p>Aquino thanked Singapore President S.R. Nathan and his people for the excellent arrangements during his visit.</p>
              <p>“I
               am grateful for the support you have extended my nation – in the form 
              of investments that have generated jobs for my countrymen and of 
              enhancement capability programs undertaken in the spirit of solidarity,”
               he said.</p>
              <p>Aquino also thanked the Singapore government for hosting
               the more than 177,000 overseas Filipino workers during a speech at the 
              state banquet hosted by Nathan.</p>
              <p>“Drive toward progress was fueled by the desire to empower your people so that they may live better lives,” he told Nathan.</p>
              <p>“I
               spent the past day seeing this first-hand: how a people so diverse were
               able to unite under one vision and one banner; how an island a little 
              more than 700 square kilometers was transformed into a hub of culture 
              and enterprise in the region, if not the world.”</p>
              <p>Aquino said every Singaporean has been empowered to fulfill his or her potential.</p>
              <p>“I believe that the same potential holds true for my own people,” he said.</p>
              <p>“You made me realize what we can someday achieve.”</p>
              <p>He was grateful to the Singapore government for the example of what can be achieved, Aquino said.</p>
              <p>.</p>

              <h1>Hong Kong - Overview of economy</h1>
              <p>During the first Opium War (1839-43), the British government colonized
                      Hong Kong in 1841. Over time it established a free-enterprise economy in
                      the colony and turned it into a trading center in Asia. Hong Kong has
                      retained these characteristics since its hand-over to China in 1997, as
                      stipulated in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the transfer of
                      Hong Kong's sovereignty to China. Accordingly, the Chinese
                      government guaranteed that it would preserve Hong Kong's
                      capitalist economy and its political and social systems for at least 50
                      years. This commitment was justified under the Chinese formula of
                      "one country, two systems," which allowed for the
                      coexistence of a capitalist Hong Kong with th<strong>socialist </strong> mainland China as 2 parts of 1 single country. The Chinese government
                      also guaranteed that it would not intervene in the internal affairs of
                      Hong Kong, and would let its government function independently in all
                      its internal affairs, including economic policies. The Chinese central
                      government in Beijing is in charge only of Hong Kong's foreign
                      and defense issues. China's official acceptance of Hong
                      Kong's mini constitution, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
                      Administrative Region, consolidated this arrangement when China's
                      National People's Congress passed it in 1990. The latter
                      guarantees free trade, free enterprise, and low taxes for at least 50
                      years.</p>
              <p>Much of the anxiety of the pre-1997 period has proven to be baseless.
                      China has kept its promise and Hong Kong continues to be a bastion of
                      free enterprise. The territory has retained all its colonial financial
                      and 
                      <strong> monetary policies </strong> and laws, including those regarding its currency, the free flow of
                      capital into and out of its territory, and taxation. It uses its own
                      currency, the Hong Kong dollar, and keeps its revenues for its own
                      needs. Its government does not pay any tax to the Chinese central
                      government. <strong>The hand-over has not changed Hong Kong's economy,
                      but the post-1997 period has had at least 2 major impacts on it. First,
                      this period has consolidated a change in the economy that began in the
                      early 1980s. This was the transfer of large, sophisticated, and
                      labor-intensive industries from Hong Kong to mainland China where there
                      is no scarcity of land and raw material and where labor is significantly
                      cheaper. As a result, existing manufacturing in Hong Kong mainly focuses
                      on the necessary activities for the 
                      
                        re-export
                      
                       of goods produced by Hong Kong enterprises in China. Being the largest
                      economic sector even prior to 1997, Hong Kong's service sector
                      has since grown significantly in the fields of trade and transportation.
                      This was done to meet the increasing demand for re-exporting and to
                      absorb the loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector. Second, there has
                      been a growing interest in 2 new industries: high-tech and information
                      technology (IT). This is a positive move towards the broadening of the
                      service-dominated economy of Hong Kong. IT activities have also created
                      new types of employment opportunities, most of which cannot be filled
                      immediately due to a lack of skilled workers. Consequently, there were
                      18,400 vacant IT positions in 2000. The root cause of this problem is
                      that those who have lost their jobs in other sectors (e.g.
                      manufacturing) are either unskilled or have skills that are not in
                      demand. The Hong Kong government has addressed this issue by increasing
                      its spending on retraining programs by 5.4 percent in 1997-98, 11.8
                      percent in 1999-2000, and 42.8 percent in 2000-01. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Like many other Asian economies, the Hong Kong economy suffered from the
                      financial crisis of the late 1990s. However, unlike most of them, it was
                      able to cope with the crisis with tolerable losses and begin recovery in
                      1999. Its large service sector has been given credit for the
                      economy's ability to recover. This sector has been the reason for
                      a constant 
                      
                        balance-of-payment
                      
                       surplus since 1997.</strong> In that year, Hong Kong had a balance-of-payment
                      deficit of US$6.159 billion (equal to 3.6 percent of its GDP). However,
                      it enjoyed 2 consecutive balance-of-payment surplus years of US$2.902
                      billion (equal to 1.8 percent of its GDP) and US$9.285 billion (equal to
                      5.8 percent of GDP) in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Figures for 2000 are
                      not yet available, but there are indications of a surplus for that year
                      as well. Unlike other Asian countries fallen victim to the 1997-98
                      financial crisis, Hong Kong's 
                      <strong> external debt </strong> has remained small in comparison to its available finances. For
                      example, its total 
                      <strong> foreign debt </strong> was US$48.7 billion in 1998, US$53.5 billion in 1999, and US$56.5
                      billion in 2000 while its 
                      <strong> foreign exchange reserves </strong> were US$89.601 billion, US$92.236 billion, and US$97.218 billion,
                      respectively. <strong>The crisis slowed down the economy temporarily, as
                      reflected in a large drop in its GDP growth rate from 5 percent in 1997
                      to-5.1 percent in 1998. However, it did not lead to widespread closures
                      of industries and companies or massive unemployment as experienced in
                      Indonesia and Malaysia, for instance. </strong>The economy began to recover in
                      1999 and 2000 when the GDP growth rates jumped to 3 percent and 9.7
                      percent, respectively. <strong>Additionally, its unemployment rate reached the
                      record high of 6.2 percent in 1999, only to drop to about 5 percent in
                      2000 despite the continued relocation of the manufacturing jobs to
                      mainland China. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Geography and size impose certain limits on the economic activities that
                      Hong Kong can undertake, but they also open opportunities for its
                      economic growth. Maintaining extensive ties with China has been an
                      imperative for the survival of this small territory, which has no
                      mineral and water resources and lacks an adequate agriculture sector to
                      meet its essential private and commercial needs. Being connected to
                      China via land, Hong Kong has depended on its only neighbor for raw
                      materials, food, and water. Its small size and acute scarcity of land
                      also lead Hong Kong to look to China for the establishment of large and
                      labor-intensive manufacturing establishments. This has been a blessing
                      in disguise as China's low wages significantly reduce the cost of
                      production of its exports and make them more competitive in
                      international markets. Reliance on China has also helped Hong Kong
                      penetrate the huge and growing Chinese market, the largest in the world
                      and to which many developed economies are trying so hard to gain access.
                      Not only are Hong Kong businesses interested in China, but the Chinese
                      government also encourages extensive ties with Hong Kong, its reunified
                      territory. Expanding economic ties with China also helps Hong Kong
                      tolerate losses in its economic transactions elsewhere. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The service sector dominates Hong Kong's economy. This is the
                      result of the territory's limited opportunities for agricultural
                      and industrial activities on the one hand, and the interest of the
                      British colonizers to develop it as a trading center on the other. Being
                      the engine of economic growth, the service sector is the largest
                      employer and the largest contributor to Hong Kong's GDP (84.7
                      percent in 1998). The major services are trade, financial services
                      (e.g., banking and insurance), tourism, 
                      
                        retail
                      
                      , and real estate. Trade has been the heart of Hong Kong's
                      economy. The service sector has been growing steadily over the last few
                      decades under British and Chinese rule alike. </strong></p>
              <p>Agriculture is negligible as a source of employment or revenue and makes
                      only a miniscule contribution to GDP (0.1 percent in 1998). The scarcity
                      of arable land leaves very limited opportunity for agricultural
                      activities. Hong Kong is heavily dependent on agricultural imports.</p>
              <p>Industry is a significant sector, but is mainly geared to the re-export
                      of goods produced in China. This sector is small, accounting for 15.2
                      percent of GDP in 1998. Thanks to a lack of minerals, there is no mining
                      industry of any significance. There is a small utility (water, gas, and
                      electricity) industry, a relatively significant construction industry,
                      and a more important export-oriented manufacturing sector. As a small
                      territory with limited land and a very large population, Hong Kong
                      cannot support heavy industries, which are land-intensive by nature. Nor
                      can it have large labor-intensive industries. Besides low wages and an
                      abundance of resources in China, space has been the main reason for the
                      relocation of Hong Kong's large and labor-intensive industries to
                      that country. The remaining industries of Hong Kong are small-scale
                      establishments, which employ small numbers of workers. Garment
                      production has been the leading component of the manufacturing sector
                      for decades, but Hong Kong has other marketable products—mainly
                      light and 
                      <strong> consumer goods </strong> such as footwear, toys, and plastics. Manufacturing lacks a significant
                      high-tech segment, but has a viable electronics branch in need of
                      development.</p>

              HK ceases to build HOS--HOME OWNERSHIP SCHEME--,like HDB, since 2002.
              
              So, new flats depend wholly on private developers.
              
              Completion of new flats, about 11,000 units ayear, is terrible low, lower than SG private flats in absolute number.
              
              Since HK get 7 millions population, plus mainland China buyers,the price is sure beyond high income young people reach.
              
              2. the average no. of all HK new flats completed is only 9975 units a year, from 2007 to 2010.PUBLIC HOUSING FOR SALE IS ZERO SINCE 2002.
              
              pl note there are about 2.3 million people age from 25 to 45 who need hosing badly.

              YES , BUT DUE TO INCOME CEILING, many people wish they are not eligible to get. but they also cannot afford private flats.
              each years, there are only about 20,000 units of PUBLIC RENTAL UNITS.

              <p>If there are too many opposition MPs complaining about GST hikes, over crowding everywhere, transport fare hikes, low paying jobs, expensive public housing, high minister salaries, parliament will become a place bustling with lots of hot noisy debates and discussions.</p>

              <p>Since HK get 7 millions population, plus mainland China buyers,the price is sure beyond high income young people reach.</p>

              <p>Hong Kong Housing Authority gives around 50% discount rate for public housing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span>In Phase 19C, the Housing Authority introduced a new flexible discount rate system, allowing successful applicants to choose from three discount rates equivalent to 10% above or below the base discount rate apart from the existing 50% discount on full market value at the time of price fixing. During application, the potential buyers were also asked about their preference on the discount options. Almost 50% of the applicants responded to the question, amongst which 76% chose 10% above the base discount rate (60% off), 18% chose base discount rate (50% off) and 6% chose 10% below the base discount rate (40% off).</span></span></p>
