                                    question: How long can the PAP carry on selecting MPs from
                                    elites with little political acumen or sensitivity and
                                    not pay a price. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> Aug 30, 2008 </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">IN
                                      SINGAPORE today where diversity is growing and young
                                      Singaporeans are becoming more opinionated, almost everything
                                      touches on politics, including table tennis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It
                                      is the sign of the times. An educated post-war generation
                                      is slowly taking over that is better informed, helped
                                      by the powerful reach of the Internet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">More
                                      than ever, Singaporeans are speaking out their minds
                                      on many subjects – sometimes vociferously – and
                                      shedding the reticence of their parents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Even
                                      the Republic’s first medal win in an Olympic Games
                                      in 48 years has produced a heated controversy that is
                                      rubbing off badly on the government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore’s
                                      three women table tennis players, all naturalised, China-born
                                      citizens, lost to the Chinese in the finals in Beijing
                                      to win the team silver medal. But the fourth player,
                                      who is ranked 12th in the world for men, got the short
                                      end of the stick when it came to support and attention.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While
                                      the attention of the team was riveted on the medal-winning
                                      women players, Singapore’s sole men’s representative,
                                      Gao Ning, went into battle without the support of a coach.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      idea of a coach-less competitor in an Olympic tournament
                                      is inconceivable. Gao went down to a shocking 4-0 defeat
                                      to an unfancied player from Croatia. Alone, he wept afterwards.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      fiasco started when a livid People’s Action Party
                                      MP chastised and sacked the team manager over national
                                      television without holding an inquiry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">She
                                      not only fired the manager, Anthony Lee, without telling
                                      him but also hinted that the future status of the popular
                                      head coach was being considered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many
                                      Singaporeans reacted angrily while players were upset – not
                                      by the idea of disciplining wrongdoers – but by
                                      the summary, arrogant way it was done.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      MP, Lee Bee Wah, who hails from Prime Minister Lee Hsien
                                      Loong’s group constituency, was president of the
                                      Singapore Table Tennis Association, a post she assumed
                                      only a month earlier.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      mistake in Beijing, said Lee, a Malaysian-born engineer,
                                      required accountability of the officials.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      issue attracted a deluge of letters – both on and
                                      offline – mostly condemning Lee’s “high-handedness”.
                                      Some Singaporeans, however, praised her for her speedy
                                      response to what was obviously a terrible dereliction
                                      of duty by officials or coaches.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Such
                                      debates are normally confined to the English-speaking
                                      world, but the ping-pong saga is an exception.<br> <br> The game is widely played and loved by the Chinese-educated,
                                    so the arguments were not just an Internet phenomenon.
                                    It spread through the heartland coffee shops.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      non-English heartland ripple worries the ruling party
                                      since it still holds the majority of PAP supporters.
                                      The conflict may even affect PM Lee’s political
                                      fortunes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Lee
                                      is one of six Members of Parliament in the Prime Minister’s
                                      Ang Mo Kio group constituency.<br> <br> Unless the conflict is resolved and tempers cool down,
                                    its overall vote can be dragged down in the 2011 election.<br> <br> “ I’m bruised,” Lee admitted but insisted she did no wrong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Her
                                      many detractors think differently, with some calling
                                      on her to resign as president of the table tennis body
                                      to take responsibility.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“She
                                      should have waited for the team to return and carry out
                                      a proper investigation before taking action,” said
                                      a more polite critic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Other
                                      criticisms are stronger. “Her behaviour was a typical
                                      PAP representative – elitist, arrogant, overbearing.<br> <br> “ Only a month into the job and knowing nothing about the sport, she acted
              as though she knew everything by firing people,” one fan said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In
                                      a move to control damage, the Sports Minister promised
                                      a full review of the episode.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“I
                                      am very concerned with the way it is spinning out of
                                      control because I don’t want a situation where
                                      people say things or do things which destroy relationships,” he
                                      said with a hint of criticism of Lee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Having
                                      a second controversial MP in his constituency is something
                                      the Prime Minister doesn’t need.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another
                                      member, Wee Siew Kim found himself in the centre of a
                                      storm when his daughter, Shu Min posted elitist views
                                      that supported the principle of the survival of the fittest.
                                      Singaporeans who fail to make it could only blame themselves,
                                      she added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      father criticised her strong language but supported the
                                      message in principle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">These
                                      controversies could drag down the vote for Lee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In
                                      the 2006 election, a team of unknown young candidates
                                      from Workers Party shocked the PAP by polling 33.86%
                                      of the votes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It
                                      has also raised questions about the suitability of selecting
                                      scholars with no political acumen or articulation skills
                                      to stand in elections.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      Olympics ping-pong success also produced another controversy:
                                      should Singapore resort to the use of foreign talent
                                      to win medals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While
                                      the win has stirred a general sense of pride in this
                                      migrant society, whose people’s forefathers had
                                      also settled here from abroad, it was not shared by a
                                      large minority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“They
                                      were not true Singaporeans. It was like a China ‘A’ team
                                      versus China ‘B’ team,” said a fan.<br> <br> The resentment partly reflects the public unease over the
                                    large influx of foreigners into the city out of fear of
                                    losing jobs to them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      increasing diversity in this land, marked by people speaking
                                      out more often, is slowly changing things.<br> <br> For one thing, the consensus society that Lee Kuan Yew
                                    had long worked to establish is fast fading.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Is
                                      this good or bad?” Some are fearful it will bring
                                      chaos, while others cheer diversity as bringing new hope.</span></p>
              <p>diversity can be a rainbow but we have to deal with the rain also.</p>

              <em>Politics</em><br>
              <strong>Growing restiveness</strong><br>
              With the changing voter, the ping pong saga revisits the question:
              How long can the PAP carry on selecting MPs from elites with little
              political acumen or sensitivity and not pay a price. By Seah Chiang
              Nee.<br>
              Aug 30, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">IN
              SINGAPORE today where diversity is growing and young Singaporeans
              are becoming more opinionated, almost everything touches on
              politics, including table tennis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It
              is the sign of the times. An educated post-war generation is slowly
              taking over that is better informed, helped by the powerful reach
              of the Internet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">More
              than ever, Singaporeans are speaking out their minds on many
              subjects â€“ sometimes vociferously â€“ and shedding the reticence of
              their parents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Even
              the Republicâ€™s first medal win in an Olympic Games in 48 years has
              produced a heated controversy that is rubbing off badly on the
              government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singaporeâ€™s
              three women table tennis players, all naturalised, China-born
              citizens, lost to the Chinese in the finals in Beijing to win the
              team silver medal. But the fourth player, who is ranked 12th in the
              world for men, got the short end of the stick when it came to
              support and attention.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While
              the attention of the team was riveted on the medal-winning women
              players, Singaporeâ€™s sole menâ€™s representative, Gao Ning, went into
              battle without the support of a coach.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              idea of a coach-less competitor in an Olympic tournament is
              inconceivable. Gao went down to a shocking 4-0 defeat to an
              unfancied player from Croatia. Alone, he wept
              afterwards.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              fiasco started when a livid Peopleâ€™s Action Party MP chastised and
              sacked the team manager over national television without holding an
              inquiry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">She
              not only fired the manager, Anthony Lee, without telling him but
              also hinted that the future status of the popular head coach was
              being considered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many
              Singaporeans reacted angrily while players were upset â€“ not by the
              idea of disciplining wrongdoers â€“ but by the summary, arrogant way
              it was done.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              MP, Lee Bee Wah, who hails from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loongâ€™s
              group constituency, was president of the Singapore Table Tennis
              Association, a post she assumed only a month earlier.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              mistake in Beijing, said Lee, a Malaysian-born engineer, required
              accountability of the officials.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              issue attracted a deluge of letters â€“ both on and offline â€“ mostly
              condemning Leeâ€™s â€œhigh-handednessâ€�. Some Singaporeans, however,
              praised her for her speedy response to what was obviously a
              terrible dereliction of duty by officials or coaches.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Such
              debates are normally confined to the English-speaking world, but
              the ping-pong saga is an exception.<br>
              <br>
              The game is widely played and loved by the Chinese-educated, so the
              arguments were not just an Internet phenomenon. It spread through
              the heartland coffee shops.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              non-English heartland ripple worries the ruling party since it
              still holds the majority of PAP supporters. The conflict may even
              affect PM Leeâ€™s political fortunes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Lee
              is one of six Members of Parliament in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Ang Mo
              Kio group constituency.<br>
              <br>
              Unless the conflict is resolved and tempers cool down, its overall
              vote can be dragged down in the 2011 election.<br>
              <br>
              â€œ Iâ€™m bruised,â€� Lee admitted but insisted she did no
              wrong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Her
              many detractors think differently, with some calling on her to
              resign as president of the table tennis body to take
              responsibility.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">â€œShe
              should have waited for the team to return and carry out a proper
              investigation before taking action,â€� said a more polite
              critic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Other
              criticisms are stronger. â€œHer behaviour was a typical PAP
              representative â€“ elitist, arrogant, overbearing.<br>
              <br>
              â€œ Only a month into the job and knowing nothing about the sport,
              she acted as though she knew everything by firing people,â€� one fan
              said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In a
              move to control damage, the Sports Minister promised a full review
              of the episode.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">â€œI
              am very concerned with the way it is spinning out of control
              because I donâ€™t want a situation where people say things or do
              things which destroy relationships,â€� he said with a hint of
              criticism of Lee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Having
              a second controversial MP in his constituency is something the
              Prime Minister doesnâ€™t need.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another
              member, Wee Siew Kim found himself in the centre of a storm when
              his daughter, Shu Min posted elitist views that supported the
              principle of the survival of the fittest. Singaporeans who fail to
              make it could only blame themselves, she added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              father criticised her strong language but supported the message in
              principle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">These
              controversies could drag down the vote for Lee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In
              the 2006 election, a team of unknown young candidates from Workers
              Party shocked the PAP by polling 33.86% of the votes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It
              has also raised questions about the suitability of selecting
              scholars with no political acumen or articulation skills to stand
              in elections.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              Olympics ping-pong success also produced another controversy:
              should Singapore resort to the use of foreign talent to win
              medals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While
              the win has stirred a general sense of pride in this migrant
              society, whose peopleâ€™s forefathers had also settled here from
              abroad, it was not shared by a large minority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">â€œThey
              were not true Singaporeans. It was like a China â€˜Aâ€™ team versus
              China â€˜Bâ€™ team,â€� said a fan.<br>
              <br>
              The resentment partly reflects the public unease over the large
              influx of foreigners into the city out of fear of losing jobs to
              them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              increasing diversity in this land, marked by people speaking out
              more often, is slowly changing things.<br>
              <br>
              For one thing, the consensus society that Lee Kuan Yew had long
              worked to establish is fast fading.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">â€œIs
              this good or bad?â€� Some are fearful it will bring chaos, while
              others cheer diversity as bringing new hope.</span></p>
              <p>diversity can be a rainbow but we have to deal with the rain
              also.</p>

              I think the PAP leaders themselves are disconnected with the people.
