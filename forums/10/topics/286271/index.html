            <div class='col-md body'><strong>When warnings go unheeded</strong><br><br>Containing dissent is getting harder for the Singapore government. The problem has been creeping up gradually, but it has taken the Burma crisis, motivating a surge of protests by Singaporeans and expatriate Burmese alike, to show how things have changed in Singapore. The old kneejerk policy of the government to ban every attempt at using the public space to make a point is becoming unworkable.<br><br>To be credible, bans must carry the real chance of enforcement. But what if enforcement is seen as carrying too high a price?<br><br><strong>More and more attempts to protest, every one met with bans</strong><br><br>As it is, there seems to be more and more attempts to organise outdoor protests, demonstrations, marches, vigils and whatever-you-might-call-it. Some organisers apply for a permit, others don't bother. Every one is met with refusal and if one still carries on, with police interception.<br><br>In yesterday's edition of 'Today' newspaper, it was reported that the police has banned a proposed 'Peace Concert for Burma' co-organised by the Substation, a centre for the arts, and Timbre, an outdoor cafe. Timbre is located in an enclosed courtyard adjacent to the Substation, and regularly holds music events. The only difference between this event and others would be that candles would be lit and a minute's silence observed.<br><br>Even so, the police statement said, "Political and 'cause'-related events are assessed to have a higher potential to stir emotions and controversy; an outdoor concert may lead to law and order concerns."<br><br>The "stir emotions" excuse is similar to the one used to explain the ban on a cycling event that had recently been proposed by the Workers' party. I don't have to say how vacuous that excuse is.<br><br>A month earlier, the police had banned another idea from the Substation: to hold an outdoor fair comprising stands by various civil society organisations. A similar permit application the year before was also refused.<br><br>Just a fortnight ago, students from 3 universities across 4 campuses organised a Peace Vigil over the Burma crisis. At the Singapore Management University, the 4th October gathering was supposed to take place in the open ground-floor foyer of the library building. Hours before it was to begin, the police phoned the Dean of Students, warning him that such an outdoor event would be illegal. The vigil was then hurriedly moved into the library itself.<br><br>Over at the Kent Ridge campus, their vigil had to be called off altogether. It's not clear what transpired, but according to the campus magazine The Ridge, "the proposal was rejected" -- by whom was not made clear...<br><br><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2007/yax-796.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2007/yax-796.htm</a></div>
