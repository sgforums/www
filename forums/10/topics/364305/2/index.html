He told Dr. Kissinger that he would come to the Guest House shortly to escort him  to the Chairman’s residence.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger and his delegation members at the meeting went back to the Guest House. Prime Minister Chou En-lai came to the Guest House at 11:20 p.m. and rode with Dr. Kissinger to Chungnahai. Mr. Chu, Deputy Director of Protocol, accompanied Mr. Lord. Prime Minister Chou  En-lai escorted Dr. Kissinger into the outer room of the Guest House and then through another room to Chairman Mao’s sitting room.<br><br>The Chairman was helped up from his chair by his young female attendant and came forward to  greet Dr. Kissinger. Photographers took pictures. He welcomed Dr. Kissinger and Dr. Kissinger pointed out that it was almostly exactly a year ago that he had first met the Chairman.<br><br>The Chairman then greeted Mr. Lord and commented that he was so young, younger than the interpreters. Mr. Lord replied that he was in any event older than the interpreters. The Chairman then motioned to the large easy chairs and the parties sat down. The photographers continued to take pictures.)</p>

              <p>Britain's PM Churchill had provided leadership in a moment of crisis, and helped Britain to recover from its defeat at Dunkirk in WW2, and steered Britain to victory by co-opting the USA to defeat Hitler.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, the Democratic practice in UK allowed the Citizens to throw out Churchill, who was no good at managing UK during the hard won Peace.</p>
              <p>It was not ingratitude towards Churchill, who graciously retired and stepped down to allow more capable persons to steer UK forward.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, for countries that are run by political autocrats and despots - the citizens are made to suffer the consequences of those who have passed their moment in history and prolonged their irrelevance, only to bring the country backwards : economically, politically, and socially.</p>

              <p>No, I am not deeply opposed towards Mao, as I have said - he stayed longer then it was neccessary.</p>
              <p>He should have left the political scene when he had served his time of relevance, and instead he continued to linger to control the helm of a sinking ship in a storm, and nearly capsized the entire ship.</p>
              <p>For his vanity in extending his own make belief sense of usefulness, he caused misery to millions and desroyed generations of precious history from moments of inspired madness that he unleased onto the Chinese population.</p>
              <p>He served his usefulness and made his positive mark on history, and should have left the management of a modern China to those who are better trained and more abled than himself.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for China, Mao could not bring himself to the same position as Deng Xiaopeng had done - and Deng had so little trouble in accepting his own finite position in China's History.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The same political mistakes are now being played out in Singapore by one dominant person's ambitious attempt to push his own hidden agenda towards posterity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one is perfect, and leaders do not become great by being over cautious or without the daring to make mistakes and learning the expensive lessons paid in blood.</p>
              <p>At least, Churchill had the strength, courage, foresight, and the political skills to galvanise the spirit of the British during their moments of crisis, and was able to deliver the heavy and difficult tasks that others before him have failed.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>At least, Churchill had the strength, courage, foresight, and
                                                  the political skills to galvanise the spirit of the British during
                                                  their moments of crisis</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>According to some writer's interpretation, Churchill also schemed to get into the position of Prime Minister:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">...On news the Germans had
                          reached Narvik before British ships could leave harbor, Churchill was
                          unperturbed. He told cabinet colleagues, including Prime Minister
                          Chamberlain, that the German occupation, "should not be on terms
                          unfavorable to us," insisting that England was, "in a far better
                          position than we had been to date."</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In
                          reality it was Churchill who was in the far better position.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> That was,
                          in position to replace Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister. </strong></span></span>Churchill's deliberate chaotic bungling of the plans for a Norway
                          invasion had led Chamberlain to assume personal day-to-day
                          responsibility for the Norwegian operation. He had been asked to do so,
                          in a calculated appeal, by Churchill.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> From that point, the trap had
                          been set against Chamberlain as well.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The conduct of the British campaign against Norway was ludicrous, and
                          Churchill was directly responsible for the disaster. He personally
                          countered orders of the military chiefs of staff, without even
                          informing them. He sent troops of the 24th Guards brigade by boat,
                          without artillery, engineers or transport, with orders to capture
                          Narvik, after it had been firmly secured by German forces...</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">...When it became obvious that he must step down, Chamberlain sought to
                          put the name of his Foreign Minister, Lord Halifax, to the King as his
                          successor, a move which Halifax, the leading Round Table figure in the
                          Cabinet, deftly declined in favor of Churchill.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">On May 10, just in the
                          hours the German Wehrmacht launched the blitzkrieg against Holland and
                          Belgium, Churchill was called by the King to form a new government.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Winston
                          Spencer Churchill, then 66, had been promoted by the Round Table at
                          that critical juncture, not because he especially appreciated the need
                          to mobilize Britain for war against Germany, though this was a
                          necessary precondition; nor because he was pragmatic enough, contrary
                          to Chamberlain, to be willing to strike an alliance with Stalin to
                          defeat Hitler, though this was also a necessary precondition.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Churchill
                          was chosen, above all, because the chief aim of Round Table policy <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>was
                          the clash between Russia and Germany. That, in order to draw the United
                          States into the war their geopolitics had brought about. Chamberlain's
                          role in setting Germany against Russia had exhausted its usefulness,
                          once the secret German-Soviet Friendship Treaty had been signed. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">A
                          new ploy, other than playing up to Hitler through appeasement, was now
                          required to advance the game. That ploy was called Winston Churchill.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">For
                          years Churchill had carefully cultivated the attentions of Moscow, as
                          Britain's most vocal opponent of appeasing Germany, through, among
                          others, London ambassador Ivan Maisky. Maisky apparently never quite
                          realized how he and Moscow were merely being maneuvered by the sly
                          Churchill, to lead the Soviet Union into a bloodbath with Germany, in
                          pursuit of British geopolitical strategy. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chamberlain had merely
                          represented another way to accomplish the same bloody goal, a
                          German-Soviet war, by playing to the German side against the Soviet
                          Union... </strong></span></span></p>

              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">...This <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia</strong></span></span> was not to
                      be found, so far as the evidence shows, among any members of the inner
                      circle of the Milner Group.  Rather it was<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> to be found among the
                      personal associates of Neville Chamberlain</strong></span></span>, including several members
                      of the second circle of the Milner Group...</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In order to<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> carry out this plan of allowing Germany to drive eastward
                      against Russia, it was necessary to do three things:</strong></span></span> </p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">(1) to liquidate
                      all the countries standing between Germany and Russia...</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html">http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html</a></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">...Accordingly, many of the appeasers, when this point was reached in
                      March 1938 went over to the anti-Bolshevik or "three-bloc" point of
                      view, while some even went into the "peace at any price" group.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">It is
                      likely that Chamberlain, Sir John Simon, and Sir Samuel Hoare went by
                      this road from appeasement to anti-Bolshevism. At any rate, few
                      influential people were still in the appeasement group by 1939 in the
                      sense that they believed that Germany could ever be satisfied. Once
                      this was realized,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> it seemed to many that the only solution was to
                      bring Germany into contact with, or even collision with, the Soviet
                      Union...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p><em>Correspondent: </em>What is the significance of the Treaty of Non-Aggression
                  Between the Soviet Union and Germany? </p>
              <p><em>Mao Tse-tung: </em>The Soviet-German non-aggression treaty is the result
                  of the growing socialist strength of the Soviet Union and the policy of peace
                  persistently followed by the Soviet government.</p>
              <p>The treaty has shattered
                  the intrigues by which the reactionary international <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bourgeoisie represented
                  by Chamberlain and Daladier sought to instigate a Soviet-German war</strong></span>, has
                  broken the encirclement of the Soviet Union by the German-Italian-Japanese
                  anti-Communist bloc, strengthened peace between the Soviet Union and Germany,
                  and safeguarded the progress of socialist construction in the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>In the East it deals a blow to Japan and helps China; it strengthens the
                  position of China's forces of resistance to Japan and deals a blow to the
                  capitulators. All this provides a basis for helping the people throughout
                  the world to win freedom and liberation. Such is the full political significance
                  of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty...</p>

              <p>Heath: I think the Soviet Union has a lot of troubles. They are facing domestic economic difficulties and agricultural predicament, and there are also differences within the leadership, over questions of tactics and timing, not over long-term strategy.<br><br>Mao: I think the Soviet Union is busy with its own affairs and unable to deal with Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, China and the Pacific. I think it will lose.<br><br>Heath: However, its military strength is continually augmented. Although the Soviet Union has encountered troubles at many places in the world, its strength is continuing to grow. Therefore, we deem this to be the principal threat. Does the Chairman think the Soviet Union constitutes a menace to China?<br><br>Mao: We are prepared for it to come, but it will collapse if it comes. It has only a handful of troops, and you Europeans are so frightened of it! Some people in the West are always trying to direct this calamity toward China. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your senior, Chamberlain, and also Daladier of France were the ones who pushed Germany eastward.</strong></span><br><br>Heath:<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I opposed Mr. Chamberlain then. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Neville Chamberlain schemed and plotted to let Hitler attack eastwards, wanted to set the Germans against the Russian, let the two finish each other off.</p>
              <p>It was the result of his policies that Hitler could go so far, sadly the british is very stubborn; refuses to admit the truth and is bent on distorting history.</p>
              <p>According to their bullshit dirty filthy propaganda, Chamberlain was only a moron, a fool to appease Hitler.</p>
              <p>This is a nonsense.</p>

[Laughter] To me this is a Great March. [Laughter].<br><br>Teng Hsiao-p’ing: Yes, and when I was on the Long March I walked <br>half the 25,000 li on foot; the other half was on the back of some <br>kind of animal, a horse or such. At that time the highest luxury <br>was to have one horse for each man.<br><br>Kissinger: I can imagine.<br><br>[The press leaves.]<br><br>Teng: So today we still have a bit of time left. Although it isn’t very<br>great, we still have the opportunity to have an exchange of views. Yesterday<br>we had the opportunity to exchange opinions with you on questions<br>pertaining to the international situation, policy and strategic. We<br>think the exchange of views was frank, and we feel that such an exchange<br>is beneficial for mutual understanding and also to the further<br>development of possible cooperation between our two sides.<br><br>Kissinger: I agree.<br><br>Teng: So as for the questions pertaining to strategy, we don’t have<br>anything new to say on our side. And if you have nothing new to say<br>on your side, then we can perhaps stop right here on that issue and<br>turn to something else. But if you wish to tell us anything on that or<br>any other position, you can tell us that.<br><br>Kissinger: I agree we have covered the issue of strategy and stated<br>the various approaches. I have listed the possible topics yesterday and<br>it is up to the Vice Premier what he thinks is most suitable.<br><br>Teng: And you have travelled the world several times in the past<br>year and we are willing to listen to whatever you would like to say to<br>us or whatever you think necessary to tell us, or whatever you find interesting<br>to have an exchange of views on. If you are interested, you<br>might begin with the southern flank of Europe.<br><br>Kissinger: All right. Mr. Habib would like me to try to convince<br>you to vote with us on the Korean question, but I don’t think I can do<br>that in one hour. [Laughter] He has approached everyone except the<br>Pope on that. [Laughter]<br><br>Well, on the southern flank of Europe, we have Portugal, Spain,<br>Italy, Greece and Turkey. Each presenting a different situation.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the case of Portugal, we find a situation where as a result of<br>forty years of authoritarian rule, the democratic forces are not well organized, and where the political structure is very weak.</strong></span></span> The military<br>have adopted some of the philosophy of African liberation movements,<br>which they fought for 25 years. And the Communist Party of Cunhal,<br>who spent his exile in Czechoslovakia—which is a curious place as a<br>choice of exile—is very much under the influence of the Soviet Union.<br>[Teng leans down beneath the table and spits into the spittoon beside<br>his chair.]<br><br>In this vacuum, the Communist Party that I described achieved<br>disproportionate influence, and for a while it seemed on the verge of<br>dominating the situation. I think this trend has been arrested. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And we<br>are working with our West European friends to strengthen the forces<br>that are opposed to Cunhal. Some of these forces unfortunately are better<br>at rhetoric than at organization. But we think that the situation has<br>improved, and we will continue to improve it.</strong></span></span><br><br>Teng: We heard recent news that some of the military officers formerly<br>under . . .<br><br>Chiao: . . . Gonçalves.<br><br>Teng: . . . <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>are prepared to stage a coup.</strong></span></span><br><br>Kissinger: Yes. We had a report this morning they refused to turn<br>over their weapons.<br><br>Teng: The news goes that they are preparing to do something on<br>the 11th of November which is the date of the independence of Angola.<br>News so specific as this can’t be reliable.<br><br>Kissinger: No, I don’t believe this. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We have the report that there<br>is one military unit that refuses to turn over its weapons. And there is<br>no question Gonçalves is on the side of the Soviet Union. But we hope<br>. . . We have been in touch with a number of other military leaders and<br>we would certainly not approve such a coup and we will certainly oppose<br>it.</strong></span></span><br><br>Teng: But it is in our view that Portugal will see many reversals.<br><br>Kissinger: I agree.<br><br>Teng: And many trials of strength.<br>We are not in a position to do anything else in that part of the<br>world. There is one thing that we have done. They have approached<br>us many times for the establishment of diplomatic relations, which we<br>have not agreed to. Our point of departure is very simple: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That is, we<br>do not want to do anything that would be helpful to any Soviet forces<br>gaining the upper hand.</strong></span></span><br><br>Kissinger: I think that is a very wise policy. We support Antunes<br>and Soares. [Teng leans down and spits again.] Antunes was in Washington<br>a few weeks ago and we are cooperating with him. But I agree<br>with you that there will be many trials of strength. And the difficulty<br>of our West European friends is they relax after a temporary success.<br>When we come back here in December, we will see the situation<br>more clearly. But we are determined to resist a Soviet takeover there,<br>even if it leads to armed conflict. It will not go easily.<br><br>I mean, if they are planning a coup it will not be easy for them.<br>Now in Spain, the situation is more complicated. We have on the one<br>hand a regime on its last legs, because Franco is very old. But on the<br>other hand we do not want to repeat the situation of Portugal in Spain.<br>We have been approached on a number of occasions by the Spanish<br>Communist Party, but we consider it is controlled from Moscow.<br>What is your assessment?<br><br>Teng: There are contradictions between the Spanish Communist<br>Party and the Soviet Union. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the revisionist Communist parties<br>in Europe it can be said that the contradictions between the Spanish<br>Communist Party and the Dutch Communist Party and the Soviet<br>Union are comparatively deeper.</strong></span></span><br><br>Kissinger: We have been negotiating a continuation of our base<br>agreement with Spain, as you know. We will probably conclude this<br>agreement within the next six weeks. We do this because we do not<br>believe a shrinkage of American security interests in the Mediterranean<br>is in the security interest of the world. [Teng spits again] Together with<br>this, we are planning to set up a number of committees in the cultural<br>and economic fields so that in the case of a new situation we have organic<br>contacts with many levels of Spanish life.<br><br>Ch’iao: You mean after the regime is handed over to [Juan] Carlos?<br><br>Kissinger: Yes. We are setting up committees now in connection<br>with the base agreement so that when Franco leaves we will not have<br>to start, as we did in Portugal, looking around for contacts. We will<br>have this infrastructure.<br><br>Teng: It is our impression that the influence of the Spanish revisionist<br>party is not so deep as that of the Portuguese in the armed<br>forces. I don’t know whether your understanding would be the same.<br><br>Kissinger: One reason we need this base agreement is to stay in<br>contact with the Spanish military. Our assessment is at the higher levels<br>there is very little impact of what you call this revisionist party. At<br>the lower levels, we have had some reports they are doing some<br>recruiting.<br><br>Teng: The lowest levels do not play such a great role.</p>
              <p>Kissinger: We have heard at the level of Captains. But at the commanding<br>levels their influence can’t be compared with the Portuguese<br>situation.<br><br>Teng: But a captain is a very important man in African forces<br>[laughter] but perhaps not so in Europe.<br><br>Kissinger: Not quite so in Europe. [Laughter]<br><br>Teng: What is your impression of the Spanish Prince?<br><br>Ch’iao: Carlos.<br><br>Kissinger:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> He is a nice man. Naive. He doesn’t understand revolution<br>and doesn’t understand what he will face. He thinks he can do<br>it with good will.</strong></span></span> But his intentions are good. He’s a nice man. I don’t<br>think he is strong enough to manage events by himself.<br><br>Teng: We heard that Franco was going to hand over power to him.<br><br>Kissinger: We hear that every six months. But Mrs. Franco likes<br>the palace too much to leave. [Laughter]<br><br>Teng: He must be in his 80’s by now.<br><br>Kissinger: Yes, and not very active. In fact, he has a tendency to<br>fall asleep while you are talking to him. [Laughter] I’ve been there with<br>two Presidents, and he has fallen asleep both times. In fact, he had—<br>when I was there with President Nixon—a hypnotic effect. I saw him<br>falling asleep, so I fell asleep. So the only two people awake were President<br>Nixon and the Spanish Foreign Minister. [Laughter]<br>No, it would be better if he handed over the power.<br><br>Teng: What do you think of Yugoslavia?<br><br>Kissinger: We are concerned about Yugoslavia. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We are concerned<br>that a number of things could happen after Tito’s death. There could<br>be a separatist movement from some of the provinces. There could be<br>a split within the Yugoslav Communist Party. Both of these could be<br>supported by the Soviet Union. And there could be Soviet military<br>intervention.</strong></span></span><br><br>Teng: During the recent visit of the Yugoslav Prime Minister Mr.<br>Bijedic, we gained from what he said, although in different words, that<br>they are also quite worried about such matters themselves.<br><br>Kissinger:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In Montenegro—you know this—they discovered Soviet<br>activities within the country.</strong></span></span><br><br>Teng: Yes, but then they were able to find out about all these espionage<br>activities and do something to end these activities.<br><br>Kissinger: Yes, but it shows the tendency of Soviet policy.<br><br>Teng: Indeed.<br><br>Kissinger: We are very interested in the independence and independent<br>policy of Yugoslavia. And you have noticed that in the last<br>year both the President and I have paid separate visits to Yugoslavia.<br>And we are going to begin selling them military equipment within the<br>next few weeks.<br><br>Teng: That will be very good. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You must know that this nation is a<br>very militant one.</strong></span></span> Although there are some contradictions among the<br>various nationalities. And it seems to me that one of their relatively<br>strong points is that they are comparatively clear-minded about the situation<br>they face.<br><br>Kissinger: Yes. They will certainly fight if there is an invasion.<br><br>Teng: We have also posed this question to our European friends.<br>That is, if there occurs a Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia, what will happen?<br>And they felt that this was a difficult issue. And perhaps a similar<br>question will confront you. Of course I do not ask you for an answer<br>now. [They laugh.]<br><br>Kissinger: No, I can give you an answer. It is a difficult question.<br>It is politically a difficult question and it’s strategically a difficult question.<br>We are now doing some military planning for this contingency. I<br>can tell you this—you can keep secrets; I am not so convinced about<br>all of my colleagues [laughter]—we have asked General Haig, in his<br>capacity as American Commander, to do some planning.<br><br>T’ang: About Yugoslavia?<br><br>Kissinger: Yes. [There is some commotion on the Chinese side.]<br><br>Teng: The Chairman will be prepared to meet you at 6:30. [The<br>Secretary and Ambassador Bush exchange glances.] So, what . . . you<br>are in a dilemma about your program [because of Ambassador Bush’s<br>reception for the Secretary scheduled for the International Club].<br><br>Kissinger: No. He [Bush] has a dilemma. I would be delighted.<br><br>T’ang: How many people would you be prepared to take with you?<br><br>Kissinger: The Ambassador, Mr. Lord . . .<br><br>Wang: Would your wife be going?<br><br>Kissinger: Has she been invited?<br><br>Wang: It is up to you.<br><br>Teng: We are willing to listen to your request or your opinion. It<br>is up to you to suggest whom you would like to take on your side and<br>whom you would like participating in the meeting and whom you<br>would like to have shake hands.<br><br>Kissinger: Then I think . . . Can everyone here shake hands, and<br>my wife? And then for the meeting Ambassador Bush, Mr. Lord, and<br>Mr. Habib.<br><br>Teng: You mean all those seated here and your wife?<br><br>Kissinger: Yes, if you can find my wife. [Laughter] She’s probably<br>out shopping.<br><br>T’ang: We will try to find her.<br><br>Kissinger: If you can find her, it will save me a lot of money.<br>[Laughter]<br><br>T’ang: So she is in the shops now?<br><br>[The Secretary discusses with Sonnenfeldt where she might be or<br>whether she will have departed for the reception.]<br><br>Kissinger: Maybe we can still catch her.<br><br>[Wang Hai-jung goes out.]<br><br>Teng: So perhaps we can continue for about 15 minutes, and then<br>perhaps you can make various preparations. [He spits into his spittoon.]<br>Kissinger: What I have said to you about military preparations<br>with respect to Yugoslavia is known only to the top leaders of three<br>European governments. Schmidt knows about it, of course. But it is a<br>very complicated problem logistically. Because our best means of entering<br>is through Italy and that is logistically very difficult. We can perhaps<br>talk about this again when we come back in a few weeks.<br><br>Teng: Yes, and recently Italy has returned the B Zone of Trieste to<br>Yugoslavia. We believe this is quite good.<br><br>Kissinger: Yes.<br><br>[Nancy T’ang gets up to leave. Mrs. Shih moves to the table.]<br><br>Shih: She is going to make some preparations. I will take her place.<br><br>Teng: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So long as they have weapons in their hands, the Yugoslavs<br>will fight.</strong></span></span><br><br>Kissinger: We think so too. But as I said, we are starting in a few<br>weeks to sell them some anti-tank weapons, and some other equipment.<br><br>Teng: We are thinking that in that area the main problem is conventional<br>weapons and not nuclear weapons.<br><br>Kissinger: That is correct. Though any conflict that involves us and<br>the Soviet Union is very complicated. It is bound to involve nuclear<br>threats anyway. But the weapons we are selling to Yugoslavia are conventional<br>weapons.<br><br>Teng:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> If the Soviet Union can control Yugoslavia, then the chessboard<br>of Soviet strategy in Europe will become alive. The next will be<br>Romania and Albania.</strong></span></span><br><br>Kissinger: If the Soviet Union can get away with a military move<br>on Yugoslavia, we will face a very grave situation. [Teng nods emphatically<br>in agreement.] Which will require serious countermeasures.<br><br>Teng: For that not only involves military strategy; it will also have<br>a very serious political influence. Its impact at least will spread to the<br>whole of the southern flank.<br><br>Kissinger: I think that is correct. It will affect Italy and Germany,<br>and France.<br><br>Teng: Also the Mediterranean. And the Middle East.<br><br>Kissinger: If this happens, whatever we do in Yugoslavia—which<br>depends on the circumstances in which things develop—will lead to a<br>very serious situation. We would not accept it. It will lead at least to<br>serious countermeasures. It will not be like Czechoslovakia.<br>[Teng glances at his watch.]<br>What is your view on the Italian situation?<br><br>Teng: Well, one can hardly see the trend of the development of the<br>situation in Italy. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To us, it is all blank. We don’t know how to look at<br>the situation. Perhaps you know more clearly.</strong></span></span><br><br>Kissinger: Perhaps the Foreign Minister should stop on the way<br>back from the UN to call on the Pope. Gromyko was there a few weeks<br>ago. [Laughter]<br><br>Teng: Really?<br><br>Kissinger: Actually you could be helpful in Italy, we think. At least<br>with some of the Socialists. The Christian Democratic Party has very<br>weak leadership. [They nod in agreement.] Their Prime Minister, Moro,<br>also has a tendency to fall asleep when you meet him. [Laughter]<br><br>Teng: They change their Prime Ministers several times in a year. I<br>don’t know how many times since the War.<br><br>Kissinger: Yes, but it’s always the same group. But the ruling group<br>of the Christian Democratic Party is not very disciplined.<br>We totally oppose what is called in Italy the “historic compromise.”<br>We do not give visas to Italian Communists to come to the United States.<br>[Secretary Kissinger and Mr. Sonnenfeldt confer.]<br><br>Teng: In my view the so-called “historic compromise” cannot<br>succeed.<br><br>Kissinger: Well, it can succeed, but it will lead to a disaster for the<br>non-Communist parties.<br>I’ve just been handed a telegram that they have put a Communist<br>into an Italian Parliamentary delegation that is coming to Washington,<br>that we didn’t select.<br>But that is a secondary issue. We will totally oppose it.<br><br>Teng: We think, with regard to the situation in Italy, where our two<br>sides differ is that we don’t attach so much importance to whether the<br>Communist Party of Italy gets the power. It is not significant.<br><br>Kissinger: No, it is of importance because it will have an effect on<br>France and even in the Federal Republic. And it is of significance to<br>the support that America can give to NATO if there is a government<br>there with a large Communist Party in the government.<br><br>Teng: [Laughs] Such a so-called “historic compromise” was once<br>effected by the French. That was shortly after the War, when De Gaulle<br>was in power. He let the Communist Party of France take part in the<br>government, and Thorez was in power.<br><br>Kissinger: But that was in a totally different situation. At that time<br>they were declining, and not increasing.<br><br>Teng: The French Communist Party got several seats in the French<br>Cabinet. One of them was the Minister of the Air Force, who was a<br>Communist. [He laughs.] The decision to bomb Algeria was made by<br>this man exactly. This we call their “performance on the stage.”<br>Shall we end our talk here today? And prepare to meet the<br>Chairman?<br><br>Kissinger: Can we leave from here?<br><br>Teng: Yes. We can take a short rest.<br><br>Kissinger: Okay.<br><br>Teng: But we will leave from here directly and meet you there.<br>[The meeting ended. The American party moved to another room<br>to await Mrs. Kissinger, who arrived shortly, and then to depart for<br>Changnanhai for the meeting with Chairman Mao Tsetung.]</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>According to some writer's interpretation, Churchill also schemed to get into the position of Prime Minister:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">...On news the Germans had reached Narvik before British ships could leave harbor, Churchill was unperturbed. He told cabinet colleagues, including Prime Minister Chamberlain, that the German occupation, "should not be on terms unfavorable to us," insisting that England was, "in a far better position than we had been to date."</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In reality it was Churchill who was in the far better position. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That was, in position to replace Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister.</strong></span></span> Churchill's deliberate chaotic bungling of the plans for a Norway invasion had led Chamberlain to assume personal day-to-day responsibility for the Norwegian operation. He had been asked to do so, in a calculated appeal, by Churchill. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From that point, the trap had been set against Chamberlain as well.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The conduct of the British campaign against Norway was ludicrous, and Churchill was directly responsible for the disaster. He personally countered orders of the military chiefs of staff, without even informing them. He sent troops of the 24th Guards brigade by boat, without artillery, engineers or transport, with orders to capture Narvik, after it had been firmly secured by German forces...</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">...When it became obvious that he must step down, Chamberlain sought to put the name of his Foreign Minister, Lord Halifax, to the King as his successor, a move which Halifax, the leading Round Table figure in the Cabinet, deftly declined in favor of Churchill.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">On May 10, just in the hours the German Wehrmacht launched the blitzkrieg against Holland and Belgium, Churchill was called by the King to form a new government.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Winston Spencer Churchill, then 66, had been promoted by the Round Table at that critical juncture, not because he especially appreciated the need to mobilize Britain for war against Germany, though this was a necessary precondition; nor because he was pragmatic enough, contrary to Chamberlain, to be willing to strike an alliance with Stalin to defeat Hitler, though this was also a necessary precondition.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Churchill was chosen, above all, because the chief aim of Round Table policy <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>was the clash between Russia and Germany. That, in order to draw the United States into the war their geopolitics had brought about. Chamberlain's role in setting Germany against Russia had exhausted its usefulness, once the secret German-Soviet Friendship Treaty had been signed.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">A new ploy, other than playing up to Hitler through appeasement, was now required to advance the game. That ploy was called Winston Churchill.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">For years Churchill had carefully cultivated the attentions of Moscow, as Britain's most vocal opponent of appeasing Germany, through, among others, London ambassador Ivan Maisky. Maisky apparently never quite realized how he and Moscow were merely being maneuvered by the sly Churchill, to lead the Soviet Union into a bloodbath with Germany, in pursuit of British geopolitical strategy. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chamberlain had merely represented another way to accomplish the same bloody goal, a German-Soviet war, by playing to the German side against the Soviet Union...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/History/MacKinder/mackinder.html">http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/History/MacKinder</a></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">...This <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia</strong></span></span> was not to be found, so far as the evidence shows, among any members of the inner circle of the Milner Group.  Rather it was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to be found among the personal associates of Neville Chamberlain</strong></span></span>, including several members of the second circle of the Milner Group...</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In order to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>carry out this plan of allowing Germany to drive eastward against Russia, it was necessary to do three things:</strong></span></span> </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">(1) to liquidate all the countries standing between Germany and Russia...</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html">http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html</a></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">...Accordingly, many of the appeasers, when this point was reached in March 1938 went over to the anti-Bolshevik or "three-bloc" point of view, while some even went into the "peace at any price" group.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">It is likely that Chamberlain, Sir John Simon, and Sir Samuel Hoare went by this road from appeasement to anti-Bolshevism. At any rate, few influential people were still in the appeasement group by 1939 in the sense that they believed that Germany could ever be satisfied. Once this was realized, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it seemed to many that the only solution was to bring Germany into contact with, or even collision with, the Soviet Union...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p><em>Correspondent:</em> What is the significance of the Treaty of Non-Aggression Between the Soviet Union and Germany? </p>
              <p><em>Mao Tse-tung:</em> The Soviet-German non-aggression treaty is the result of the growing socialist strength of the Soviet Union and the policy of peace persistently followed by the Soviet government.</p>
              <p>The treaty has shattered the intrigues by which the reactionary international <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bourgeoisie represented by Chamberlain and Daladier sought to instigate a Soviet-German war</strong></span>, has broken the encirclement of the Soviet Union by the German-Italian-Japanese anti-Communist bloc, strengthened peace between the Soviet Union and Germany, and safeguarded the progress of socialist construction in the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>In the East it deals a blow to Japan and helps China; it strengthens the position of China's forces of resistance to Japan and deals a blow to the capitulators. All this provides a basis for helping the people throughout the world to win freedom and liberation. Such is the full political significance of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty...</p>

              <p>Heath: I think the Soviet Union has a lot of troubles. They are facing domestic economic difficulties and agricultural predicament, and there are also differences within the leadership, over questions of tactics and timing, not over long-term strategy.<br><br>Mao: I think the Soviet Union is busy with its own affairs and unable to deal with Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, China and the Pacific. I think it will lose.<br><br>Heath: However, its military strength is continually augmented. Although the Soviet Union has encountered troubles at many places in the world, its strength is continuing to grow. Therefore, we deem this to be the principal threat. Does the Chairman think the Soviet Union constitutes a menace to China?<br><br>Mao: We are prepared for it to come, but it will collapse if it comes. It has only a handful of troops, and you Europeans are so frightened of it! Some people in the West are always trying to direct this calamity toward China. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your senior, Chamberlain, and also Daladier of France were the ones who pushed Germany eastward.</strong></span><br><br>Heath: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I opposed Mr. Chamberlain then.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Neville Chamberlain schemed and plotted to let Hitler attack eastwards, wanted to set the Germans against the Russian, let the two finish each other off.</p>
              <p>It was the result of his policies that Hitler could go so far, sadly the british is very stubborn; refuses to admit the truth and is bent on distorting history.</p>
              <p>According to their bullshit dirty filthy propaganda, Chamberlain was only a moron, a fool to appease Hitler.</p>
              <p>This is a nonsense.</p>

              <p>For all that it is worth - it remains to be "<em>some writer's interpretation</em>" - of past events that he was not even a participant living through that historical period.</p>
              <p>Anyone can interprete the events, and no one can stop anyone from accepting the presented idea - "hook, sinker, and line".</p>
              <p>It still does not bring any shine to Mao's damaged image when he live pass his time of being relevant in China's history.</p>
