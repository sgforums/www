              <p>Any careful and astute observer of Singapore's political scene will
              notice that Singaporeans still lack maturity with regards to political
              issues and need to be carefully guided in their thinking.</p>
              <p>Our
              restless generation, especially the youth, seem to be clamouring for
              more freedom of speech and expression in all areas of life, including
              the political front. They like to cite these as part of so-called
              "civil liberties". But with freedom comes grave responsibility. That is
              what the youth of today are lacking in.</p>
              <p>The PAP government (may
              the PAP progress!) has created a nation of peace, prosperity, economic
              progress, and racial and religious harmony. This has not come easy.
              Anyone who is in government knows that the process of nation building
              is a slow, tedious process that is incredibly hard. We are where we are
              today because of the tireless and selfless dedication of the men and
              women in office, many of whom have made monumental sacrifices to take
              the lead and bear the immense burden of public office. To these men and
              women we should be sincerely grateful.</p>
              <p>However many of the
              present generation are unaware of how we got to be where we are, and
              the kind of work and sacrifice it takes to keep our nation running.
              Many folk like to view events and government policies in isolation,
              randomly criticizing them, without reflecting upon the bigger picture.
              People today only seem to just want more and more -- more money, more
              handouts, less taxes, less obligations, more free space, more free
              speech -- without taking into account the needs of tomorrow. This is
              truly irresponsible.</p>
              <p>The present day generation, especially our
              youth, must learn to appreciate the soundness of our government's
              policies, and recognize the fact that the government is not afraid to
              enact policies for the long term good of our nation, and not pander to
              the short term whims of the electorate. Mindless criticism of the
              government and its policies without considering the long term good of
              our nation is only going to be counterproductive. The government
              devotes all its resources and capabilities, and deploys the best brains
              we have towards researching the best policies for our nation, policies
              that will serve all Singaporeans through thick and thin. Singaporeans
              would do well to recognize this.</p>
              <p>While cyberspace and the
              internet serves as a medium for Singaporeans to express their views and
              thoughts freely, Singaporeans should be mindful that with free speech
              comes responsibility -- responsibility to their nation, to their
              community, and to themselves ultimately. Singaporeans must learn to use
              their freedoms on the internet wisely, and not abuse them, like so many
              people are wantonly doing these days. The internet, unfortunately, has
              frequently become a hodge-podge of thoughtless and irresponsible
              anti-government propaganda. This is indeed regrettable. It is my
              sincere hope that Singaporeans can recognize the grave mistake they are
              committing. Their thoughtless and mindless anti-government propaganda
              is only going to sabotage the efforts of the government in the long run
              in building a better and freer Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP (may the PAP
              progress!) is still today the best possible party to lead our nation
              further into the 21st century. Their ranks are filled with capable men
              and women of honour and integrity, and their leadership renewal is in
              progress. Instead of mindlessly bickering about being affected by
              inevitable circumstances such as rising prices or the need to plan and
              save for a longer retirement, let us instead close ranks and support
              the one party in Singapore that will lead our nation from strength to
              strength, and serve the interests of all Singaporeans to the fullest.
              Let us support the PAP.</p>
              <p>Majulah PAP! Majulah Singapura!</p>

              <p>Mr Goh,</p>
              <p>We are not as greedy as you think.</p>
              <p>We are asking for more transparency, so that we can start trusting them again.</p>
              <p>We are asking our leaders to not close their ears and eyes to the plight of the people.</p>
              <p>We are asking for more accountability from the gahmen to fellow Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Is that too much to ask ? Isn't that what a good gahmen should be doing anyway ?</p>
              <p>You think our hearts don't bleed for the poor and struggling middle income families ?</p>
              <p>You think our hearts don't bleed for the many who fall through the gaping holes within our welfare webing  ?</p>
              <p>You think our hearts don't bleed for the old and disease striken who cannot find themselves a job because our gahmen couldn't come up with some policies to protect them against discrimination ? Do they have to become beggars because of their plight ? NO !</p>
              <p>There are so much they could have done.. but instead of addressing the issues, they simply chuck us aside. Bigger picture ? They couldn't even paint a nice smaller picture.. what bigger picture ? Yah lah.. a  LOUSY bigger picture lor.</p>
              <p>Do they have to strip the people of their pride and dignity before help can be offered to them ?</p>
              <p>Yes yes.. we must all try to see far far.. see ahead lah. But don't you know it's the nearest stone that's gonna trip you over ? Can don't be so mindless anot ?</p>
              <p>How can we not gripe about it ?<br> You know how to solve a problem ? By sweeping them under the carpet ? I hope not.</p>
              <p>Stop telling our grandfather stories.. we're not living in their era.</p>

              <p>"The PAP government (may the PAP progress!) has created a nation of peace, prosperity, economic progress, and racial and religious harmony. This has not come easy. Anyone who is in government knows that the process of nation building is a slow, tedious process that is incredibly hard. We are where we are today because of the tireless and selfless dedication of the men and women in office, many of whom have made monumental sacrifices to take the lead and bear the immense burden of public office. To these men and women we should be sincerely grateful."</p>

              <p>It is because of constant selfish agendas to serve the government own purposes that we have had too much problems with the people ranging from greed to over-protective policies to succeed in building surpluses at the expense of the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We need new people uninfluenced by such past selfish policies to move forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we can find another Lim Kim San or Dr. Goh Keng Swee and people with passions and practical abilities to restructure and remake the governing of the nation to be more proactive and pro-people to bring about change to past selfish policies of the current government we should always try to give such people the chance to assume higher position of responsibility.<br><br>Such people of ability are often more reserved, modest but willing to work passionately for the people with little or no pay. I for one hope we can spot such people and welcome such practical talents who like Bill Gates or Sim Wong Hoo are often excluded due to over-emphasis on academic ability or positions or status.<br><br>I have known of ordinary MCST and unsung heros which brought about major progress and great benefits to their respective organizations by lowering costs and the high management fees from $1.00 per share pm to $0.20 per share pm during recessions despite the government ministers constantly refusing to lower taxes and costs in every service and ministry even as it is increasing yet again all taxes to hoard more monies for its own selfish purpose.</p>
