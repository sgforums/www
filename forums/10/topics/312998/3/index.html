              <p>Singapore defence budget is US$5 billion per year, as compared to malaysia's US$2.5bn/.</p>
              <p>Our army is smaller, and we pay our NSF peanuts. do we really need so much money for defence?  defence is important, but surely the government is able to fork out 20-50million per year to provide welfare money for our elderly age 85 and above,instead of asking them to contribute money into a money trap, in which nothing is left to us descendents , when you see the father passing on his weath and power to his son and daughter-in-law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is it too much to ask for state welfare for citizens age 85 and above. not many can live that long anyway. either that, or their savings run out before they reach 85 years of age. it would be proper showing of respect for our elders to look forward to, and live a relatively carefree life, as compared to now, with them having tio go around scavenging on drink cans and cardboard like some beggars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it would be sad fior a numbver 1 country in everything to neglect on the welfare and living conditions of the elders who work so hard to make singapore what singapore is today.</p>

              <p>Any careful and astute observer of Singapore's political scene
              will notice that Singaporeans still lack maturity with regards to
              political issues and need to be carefully guided in their
              thinking.</p>
              <p>Our restless generation, especially the youth, seem to be
              clamouring for more freedom of speech and expression in all areas
              of life, including the political front. They like to cite these as
              part of so-called "civil liberties". But with freedom comes grave
              responsibility. That is what the youth of today are lacking in.</p>
              <p>The PAP government (may the PAP progress!) has created a nation
              of peace, prosperity, economic progress, and racial and religious
              harmony. This has not come easy. Anyone who is in government knows
              that the process of nation building is a slow, tedious process that
              is incredibly hard. We are where we are today because of the
              tireless and selfless dedication of the men and women in office,
              many of whom have made monumental sacrifices to take the lead and
              bear the immense burden of public office. To these men and women we
              should be sincerely grateful.</p>
              <p>However many of the present generation are unaware of how we got
              to be where we are, and the kind of work and sacrifice it takes to
              keep our nation running. Many folk like to view events and
              government policies in isolation, randomly criticizing them,
              without reflecting upon the bigger picture. People today only seem
              to just want more and more -- more money, more handouts, less
              taxes, less obligations, more free space, more free speech --
              without taking into account the needs of tomorrow. This is truly
              irresponsible.</p>
              <p>The present day generation, especially our youth, must learn to
              appreciate the soundness of our government's policies, and
              recognize the fact that the government is not afraid to enact
              policies for the long term good of our nation, and not pander to
              the short term whims of the electorate. Mindless criticism of the
              government and its policies without considering the long term good
              of our nation is only going to be counterproductive. The government
              devotes all its resources and capabilities, and deploys the best
              brains we have towards researching the best policies for our
              nation, policies that will serve all Singaporeans through thick and
              thin. Singaporeans would do well to recognize this.</p>
              <p>While cyberspace and the internet serves as a medium for
              Singaporeans to express their views and thoughts freely,
              Singaporeans should be mindful that with free speech comes
              responsibility -- responsibility to their nation, to their
              community, and to themselves ultimately. Singaporeans must learn to
              use their freedoms on the internet wisely, and not abuse them, like
              so many people are wantonly doing these days. The internet,
              unfortunately, has frequently become a hodge-podge of thoughtless
              and irresponsible anti-government propaganda. This is indeed
              regrettable. It is my sincere hope that Singaporeans can recognize
              the grave mistake they are committing. Their thoughtless and
              mindless anti-government propaganda is only going to sabotage the
              efforts of the government in the long run in building a better and
              freer Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP (may the PAP progress!) is still today the best possible
              party to lead our nation further into the 21st century. Their ranks
              are filled with capable men and women of honour and integrity, and
              their leadership renewal is in progress. Instead of mindlessly
              bickering about being affected by inevitable circumstances such as
              rising prices or the need to plan and save for a longer retirement,
              let us instead close ranks and support the one party in Singapore
              that will lead our nation from strength to strength, and serve the
              interests of all Singaporeans to the fullest. Let us support the
              PAP.</p>
              <p>Majulah PAP! Majulah Singapura!</p>
