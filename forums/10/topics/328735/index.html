              <p>Do we have to have British or American accents to consider as good english? Ang-mohs (those that I deal with) think that we have good command of english, esp written... they said that we have good grammar... but we speak too fast for them to understand.</p>

              <p>ya, try to speak like angmoh Singaporean will find you guai guai, angmoh still won't understand.</p>
              <p>avoid missing english with dialects, malays and speak slowly, most angmoh will understand us.</p>
              <p>Many angmohs are actually non native english speaking, more so we need to speak slowly.</p>
              <p>But a friend of mine always remind me, angmoh is surprised when we could speak such good english, but they are more surprised when they realised many of us couldn't speak our mother tongue. You chinese can't speak chinese, what about cantonese? alamah....why like that?</p>
              <p>Language is only part of communication, the other part is your body language, sincere? smiling? act to help? this is more important now when they outsource all telephone answering to India.</p>

              <p>I always think that Chinese language education in Singapore almost died in his hand, but then he sent his children all to Chinese Schools, LHL, LHY to Catholic High and his daughter to Nanyang.

              <p>It is always a good experience when you accompanied angmoh to China. You decide when you are chinese to the angmoh, and you are foreigner to the chinese.</p>
