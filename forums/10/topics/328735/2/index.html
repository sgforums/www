              <p><br>Fully agree! ever ask a French colleague why can't we discuss French culture in English, "French language is our culture!" I shut up, very shy.</p>
              <p>Yes, the Englishmen now insist that the american speaks american, not english or an adulterated english language. they are now more conscious of their english culture. But unfortunately they colonised the indian subcontinent and the indians in UK are adulterating the english in the land of the Queen.</p>
              <p>That is the reason why many Singaporean feel empty, try to find the Singaporean culture but cannot find. chinese cannot be malay even if you accept islam and call yourself Mohamad. call yourselves Jonathan Wilson Chen still won't be acknowledged as a lao wai.</p>
              <p>Singapore is too young to have our own culture developed. Singlish is a good start. It is a unique Singaporean identify, I will keep it.</p>

              <p>How LKY and Low Thia Khiang speak is directly connected to their upbringing and how they were educated. One comes from a primarily English speaking background while the other was education in a Chinese environment. Hence whether one speaks with a slight English accent and the other in a Teochew accented English is not really intentional.</p>
              <p>So, please, to those who are already bias towards one person, at least be objective in this observation. I am in no way implying that one language of education is superior to another.</p>
              <p>Back to the topic: What then is GOOD English? I don't think the intent is to say that spoken English has to carry an accent of another country.</p>
              <p>Language in itself is dynamic - as long as the person listening to you is able to make up what you are saying, it can be deemed that communication has taken place, regardless of whether good or bad English is spoken.</p>
              <p>But to broaden the argument - what is GOOD English when we are dealing with other people beyond your circle of influence? Actually it is no different from the previous paragraph.</p>
              <p>However, taking into context the level of language prowess among our people, I don't think it is wrong to state that many Singapores do not speak GOOD English because foreigners may not understand what we are saying....</p>
              <p>It goes beyond accent - it goes into the jargons, the colloqualism, the patois etc. Many people are not able to remove these when communicating, hence the chances of beind misunderstood or not understood is very high.</p>
              <p>I know these for a fact because I work with foreigners either here or their home country. And when I communicate, I have to ensure that my language is crisp, precise, and clear.</p>

              <p>Hypothetically speaking, if someone who was brought up in a all-Cantonese speaking environment, and being billingual, this person speaks good English (i.e. no "lah", "leh" , "lor", etc.).  Would you agree that a westerner will find it difficult to make out the words that this person is speaking? ... He will be replacing "R" sounds with "L", most of the time... e.g. "I like to lun in the morning... and then lide my bicycle to wok"...</p>

              <p>Anyone trained under the Singapore public school system will naturally pick up the singlish style of speaking.</p>
              <p>The reason for that is due to the way language is taught to school children at a young age.</p>
              <p>Two languages are taught at an early age, with the child being bombarded with vocabulary from two languages, one being english, the other mother tongue.</p>
              <p>The emphasis in the Singapore school system is on english language, since it is the medium of instruction in teaching maths, science etc, and not mother tongue.</p>
              <p>The effects of such early bombardment of two languages on children is the result of "singlish".</p>
              <p>Meaning rojak language, since two languages is taught at the same time to a child.</p>
              <p>In other school systems, only one language is taught, so the child from the beginning has a good grasp of the language, without confusion from another language being taught at the same time.</p>
              <p>This can be seen in the Taiwan school system, where their grasp of mandarin is far better than the average Singaporean.</p>
