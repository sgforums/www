              <p>I pity you, because you either have some problem with Peranakans or your hatred for Lee Kuan Yew has blinded you to the fact that he is one and did not learn Mandarin or speak it at home when he was young.</p>
              <p>Kids in other countries also learn 2 languages or more in school when they are small, and many are effectively multilingual. Some can speak and write English better than chavs from GB.</p>
              <p>I think the trouble is with kids who speak broken English at home, and then bring it to their social spheres. It is a lot easier to pick up a language from scratch than to unlearn flawed structures that one is used to. Singlish then becomes a way of communicating with everyone from different backgrounds, because it incorporates words from other languages AND their sentence structures (even if they are unsound).</p>
              <p>I'm not sure about Tamil, but I had difficulties learning Mandarin because one can't pronounce the characters or derive their meanings just by looking at them. It's more abstract in that sense to one who comes from an English-speaking home. On the other hand I found it more straightfoward to read German and adjust the sentence structure accordingly. That is just my experience.</p>
              <p>Our language education could provide better grounding (and don't just bring in foreigners to teach without ensuring that the standards of other teachers subsequently rise), but having said that, when we have a good mix of kids from different ethnic and home backgrounds, we have a harder task than more homogenous societies.</p>
              <p>We have to let go of the habit of championing people who can switch between both Singlish and standard English, because not everyone has the ability to switch codes or a firm grasp in the latter or the sensitivity to be able to do so. And yes, please drop the false accents and the bombastic sentences if that is what one thinks good English is about.</p>

              <p>Peranakans and the Chinese "helicoptor" are the result of the circumstances of the past. correct me if I am wrong about Peranakans, the true peranakans were chinese who married local girls and they spoke Malay and Hokkien. Chinese who went back to China to get married continued to speak only Chinese dialects.</p>
              <p>The use of English came in when Peranakans and Chinese went to English schools set up by the British government. And some Chinese continued to study in Chinese schools set up by the chinese community. The diversion among the Chinese is therefore not among the Peranakans and others, it is between the English educated and the Chinese educated. Many peranakans I know continue to speak Hokkien at home, and their observance of Chinese traditions and culture is even more strongly rooted than many other Chinese.</p>
              <p>Unlike Taiwan and Hong Kong Chinese immigrants, Singapore Chinese immigrants did not come from educated families, most of our ancestors were very very poor farmers, mainly from the poor southern China. any child who went to english school will go home and speak with their parents in dialect, how to learn english at home? got money to let you tuck che, jin ho liao. If the children continued their english education till O level, last time level 9, gao ho, you can become government officers liao, then you can continue to speak english. If you stop at primary six and go back to help your parents, or flunk during secondary school, then you use the little english you learned, the balance substituted with hokkien...hence singlish. These people represents a much larger segment of the society, compared to those who learned proper english.</p>
              <p>the important thing about singlish is that we speak english when we think in chinese, "you go where", "wait lah" are Chinese sentence structure.</p>
              <p>The difference between Chinese language and english, or german, french is the origins of these languages. Chinese language developed from oracle, the shape of the words tell the meaning. So you have the word èˆ¹ï¼Œmade up of a sampan èˆŸ, with eight persons å…«å�£, very much in line with the history of Noah recorded in the Bible. German and English are originated from Latin, hence you find much more similarity between the two languages. If you learn Japanese and Korean, you will also find it a lot easy if you know Chinese.</p>
              <p>I am glad that today there is no distinct Chinese and English educated, but we have Singaporeans who know both English and Chinese, but good at neither. When I auntie told me my nephew, who scored A in Chinese, said to the waiter "ä½ ä¸�ç»™å¸�å�•ï¼Œæˆ‘æ€Žæ ·èµ”é’±ã€‚"" You don't give me the bill how do I pay money?" we have problem.</p>
              <p>what to do and where to go from here, I really don't know. I only ask my kids to study well in both languages and if possible, they should spend sometime in China and UK, or may be america, for a short period of time, exchange program, may be, to feel the language environment. After that what they learn and speak, I really don't know.</p>

              <p>Cantonese is the only dialect group I know who treasure their dialect. Almost all the Cantonese I know are like you, continue to speak fluent cantonese while using  English as your dominant language for work and business. Many other dialect groups have given up their dialect in trying to speak good English.</p>

              <p>"Its singlish which makes us Singaporean" i'm sure many if not most of you find this phrase starkingly familar. Singlish is definately one of a kind. It reflects on our nation as a country with diverse multi-racial and multi-religious culture.</p>
              <p>No doubt what XenStar says is true about sounding uncouth, but one can also see it as an intra-singapore language bridging across generations both young and old alike. Like how the chinese in China all speak different kinds of chinese with their different accents and words from their dialects but they too have a common chinese languange also known as 'pu tong hua' ( common language ). They too, use their own variations of chinese to identify people from their own groups who share a common root with them. We could do likewise and take singlish as our own unique variation of english. At the same time making the switch to use proper english to converse with our foreign counterparts.</p>
              <p>Furthermore it gives us a common sense of belonging, especially when we're overseas, its more heartening to know that there's this stranger you've met who share something in common with you. That kind of 'qing qie gan' ( familiarity ) can only be felt.</p>
              <p><br>Its just how we want to view singlish as; a cultural jewel or a rotten apple?  You decide</p>

              <p>Peranakans and the Chinese "helicoptor" are the result of the circumstances of the past. correct me if I am wrong about Peranakans, the true peranakans were chinese who married local girls and they spoke Malay and Hokkien. Chinese who went back to China to get married continued to speak only Chinese dialects.</p>
              <p>The use of English came in when Peranakans and Chinese went to English schools set up by the British government. And some Chinese continued to study in Chinese schools set up by the chinese community. The diversion among the Chinese is therefore not among the Peranakans and others, it is between the English educated and the Chinese educated. Many peranakans I know continue to speak Hokkien at home, and their observance of Chinese traditions and culture is even more strongly rooted than many other Chinese.</p>
              <p>Unlike Taiwan and Hong Kong Chinese immigrants, Singapore Chinese immigrants did not come from educated families, most of our ancestors were very very poor farmers, mainly from the poor southern China. any child who went to english school will go home and speak with their parents in dialect, how to learn english at home? got money to let you tuck che, jin ho liao. If the children continued their english education till O level, last time level 9, gao ho, you can become government officers liao, then you can continue to speak english. If you stop at primary six and go back to help your parents, or flunk during secondary school, then you use the little english you learned, the balance substituted with hokkien...hence singlish. These people represents a much larger segment of the society, compared to those who learned proper english.</p>
              <p>the important thing about singlish is that we speak english when we think in chinese, "you go where", "wait lah" are Chinese sentence structure.</p>
              <p>The difference between Chinese language and english, or german, french is the origins of these languages. Chinese language developed from oracle, the shape of the words tell the meaning. So you have the word èˆ¹ï¼Œmade up of a sampan èˆŸ, with eight persons å…«å�£, very much in line with the history of Noah recorded in the Bible. German and English are originated from Latin, hence you find much more similarity between the two languages. If you learn Japanese and Korean, you will also find it a lot easy if you know Chinese.</p>
              <p>I am glad that today there is no distinct Chinese and English educated, but we have Singaporeans who know both English and Chinese, but good at neither. When I auntie told me my nephew, who scored A in Chinese, said to the waiter "ä½ ä¸�ç»™å¸�å�•ï¼Œæˆ‘æ€Žæ ·èµ”é’±ã€‚"" You don't give me the bill how do I pay money?" we have problem.</p>
              <p>what to do and where to go from here, I really don't know. I only ask my kids to study well in both languages and if possible, they should spend sometime in China and UK, or may be america, for a short period of time, exchange program, may be, to feel the language environment. After that what they learn and speak, I really don't know.</p>

              <p><br>There isn't anything I'd disagree here. I pointed out LKY's background to show PAP how blinded he is. Peranakans also speak Malay (specifically Baba Malay which is a potois of that and Hokkien) at home.</p>
              <p>It's not an easy task to break the chain of broken English...the trouble is also with getting students and adults to break out of the habit even if they already have the resouces, and to want to improve their own command of the language.</p>
