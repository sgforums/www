            <div class='col-md body'>US Wants Iraq's Oil<br>As Collateral For More Borrowing<br><br>By David McArthur<br>dmcarthur2680@rogers.com<br>2-11-3<br><br>The United States desperately wants a war with Iraq, but not for the espoused reasons of eliminating hard-to-find "weapons of mass destruction."<br><br>The U.S. wants another war with Iraq in order to control Iraq's immense oil-fields, to be used as collateral for more international borrowing, and to increase the huge, unsupportable U.S. debt.<br><br>The U.S. has big, big economic problems. The debt-based U.S. economy is being squeezed because international borrowing is getting harder. The U.S. has been living off the savings of the rest of the world for years, now absorbing some three-quarters of the world's debt finance. The U.S. government, corporations and people are now the most indebted in the world.<br><br>Altogether, the U.S. has borrowed nearly $40 trillion, and needs $2 billion a day in debt finance to support its huge trade deficit.<br><br>The U.S. corporate debt market is a mess, with a corporate credit crunch underway. Highly indebted, highly leveraged U.S. corporations cannot borrow any more money, or pay their debt. Credit downgrades are rising, along with credit downgrades to junk bond status for blue-chip U.S. corporations, which are going bankrupt at a rapid pace.<br><br>The liquidation of their debt is destroying money and negating efforts at reflating the U.S. dollar. Price deflation is appearing in many sectors, worsening their troubles. The profits of U.S. corporations are languishing, as prices fall and as the U.S. consumer shows signs of exhaustion.<br><br>Japan-style deflation is starting to hit the west, and with deflation, the most indebted face huge problems paying the interest on their loans - they risk bankruptcy.<br><br>The U.S. has also lost some 8 trillion dollars in its collapsing stock markets since March 2000. Stock markets are still collapsing as a historic, 1920's-scale investment bubble deflates. The investment bubble had boosted manufacturing capacity of uncompetitive, high-cost products. U.S. stocks are still hugely overvalued, as measured by price-earnings ratios, which indicates they have a lot further to fall. This erodes corporate and consumer finance.<br><br>Meanwhile, China and other low-wage countries are garnering the lion's share of the world's direct finance to expand their manufacturing. Chinese and other low-wage countries increasingly export to the U.S., displacing U.S. manufacturing. Over three-quarters of products used in the U.S. are now made offshore, and imported.<br><br>This is all bad news for the U.S. dollar. Offshore investors are fleeing the falling dollar, and are buying gold or the Euro with their immense dollar holdings. Economist Peter Warburton has just warned that the falling U.S. dollar will worsen the U.S. credit crunch. Islamic nations are planning to exchange their U.S. petrodollars for the Euro and gold, and this is another reason why the U.S. wants war: to keep them in line and supporting the U.S. dollar.<br><br>In the U.S., only military contracts and low interest rates are propping up the U.S. economy now and keeping it out of recession. Low rates allow zero interest loans for new vehicle sales, and a huge housing investment bubble with skyrocketing housing prices. Yet hugely indebted U.S. consumers have reached their limit of borrowing and consumption, and the real estate bubble is showing early signs of collapse.<br><br>If the U.S. grabs the Iraqi oil-fields, U.S. oil corporations can then move in and develop what are believed to be the world's largest oil reserves, surpassing even Saudi Arabia's oil-fields. That's money in the bank, and collateral for new loans, and new debt. U.S. portfolio manager and economics writer Marshall Auerback suggests the U.S. wants Iraqi oil-fields to repair its credit rating. Increased Iraqi oil flow to the U.S. could ultimately keep oil prices low, break OPEC, and prop up the U.S. economy.<br><br>Yet in the meantime, oil prices are high, slowing the world economy, and oil prices could skyrocket in an actual war, pushing the world economy into recession, or worse.<br><br>Thus, the U.S. wants war with Iraq as a way out of its economic and financial mess. The world shouldn't let the U.S. get away with it this time.<br><br>From rense.com</div>

North Korea seems controlled by men more interested in holding their soverign rights than the welfare of its own people.<br><br>Now, when the US army is done with Iraq the world will start wondering who would be next. North Korea will be so worried they will accelerate their nuclear weapons research and start bragging "Oh i got a nuke you better not attack me or i'm going to shoot it!" thinking that would scare the US off. Then Bush will start saying North Korea should be "liberated" from the evil people starving Communists and move on them with the support of Japan.<br>This isn't just about Iraq, it's about what paranoid men will do when they realise they may be next.</div>

While they are buying up stocks of oil from the Middle-eastern, South-east Asian, and South American countries, they are keeping their own natural oil reserves intact.<br><br>In all the colonial history of the world, USA has never colonized any country by military force or otherwise. In the Philippines, they stepped in to help in maintaining law and order when the Spanish were thrown out by a Filippino popular revolt; and they left by popular vote of the Filippino Congress.<br><br>Certainly 911 played a major part in the US current plans to attack IRAQ, especially with their present intelligence reports that the defeated Al Qaeda operatives on the run from Afghanistan have now found safe refuge in Iraq.<br><br>Attacking Iraq, can be seen as similar pre-emptive strikes taken by our own Singapore Government against Singapore Citizens, who form quiet radical cells and secretly planning attacks on our Singapore targets frequented by US Citizens.<br><br>USA is trying to prevent OSAMA BIN LADENÂ’s agents from possessing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), which Saddam Hussein of IRAQ is known to be developing, and playing a game of hide-and-seek with UN Inspectors, and preventing these WMD from being discovered and destroyed.<br><br>OSAMA BIN LADENÂ’s followers are slowly being exposed by intensive investigation, and hunt across USA, UK, Europe, Middle-east, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines and Australia.<br><br>Our experience with the Singapore branch of the J.I. Group being linked to OSAMA BIN LADEN is already telling enough, and came as a surprise, and probably prevented a disaster on the scale of Bali bombing.<br><br>Our Singapore J.I. Group had plans to hijack a Singapore Airline plane from Bangkok, and crashing it into a strategic building in Singapore Â– such as the Changi Airport Terminal, or downtown Singapore Â– much like the airplane crashing into the New York World Trade Center in 9-11 incident.<br><br>Should President Bush wait for Saddam Hussein to hand over a Â“dirty bombÂ” to one of Osama Bin LadenÂ’s operators, to conceal such a bomb in a Twenty Foot Shipping Container, and delivering such a bomb into a busy port in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, London, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Hongkong or Singapore?<br><br>Do we wait for a mad man such as Saddam Hussein to surrender and destroy his pet WMD projects, and give him time to conceal and fine tune those weapons further, while he play a game of Â“hide-and-seekÂ” with the UN Inspectors?<br><br>South Africa had developed a Nuclear Bomb in the late 1990Â’s, and their voluntary disarmament and quick full co-operation with the IAEA to disarm, was completed in less then two years.<br><br>UN has demanded Saddam Hussein to disarm since 1992, after Iraq was evicted from their invasion of Kuwait.<br><br>It has been more then twelve years, and this issue remains, and we now have OsamaÂ’s operators to contend with.<br><br>The world becomes more dangerous when a mad man that can murder his own citizens with gas, can now harbor known terrorists in his country. These terrorist have no qualms in setting off bombs in a peaceful environment such as Bali or in New York City.<br><br>Do you want to wake up with a Civil Defense Public Address System calling you to the shelter, because a dirty bomb is found in PSA, and some J.I. fellow is holding us to ransom?<br><br></div>

Situation is like this: Someone accuse u of stealing a handphone which u didn't. U let him search your bag, your house and everything and found nothing. He still accuse u of stealing his phone, wat u gonna do ?? If he is really guilty, then we should have let inspector spend more time on it.<br><br>About democracy thingy, it is not for us to say whether is it better for them or not. It is like asking tribesman to live urban lifestyle. We cannot force them to change for the better just because we felt it is better for them. Some tribes in Africa use rings to increase their neck length, which I find disgusting. Does tat means we stop them from continuing by forcing them ?<br><br>I felt they r should live a democratic, free life like the rest of the world too, but we can only appeal through pursuasion and dialogue, not by force. We cannot force people to change just even when we feel honestly tat it is better for them.<br><br>WW1 WW2... winners say everything. History is always like tis...<br><br>Terrorists will not stop after iraq is gone. Terrorist will increase like shit as America haters increase trememdously. They only seems to solve problem temporary, but given time the problem will be back again. Think why they wanna do those terrorist act... who wanna be a sucide bomber ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a story I have writtenÂ…<br><br>There is a big classroom and there r a lot of students in it. One of them is a very influential student in the class. He has money, best fighter in the class and had the respect from most of the classmate. He is now Model, as a role model for others. There is also another fellowÂ… he is ugly, always unfriendly, scolds everyone in the class and do a lot of disturbances like throwing rubbish everywhere and a lot of classmates hate him.  He is called Creep.<br><br>One day, disaster struck. Model say tat Creep has killed one of the teacher, and claims tat it has evidence and insists tat he is right. He suggest tat he be taught a Â‘lessonÂ’ and must be Â‘re-educatedÂ’. Creep, of course denies any of such things. The rest of the class decide tat they check out the Model claims, however Model say tat the class has no time, and Creep must be punished instantly.<br><br>Rest of class investigate on issue, but they need some time which model does not give. Model say tat he can beat up creep by himself, which everyone has no doubt. Model now say tat if Creep is Â‘re-educatedÂ’, the class will be a better place to live in, and can be example for other creep-alike in the class.<br><br>SoÂ… is Creep guilty ? Should we re-educate him so tat the class will be a better place ? If we r creep, how will we feel ? Will tis make other creep-alike in class band themselves together more or scared and open up to whole class ?<br></div>
