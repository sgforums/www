Nothing but feeble excuses, half-truths and worst of all, moral bleating. This coming from a country who has a record of forgoing morals to meet its self-interests in the past 60-odd years. What does it make them? IMO [b]Hypocrites</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Sorry, but I certainly would beg to differ from your posted views concerning "half truths, feeble excuses, moral bleating".<br><br>The WMD program pursued by Saddam was exposed and confirmed by his own Sons-in-Law, when both of them fled Iraq, only to be enticed back to Iraq for a short reunion with Saddam's daughters before being executed for betraying Saddam's secrets.<br><br>On Monday, in Manila, one of Saddam's primary engineer, who worked on the WMD program, confirmed the existence of such attempts by Saddam, in a pre-planned game of "Hide-and-YOU-Seek-if-YOU-can".<br><br>Reading the manner in which Saddam has responded to the UN Security Council, it is very obvious that he will hold out to the last minute, just to see what the Inspectors will report and what the UN Security Council will demand. Saddam will then TAILOR his response to pacify those concerns which is demanded by the Security Council, while he continue to have the latitude of time to hide his WMD for another day.<br><br>He plays his cards close to his chest, responding to the gambit by carefully watching what the other side intends to do, nullify it with adequate response, buy time to save his pet projects, and at the same time try to take the sting out of any aggressive actions from the USA by playing to the world's opinion and sympathy.<br><br>Quote:<br><strong>"This coming from a country who has a record of forgoing morals to meet its self-interests in the past 60-odd years."</strong><br><br>This is quite a sweeping and forceful statement, which I can only wonder what could have caused you to bear such a burden of opinion against the USA.<br><br>In the world of politics, are there any morals involve, even when viewed in our local Singapore political scene ?<br><br>Against the historical backdrop of the Cold War rivalry between US Capitalist and Russian Communist systems, both sides have resorted to unscrupulous means to gain footholds in the world's communities across all continents.<br><br>It is just our good fortune that the "immoral" and "unscrupulous" policies of US Capitalism won the day.<br><br>If the USA did not prevail against the odds stacked against them from World Opinions during the various periods of crisis, we would have been dominated by the Russian Communists model that swept almost half of Europe, and taking the biggest cut from Asia in China, North Korea, and Vietnam (the last two are still bogged down in Communist style economy, while China has embraced Capitalism).<br><br>Hypocrisy ?<br><br>It is a trademark and a common feature of politicians.<br><br>Let us not be naive in this competitive world.<br><br>Let us be street smart and know which side of the street to walk, just to avoid getting into any troubles.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there's little way about it, Saddam must go, if the Iraqi people want to fight for him, it's their loss, they're sealing their own fate. All this talk about what's right and how we must take absolute high moral ground and not be hyprocrates before we can launch any kind of war is poppycock. It's only nonsense that helps people like Saddam. These kind of pple will only understand force, that's how he holds his current position anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even if the US is stopped by the UN from attacking Iraq. This problem will still continue unless the conflict between two countries end by:<br><br>1) Iraq uses continental ballistics missiles attacking USA itself or by terrorists attacks.<br><br>2) US attacks Iraq.<br><br>I think I want US to attack Iraq ASAP cause if this "War or Not War" thing persists, the economies throughout the world will remain affected.<br><br>People die everyday. By natural or man-made. Yet man-made deaths can be considered a natural cause as human population is so big, that we see deaths of humans so often. This known as the "Human Civilisation Ecology System". Watch "Final Destination 2". You will know death is everywhere. But of course we should live well and live it to the fullest. You can try to stop the war etc. After all, its always a failure to please everyone.<br><br>Let US conquer Iraq. Iraq could have a better future like Japan after World War II. US wouldn't torture Iraq then, it knows the more you torture a nation, the hatre of the country will be there and will get back at their enemies. This is like Germany from WWI leading to WWII.<br><br>"Peace will reign after war and post-war period"</div>
