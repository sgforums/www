            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe..I thank you for your insights into <strong>Salman's reasoning</strong>. I must say there is <span style="font-style: italic;">some reality </span>in Salman's words. He had been to Myanmar and Iraq for sure and see the contrast of Singapore versus some poor countries. Those were <strong>totalitarian countries </strong>where they had keep people in chains for whatever reasons&lt; politics, many petty crimes etc, etc&gt; Yes, Singapore is better only outwardly. However, what kind of chains had the Garmen of Singapore used ?. I believe and see it is the issue of money.  Having more money and making more and more money is our national Greed. Someone very rich said "Greed is good". So we became bondage all our life to the slaves of PAP Garmen because money is what Garmen enchained us all with - no different from those in chains in those poor countries!<br><br>The issue is real VALUES versus the false <strong> value of money </strong>  <br><br>I lived a simple life.. I enjoyed life at the best without having to slough for the sake of money. I have never been richer than a couple of hundreds in my pocket. The last time when the Garmen give us some money &lt; last year&gt; I give it to some needy people Yet all my life  I had only worked a few years for the Garmen as an Instructor until I quitted and forget about working !<br><br>By today's PAP standard my family is average. WE had never suffer privation as those elder folks had to  neither any here on this forum &lt; I believe&gt; except those like Mr. LKY &lt; a person, I respected, and still do&gt; I don't mind leveled with him in any debates too but that is not the point. His generation is old and resistant to changes  but <span style="font-style: italic;">did he really want to build upon the temporary values of money for his own grandchildren and the children of many hundreds of thousand of people here?</span> Yet the political values somewhat had modified however, those old values incalculated cannot change so fast.. it takes time?<br><br>What does all Singaporean want? I sincerely believe we all wanted a more <span style="font-style: italic;"> humane</span> Garmen and learned to help our needy neighbors &lt; as in the tsunami and the earthquakes&gt;and above all to have a caring Garmen who acts to fulfilll the aspirations and hopes of our people&lt; all people not just the rulers&gt; The poor slaves of us when we buy a shop we are bonded to pay the banks a lifetime of interest which nobody in this world would think is possible but it is here! The rates is multiplied to the lower down mee sellers, and food stevedores and stall keepers who are had to pay a rental of 2 -3 thousand dollars for simply selling foods for people to eat. Our bus fares MRT fares even the recent HDB increases in levy are not justifiable. IT just make the Garmen more richer and the bondage more deepened. I  call it the slow boiling of the easy going frogs. Singaporeans had become easy going frogs in matter of health costs, car cost and credit bondages of all kind. The question is: can we do with a little more on the alloted time we all have here on earth for family, for health and our spiritual well being as a people with solid values than those incalculated in all of us <br><br>Therefore the question in particular related to the time we each have here on earth: <strong>how much time do you have</strong>?<br><br>Let measure our days wisely. Let me ask this<br><br>:: " if a man save all his life one dollar a day for all his life from babyhood-childhood to adulthood and then die after <strong>a hundred years</strong>&gt; how much are there when he ever lives to <span style="font-style: italic;">a hundred years old</span>?<br><br><strong>Answer is $36,500</strong>.. not enough for you to just buy a car!<br>Simply said, in Canada, USA I could easily buy a second hand car for US$5,000, here <strong>in Singapore I would only dream</strong>.<br><br>In some third world country like Myanmar I could buy some land and a small cottage with that sum of money. But in Singapore $36,500 is no sum for any PAP Garmen rulers or some their rich supporters!<br><br>I never dream of having so much money to carry in my pocket at any time, but rich people,especially those rich supporters and Garmen people <strong>carry like that as for small change</strong>&gt; <strong>The trouble is that money in their pockets come out of those who slough hardiest and made pennies </strong>to enrich their coffer yet we are kept tightly by a Garmen which is holding the reins of our money in the GIC and those surplus every year,. Had any good people in garmen dream a thought of the have-not here among so many in Singapore! Maybe, but it is all about how to tighten those reins of control! What can we do lah ?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I suggest Singaporeans to act wisely and VOTE for the party they believe who can best serve to their aspiration for all people and not for <span style="font-style: italic;">selfish reason </span>of their own in view of our grandchildren and childrenÂ’s children. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  One day when we all are without moneyWhat do we really have?<br>Besides the greater reality is around each of us soon &gt; all of us have to die...<br></div>
