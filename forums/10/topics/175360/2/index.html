            <div class='col-md body'>How about posting like this one below:<br><br><strong>What kind of Government in a small Country of four millions where the road to political freedom to vote is often curtailed by the rulers? Democracy, or Meritocracy or whatever the majority of the people just miss every chance to vote at every election. They are all dying to vote but could never have the chance to vote. There are so many walkovers. The simple answer to tear up the GRCs  ! GRCs really smell like yak, that has been, in any case was a PAP Garmen move to allow the original electorate districts manipulated into GRCs with the simple excuse the minority are not represented.. What is laughable is that such gerrymandering so-called in larger and old democracies is strictly forbidden, but in a quiet corner in this great Country the people had quietly condescended to allow the whole system to be foolhardily corrupted into unprecedented great walkover ! Singapore can never again be what a free Country as a freeborn Nation with a free born people.

I have never been to Iran nor Myanmar but I surely hope to esp. Myanmar <i><br>The point is governing but I have been staying in Canada for 12 over years and driven all over USA in cars. so I meet with farmers and politicians as friends too &lt; My friend's son just got elected into Parliament in Alberta..ie I congra him too&gt; I also  preached in many churches...I am also a good learner and willing to adapt with changes So you now know we are leveled at travelling..<br><br>However,  politics isn't exactly my cup of tea, though I enjoy the rapport.<br>I prefer philosophy or something else <br><br>Yes you are right the Garmen had specially paid attention to Politics now that election is close, but that is not to say they have not been planning all the times to manipulate people's mind according to their highly exhorted system of Government: What kind of government do you prefer &lt; PAP type: so be it, we have no right to change your inclination&gt; but why do you yourselves change your mind some times ago when considering voting for the opposition Seriously you are doing it because you just read how bad the oppositions are ? as reported? or was it that something else cause you to change ?<br>Our world is never perfect but someone  said this " think not what you can get from your Country but what you can give back..&gt; So many of politicians are labeled as "opposition" and when they enter politics is not for fun. They give back, some gone to jail for their struggle, others their fortune and business, and many had been forced to leave or else you know what will happen Only God know better. the point is<br>Our Government has been labeled as authoritarian or even totalitarian. That is meaning slowly but definitely we end up as the common masses serving the State's aspiration and promoting the interest of a few rulers - what happened to the poor marginized people "the have-nots" ?<br><br>So I too, made my choice, it is an intelligent one, so please don't call us or anyone who VOTE according to our own wishes as <strong>the wishes of liars</strong>..That is certainly not what you want in your vocab...quote:&gt;<span style="font-style: italic;">You se, more lies from them whiners.</span><br>Thank you for attentions, everyone!!<br><br>cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></i></div>
