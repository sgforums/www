Instead of taking the fight up on policy issues, they've resorted to muck-slinging.<br><br>However, I've got to say, its shaping up to be really entertaining wayang, the way things are panning out for the Not-WP. It's even more entertaining than Kerry-Bush fight of 2004. Just sit back and enjoy the show. Then after 6 May, enjoy the sue-sue sideshow.</div>

If they want to critize WP honesty and dignity, what's their honesty and dignity level??<br><br>First, WP say that they make PAP's claim to 1st world government a topic during the rally. PAP accuse them of not being honest and serious to the public by adding new topic right before the rally. What is the PAP doing now? They also make this James Gomez saga a new topic what. Evey single PAP from top-dog to middle-dog to low-dog are all barking at this!<br><br>Then, they critize CST as a lousy opposition with the CSJ episode. Last night MM come out to say that CST is respectable and a good opposition and that WP cannot match SDA?????  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>PAP flip flopping because they have nothing to answer to opposition's rally questions??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your posting revealed your ignorance. Why take information at its superficial level? You need to listen to the whole story before forming your opinion or risk being manipulated like a puppet.<br><br><strong>1. "Carrot of PAP"<br>They PROMISE people that PAP wards will get their Lift Upgrading FIRST, then the OPPOSITION. How do you vote for the Opposition?</strong><br><br>Do you know that WP upgraded the lifts in Hougang using their estate fund and the resident does not have to pay for a single cent for the upgrade?<br><br>Do you know that except for Marine Parade (GCT), Tanjong Pagar (LKY) and Ang Mo Kio (LHL), some of the other PAP wards did not get their fair share of upgrades and facilities? And when they do, they have to pay part of the fee "so that Singaporeans will not grow reliant on the government"?<br><br><strong>2. Opposition Calibre<br>Do you think anyone here would want to vote for Dr Chee, Mr Ling e.t.c.? No point. Maybe LTK, but then...</strong><br><br>Did you look carefully at each of the WP's credentials? Political Science Honors graduate, lawyers, CFO of MNC. I think their candidates line up is as impressive as PAP. I would put my faith in a private sector CFO than any other PAP candidate.<br><br><strong>3. Experience<br>The vicious cycle for the opposition continues BECAUSE they do NOT have experienced people except CST and LTK. Are 2 people enough?</strong><br><br>That's why we need more opposition in the parliment. Give them a term or two and they'll be as experience as CST or LTK. Look at Slyvia Lim, she's a tough woman. Probably more capable, responsible and accountable than HC.<br><br><strong>4. The Psychological Factor<br>Do you really really feel safe in the hands of the Opposition. If you said that James Gomez merely made an honest mistake, how can you prove it? His attitude shows one thing -- he is very arrogant and thinks he's right.</strong><br><br>Do you feel safe when PAP makes multimillion dollar 'honest mistakes'? Or when PAP members are charge in court for embezzelment and crime (which are not publish). JG make a mistake, he apologize, so let's move on. At least he apologize, PAP can't even be bother to explain to the public.<br><br><strong>5. The Manifestos<br>WP said "Abolish all GRCs" in a part of their Manifesto. This was the VERY WAY we introducted minority candidates, and now you want to abolish it. It will become a strict racist affair in time to come. Not only that, CST mentioned "merge economy with M'sia" in the Straits Times. Why should we weaken our currency overnight to work with a country where they are inclined to favour Malays, and is not impartial?</strong><br><br>Read the manifesto carefully. The abolishing of GRC is to ensure level political playing field. You vote for a key minister and you get 5-6 free loaders that get elected as well. Let them be contested individually on their capability.<br><br>GRCs can be abolish because the WP believes that Singaporeans are mature enough to ensure equality for all races. Unless the government or yourself acknowledge that you are racist and you need a GRC to ensure that minority are represented.<br><br>Back in the days without GRC, didn't Jeyarathnam get elected also??<br><br><strong>Would be interested in knowing about the opposition's pros.</strong><br><br>Voting in more opposition would ensure that policies that are unfair to the average citizen are contested and these arguments are made known to public. When this happens, the ruling party will not get a blank cheque to pass any unjust law as and as they chooses because they know it will be challenged.<br><br>Voting in the opposition signal our discontent with the ruling party and will spur them to be on their toes. It will make them more accountable and strive to make life easier for the average citizens because they want your vote back.<br><br>I also believe oppositions are necessary for democracy. I believe that PAP did well for Singapore but I firmly believe they can do much better and there's a much needed, long overdue wakeup call.</div>
