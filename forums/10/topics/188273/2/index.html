            <div class='col-md body'>PAP is too much. I am disappointed that key PAP ministers are taking cheap shots at the guy. Gomez made a mistake. It is a small matter. Given the many things on the mind of a candidate, plus the pressure on an opposition candidate, it is understandable if Gomez slipped up.<br><br>Take a step back, look at the purpose of Gomez's application. Gomez is only asking to be certified as a minority candidate. He is clearly a minority. We can see from his skin colour. We don't need the Election Dept to certify this fact. The Election rules should not be administered in such a way to disqualify potential candidates.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Am absolutely disappointed at Gomez and his party.  Can't believe they let this happen at such a crucial time, when WP was actually showing some promise with their team.  I mean, this is just paperwork, it's not even politics! If they were under pressure so was everyone else.  You can't count on the elections department to be a nanny and check that your things are in order, it's the individual's responsibility.  The way Gomez responded to the department was untactful and rude; they've got to be more careful, surely they know by now anything they say and do will be used against them.   I think it's a significant blow to WP , due to a silly and careless oversight which has cast doubts on their reputation, and sadly maybe this is a sign that they (or some of the canditates) are not ready for the political arena yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when i first learnt of Gomez's hiccup after a similar incident the previous election, i was left wondering if Gomez isn't himself a mole planted by the PAP ...<br><br>anyway, my take is this.  the PAP is accusing Gomez of something and wants him to come clean with it.  what has Gomez done?  he has nearly jeopadised his party's eligibility if it weren't for other minority candidates available.  so is the PAP accusing Gomez of trying to jeopardise WP's chances?  what stupid logic is this?  your biggest enemy is accusing you of destroying your own party?</div>
