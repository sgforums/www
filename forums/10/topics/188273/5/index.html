When cornered, he says, "I apologise". But he refuses to say what he has apologised for. He will not answer the questions asked by the Minister for Home Affairs. So the minister has come out with a statement setting the full facts to show that Gomez has lied and done so deliberately. He planned to damage the Elections Department and the government, by pretending that we fixed him by not giving him a minority candidate certificate and so prevented him from taking part in a GRC where they needed him as an Indian minority candidate."<br><br>Mr Lee noted that blame would be on the Elections Department and the minister, Mr Wong Kan Seng, in whose portfolio the Elections Department comes under.<br><br>MM Lee said: "Mr Wong gave him the last three days to come clean, repeatedly asking to answer simple questions. Gomez chose to say nothing. Low Thia Khiang said he had asked Gomez for the details. Low chose to defend him but refused to clarify his position on Gomez's deliberate trick to put the blame on the Elections Department."<br><br>"Mr Low decided to back Gomez. I thought Mr Low was politically smarter than Mr Chiam See Tong. When Chiam found Dr Chee Soon Juan was a bad egg, he criticised Chee and distanced himself from him. Chiam lost his own party. Mr Low appears to have lower standards of integrity compared to Chiam."<br><br>Mr Lee also reminded voters to consider carefully the candidates who could look after their lives, jobs and homes.<br><br>Said Mr Lee, "During elections, the opposition makes promises which they know they cannot fulfil, because they will not be the government. Many people go to their election rallies to enjoy the noise and excitement. But when you go home, consider carefully which candidate or the group of candidates in the GRC can look after your lives, your jobs, homes, your children's education, health, schools, transportation, playgrounds and parks.<br><br>"The PAP has improved your lives continuously over 40 years. In the last five years, together we overcame problems. Had the government been incompetent, they would have brought Singapore down -- Asian financial crisis, SARS, terrorism, Iraq war. Now there is the danger of an oil crisis, the price could spike from US$70 to over US$100 per barrel, because of the problem of Iran's nuclear technology. If that happens, there will be a world recession." - CNA /ch/ct </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quoted from sammyboy website in their coffeeshop forum (nt porn)<br><br>"<br>Well, in a rather obscure place much away from the peering public, had this breakfast with this very well regarded senior journalist/ editor from SPH. Here are the journalist's personal (because this person is a known rebel amongst the SPH folks) views/opinion and assessment (not in any particular order). Given that this journalist has had top level access to a lot of people this is perhaps not only interesting but has a ring of credibility.<br><br>PAP worried that this time they were not returned on nomination day.<br><br>Many are really concerned with the kind of damage that LKY is doing with his interviews (CNA, Foreign media etc.). A very seasoned media personality had to tell LHL about this on friday, that LKY needs to be more subdued. Will the PM tell his Mentor father?<br><br>The entire ISD is busy trying to dig up something on Sylvia. WKS is personally supervising it. They want to destroy her before she becomes big. There is a big chance that they could have stumbled something about her. The PAP will use it during the closing stages.<br><br>Actually GCT didnt want to be part of electioneering and wanted to play a laid back role. He got pitchforked into this to his own surprise. It sounds like a conspiracy to have him discredited. What is not clear is whether GCT screwing up by making confusing statements is intentional or accidental. GCT is not even invited or even consulted for some of the strategy meetings. He gets his information from secondary sources. By end of this year, GCT would be out of the cabinet and sent to Batam to retire or would be called as Travelling Minister, because he would be constantly made to travel.<br><br>The PAP big guns are going to land up in Aljunied from Tuesday, and it will see a flurry of activity, threats (both covert and overt). LKY himself may be seen there, though a section of the PAP dont want him, because he is pissing off people.<br><br>PP may be a close shave, but looks like the odds favour CST, because of the stupid, contradictory and disparaging statements made by GCT.<br><br>Additional precautions are being taken to prevent outbreak of rioting, violence, shouting on the streets or stadiums on thursday and friday. Riot police have been asked to be on standby. They do expect (or even want) some violence or rioting so that they can make a few arrests, and put the fear into the hearts of the people. so, make sure that the AP urge people not to become violent at their rallies repeatedly.<br><br>I think if CST and LTK were to stand on the same stage and speak the same language, especially at PP, Aljunied and CCK, the PAP would be pissing in the pants.<br><br>PAP actually happy that WP havent aggressively touched the core issues yet -- Jobs, CPF cuts, HDB window rivet, NKF, cost of living etc. Their strategy is to keep the WP busy with the Gomes issue, so that other important issues get less airtime. APs, should just move on and raise the bigger issues.<br>"<br><br>by Serenditpity</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, one of the MPs said on TV that election is a matter of national importance. If that is the case how do we pass the GRC law to make it necessary to require election candidate to fill a form of minority race candidate in order to be eligible to stand for election.<br><br>Is not the GRC system law an issue of national importance as well? If it is then should it not be made or incorporated as an integral part of the constitution of Singapore and be referred to a national referendum before introduction as law since it changes the election system from one-man-one-vote system to one-man-multi-candidates system.<br><br>Upgrading of HDB estates was generally passed by greater majority exceeding three quarter majority of those living in the estate proposed for upgrading. Shouldn't any change to one-man-one-vote constitutional right of citizen be passed by a greater majority than even for lift upgrading of the estates?<br><br>So shouldn't our many highly talented and respected MPs and Ministers who spoke about the missing form as a matter of national importance pay even greater attention to the passing of the GRC laws and ask if that law should be passed by national referendum and requiring even a higher percentage in passing it then 75 % required for approval of HDB estate upgrading.<br><br>If our new MP candidates are parties to the election, they should not speak with such authority to avoid conflict of interest. Let an independent election officer not related to the government seeking re-election speak for better decorum. After all when election should be free it should not be subjected ao t minority form to become a real issue in any system.<br><br>It is time to review the GRC election system which in the first place is a greater national issue than the minority form in this instance.<br><br>Where is the sense of proportion or fair-play in our election if we want to go on quibbling over a form which in the first instance is not even required for election in true democracies ?</div>
