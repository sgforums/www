              <p>Wednesday, 18 February 2009	
              
              <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/postersI/rodneykingbook.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="right"></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br>With
              the economy falling apart and the investment debacles at GIC and
              Temasek making headline after shocking headline, the facade of an
              omniscient PAP Government has been stripped bare for all to see. <br><br>Below are excerpts from a book entitled <em>The Singapore Miracle: Myth and Reality</em> written by Mr Rodney King, a journalist that once worked at the <em>Straits Times</em>.
              The book, published in 2006 and recently updated, is poignant, now more
              than ever, given the current economic and financial mess we find
              ourselves. It is a wake-up call that Singaporeans cannot afford to
              ignore:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <blockquote>The PAP never tires of
              telling Singaporeans how much they have benefited from its rule, how
              much happier they are in their HDB units than in the kampongs and how
              poverty has all but disappeared.<br><br>The rivers of dubious
              statistics the PAP state generates to back its questionable claims have
              often been uncritically accepted by journalists and Western neo-cons
              and the now discredited "Asia Rising" theorists. <br><br>Both the
              myths and the statistics used to "prove" the Singapore Miracle are
              suspect. To what extent is the miracle a statistical mirage? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If the
              statistics and myth-making used to promote this miracle are scraped
              away what is left? – A dependent and EIC-deficient economy, driven by
              MNC capital and expertise, with severe inequalities of wealth and
              income, high living and an often poorly paid workforce. Such truths
              about Singapore's miracle are not widely known abroad.</strong></span><br><br>Negative
              foreign comments about Singapore focus on its authoritarian nature, the
              ruthless persecution of political opponents, its compromised and
              "compliant" judiciary, its lack of press freedom and its less-than-free
              elections. But Singapore is still seen as an economic success story
              that has delivered high living standard to its citizens despite
              democratic shortcomings.<br><br>Apart from Singaporean political
              activist Chee Soon Juan, few writers have exposed the many shortcomings
              of Singapore's economic miracle, and especially how little Singaporeans
              have gained from it. <br><br>Were more commentators to do so,
              Singapore would no longer be regarded as a model for national
              development. It would lose its iconic "brand name" status around the
              world, particularly among neo-conservatives and the globalisation
              lobby. An MNC outpost serviced by underpaid locals and ruled by a
              manipulative and over-paid political elite is not an inspiring
              development model.<br><br>Unlike Singapore's foreign friends, PAP
              leaders understand its real situation. Frantic government efforts to
              transform the country into an entrepreneurial, innovative, risk-taking
              society reflect this concern. However, such ends can only be achieved
              if the PAP state relinquishes much of its power over the economy and
              people.<br><br>While desperately trying to transform the economy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the
              PAP continues to deluge Singaporeans with assurances that everything is
              fine, using biased statistics to do this. Many Singaporeans see through
              such subterfuge, perceiving their society as one riven with privilege
              and inequality.</strong></span><br><br>Besides growing inequality, Singapore is
              hollowing out economically and socially. It will remain dependent on
              foreign capital and talent despite endless "re-engineering" efforts to
              make it more competitive. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore is becoming a transient hotel-type
              society. State-led efforts to inculcate patriotism and a sense of
              community merely disguise this process.</strong></span><br><br>Eventually the truth may
              emerge that Singapore cannot be transformed into the economy the PAP
              wants unless the Government is prepared to relinquish significant
              economic and political control.<br><br>The PAP cannot do this because
              it would undermine its rule and disrupt many powerful vested interests.
              However, without such reform Singapore is condemned to ongoing
              mediocrity. A vibrant MNC sector and huge national reserves will
              disguise this only for a while.<br><br>Nonetheless, a combination of
              internal and external factors could disrupt and tear apart Singapore's
              carefully cultivated image as a competitive cutting-edge economy. Some
              scenarios have been outlines on how this could occur.<br><br>If
              conditions worsen, no amount of PAP spin, compliant ratings agencies or
              neo-con accolades will disguise Singapore's growing problems. Only then
              will the myths that have sustained PAP' Singapore for so long be
              exposed; and only then will Singapore become a deservedly discarded
              development model for developing countries. Then, the Singapore Miracle
              will finally be seen for what it is.<br><br><em>The book is available at Select Books at the Tanglin Shopping Centre.</em></blockquote>

              <p>i agree the PaPA has got the basics right in some areas while not in others.</p>
              <p>The biggest mistake of the PAP is its over reliance on foreign investment, and neglecting its own talents.</p>
              <p>Let the citizens rise, in education, training and be bosses of the foreign talents which come here is the answer.</p>
              <p>Let promotion in the workplace go to locals first, like in Australia.</p>

              <p>Singapore is indeed a miracle. How it rose is an exemplary story to the world...</p>
              <p>Do u seriously think that ang moh countries, without their natural resources like food ect are able to survive with their lazy so called democratic society?</p>
              <p>Even with their so called natrual resource rich nations, cost of living is also very high. Taxes are high</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what happens if the PAP does not maintain its draconian laws?. U will see chinese start to gamble in engage in vice, Sri lankans raising funds for LTTE, islamic radicals spreading their ideas .</p>
              <p>I believe PAP still think Chee soon juan is an ok fellow. They know it by now.</p>
              <p>PAp policies are a double edged sword. it has its merits as well as the drawbacks. The key to tacking this situation is to dynamically alter policies here and there to the best as possible</p>

              <p>That is why you must vote in more opposition to build up the strength.</p>

              <p>40, 50 or 60 opposition MPs can do plenty.</p>

              <p><br>that is not even any source?? full of theory in net, opposition must be more open, challenge the govt, debate on what to do rather than complain and insulting other poor performances. If a opposition can come out, speak out reasonably and sensibly on how to solve the current crisis or help the poor, so to speak, we young ones will notice you, so far we heard about a few young professional in the opposition only during the election period, after that all gone hiding liao, what is left are Dr Chee own personal views and theories, which alone cannot make us change our mind. As i said, we dun gamble on the losing side, show us a light at the end of the tunnel and not shouting inside a dark tunnel that lead us into a darker tunnel.</p>
