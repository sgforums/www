Residents offer help, but...<br>By Dawn Chia<br><br>February 11, 2006<br><br>THEIR room walls: Two bedsheets hung together by raffia.<br><br>--Pics/KUA CHEE SIONG<br>Their door: An upturned table.<br><br>Their home: The void deck of a Yishun HDB block.<br><br>For two nights, this space was home to a China study mama and her teenage daughter.<br><br>The daughter claimed they didn't have enough money to pay the rent and the landlord had asked them to leave the unit in the same block.<br><br>The 13-year-old looked worn out. (See report on next page).<br><br>We are not naming the pair to spare the student embarrassment.<br><br>Ask the mother if they need help and you get a terse reply.<br><br>'I don't need money. If you want to, just find me a job,' she said coldly.<br><br>Her pride surprised concerned residents in Block 283 at Yishun Ave 6, many of whom have, asked if they could help.<br><br>The 45-year-old study mama firmly declined their offers.<br><br>She was seen setting up house in the void deck on Monday after moving her belongings from a second-floor unit where she used to rent a room.<br><br>A TV set, two large suitcases, a small bookshelf and piles of clothes lined the sides of a single-sized mattress.<br><br>Two toothbrushes and tubes of toothpaste sat snugly in a plastic mug. A rectangular-shaped coffee-table turned on its side functioned as the door to their 'room'.<br><br>Two basins of tap water sat untouched on a bench just two steps away - that was their water for drinking and also for washing up.<br><br>Residents and curious passers-by have peeked over the 1.2m-high 'walls', but that didn't bother the woman one bit.<br><br>She either continued snoozing or reading a book, oblivious of the curious stares.<br><br>The slim, long-haired woman told The New Paper in Mandarin: 'It's not like I've been here for a month - it's just been two nights.<br><br>'I know it's unsightly to see us staying here, but we're not doing anything wrong, and we have no other choice.'<br><br>She did not want to say why she moved out, saying only that she 'had a disagreement' with her landlord and felt she couldn't stay there any more.<br><br>Her daughter later said they had not been paying rent for three months.<br><br>The mother has been renting a room for $300 a month from this landlord for about six to eight months.<br><br>The safety and well-being of her daughter living in the void deck was not a concern, she said.<br>S'PORE IS SAFE<br>She said: 'There's nothing to worry about - Singapore is a safe place.<br><br>'I wouldn't let my daughter sleep in the open if it's dangerous. Besides, nothing has happened so far.'<br><br>She said she was from Liao Ling province and that she had come to Singapore about three years ago in search of a better life.<br><br>She claimed that she had been looking for a job for 'a very long time', but wasn't able to find a satisfactory one.<br><br>Over the years, their daily expenses have eaten into her savings. Money which she had borrowed from her relatives to supplement her savings was soon depleted.<br><br>She lamented: 'How can I approach friends or family for help?<br><br>'If I tell them that I have no money, do you think they will believe me? They have their own problems.'<br><br></div>
