The panic reaction will cause the press to sensationalise the issues further and the spiral goes on. A recent eg here would be Huang Nan incident, where the numerous newspaper reports on the little girl fanned the public concern for her which became overwhelming.<br><br>The anti-Japanese demo could be an eg of DAS in China and Korea but it didn't happen here.<br><br>DAS rarely happens in Singapore because besides being govt controlled there are too few newspapers here. When there are too many papers, these papers will usually resort to sensational news reporting to gain readership.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireIce:</div><div class="quote_body">food for thought....<br><br><span style="color: blue;">In 1972, Stanley Cohen wrote a book entitled, Folk Devils and Moral Panics. The thesis of the books is that moral panics usually include what Cohen called the deviancy amplification spiral.<br><br>The spiral starts with some "deviant act". Usually the deviance is criminal but it can also involve legal acts considered (rightly or wrongly) morally repugnant.<br><br>The mass media report what is newsworthy. Bad or frightening situations are reported. What is not frightening and would help the public keep a rational perspective tends to be ignored.<br><br>Minor problems are made to look serious. Rare events are described as if they were the norm. Gullible and frightened members of the public buy newspapers; they listen to radio or television programmes and believe what they are told. This is profitable for those who run the media. Irresponsible publicity can increase deviant behaviour.<br><br>In the next stage, typically public concern about crime forces the police and the whole law enforcement system to focus more resources on dealing with the specific deviancy than would otherwise be necessary. Police under public pressure make more arrests. Judges and magistrates under public pressure pass stiffer sentences. All this tends to convince the public that any fear was justified while the media continue to profit by reporting police and other law enforcement activity.<br><br>Moral panics do not always include the deviancy amplification spiral. The witchhunts that occurred in medieval times did not have significant media involvement. In modern times media involvement is usual in any moral panic.</span><br><br>familiar?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">extracted from wiki</span></div></blockquote>totally. sensational news=big money.<br>there's no responsiblity or morality involved in news reporting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oops..after reading the article, I thought it was about the US after 9/11. You know, the increase in patriotism, arrests without evidence, increased airport security, harsher interrogations (torture), spreading of fears of more terrorist attacks. Allowed greater support for the Iraq war and the myth that there is a weapons of mass destruction. Silence protestors of the war as they are deemed 'unAmerican'. It justified the increase in military spending and the missile shield project. Increased the ability to recruit more soldiers. More tolerant about the discrimination of Muslims. Encouraged belief that certain countries are "evil" and thus wants the US to give them the 'freedom'. That they are unreasonable and the only solution is war. Defy UN's orders because UN is anti-American. Made fun or discriminate against countries who are against the war like France. Creating a more 'police' state to increase 'security'. And this is a country with supposedly freedom of the press.<br><br>So, I don't know. Compared to this, Singapore's situation seems mild.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, we see them in Singapore. In fact, I suspect at times they are orchestrated by the government. With a compliant media, it is easy to initiate a fear or concern that can be easily disseminated and amplified to achieve a particular political or social objective.<br><br>Of course it can be used for good as well as evil. I only dread the day our benign dictatorship turns malignant....</div>
