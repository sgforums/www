Our ruling party can definitely review their current system in their way of governing Singapore.<br><br>Btw, I just put up a thread titled "Temasek &amp; 98 Holdings". Knowing that you are very in tune with these issues, can you offer some suggestions as to why such a deal was done?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asian values and confucianism were adopted as convenient catch-phrase to justify the autocratic style of leadership in many Asian states from the 1960s.<br><br>In actual fact the primary success factor in any effective leadership lies in empowerment of the masses in practical knowledge application which will bring about real advances and progress.<br><br>Such leadership is collective in nature with the people identified as close partners of progress with the leaders and elites surrounding the leaders. If leaders want to produce results in any significant manner, they will have to be able to motivate the people and suffer together with them in time of hardship.<br><br>In the period leading up to the Asian Financial crisis many autocratic Asian leaders were seen busy trying to use Asian virtues and Confucianism to clothe their personality cult as some sort of flesh to cover their nakedness of self. They were seen lagging behind in corporate governance standards often making decisions without participations of the rest of the collective leadership.<br><br>So the only way such leaders can lead the country is through compulsion of the citizens with all sorts of controls and regulations to enforce their personal wishes and agendas.<br><br>Suharto was found to be issuing decress and edicts to enforce his various narrow concepts of Pancasilla. The citizens had to suffer in silence of corruptions and nepotism and cronyism.<br><br>All these grandiose promotion of Asian values had to grind to an abrupt halt as autocractic leadership typical of Asian cultures was found to breed self-centredness the root cause of the lack of accountability and transparency in running of the respective Asian authoritarian states which led to total collapses of the economy.<br><br>By promoting personality and leadership, many autocratic states were clearly governed with little regard for accountability and transparency.<br><br>However as soon as the Asian Financial crisis was over, self-centred individualism reasseted itself and was creating again new pressures on the people in these Asian autocratic states.<br><br>There is no sign that leaders in these Asian states have learned from the Asian Financial Crisis and soon forgot the many lessens attributable to the accountability and transparency in running the country. They prefer to govern according to their wishes and commands.<br><br>NKF was a case where an organization was run by individualistic personality which led to many problems. Finally such a self-centred system breeds abuses and malpractices. Those who were in charge were seen wanting to govern according to their own personal wishes which were called talents or leadership but such self-centred practices were unable to motivate and empower the masses.<br><br>There is a critical need to learn from the Asian Financial crisis and NKF. Yet how many Asian leaders are prepared to admit their self was the root cause of widespread discontent which often cause great harm to the unity and vibrancy of society creating instability and more future financial and social crises.<br><br>Until and unless the Asian states learn how to govern their countries with accountable pro-people and pro-result work processes there will be continual instability in all these countries.<br><br>There will be difficulty in giving up self-centred past practices because of in-born characteristics and other cultural factors.<br><br>However if they want to progress as well as other pro-people empowering system, as practised by advanced democracy like Finland and Switzerland, they will have little chance to win over their people who will want to be co-owners of the whole system for the long-term governance of the country. Only in this way will the Asian autocratic states survive and compete well in the future.</div>
