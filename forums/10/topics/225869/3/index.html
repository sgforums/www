Why not recommend medicine to people here?  There are a lot of people here who are smarter than you and can obviously do your job better.

I can't say anything against the sprirt of your post because I've never had a problem making money myself, and I do agree that opportunities go to those who can recognise one when they see it.<br><br>However, as you would be aware, the clause in the pledge relating to achieving "happiness, prosperity and progress" in itself shows that it's the responsibility of everybody, the government more than anybody else, to achieve said happiness, prosperity and progress.<br><br>The issue here is not that people are unhappy.  The issue is that people are unhappy and the government is derelict in its duty to recognise and address these issues.<br><br>If you think about the concept of government, it is to govern, not to make money for the nation and certainly not to make money for themselves.
