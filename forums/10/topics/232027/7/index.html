To the military, the coup is payback time. Then, there were accusations of corruption even back in the days before he became PM and then of cronyism when he became PM.<br>All this time the pot was slowly simmering. The first big anti-Thaksin rally in Thailand took place over the tax-free sale of Shin Corp for $1.9Bn to PAP's Temasek Holdings.<br>The simmering pot finally exploded and Thaksin's out.<br>Anybody still wonder why of so many countries that  Thaksin has visited, the Thai Govt only fumed at PAP?</div>

No immediate action was taken after the message was relayed to the Thai side. But Thaksin appeared to have crossed the threshold when he went to the foreign media during his visit to attack the government and the junta.<br><br><strong>A Thai source said Thaksin's visit was at the invitation of Singapore.</strong><br><br>In his interview with Wall Street Journal, Thaksin discredited the Thai government's economic policies and also derided the power seizure that deposed him from power on September 19.<br><br>Thaksin also took a political pot-shot during his five-minute stint on CNN and reminded the audience that he was democratically elected.<br><br>The indefinite suspension of the important summit retreat between the two leaders scheduled<strong> for later this year represents a low-point in Thai-Singapore relations</strong><br><br>This informal retreat has been the main forum for leaders of both countries to engage in a tete-a-tete on pivotal bilateral and regional issues. The fourth summit retreat was scheduled later this year in Singapore. <strong>The first was held in Phuket in 2003, the second in Sentosa Island 2004, and the latest summit was held in Chiang Mai in 2005.</strong><br><br>Another important bilateral meeting, known as Thai-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Programme (CSEP) has also been suspended.<br><br><strong>Singapore Foreign Minister Yeo was scheduled to fly in for the CSEP meeting in early February</strong>. This programme started in 1998 and was aimed at strengthening cooperation between the civil service sectors as part of the "strategic partnership" banner. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would seem that Thaksin's visit was brought to the attention of the current Thai administration by our govt.<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="large"><strong>Thai FM warned S'pore over meeting Thaksin<br>Foreign minister Nitya Pibulsonggram says he informed S'pore counterpart George Yeo at Cebu summit that planned meeting with DPM Jayakumar was unacceptable </strong></span><br><br>The Nation<br>Jan 20, 2007<br><br>Thai Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram said yesterday that he had personally warned his Singaporean counterpart George Yeo that there would be "reactions" from Thailand if former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was received by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar during his visit to Singapore last week.<br><br>Mr Nitya said that after having been informed of Mr Thaksin's pending visit to Singapore, the Thai Foreign Ministry notified Singapore "at least three times" that the treatment to be accorded Thaksin was "unacceptable" to the Thai Government.<br><br>Speaking to a group of senior editors during their lunch meeting with Prime Minister General Sura-yud Chulanont at Baan Phitsanu-loke, Mr Nitya said his warning to Minister George Yeo during the Asean summit meeting in Cebu, the Philip-pines, had been unmistakable.<br><br>"I told him: 'We cannot accept the fact that Thaksin is going to be received by Singapore's deputy prime minister'," Nitya said. "I emphasised that it was something unacceptable." The Thai foreign minister said he also warned Yeo "there would be reactions" from Thailand if Mr Jayakumar received Thaksin.<br><br>Mr Nitya was apparently trying to counter media reports that the Foreign Ministry had not been forceful enough in impressing on the Singaporeans how serious the consequences of such meeting would be.<br><br>Despite Thailand's protest, the Singaporean government went ahead and arranged a meeting between Mr Thaksin and Mr Jayakumar which subsequently prompted the Thai Foreign Ministry to retaliate by suspending all high-level meetings with Singapore, including a ministerial dialogue scheduled later this month. The invitation to the Singaporean foreign minister to attend the dialogue was also withdrawn.<br><br>Mr Nitya said that while other countries were sensitive to the Thai Government's stand on Thaksin, Singapore had made itself an exception.<br><br>"It was a slap in the face to Thailand and tantamount to recognising the former government," said the Thai FM.<br><br>He added that that during his conversation with Mr Yeo, he had also reminded his Singaporean counterpart of President SR Nathan's recent pledge to General Surayud that Singapore would not do anything to "betray" the trust and understanding between the two countries.<br><br>"I looked Yeo in the eyes and reminded him that he had been there when President Nathan said that," Mr Nitya said.<br><br>Asked how the two countries would repair the damage from the row, Mr Nitya said the Foreign Ministry would assess the situation "on a daily basis" before deciding what to do next.<br><br>"But if you are asking me if I am going to fly to Singapore tomorrow, the answer is no," he added.<br><br>An informed source close to Surayud said that during their meeting in Cebu Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing had told the Thai leader that China was very uneasy about Mr Thaksin's presence and activities in Beijing, where he spent most of his time after London following his ouster from power in the Sept 19 coup.<br><br>Mr Li also assured Gen Surayud and Mr Nitya that Beijing would not allow the former Thai leader to engage in any activities that would displease the Thai government.<br><br>"Li also assured Surayud and Nitya that no Chinese official had met Thaksin during his stay in China," said the source.<br><br>The source said the Chinese understood the situation very well.<br><br>"When Khun Nitya tried to explain at length to Li what Thaksin shouldn't be allowed to do while in China, the Chinese foreign minister even helped him to get straight to the point, asking him: 'So you want him to do nothing damaging to his own country, is that right'?" the source said.<br><br>Meanwhile, Gen Surayud said that former prime minister Thaksin was welcome to return to Thailand but only when the "terms" had been worked out. "He can return, but first we have to talk about certain conditions," he said, without elaborating.<br><br>The General earlier said that Mr Thaksin should only return to Thailand after a new government came to power following a general election.<br><br>He also insisted that the Thai Foreign Ministry's decision to suspend all high-level contacts with Singapore in retaliation for Thaksin's recent visit to the island state during which he met Mr Jayakumar was appropriate and necessary "to let Singapore know how Thai people feel".<br><br>But when asked for comment on the claim by General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, chairman of the Council for National Security, that Singapore had been eavesdropping on Thailand's communication channels, Surayud said it was only a "technical matter".<br><br>"If you ask them, they will of course deny it," he said.<br><br>On Thaksin's ongoing tour of the region and media interviews, the prime minister said his government had no objection as long as he was not accorded recognition by host governments the way he had been in Singapore.<br><br>In a related development, Singaporean Ambassador to Thailand Peter Chan met Interior Minister Aree Wongsearaya but played down the meeting as "a normal courtesy call".<br><br>"Mr Chan said Singapore would continue to work with Thailand to strengthen their longstanding good relations and looked forward to an improvement in relations," said a statement from the Singaporean Embassy in Bangkok.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Thaksin arrived in Japan late on Thursday on a private jet from Beijing. He is expected to continue with his attack on the government in Bangkok and reportedly will meet business leaders.<br><br>Mr Thaksin played down the trip, telling waiting reporters there was no pressing reason for his visit.<br><br>"Now is a time for me to relax, get together with my family and see my old friends,'' Thaksin was quoted by the Associated Press as saying upon arrival at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo.<br><br>Japanese officials reportedly said they were aware of Mr Thaksin's visit but had no plans to meet the former leader.<br><br>Tokyo University spokeswoman Kayoko Hayashi dismissed media reports that Thaksin was planning to deliver a speech at the university and receive an honorary degree. </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, our govt apparently decided that it was a 'trivial' matter and permitted it to go ahead despite the warning signs.<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">S'pore FM George Yeo confirms Thai warning over Thaksin's visit<br>But he assured his Thai counterpart that the former premier's meeting with DPM Jayakumar was "completely social and private". </span></span><br><br>AsiaOne<br>Jan 20, 2007<br><br>Singapore's Foreign Minister George Yeo, who is currently in Calcutta, has confirmed that Thai Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram spoke to him "two to three times" in Cebu about former Thai Prime Minister's visit to Singapore.<br><br>A spokesman for the Foreign Minister, responding to the Mr Nitya's comments reported in The Nation today, said: "Foreign Minister George Yeo said that he had the highest respect for Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram.<br><br>"Minister Yeo said that while he understood the Thai Government's concern, he also sought Minister Nitya's understanding of the Singapore Government's position.<br><br>"Minister Yeo assured Minister Nitya that Dr Thaksin would have no official meeting in Singapore and that his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar would be completely social and private."<br><br>Mr Thaksin, who has been living in exile since the coup, said in an interview on CNN this morning that he came to Singapore to play golf and meet old friends. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's FM gives too much credence to civil liberties, the rule of law and the freedom of expression.<br><br>True, Thaksin was legally entitled to visit Singapore as he had a valid Thai passport. Why doesn't Thailand cancel his passport and strip him of his Thai citizenship? That will stop him from traveling around the world. With a valid passport, Singapore is legally required to grant him entry based on international protocols and conventions unless we trump up charges or pronounce him persona non grata. Maybe that was what we should have done.<br><br>True, Thaksin was legally entitled to meet his friend Jayakumar on a social visit. As long as no official meeting takes place, no national anthem or guard of honour, there was no legal impediment to stop him playing golf in Singapore or meeting a personal friend. True, it is your civil right to associate with whoever you choose as a friend. But Jayakumar is a DPM and so his national duty should supersede his personal interests. It is not in our national interest for him to have Thaksin as a friend and so he should have dumped Thaksin. Although meeting a friend is legal in Singapore (and Jayakumar knows it well as an ex-professor of law), it is not in our interest to allow such a meeting and in the national interest, some rules of law can and should be bent. LHL should have banned Jayakumar from meeting Thaksin.<br><br>True, Thaksin was only exercising his right to freedom of expression by speaking to CNN. True, Singapore cannot stop him if we are to respect such freedom of expression that is enshrined in international protocols and conventions of human rights. But it is not in our national interest to have him speaking against the effective ruler of a neighboring nation. Thaksin will not return to power again, having lost the support of the Thai king. So we should have ignored his right to freedom of expression and muzzled him.</div>
