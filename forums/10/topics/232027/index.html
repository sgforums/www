After assessment of the situation, the Royal Thai Government has decided to implement the following:<br><br>1. Cooperation under the framework of Thailand-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Programme (CSEP) is suspended;<br><br>2. The 8th CSEP Meeting scheduled to be held in Thailand from 29-31 January 2007 is called off; and<br><br>3. The invitation previously extended to Mr. George Yeo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Singapore, to visit Thailand from 29-30 January 2007 is retracted.<br><br>In this regard, it is ThailandÂ’s view that the incident is not consistent with what the President of Singapore told Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont during his official visit to Singapore in November 2006 that Â“We will never betray nor jeopardize that trust between Singapore and Thailand.Â” 16 January 2007</blockquote>2.Thailand discriminate Spore.<br><br>Thaksin <strong><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/070116/3/45zta.html" rel="nofollow"><blockquote> has spent most of his time since then in exile  in London or Beijing</blockquote></a></strong> and spent days in HK.<br><br>Have Thai dared to protest to PRC or UK?<br><br>If Thai do so to PRC and UK ,I salute them.<br><br>3.Spore is not a small bro any more,to any one,even to US.Take note.<br><br>4.Tell me which country will crash with US President just for<br>canning a teen whose name is Michael Faye .<br><br>ONLY SPORE DARE TO DO THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.<br><br>5.Even Thai Foreign Ministry said He and his wife can travel on ordinary passports.<br>So,what is wrong they are in Spore for a private visit?<br><strong><blockquote><a href="http://www.mfa.go.th/web/35.php?id=17886" rel="nofollow">Notwithstanding, both Pol.

If SG don't do it, do you think people still can believe in the law or be happy about it? Can SG still uphold its law? Afterall, SG talks about justices and fairness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its what we call being 'sensitive' to neighbour's feelings.<br><br>its true that Thaksin stayed for quite a while in HK &amp; UK, but did he meet with any political ppl there?  Ok, maybe he did, but if he did, it was not disclosed, so, to outsiders, no one knows better.<br><br>i think the issue is not he visiting Singapore, its no problems because he is not a wanted man, he is not a criminal, he did not commit any crimes as far as we know of.  The sensitivity comes from he meeting our DPM and cabinet minister.  Sure, we claimed that they were friends, granted but, is it a bit "glam" and show-show for the media to report?  If he wants to meet as friends, must it be reported?  I think thats the sensitivity.<br><br>Already, sentiments are ruffled following the sale of Shin Corp although we maintained its above board and I am inclined to agree its clean.  But in this world where the world is not comprised of Singapore alone, sometimes sensitivity should be shown.  I don't think this is kow-towing to Thailand.  Its just being sensitive.  You don't talk happily about your relationship when your friend has just broken up right?<br><br>Same thing here, visit can, sure but since its a private visit, must it be made public?  Its unnecessary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Singapore have no rights to ban anyone without malicious intention to enter Singapore.<br><br>But when an ousted political leader (Thaksin) from a neighbouring country came to visit our political leaders?<br><br>No. It's pure stupidity for any leader to allow a meeting with that particular leader, may it be private or diplomatic visit. At least we don't see any Tom or Dick (where Harry? He is known as MM now) go pay a visit to them as private visit.<br><br>I'm not surprised by the Thais' reaction following that visit.<br><br>One more thing. It's the the Shin Corp incident that ignited the ousting of Thaksin, it is not surprising for the new Thailand governement to be alarmed with Thaksin visiting Singapore political leaders.<br><br>So the "bullying" and "downgrading"?<br><br>It take two hands to clap.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am surprised by some of the remarks made here... Personally I felt that Singapore have every right to let anyone visit or visit anyone. They do not have to seek permission from any Ah Gou or Ah Niao for them to do things. This is especially true since he do not require VISA and he is not a criminal. Sensitivity-wise, all the procedures used are for "private" visit and I do not think we should obey Thai who decide who we should visit or not visit. So is it recommended that this "old friend" of Thaksin can never see him ever again ? I think this is their personal rights.<br><br>It seems to me that the current Thai Gov behaves like little kids claiming "I don't friend him, my friends also cannot friend him" kind of mentality. But seeing the things they had done before, it is not a surprise and they are inflicting more political damage to themselves.<br><br>About the deal with Thaksin telecom company, it is strictly a business deal. It is perfectly legal and it is a tragedy that it have been politicised to this. Nobody can foresee the military coup then.</div>
