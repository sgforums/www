            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All.. I am Thai. I hope I can share some Thai point of view.<br><br>1. There is nothing behind Thai junta govt. decision. They just try to bully a small country like Singapore, but not succesfully.<br><br>2. They are so disturbed by Thaksin who travel around the world. This create uncertenty at home. Most of the Thai still in love with Thaksin. Everytime they see Thaksin 's picture, it create emotional feeling.<br><br>Thai junta is very afraid of riot, mass protest from the Thai people. Since almost every coup happend in the past ended with the mass protest. And this one is likely to have the same fate.<br><br>3. Thai media is not reliable. Don't belive them. They usually lie. Thai middle classed and Thai elite class have been propagandized by them. Only those who really benefit from Thaksin's policy directly, can survive from that black propaganda. This is the situation in Thailand, the Big Lie is happening in Thailand.<br><br>4. Singapore is an honor country. There's no reason for Singapore to regret it. The fault is with Thai stupid PM. Since it's one of two country that ruled by military. ASEAN leaders just finish meeting in Phillipine. Singapore Deputry PM is the one who proposed the new idea of punishing coup d'etat in ASEAN members.<br><br>5. Thaksin has so much money and is a good business man. It's so normal for such kind of person to travel around the region. SG don't have to listen to the other. Why they have to?<br><br>6. The Junta come into power with bad intention. They used the King's name to make the coup. In fact the King already passed the law with special supportive comments attached to the law to have a general election on 15/10/06. But the coup took place on 19/09/06.<br><br>They lie to everyone that the King backed them. The truth is the King doens't want to have any bloodeshed in the country, so no choice. This kind of events happen to him so many times during his 60 years in the position.<br><br>7. All the accusation to Thaksin, can't be proven. For example, the Shincorp-Temasek tax-free deal. It's really no tax. But the media just use their trick to blame him. (the share in his left hand pocket move to his right pocket bf selling to Temasek, there is no point of taxing him.)<br><br>Thaksin already checked with the tax office, they already made official statement saying no tax for that. .....many many more of this kind of story.<br><br>8. If you still can't imagine what I try to explain, just look at Myanmar military Junta. It's quite the same story. Why SG has to regret to what that type of govt. say.<br><br>9. Among Thai, they are afraid of Sigapore using stronger reaction. Thailand is much much weaker then SG now. No one in the world wants to make friend with Thai govt.<br><br>There are still many many more reasons. I know your concern. But there's nothing behind Thai's reaction, there's nothing. If SG react stronger, that could even make Thai middle class go to the street to protest their govt from destroying the friendship among the two countries.<br><br>Regards,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But the reality is that Thais faced a seemingly insoluble political dilemma, Thaksin had placed himself in such a situation it was impossible to dislodge him.For those of you who don't know about some of the shady deals. While it is argued that corruption exists in politics, the fact is that he is still a political exile in Thailand. </blockquote>As a democratic nation, thing should be resolved democratically and not by usurping position with military might. In the case of Taiwan, even though the president is increasing unpopular, they seek to end it using democratic means and not use might. Furthermore the charges laid out are not proven and have little or no evidence. That is why he is not charged nor any evidence shown to prove him guilty at this point of time. Looking at the other side of the picture, he is very capable in dealing with economics in Thailand. Under his wing, Thai recover from the 1997 economic crisis. The GDP increase from 4.9 trillion to 7.1 trillion. It has also improved the life of the poor substantially by increasing their income by as much as 40% and poverty level in the country drop from 21.3% to 11.3%. That is why he is particualrly popular among the poorer people of Thailand. His education and healthcare policies also help the poorer people in Thailand achieve a better life compared with other prime minister. Although he is charge for corruption, corruption level in Thailand actually drop significantly<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaksin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaksin</a><br><br>There is nothing wrong about the sale of Shin Corp. Period. Individuals who sell shares on the stock exchange pay no capital gains tax. That is the law of Thailand.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Supporters, however, counter that Thailand's mobile phone industry is highly competitive, and that little criticism was raised when the Norwegian firm Telenor acquired the country's second largest mobile operator. There was also no criticism when Temasek-owned DBS bought a large stake in Siam Commercial Bank (majority owned by King Bhumibol Adulyadej). Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva had earlier criticized Thaksin for not sufficiently opening up the Thai telecom sector to foreigners. Democrat Party deputy leader Korn Chatikavanij noted "I have always said Shin [Corporation] was safer in Singapore hands than in Thaksin's hands".[117] Supporters further counter that the complete sale of Shin Corporation by the Shinawatra-Damapong families had been a long-standing demand of some public groups,[118] as it would allow Thaksin to undertake his duties as Prime Minister without accusation of conflicts of interest.</span><br></div>

I think it's right that Thais got rid of Thaksin, or his party could become another like ours. That would be a very sad day for Thailand.  I appreciate what is being done now in Thailand  to get rid of all the corrupt practices in the past. Remember Mahathir introducing currency control to save Malaysia, instead of following IMF? Thailand would be better off without Thaksin.</div>

We shouldn't let ourselves be dictated by other countries on what we should do or not. If we only care to appease countries, then we shouldn't push Myanmar to democracy, we shouldn't question Indonesia to stop their burning of the forest, we shouldn't even cane Micheal when he vandalised all the cars and he can vandalised more if he wants to. In the end Singaporean have no rights and power and it becomes a shame to be Singaporean. Let me ask, what is the reason given by the Thai government for this backlash ? Thai citizen cannot go to Singapore for social visit or Singapore foreign minister have to seek approval from Thai Gov to see an old friend ?  What is the charge in this case ? Thaksin holds no official position, probably not even a job and how could his visit be classified as anything other than personal ?</div></blockquote>Everyone is entitled to 'rights', until such time when they abuse their 'rights' will it be revoked.<br><br>I have the right to invite anyone to my house, but i am also obliged to keep my stereo volume down so as not to incite my neighbours. This is not an act of appeasement, but common courtesy. If our govt had informed the current Thai govt of Thaksin's visit before hand, the response would surely have been obvious.<br><br>While our govt responds by claiming that they were 'not informed' of any restrictions on Thaksin by the current Thai govt, what stopped them from pre-empting the Thai govt about a visiting political exile, well aware of the political repercussions and diplomatic fallout?<br><br>This stinks of damage control and mitigation, rather then defending the right course of action.<br><br>Michael Fay should have been caned, just as the Filipino maid was served sentence despite the public outcry. But there's no stopping our govt from adopting a more open approach by hearing out the respective govts (for all the good they will do) and then pass judgement. It slows down the process, but does not impede it, nor circumvent our sovereign rights, and gives a humane approach to our actions.<br><br>All this can only improve our standing in the international community.</div>

Perfectly stupid!</div></blockquote>We hear you loud and clear, my friend, but take note that there are some frustrating people here trying to hammer the singapore government for whatever reasons. I laugh when the non Thai said that Thailand is better without Thaksin. I laugh when people talk about democracy but support a military coup, may be they think the Taiwanese military should be used to oust ah bian. Thai military is known to be capable of shooting students on the street and I guess the King really don't want that to happen again. Its sad.<br><br>There are some Singaporean here who cannot migrate because other countries don't want them, they can't vote the PAP out cause there are no credible replacement, they can't gather enough people to go on the streets like the Thai and the Taiwanese, deep down inside they really wish singapore military could also launch a coup and take over the government, but, alas, they also don't want to do NS....<br><br>Personally, your Thai government changed so often in the past, don't know which one to listen to. Thaksin appears to the most popular one, voted in democratically 3 times, now some middle class want him out, must be because they didn't get what they want. My friends in Thailand will continue to be my friends, welcome in Singapore anytime, but if your government continue to change laws and regulations like you change the government, I will pull out my very little investment there, and I believe my company would do the same, the angmoh want democracy, you know.<br><br>I am a singaporean, I vote for WP, I visit Thailand 7 times last year, I wish your military return the government to the people, whoever they are, and may the military stays out of all governments, Thailand or anywhere else.<br><br></div>

The overall economy and income improve and with that increase the budget of the government. Before Thaksin becomes Prime Minister he already is a business man with Shin Corp. The growth of telecommunication is not localised in Thailand only but is a worldwide phenomenon and one cannot say they purposely increase the ease of telecommunication to earn money from it. Furthermore telecommunicaton competition is encouraged in Thailand. If Thaksin make use of his political clout for his personal gain, then why are there other foreign telecommunication company allowed in Thailand  ?<br><br></div>
