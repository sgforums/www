The evidence includes the ousted prime minister's letter of consent that was sought by the military-appointed assets scrutiny committee to back up its probe, according to the source. Khunying Potjaman is alleged to have bought the land at a price much lower than market value. The panel also suspected that the bidding conditions were manipulated to help her secure the deal. This issue has led to debate about whether or not Mr Thaksin breached Article 100 of the Counter Corruption Act which bars state officials, the prime minister, members of the cabinet and their spouses from entering into or having interests in a contract with a state agency where they have authority to oversee, control, regulate and execute. Article 122 of the same act which stipulates punishment for breaching Article 100 said the officials would not be guilty if they can prove they did not acknowledge or permit the action(s) of their spouse. But this kind of immunity seems to no longer apply to Mr Thaksin, then the premier, as the source close to the issue said Mr Thaksin had submitted his letter of consent to the Land Department one day before the deal was secured by his wife. </strong><br></blockquote></div>

I think it truly look down humanity.<br></div></blockquote>It was a technical issue.  In parts of Bangkok and in southern Thailand, most TRT candidates were elected on minority votes after the majority of voters used the "abstain" option on their ballot papers. In a number of southern seats TRT candidates failed to poll the required 20% of registered voters, rendering the results in these seats invalid. Thus as there were still quite a number of empty seats in the government, the government was not recognised and the election considered not valid.</div>

Wife of Thaksin bought the land in the bidding from FIDF.<br><br>They accused that the deal was invalid, when Thaksin was still in the govt. It's accused this ..conflict of interest.<br><br>The truth is FIDF is a free body. It's not under governmenet. It's under Bank of Thailand. It's set up for that pupurse.

But nobody is willing to do, because it's so obvious that it is not illegal.<br><br>Anyway, the Junta and the team keep trying say to newspaper. And the bad nespaper keep playing this articles. And ignorance keep reading it withing trying to find the reality. They thought they know more than the others.<br><br>.....................<br><br>Now Thaksin is in China, his lawyer said that some media wants to make some interview from him. ....... If this is true, I hope that Thai Junta will make some protest by calling the ambassdor of China in Thailand to give some lecture.<br><br>Moreover, Thaksin 2 months ago visit Indonesia meeting the minister and having dinner or lunch together on private visit. .... Thais junta quiet??<br><br>......... Now in Bangkok, I heard people saying that the media or the junta men trying to setup a group of person to protest in front of Singaporean embassy. (pls be sure that, it's setting up)<br><br>I hope that Singaporean will act stronger. The message from Foreign Minister is nice and polite to deal with these uncivilized group of people.</div>

However right now, what we don't understand is why Singapore allowed herself to be embroiled in this controversy. Isn't it better to just play a neutral role? Singapore has nothing to gain out of this. Absolutely NOTHING.<br><br>The only winner from this unfortunate event? Thaksin. If you think about it, the Thai junta has nothing to gain from poor relations with Singapore in the long term, neither does Singapore have anything to gain. Thaksin has played his cards well, he is trying to focus the media spotlight on the current government. Whether or not the current Junta is good or bad is besides the issue.<br><br>Singapore has unfortunately allowed herself to be used again. Hope everything turns out well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a question... if CNN want to interview Thaksin and Thaksin agree, under what law and reason should Singapore give to prevent the 2 parties from conducting the interview  ? If we forcefully stop the 2 parties from interviewing, CNN may portray Singapore in a bad light and still rub the wrong way for Thaksin supporters in Thailand... Another thing is... I believe Thaksin cannot go to Hong Kong as that will require a VISA... and no country is going to issue him with a VISA...</div>
