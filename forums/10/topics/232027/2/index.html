Personally I felt that Singapore have every right to let anyone visit or visit anyone. They do not have to seek permission from any Ah Gou or Ah Niao for them to do things. This is especially true since he do not require VISA and he is not a criminal. Sensitivity-wise, all the procedures used are for "private" visit and I do not think we should obey Thai who decide who we should visit or not visit. So is it recommended that this "old friend" of Thaksin can never see him ever again ? I think this is their personal rights.<br><br>It seems to me that the current Thai Gov behaves like little kids claiming "I don't friend him, my friends also cannot friend him" kind of mentality. But seeing the things they had done before, it is not a surprise and they are inflicting more political damage to themselves.<br><br>About the deal with Thaksin telecom company, it is strictly a business deal. It is perfectly legal and it is a tragedy that it have been politicised to this. Nobody can foresee the military coup then. </div></blockquote>Should you be 'surprised' at all at the reaction of the Thai military govt? Does it not in any way mirror the typical response from our ruling party when it suits them? The way our govt lacks the human touch when providing a response to its own people, is a clear reflection of the mannerism our govt conducts itself, answerable to no one save their own.<br><br>Given the already political atmosphere and animosity between the current Thai govt and Thaksin, it should come as no surprise that Singapore's preceived belligerence bellies the arrogance in their actions. Could it be that our learned ministers and leaders failed to take into account the political repercussions of such a 'social visit'?<br><br>Surely after Temaesk's buyout of Shin Corp sparking dismay among the Thais, arguably the indirect cause of the military coup, along with the friendly nature Thakin enjoys with our govt, how could anyone expect the current Thai administration to consider his recent 'social vist' to be little more than a house call and private get-together?<br><br>Has our govt, coupled by many of the responses in this thread, failed to consider the insensitivity of our govt's 'learned' actions, despite their claims to sovereign rights as a nation?<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">Singapore is "saddened" with Thailand's action over Thaksin's meeting with Jayakumar<br>It regrets Thai government's decision to cancel exchange programme and rescind invitation to Foreign Minister George Yeo to attend a joint meeting<br><br>By Irene Ngoo<br>Jan 16, 2007<br>AsiaOne<br><br>Singapore says it is "saddened" that Thailand had decided to cancel a civil service exchange programme with Singapore and rescind its invitation to Foreign Minister George Yeo to attend the joint meeting in Bangkok at the end of this month, in what is seen as a protest against a meeting between ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar last weekend.<br><br>The latest Thai diplomatic retaliation came shortly after Singapore's ambassador to Thailand, Mr Peter Chan, was summoned by the Thai Foreign Ministry permanent secretary earlier today to explain why Mr Thaksin was allowed to meet such a top government figure in the city-state.<br><br>The Singapore Foreign Ministry had said Mr Thaksin was in Singapore for a private visit and had requested to meet Professor Jayakumar, who is an "old friend."<br><br>"We expressed dissatisfaction with the incident and the explanation made by Singapore authorities," Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kitti Wasinondh said today, explaining why the Thai government was suspending the Thailand-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Programme (CSEP) and cancelling the CSEP coordinating meeting that was scheduled to be held from Jan 29 to 31. Bangkok also rescinded an invitation to Minister Yeo to attend the joint meeting.<br><br>"Singapore should be more cautious about allowing such movements since we have already revoked Thaksin's diplomatic passport," added the spokesman, who said Singapore's ambassador was informed of the Thai government's decision during his meeting with foreign ministry permanent secretary Krit Garnjana-Goonchorn.<br><br>The Singapore Foreign Ministry, in response to media queries on Thailand's action, said in a statement tonight: "The Singapore Government hopes that Thailand can appreciate Singapore's position on the visit.<br><br>"The Thai Government did not notify us that Dr Thaksin has been charged for any offence. There is also no restriction on where he can travel to. He had chosen to make a visit to Singapore on his own. Dr Thaksin had asked to meet Deputy Prime Minister Professor S Jayakumar, who is an old friend.<br><br>"It was purely a social and private meeting. No official calls or meetings were arranged. Thai nationals do not require visas to visit Singapore. There is no reason for Singapore to turn Dr Thaksin away. Prior to Singapore, Dr Thaksin had also visited several other countries without any protest by the Thai Government."<br><br>The statement said Singapore was "saddened" that the Thai government had chosen to take this course of action."<br><br>"We hope Thailand will respect Singapore's position as that of a sovereign country. We value the longstanding friendly relations with Thailand," it added.<br><br>Since his removal in a military coup on Sept 19, Mr Thaksin has spent most of his time travelling to London, Beijing, Hong Kong, Bali and now Singapore, where he is expected to stay for a couple more days before leaving for China, said an AFP report.<br><br>He also used his Singapore visit to give his first televised interview since his ouster, telling the American media that he had no intention of returning to Thai politics and had nothing to do with the bomb blasts in the capital on New Year's Eve, which the military has blamed on his political supporters. He also warned that the Thai public would not tolerate military rule in the kingdom for long.<br><br>Thai military government muzzling media coverage on Thaksin<br><br>AP reports: The military council that removed Thaksin has renewed attempts to muzzle the media and its coverage of Thaksin. The generals asked broadcasters last week to limit coverage of comments by Thaksin and his representatives in the name of national unity, prompting a media outcry. But the government succeeded in blocking certain broadcasts.<br><br>A CNN interview with Thaksin broadcast elsewhere on Monday evening was not shown in Thailand.<br><br>Cable TV provider UBC decided "not to broadcast the interview," said a UBC official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. The official said there had been no particular order from coup leaders not to air the interview.<br><br>CNN spokeswoman Yvonne Yuen at the network's Asian headquarters in Hong Kong had no immediate comment.<br><br>"We are unable to comment on the action taken by affiliates," she said.<br><br>Since the coup, the military and the temporary government it installed have blamed Thaksin and his supporters for trying to cause unrest to destabilize the country. Thaksin has denied the allegations, for which no evidence has been produced.<br><br>Thaksin has been barred from returning to the country since the coup.<br><br>In the CNN interview, Thaksin repeated that he has retired from politics.<br><br>"Enough is enough," he said, adding that it was time to "contribute to the Thai society outside the political arena."<br><br>In a separate interview published Monday in The Wall Street Journal, Thaksin said he would not try to return to power.<br><br>"I reassure them they shouldn't feel worried about me," he said, adding that he will not seek to regain his old job, but will remain a member of his political party.<br><br>Reader's comment<br><br>An AsiaOne reader, Mr Eng Frank, who read this story, immediately posted his comments on AsiaOne, saying: "The new Thai government appointed after the coup is practising strong arm bullying tactic as far as the recent visit by the ousted former PM to Singapore is concerned.<br><br>"Why don't they summon the Chinese High Com,US High Com,British High Com and Indonesian High Com to give an account as to why their governments provide free travel and freedom for Mr Thaksin to stay?" </span></blockquote></div>

In so doing, the CNS is no different from Mr Thaksin who, during his past five years in office, has resorted to all the tricks to silence the media and journalists who are critical of him or his administration. </blockquote>3.i like SG do things in board day light---Sue it,ban it,censor it.<br>NO hidden agenda.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by socrates:</div><div class="quote_body">My point is that Singapore and Singaporean has every right to visit anyone or let anyone visit them. We shouldn't let ourselves be dictated by other countries on what we should do or not. If we only care to appease countries, then we shouldn't push Myanmar to democracy, we shouldn't question Indonesia to stop their burning of the forest, we shouldn't even cane Micheal when he vandalised all the cars and he can vandalised more if he wants to. In the end Singaporean have no rights and power and it becomes a shame to be Singaporean. </div></blockquote>Yes, but at what cost? Is it worth maintaining these rights at the cost of degrading the good diplomatic ties that Thailand and Singapore enjoy? I would beg to differ regarding your examples.<br><br>1) Pushing Myanmar to democracy - Singapore is not pushing Myanmar.<br><br><blockquote><strong>ASEAN, comprising Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, has a policy of not interfering in its members affairs.<br><br>But with Myanmar due to assume the ASEAN chair in 2006 and host regional meetings with the West, Southeast Asia is under pressure from key trading partners Europe and the United States to take a harder line against Yangon.<br><br>Although there are no reliable statistics on trade between Singapore and Myanmar, business links are growing, underlined by the sale last year of British American Tobacco's 60-percent stake in a Yangon tobacco firm to Singapore's Distinction Investment Holdings Ltd.<br><br>Since Myanmar allowed foreign direct investment at the end of 1988, Singaporeans have invested more than $1.5 billion in the military-ruled country despite sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union for its poor human rights record.<br></strong></blockquote>2) Asking Indonesia to stop the forest fires and illegal land-clearing - In actual fact Indonesia has seeked Singapore's help in containing the forest fires. Singapore has offered help in terms of identifying the areas deemed more susceptible to forest fires.<br><br>3) Caning Michel Fay - Anyone who commits an offence in Singapore should face the consequences. No ifs no buts. Michel Fay is a criminal and we made our stance, fair. Thaksin's presence in Thailand is required to assist in further investigations, thus wanted, thus guilty unless proven otherwise.<br><br>Based on what you said, Singapore should have given the recommended strokes of the rotan, however it was revised and promptly reduced. They SHOULD have made a stance since we are a sovereign nation...<br><br>Can you not see my point? Singapore often asks for the extradition of Singaporean criminals from foreign lands, is this encroaching on other nations' sovereignty? No! If the crime is committed on Singapore's land, let he/she be judged by the laws of Singapore!<br><br><blockquote><strong>Thai citizen cannot go to Singapore for social visit or Singapore foreign minister have to seek approval from Thai Gov to see an old friend ?  What is the charge in this case ? Thaksin holds no official position, probably not even a job and how could his visit be classified as anything other than personal ?</strong></blockquote>Thaksin holds no official position but his visit entails a visit to his dear friend, a Cabinet Officer in Singapore, sovereignty or not, it is very insensitive.<br><br>In the case of you calling me childish, I would beg to differ again. If it is a small argument, perhaps so, but what if your worst enemy committed a grave act? What if your best friend KNOWS about the hideous acts and still meets up with him DESPITE your personal requests?<br><br>Singapore has it's own rights, but I urge greater sensitivity.</div>
