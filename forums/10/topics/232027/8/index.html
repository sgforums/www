Why doesn't Thailand cancel his passport and strip him of his Thai citizenship? That will stop him from traveling around the world. With a valid passport, Singapore is legally required to grant him entry based on international protocols and conventions unless we trump up charges or pronounce him persona non grata. Maybe that was what we should have done.<br><br>True, Thaksin was legally entitled to meet his friend Jayakumar on a social visit. As long as no official meeting takes place, no national anthem or guard of honour, there was no legal impediment to stop him playing golf in Singapore or meeting a personal friend. True, it is your civil right to associate with whoever you choose as a friend. But Jayakumar is a DPM and so his national duty should supersede his personal interests. It is not in our national interest for him to have Thaksin as a friend and so he should have dumped Thaksin. Although meeting a friend is legal in Singapore (and Jayakumar knows it well as an ex-professor of law), it is not in our interest to allow such a meeting and in the national interest, some rules of law can and should be bent. LHL should have banned Jayakumar from meeting Thaksin.<br><br>True, Thaksin was only exercising his right to freedom of expression by speaking to CNN. True, Singapore cannot stop him if we are to respect such freedom of expression that is enshrined in international protocols and conventions of human rights. But it is not in our national interest to have him speaking against the effective ruler of a neighboring nation. Thaksin will not return to power again, having lost the support of the Thai king. So we should have ignored his right to freedom of expression and muzzled him. </div></blockquote>On what basis does the current Thai Administration have the right to 'strip' Thaksin of his passport and citizenship? He is not a fugitive (at least no charges have been brought against him as yet) and the military coup itself was 'undemocratic' and leaning towards a criminal act against a legitimate govt. The only thing that lends credibility is the blessing of the Thai King.<br><br>There is no stopping a normal person from entering a country of his choice. But meeting with specific people of power within that country's govt is another matter.<br><br>What strikes me as typical of our govt is their attempts to claim the moral high ground by first indicating that 'yes i did inform the Thai administration of Thaksin's impending visit', and then followed by a 'well, its a social call, i can't stop him from meeting 'friends' ', knowing that repercussions would follow.<br><br>Whether or not the current Thai administration is legit is irrelevant. It is the defiant act itself that displays our contempt and arrogance towards our neighbours. That does not bode well for future diplomatic relations and enhances Malaysia's gribe that we are a bunch of cold, calculative fish.</div>

The fact is, they have won and they can do it. If the military junta does not want Thaksin to go around garnering support around the world, they can cancel his passport. What basis? On the basis that they have the power to do so.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>There is no stopping a normal person from entering a country of his choice.

Pray tell on what basis can a government stop Thaksin from meeting his friend without infringing his right to free association?<br><br>As I said, Singapore should have stopped that meeting on the grounds that it is not in our national interests. Of course we will infringe his human rights, but we must not be afraid to do that if it is in the national interests.<br><br>At least I am prepared to call a spade a spade...unlike the hypocrites who champion civil liberties when they can take a swipe at the government but are strangely silent when the government did the very thing they advocate.<br><br>Civil liberties are not sacrosanct.

I thought you people who always talk about human rights and civil liberties would welcome any action that protects someone's right to free association and freedom of expression? If the government had not allowed Thaksin to meet Jayakumar and speak to the press, would you not also condemn the government for curbing freedom of expression and ignoring human rights?<br><br>I agree with you that the government should not have allowed the meeting but for a different reason. I believe national interests must come before civil liberties and so the government was wrong. As for you, the government is always wrong.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The role of a monarch is largely ceremonial; however King Bhumibol has stepped in only in times of national crisis.<br><br>For those who mentioned that Thaksin has played a bigger role for creating what Thailand is today, I urge you to think again. The King of Thailand has little direct power under the constitution but is a symbol of national identity and unity.<br><br>King Bhumibol Â— who has been on the throne since 1946 Â— commands enormous popular respect and moral authority, which he has used on occasion to resolve political crises that have threatened national stability.<br><br>He also mentioned he will not get actively involved in politics unless it comes to a point whereby the people of Thailand are deeply divided. There is a right time for every action and he chooses his next move carefully. LetÂ’s respect this man ok?<br><br><blockquote><br>Although Bhumibol is a constitutional monarch, he has several times made decisive interventions in Thai politics, including the political crisis of 2005-2006. Bhumibol has been widely credited with facilitating Thailand's transition to democracy in the 1990s, although in earlier periods of his reign he supported military regimes. Most recently, he did not oppose the September 2006 coup which overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.<br><br>Bhumibol uses his great wealth to fund numerous development projects, particularly in rural areas. He is immensely popular in Thailand, and is revered as a semi-divine figure by many Thais. Critics, mostly outside Thailand, attribute this status to the suppression of criticism of the monarchy. </blockquote><blockquote><br>During the 1970's, Bhumibol was a key figure in the Village Scouts and Red Gaur. In October 1973 after massive protests and the deaths of a large number of pro-democracy demonstrators led by students, Bhumibol asserted himself politically for the first time by opening the gates of the Chitralada Palace to fleeing students, and holding audiences with their leaders.</blockquote><blockquote><br>In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. A coup on February 23, 1991 put Thailand back under military dictatorship. After a general election, held in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be the Prime Minister. This caused much dissent, and the conflict escalated to demonstrations and then to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control the protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as neither side would back down and the violence escalated.<br>Bhumibol summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda's resignation soon afterwards. It was one of the few public occasions where Bhumibol directly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward leading to a civilian government.</blockquote></div>

He was Singapore's ambassador to the playground of diplomats, the United Nations, and its Foreign Minister at a time when the country's relations with Malaysia were at their testiest.<br>.<br>So, why did he agree to the meeting?<br>.<br><strong>Two possibilities: One, sovereignty.</strong><br>.<br>Being an impossibly small nation surrounded by big players, Singapore has not compromised, at least publicly, on its sovereignty.<br>.<br>It was a stand espoused by Singapore's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and its first Foreign Minister S Rajaratnam way back, after the separation with Malaysia in 1965. Legally or diplomatically, the Republic never gave in to pressure.<br>.<br><strong>Whether it was pressure from Indonesia not to hang its marines who bombed MacDonald House on Orchard Road during the Indonesian Confrontation, or the outpouring of anger and protests in Malaysia and Indonesia against the official visit of Israeli President Chaim Herzog in 1986 Â— Singapore stuck to its guns.</strong><br>.<br>In the latter case, this was so even though it was accepted that inviting the President was not the best thing to do because of the sensitivities of Singapore's Muslim neighbours.<br>.<br><strong>Two, the signals from Bangkok were, at best, not clear; at worst not read well.<br>.</strong><br>It is becoming clearer by the day that Thai politics is in a state of flux. A country flip-flopping within 24 hours of announcing major changes to its economic management (read: capital controls); talking about self-sufficiency economics (read: economic barriers); and not making a fuss when it was first told of the proposed Jayakumar-Thaksin meeting (read: hazy power structure) Â— means that relations have to be handled with care.<br>.<br>That is because every shade of opinion can become contradictory, every tea leaf discoloured.<br>.<br>What finally broke the camel's back, as veteran diplomat Kishore Mahbubani said in an interview with this paper, was Mr Thaksin breaking his silence and criticising the military government in interviews with high-profile news organisations such as CNN and the AWSJ.<br>.<br>Was Singapore outfoxed by Mr Thaksin, as Mr Mahbubani had suggested?<br>.<br>More than that, did Singapore read a good friend wrongly?<br><br></blockquote>-----<br>P N Balji<br>Editorial Director<br>balji@mediacorp.com.sg<br>Â— News Comment by P N Balji<br>balji@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlethaksinpress38.html" rel="nofollow">even Thai FM admitted The meeting with DPM Jayakuma  was purely social and private</a></strong>----15 Jan 07<br>http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=116023<br><br><blockquote>(Thai)Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram played down the Singapore report.

            <div class='col-md body'>Look. If you go to any democracy, a mature one, the rule of law, the constitution is absolute. Human relationships to hell. Sure, there are exceptions to the rule, but note so that the rule of law is well respected and mob rule is heavily frowned upon. How about this, you commit a crime, and then you cry fowl that the police are being too legalistic. Stupid argument right?<br><br>There was absolutely nothing on the basis of rule of law that would deny the right of the DPM to meet Thaksin. It was used as a mere excuse for the Thais to beat the Nationalistic drum. The Thais can be very very nationalistic at times, and back in WWII, they actually heavily supported the Japanese, despite the attempts to pretend that issue never happened. They even invaded some neighbouring country.. forgot which one. Royalty back then did not have the respect they had now. Hell, the king abdicated because of the clashes with the Junta back then.<br><br>What really ticked the Thais off was the use of CNN and ANN to fire shots at the Thai Junta. The Thai Junta are fast realising that there is virtually nothing to pin Thaksin on, and they know people are getting restless.<br><br>Typical military types to think they can write the law as they so wished.
