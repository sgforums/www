The following is a transcript of the interview. Rivers began by asking Shinawatra about his alleged involvement in New Year bombings in Bangkok.<br><br>Shinawatra: It's baseless allegations. No one believes so. Because everyone knows who is, who am I. I come from election, I come from the people. I owe gratitude to our people. I do everything for the good of the country and the people. I don't do something that's stupid.<br><br>Rivers: So you had no involvement.<br><br>Shinawatra: Not involvement at all. But I would like to express my deep sympathy, deepest sympathy for those who lose, lost their loved ones and also all those who are injured. And the individuals who are involved must be brought to justice.<br><br>Rivers: This is the first time you've spoken since the coup of September the 19th, first of all, you were in the United States, in New York at the U.N., when this happened, how did you find out that this was going on?<br><br>Shinawatra: Well I find out just about four, five hours before, before it happened, but I trying to get into the television station but it's very difficult at that time I cannot get into it until I can get into channel 9 briefly, but you know, which I, it's a rumors at that time but I don't believe that this can happen again in the 21st century.<br><br>Rivers: So it was surprise when it happened?<br><br>Shinawatra: It's very surprise because you know, but anyway 70 years in Thailand, 17 coup happened is very unfortunate but it's, it's an event that happened here in Thailand.<br><br>Rivers: Will you go back to, back to politics?<br><br>Shinawatra: No. No. (DR: Go back as a private ... ) Enough is enough. Six years you serve the countries. You been working hard. You sacrifice your time even your life. And, even your family life. So it's, it's time for me to go back as a private citizen. And contribute to the Thai society outside political arena. </blockquote></div>

It reflects very badly on yourself. If ppl here are wat u say they are, they would'nt be able to communicate at all. Perhaps, if u are smarter than all the ppl here, u should be actually making tonnes of money and be so rich that u will be living in cloud nine!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  U would'nt need to worry about what goes on in Singapore.  U can be residing in the best country [if there is such a country] with no worries about a country's political scene at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
