            <div class='col-md body'>It's indisputable that the cartoons were in bad taste.  Freedom of speech does not mean that one is free to insult others and must be practiced with prudence.  Nonetheless, the violent and frenzied reactions of the muslims is grossly out of proportion and only serve to reinforce the negative impression that one may have of the religion i.e. it is prone to violence and knee-jerk reactions. It is undeniable that Islam has become a most violent and destructive religion although only a small minority are responsible for the excesses and brutalities we see on TV almost on a daily basis. As someone stated earlier, this could be due to the fact that they may have a seige mentally and are behaving as would a cornered wounded rat in the face of a ferocious cat.</div>

That's why i'm always suspicious of any one , of any religion, who is overly pious, for the minds of these people are closed to reason, they have been brainwashed by dogma, just take a look at those extreme nutcases that pop up every now and then at Eternal hope (no offence to the majority of the decent, thinking people there)<br><br>you know, in the end, all this protests, I think, were pointless and silly, not just overboard. Think about it, you can legislate all you want, the papers can censor themselves all they want, but you can't stop people thinking what they want to. the protesters can stop the publishing of these caricatures, they can extract an apology from the goverment of these countries (which is stupid, cos these countries have an independent press, unlike the press of some of these protesting countries, so they are basically barking up the wrong tree). But in the end, all they've succeeded in doing, was not to claim more space for themselves, either in the societies they are living in, or the internatinal community, but in leaving a bad taste in people's mouths, and make other more suspicious and wary of them and their religion. Any reaction may very well beget an equal reaction, violent protests will trigger backlashes in turn ... remember the racial riots in Australia recently ? this is a classic example ... I guess the only people laughing now are the far rights and the white supremacists in these European countries, telling the legions of new supporters "I told you so.... "<br><br>it's a step backwards if you ask me ... and that's the tragedy of it all ...</div>
