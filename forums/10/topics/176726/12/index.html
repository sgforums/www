Unfortunately, this violence takes many forms and occurs across national, cultural, racial, and religious borders.<br><br>Islam condemns all forms of violence against women. The basic Islamic premise of equality between women and men cannot be achieved so long as violence against women persists.<br><br>Islam requires that husbands treat their wives with respect and it prohibits any form of physical or emotional abuse. The Quran requires that spouses treat each other with love and mercy. (Quran 30:21). Moreover, the Quran repeatedly warns against the use of injurious statements by a husband against his wife. (Quran 58:2-4).<br><br>Rape, unfortunately, remains a common form of violence against women. In addition, the woman is often blamed for being the victim of rape. Islam views rape as a violent crime against the victim, against society, and against God.<br><br>The perpetrator has committed a crime and hence is morally and legally responsible.<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>The victim is an unwilling partner in the sex act and thus bears neither blame nor stigma</strong>.</span><br><br>To either ostracize or condemn the victim because she was compelled to engage in sexual intercourse is against the laws of Islam as the victim was an unwilling, and therefore, a blameless participant.<br><br>Female genital mutilation, another form of violence against women, has no basis in Islam. Rather, it is a cultural practice which must be eliminated through education and the empowerment of women.<br><br>Islam's mandate of equality between women and men necessitates that all forms of violence against women be eradicated, for so long as women suffer abuses, women cannot achieve their full potential as free and equal members of society.<br><br></span></blockquote></div>

That's why we've said that if people feel insulted, we regret it. Insulting people was never on our agenda. But there's absolutely no way we will apologise for publishing the cartoons. If we apologise, then we let down the many generations who have fought for freedom of expression and other civil rights.'</blockquote>-----<strong><a href="http://www.jp.dk/udland/artikel:aid=3544978:fid=11328/" rel="nofollow">Jyllands-Posten Editor-in-chief Carsten Juste on Interview by JOHN HANSEN, published on the 18th of December 2005.</a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.jp.dk/udland/tema:fid=11328/" rel="nofollow">more stories</a></strong><br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://www.jp.dk/udland/artikel:aid=3544960:fid=11328/" rel="nofollow">At last,they said HALF sorry.Is it too late??</a></strong>-----The editor's dilemma,<br>Interview by Pierre Collignon, published on the 5th of February 2006<br><br><blockquote> In a statement addressed to the: `Honourable fellow citizens of the Muslim world' - the statement now acknowledged that the drawings, despite not being in conflict with Danish law, had 'indisputably' offended many Muslims, 'for which we must apologise'.<br><br>editor-in-chief Carsten Juste himself characterizes use of the word `apology' as a `semantic manoeuvre' and emphasises that his newspaper's position in the Mohammed dispute remains the same as always:<br><br>`Part one is that we maintain our freedom of expression. <strong>We will never apologise for that.</strong> Therefore we cannot apologise for publishing the drawings. Part two is that we regret offending the many Muslims who took offence. What's new is that we have now simply added an apology to part two.'</blockquote><strong>With the following attitudes,i can gurantee u more troubles are<br>coming</strong><br><blockquote>Some imams have demanded not just an apology, but an undertaking that Jyllands-Posten will not publish drawings of the Prophet again. Can you promise that?<br><br>`No, I can definitely not promise not to do it again. It could be that we won't do it again, but we can't make that a promise. If we did, we would be curbing freedom of expression.'<br><br>But will you do it again?<br><br>`I have already said that we will take a break, but of course I cannot rule out that if a situation comes along where it seems relevant to do it, then we must do it.'<br><br>What is today's editorial line in relation to satirical drawings of Islam and the prophet Mohammed in Jyllands-Posten?<br><br>`The editorial policy is that we will not rule out the possibility of publishing drawings of Mohammed in a relevant context. One can see that the drawing of Mohammed with a bomb in his turban particularly sticks in their caw. We would be very unlikely to publish a drawing like that.'<br><br>Why not?<br><br>`Because so many people were offended by that one drawing in particular. That tells us that if that really is the case, then we have ethical standards ordering us to be cautious.'</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Danish paper rejected Jesus cartoons </strong><br><br>Gwladys FouchÃ©<br>Monday February 6, 2006<br><br>Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper that first published the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that have caused a storm of protest throughout the Islamic world, refused to run drawings lampooning Jesus Christ, it has emerged today.<br>The Danish daily turned down the cartoons of Christ three years ago, on the grounds that they could be offensive to readers and were not funny.<br><br>In April 2003, Danish illustrator Christoffer Zieler submitted a series of unsolicited cartoons dealing with the resurrection of Christ to Jyllands-Posten.<br><br>Zieler received an email back from the paper's Sunday editor, Jens Kaiser, which said: "I don't think Jyllands-Posten's readers will enjoy the drawings. As a matter of fact, I think that they will provoke an outcry. Therefore, I will not use them."<br><br>The illustrator said: "I see the cartoons as an innocent joke, of the type that my Christian grandfather would enjoy."<br><br>"I showed them to a few pastors and they thought they were funny."<br><br>But the Jyllands-Posten editor in question, Mr Kaiser, said that the case was "ridiculous to bring forward now. It has nothing to do with the Muhammad cartoons.<br><br>"In the Muhammad drawings case, we asked the illustrators to do it. I did not ask for these cartoons. That's the difference," he said.<br><br>"The illustrator thought his cartoons were funny. I did not think so. It would offend some readers, not much but some."<br><br>The decision smacks of "double-standards", said Ahmed Akkari, spokesman for the Danish-based European Committee for Prophet Honouring, the umbrella group that represents 27 Muslim organisations that are campaigning for a full apology from Jyllands-Posten.<br><br>"How can Jyllands-Posten distinguish the two cases? Surely they must understand," Mr Akkari added.<br><br>Meanwhile, the editor of a Malaysian newspaper resigned over the weekend after printing one of the Muhammad cartoons that have unleashed a storm of protest across the Islamic world.<br><br>Malaysia's Sunday Tribune, based in the remote state of Sarawak, on Borneo island, ran one of the Danish cartoons on Saturday. It is unclear which one of the 12 drawings was reprinted.<br><br>Printed on page 12 of the paper, the cartoon illustrated an article about the lack of impact of the controversy in Malaysia, a country with a majority Muslim population.<br><br>The newspaper apologised and expressed "profound regret over the unauthorised publication", in a front page statement on Sunday.<br><br>"Our internal inquiry revealed that the editor on duty, who was responsible for the same publication, had done it all alone by himself without authority in compliance with the prescribed procedures as required for such news," the statement said.<br><br>The editor, who has not been named, regretted his mistake, apologised and tendered his resignation, according to the statement.<br><br>(The Guardian, http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,1703498,00.html)<br><br></div>

Who will not accede the message from the God if you believe in one? there should be no such thing as cultural, social or political values that we could not change , is whethere you WANT to change it or not? So, if these people are going to go around killing ppl, are we going to accept these fact and give lame excuses of such?<br><br>How could one accept this. You must FIGHT for what you believe, if not this is not religion. You even fight the evil in you if u must to follow the words of God. If people around you are doing the wrong thing in the name of your own religion, by NOT telling them, by NOT voicing out to them , and by NO EFFORT of CHANGING them, I believe you are already wrong!!! Simple, because you dont live your life for your religion. You wont wan to spread the word of God to these people if they are astray.<br><br>In conclusion, if cultural,social or political values may not he change by the principle in the religion, it would be failure of mankind in the name of their religion, both, those righteous and those who aren't. And it all falls back to the fundamental of the religion, which is to SPREAD the TRUTH , which includes to FIGHT for the truth, and not keep quiet and give meer excuses.<br><br>I do agree with certain points that you give in all the posts by you, however, you know it clearly in your heart, denial can resolve anything. Denying an act which was committed, denying the "faith" of certain brethen and denying the terrorism that some had done to innocent people it is wrong. Scold them, change them, forced them if you must because they are your so call brethens because it is your responsibility to bring those lost sheep back. NO ONE ELSE will do it, if u guys who are righteous dont make the first move.<br><br>Just my thoughts, and be reminded, we must learn to forgive and love. Forgive is an easy word to say, but it takes 1000 guts to do so. For me, i am a Christian to be honest, and we share the old testament. I do admire my pope who really still love a person who tries to murder him and his love is to everyone, even to those who scorned and insulted him. Same goes with Mother Thressa, she is so damnn poor. But she care to sacrifice her life for others. Not to say you are from Afghanistan, Pakistan you cant do charity..yes you are poor , but that doest stop you in doing charity. Words sometimes are useless if they are not put into action. You can quote 1000 beautiful quotations, however, if no action is done, is merely NOTHING.<br><br></div>
