An attempt to assassinate a very highly regarded and high profile muslim cleric/religious leader by a non muslim. The cleric survives.<br><br>2. The biggest, oldest and most beautiful mosque is demolished by a non muslim government despite protests and pressure from muslim leaders not to do so. There were no casualties during the demolishing.<br><br>3. An internationally famous author writes a book making a mockery of various aspects of the muslim community. ie saying that there is an order of clerics that conduct terrorist attacks around the world. The gist of the story is that Muhammud married a prostitute and that he wasn't a real prophet but was installed by the Sultan of Turkey.<br><br>So tell me all you muslims and supporters, what would be the reactions of the muslims around the world?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi just here to offer my 2 cents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I say both sides are at fault-- the Western world being too insensitive and the Muslims way too sensitive. The cartoons protray the Prophet as a terrorist, which is something really unacceptable. But then the muslims retaliated by burning down embassies, killing, etc which is horrific to me.<br><br>I do question the motives of the attacks. Anti-western sentiment is prevalent in the muslims.. The establishment of Israel in the middle-east conflict, the US invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. The cartoons provide the radical muslims a convenient tool to stoke the flames to arouse further anti-western sentiment among the moderate muslims. You can see that the protestors attacked not only Danish embassies, but Norway, US and France. This should serve as a reminder to he western world the anti-western sentiment the most muslims have.<br><br>As I posted earlier, the Indonesian muslim students hated the US to the core.. shouting them devils, etc in the class. When I was in army, a naive guy in my section said he will always support the US in any situations since they brought peace and stability to the world. Straightaway, one muslim section mate of ours immediately stood up and shout vulgarities and even kicked the chair, etc. Eventually he was calmed down after my friend apologised.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just another point to add on.. I wonder how many muslims or the protestors have actually read the Quran or understand the verses.<br><br>I remember there is a Discovery channel documentary that shows the "mercy killing" practise which took place in a village in Pakistan. The journalist went together with an interpretor who was quite well-versed in the Quran. In the documentary, there was a married woman whose eyes were gorged out and her right leg was beaten til crippled. Worse, her nose was chopped into half..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  All these because a stranger asked her for directions one day on the street and her husband saw it. So thinking it was infidelity, the husband actually tried to "mercifully kill" her and according to him in the interview, he actually felt good becasue he had done a good deed. Thankfully, the victim escaped and wanted to press charges against her husband for causing grevious hurt.<br><br>To cut a long story short, the husband justified mercy killing because he said it was mentioned in the Quran. When the journalist asked him which verse was it, the husband could not answer and merely replied it was the village chief who told him. He himself did not even have the Quran. So when they asked the village chief, he showed them the Quran but even he himself could not answer which verse was it. He merely replied it was his father who taught him this "mercy killing" culture. In the end, the husband was found guilty of causing grevious hurt and was sentenced to over 10 years jail. He did not feel anything after the verdict, except commenting that he should be punished because he could not managed to kill his wife.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>In poor villages, most muslims could not afford to go to religious schools to learn about the Quran, etc. I guess that's why terrorism is so widespread in such places. Most of the suicide bombers were misled by false interpretations into thinking suicide bombing is a very sacred thing and that the jihad must be waged against the "white infidels". I myself have not read the Quran (I am not a muslim), but I don't believe the Quran actually encouraged the muslim followers to kill innocent western people.<br><br>And of course, the western countries also have a fondness of stereotyping. Just like stereotyping Singapore as a "fine" country, China as a "bunch of wankers", the mindless attacks on the embassies further prove their stereotyping of the muslims and their religion is "terrosist-based", just like what Salman is trying to tell us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, if you note, there are many Muslims who do go to madrasahs, whether in Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia.

But then the muslims retaliated by burning down embassies, killing, etc which is horrific to me.<br><br>I do question the motives of the attacks. Anti-western sentiment is prevalent in the muslims.. The establishment of Israel in the middle-east conflict, the US invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. The cartoons provide the radical muslims a convenient tool to stoke the flames to arouse further anti-western sentiment among the moderate muslims. You can see that the protestors attacked not only Danish embassies, but Norway, US and France. This should serve as a reminder to he western world the anti-western sentiment the most muslims have.<br><br>As I posted earlier, the Indonesian muslim students hated the US to the core.. shouting them devils, etc in the class. When I was in army, a naive guy in my section said he will always support the US in any situations since they brought peace and stability to the world. Straightaway, one muslim section mate of ours immediately stood up and shout vulgarities and even kicked the chair, etc. Eventually he was calmed down after my friend apologised.<br></div></blockquote>you said this happened in when you were in the army ? ...<br><br>doesn't it send a chill down your spine ? Your friend had to apologise before the chap calmed down ? ... for what ? what did he do wrong ? for having personal opinions different from his ?<br><br>it's not about whether that "naive" guy was right or wrong in his opinions, but whether he can have his own opinions, your muslim section mate need to understand that, kicking the chair, shouting vulgarities etc is not the way to go, perhaps he is the naive one, if he thinks that making a lot of noise like this can change the opinion of others, and this issue is at the core of the disconnect between the West and the Muslim world right now ...<br><br>since we're bordering on so many "taboo" subjects here ... let's go on further ...<br>do you trust that noise maker to fight for Singapore, if the shit ever hits the fan ? when our most potential enemies become our real ones, and they play it down and dirty, invoking the race and religion card, do you trust him to fight for the Flag, fight for Singapore ? or do you think he will answer to a larger brotherhood ?<br><br>Let's be open here, to me, what frightens me are not secretive terrorists  infiltrating into our society and causing mayhem, planting a few bombs etc. it's young men like that chap brainwashed into intolerant and aggressive persons, our society can stand up to a few bombs and terrorists, we did that during confrontasi before remember, but we cannot survive if our national interests are subverted from within ...<br><br>to those thinking Muslim bros reading this in this forum: no, i'm not trying to incite anything over here, but these are real issues that confront us and our security, and pretending it doesn't exist and sweeping it underneath the carpet would never change the present reality. Singapore's society is still very much influenced by external forces, cos we're so intertwined to the outside world. For situations like this, that's where you guys come in, as I've said earlier, it is up to you guys to convince everyone that you guys are equal stakeholders in the society, ready to defend it, ready to die for it. We're still quite a long way away from making this issue go away, we are not 100% comfortable with each other, yet ... and recent external events seemed to be pushing us backwards, but keep in mind that this is a fight that we have to win ... for there is no other way ...</div>

"<br><br>Will you agree that atleast a Catholic is allowed to make the choice and if his choice is jesus rather than Mother Mary,he can renounce being a Catholic and becomming a protestant or a methodist or even a muslim.<br></blockquote>This statement or analogy is seriously flawed.Catholics like other Christians <strong>do not worship Mary</strong>. Worship is only reserved for God.<br><br>However I'm not going into a theological debate on the role Catholics attribute to Mary here.<br><br>I feel as another forumer has mentioned, the problem is with extreme sects. I have great respect  and admiration for the Sufis.
