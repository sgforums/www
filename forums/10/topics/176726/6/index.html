            <div class='col-md body'>dear billy, get your history right.<br>The Crusades came in direct response to 300 years of jihads. The middle east and north Africa was Christian lands to begin with before the jihads. The Christians finally struck back after the sultan banned Christians from pilgrimages to Jerusalem. The crusaders were not blind.<br><br>Neither were the jihadhists blind. They were rewarded with land, booty and slaves with every successful jihad. Those who were martyred in the process were promised a direct passage to heaven.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by resorting to such violent behavior they are only proving that what the danish cartoonists said are true..that muslims are indeed violent. if islam is to be projected as a religion of peace then the violence must be stopped.</div>

There, they had established their own state. But various coalitions of non-Muslim tribes--including Christians, Jews, atheists and animists--continued to go to war with them. This portion of the Qur'an explains their reasoning behind striking back.<br><br>The passage actually <strong>refers to a defensive war</strong>. "You fight back. You go as far as it takes to stop the aggression but you do not go beyond that. So if you have to, you go as far as fighting verbally to get someone out of your home--but you don't shoot him after he is out. <strong>You don't keep going on with it--only if you are attacked, if there is an oppression applied to you</strong>. <strong><span style="color: green;">The idea is that justice prevails. You don't fight because you enjoy fighting, but because there is an oppression. </span></strong><br><br>"It could be military force or [in today's world] it could be media force, writing against you. But when the hostilities are over and the enemy offers a peace treaty, you should submit. Muslims are obliged to submit to a peace treaty offered by the enemy. You don't keep fighting."<br><br>Al-Hajj Talib 'Abdur-Rashid, imam of the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, says <strong><span style="color: green;">the word jihad has its origin in the verb jahada which means to struggle, to fight</span>.</strong> The word has a few different connotations, since struggle can occur on several levels.<br><br>"Muslims understand these levels based not only on the words of Allah in the Qur'an, but also on the authentic statements of the Prophet Muhammad as recorded in our oral traditions, preserved as hadith," he says. According to 'Abdur-Rashid, there are three levels of jihad:<br></blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">Personal Jihad: The most excellent jihad is that of the soul. This jihad, called the Jihadun-Nafs, is the intimate struggle to purify the soul of satanic influence--both subtle and overt. It is the struggle to cleanse one's spirit of sin. This is the most important level of jihad.<br><br><strong>Verbal Jihad</strong>: On another occasion, the Prophet said, "The most excellent jihad is the speaking of truth in the face of a tyrant." He encouraged raising one's voice in the name of Allah on behalf of justice.<br><br><strong>Physical Jihad</strong>: This is combat waged in defense of Muslims against oppression and transgression by the enemies of Allah, Islam and Muslims. We are commanded by Allah to lead peaceful lives and not transgress against anyone, but also to defend ourselves against oppression by "fighting against those who fight against us." This "jihad with the hand" is the aspect of jihad that has been so profoundly misunderstood in today's world.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chapter 2, verse 256: Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.</span><br><br>This passage has been cited to justify expelling non-Muslims from Muslim countries. But Imam Hendi says that not only does the Qur'an avoid any such suggestion, it even prohibits aggressive efforts to convert. <strong><span style="color: green;">"No Muslim is allowed to go out and force people to become Muslim.</span></strong> In the early days of Islam, Jews came to Islam and had younger children and asked Muhammad if they could force Islam on their children because they are younger. This verse [which was] revealed to him says that <strong><span style="color: green;">there can be no compulsion on other religions</span>.</strong> This is very clear.<br><br><strong>What's more, fundamentalist Muslims seldom cite the passages of the Qur'an which are quite religious pluralistic.</strong>  </div></blockquote>[quote]Originally posted by Salman:<strong><br>Lets say some kook turns up with a new religion and say Muhamad was a great prophet under his religion and then sack Mecca.
