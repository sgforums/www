            <div class='col-md body'>Just skewing off a bit here.  Many or maybe most muslims aren't Arabs.  As such, I wonder how many of the non-Arab muslims really understand the religious book (Koran) they recite from.  Do they really know the contents that are in arabic, a language they most probably do not speak or understand well?  If they don't, then they are easy candidates for manipulation by the imams.</div>

I'm sorry if I wasnt clear. The matter is that the word apes and swine, again, are used to describe AMONG those who behave thoughtlessly and are unbashing of commiting wicked acts. The Quran never described the whole Jews like that but it admonishes among the "People of the Book" to return to their own revealed scriptures and act well. It could apply to any group of people, and it did was used in that way, since there are always retards among us. Its the same if you call some Muslims terrorists because of their actions, but you don't mean them all.
