Don't try to sweep it off with such deceptive interpretation on your part.<br>Here's what 5:59-60 says<br><blockquote><br>[5.59] Say: O followers of the Book! do you find fault with us (for aught) except that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before, and that most of you are transgressors?<br>[5.60] Say: Shall I inform you of (him who is) worse than this in retribution from Allah?

So in effect the Quran is saying that most people in the world are apes and pigs by default.<br>And why should anyone be called apes and pigs just because they don't observe the sabbath?

Those verses you pointed out wasnt a reference towards the unbelievers.

The rationale behind cursing some for their sinful stances and deeds could be gradually unfolded if you <span style="font-style: italic;">read through the preceding verses</span> which give the meaning of:<br><br>"O you who believe! do not take for guardians those who take your religion for a mockery and a joke, from among those who were given the Book before you and the unbelievers; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah if you are believers. And when you call to prayer they make it a mockery and a joke; this is because they are a people who do not understand. Say: O followers of the Book! do you find fault with us (for aught) except that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before, and that most of you are transgressors?" 5: 57-59<br><br>Notice, "most" were referred to among those who made mockeries.<br><br>So what is worse in retribution for the mockings? 5:60 "Worse is he whom Allah has cursed and brought His wrath upon, and of whom He made apes and swine, and he who served the Shaitan; these are worse in place and more erring from the straight path."<br><br>I don't see Allah calling any certain group apes or swines. It is again descriptive in the language that "monkeys" - people behaving thoughtlessly and pigs - people neither bashful nor shy of wicked acts.<br><br>These verses should be interpreted in the context of the whole chapter, and the whole issue should be understood in the framework of the whole book and the historical facts. The prophet Muhammad himself had the similar problem as when Jesus, bringing his completing message, wasn't accepted and mocked the same.<br><br><blockquote>So why don't you follow the teachings of Buddha?<br>The Quran never mentioned Buddha specifically so how can you say Buddha was a prophet in Islam.<br>According to your interpretation of Quran, doesn't that make you a pagan?<br></blockquote>Praciticing humanity, goodwill and rationality isnt a Buddhist or Muslim or any religious cause. O__o. I've said before, in every nation there was sent a messenger. Though in Islam, the fives main ones are Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, there are also many many countless saints thoughout humankind. They are recognized such, as rightful messengers, in the result of their time. That doesn't make me a pagan.<br><br><blockquote><br>So why kill apostates?<br>If truth distincts from error, why do Muslims the need to silence critics as what they are trying to do with the publisher of these cartoons?<br>I find it very strange what you Muslims say and what you do.
