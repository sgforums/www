As it is, even with pacifist mentality by the west, the muslims are already adopting a "us against the world" and victim mentality. Don't you think that taking such harsh actions against those same muslims that defy all logic will make them even more hardlining? Won't their clerics tell them that the west is really against them by the actions taken by the west?</blockquote>If you read my suggestion carefully, I suggest being hardline only to hardliners.

An example is the china catholic church.<br><br><blockquote>Response by Atobe:<br>Garbage IN, will result in Garbage OUT.<br><br>The 2 Billions are divided into the main stream Catholics and Christians - with the Christians being "brached" into the main "groups" of Anglicanism, Baptism, Methodism, Protestants, and some other minor Christian Groups and older orthodox Christianity.<br><br>In each of these groups there exist a formal body that sits in the different centres of religious capital - with Catholics in the Vatican, Anglicanism in the Church of England, Methodist in the Methodist Council in the USA, and the others having their own Governing Body that guide their respective religious practices.<br><br>These groups are not allienated by sect, tribe, ethnicity, race, nor culture, traditions, politics, etc.<br><br>Can ISLAM and its Faithful Followers transcend the complexities of their religion that is intertwined into the many tribal, sectarian, ethnic, cultural, traditional, and political practices ? </blockquote>Christianity is very diverse, more so than islam. Any yahoo can get a few friends to his house and strum the guitar to some popular christian songs and claim that he has started a new church.<br><br>There are Baptists, faith baptists, bible baptists, methodist baptists... that's just one string of denomination alone.<br><br>There are also those that do not brance from any major denominations, such as new creations and city harvest. They claim no ties to any other denominations. There are hundreds more in USA and europe.<br><br>Catholics are the most stringent and tightly managed, hence there are less catholic denominations.<br><br>The history of christianity is as complex, bloody and intertwined as islamic denominations. Can you imagine that every christian denomination claims to be the original and first church?<br><br><blockquote>Response by Atobe:<br>The privilege should have gone to you first, since you are more familiar and learned in ISLAM, as you seem bent in your conviction that you have the ability to READ and HAVE READ the entire QURAN; and will be more accepted too, since you have those TWENTY FRIENDS "who do not question" and whom you based all your SLANTED VIEWS toward ISLAM and the Muslims.<br><br>Is it any surprise that Mike Jackson had a song "Man in the mirror" ?<br><br>He is also a "no brainer" too - if you realise, since you are so familiar with that song, and you should also know the numerous "no brainer" antics that he is capable of performing - he appreciates "sucks" too.<br><br>Is that not familiar to us all by now of your inclination to "sweet babes" - just like Mike Jackson ? .    </blockquote>...<br><br><blockquote>Response by Atobe:<br>Can we believe in your confusing and contradicting statement ? .<br><br>If Religion is about LIFE and one conveniently forget about religious teachings when practicing POLITICS, is it any wonder that we have "no brainers" who believe in killing innocent LIVES for the sake of their POLITCS and WILL FORGET their religious teachings ? .<br><br>Did we listen to you blaming those extremists for being Muslims and committing Terrorist Acts ? .<br><br>Or did they follow your "no brainer" approach by separating Religion from Politics and commit their terrorist political acts ? . .<br></blockquote>If religion is about tolerance and respect, then in politics, how come I see muslim countries practising an utter lack of tolerance and respect for other religions?<br><br>If religion is about the sancity of life, then a muslim country cannot go to war?<br><br>Even when politics and religion are put together, that did not stop 5 countries from attacking Isreal? That did not stop indonesia from calling singapore a red dot? That did not stop saddam from gassing the kurds? That did not help the polics in muslim countries to protect the american embassies that were destroyed?<br><br>So tell me now, does putting religion with politics help improve the behaviour of the govt? Where is the faith in politics then?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Like the chinese saying, those not personally involved in the issue can see the clearest. When muslims and those targetted by terrorism get emotional, they tend to be less rational. Those on the outside can give objective suggestions and logical response.<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>Should one who knows nothing about the complexities of Theology of a Religion be allowed to participate in the REFORMATION or comment on the Religion ?<br><br>Can one imagine a Budhist helping a Catholic to reform Catholicism ? </blockquote>But if the muslims refuse to voice up when their fellow muslims kill priests in the name of their god, what then? Let the priests die?<br><br><blockquote>I'm glad you can clerly identify and vocalise the cause of fundamentalism. Do you think there is muslim fundamentalists bringing a bad name to islam?<br><br>Fundamentalism takes different forms - the Passive and the Reactive.<br><br>Passive FUNDAMENTALISM does not impose itself on anyone, compared to the REACTIVE FUNDAMENTALISM.<br><br>In its basic form - FUNDAMENTALISM - is about the return of a Religion (any religion) to its foundation, its roots, its beginnings, it original form - and is an expression of concern towards the corruption of the Religion by forces that is pulling the Religion to a new form.<br><br>This is similar to Mao Tse Tung's own fundamentalist revival to the purity of the Communist Struggle when he launched the Cultural Revolution to imbue the Precepts of the Communist Struggle.<br><br>Religious Fundamentalism is a battle of forces within the religion as practised by those Passive Fundamentalists; and a battle conducted by Reactive Fundamentalists towards external corrupting influences on its Religion. </blockquote>What about those who kill priests and destroy american embassies in the name of islam? Should passive muslims and muslim leaders continue to accept such disgraceful behaviour?<br><br><blockquote>The necessity and relevance of religion to life, this answer is roughly the same with few negligible variations for all major religions.<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>Unfortunately, different religion approach this subject in different forms, and an aethiest will differ in his opinions from an agnostic, and this subject is totally blasphemious to some other more religious thinkers. </blockquote>Very true. I stand corrected. Ironically, in my capacity as a religious practioner, I welcome challenges to my faith. Only by questioning my understanding of my faith, can I truely know the extent of my knowledge (or lack thereof) and faith.<br><br>This allows me to constantly keep myself in check without going overboard in my actions.<br><br><blockquote>To me, religion is necessassary. But many have lived without religion, invented their own, and some even believe in many religions concurrently! As important and necessassary religion is, there is never enough reason to take another human life. I believe in the sanctity of life.<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>Unfortunately, others - who are more simplistic and practical in their mental faculties - will differ from your position taken. </blockquote>Very unfortunately, evident by the many dead priests.<br><br><blockquote>All major religions are very intertwined with tradition, culture and life itself. Buddism and taoism is very integrated with chinese lifestyle and folklore. Christianity is also very integral in the culture, history and even language of the westerners.<br><br>That didn't stop them from separating religion from politics.<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>While certain religions that you have mentioned allow its followers to have the flexibility to separate Religion from Politics, it merely suggest that the practitioners of those Faiths have been able to "turn a blind eye" when "offending their own Religion" in the course of making a "Political Act"<br><br>Some other Religions will DEMAND that the Faithful Belivers of their Faith MUST FOLLOW THE RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS IN ITS ENTIRETY - with NO EXCEPTIONS. </blockquote>All religions demand that their believers must follow the religious teachings with no exceptions. Failure means purgatory, Hell or both.<br><br>BG Yeo is a catholic and a minister. He lives his life as a God loving and fearing follower of Christ and discharges his duties as a political leader of singapore. He does not smite the taoists for believeing many gods, nor does he marginalise the muslims for the dead priests in another country.<br><br>Ironically, since islam teaches about love and peace, toerlance and Godlyness, how come the muslim teachers and leaders can turn a blind eye when calling for the extermination of a race or another religion? Clerics and mullahs can encourage their followers to kill danes? They can declare that the rain of aeroplanes will not end until the great satan is destroyed? Are they discharging their duties as religious leaders or have they too turned a blind eye to their religion?<br><br><blockquote>Perhaps it is time for clerics and mullahs to provide an avenue for their followers to clarify certain confusing aspects of their religion. Also, there are many parts of islam that has been misintepreted and exploited by certain terrorists. Responsible and God loving clerics and mullahs should try to clarify those points.<br><br>Clerics and mullahs, like priests, monks and the Pope are not only religious leaders, but also public figures. Their followers look to them for leadership and guidance. They should condemn any atrocities, crimes and terrorist acts that their follow indulge in. Not just keep quiet and be happy about it.<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>It is unfortunate, that in the present discussions, the spotlight is on ISLAM - and if we are aware of the THIRD WORLD CIRCUMSTANCES in which the Islamic Religious Leaders are living in, where the Rule of Law and Order are practically non-existent.<br><br>Leadership is by those with wealth or military power - and this is hardly the ground in which Religious Leaders have any to boast about. </blockquote>Islamic country have many islamic leaders and teaches, many of which are influential and very high profile. In all fairness, I did read about a cleric in iraq calling for peace and an end to terrorism. I think he is Sisitianti... I forgot how to spell his name.<br><br>There are many more influential clerics in the muslim world that have been keeping quiet, if not praising, the various terrorist acts. When they call for terrorism against danes or americans, their followers really do respond to them.<br><br>There are also many islamic countries where the muslims are not oppressed or poor. They too have many mullahs and clerics who keep quiet to the terrorist acts committed in the name of islam.<br><br><blockquote>They can come to agreement on various things (things other than who is God of course). Catholic leaders and Buddist leaders have agreed to mutual respect and tolerance even though the teaching of each religion is a violation of the other's. Christian and Catholic leader have also learnt to coexist even though their beliefs are in direct conflict.<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>Your description is based on your Singapore experience - which is an inexact science, as it is the only model imposed by a STRONG POLITICAL LEADERSHIP onto the puch-and-pull of Religious self-interests. </blockquote>In my capacity as a catholic, I think in terms of catholics worldwide, not catholics in singapore. The former pope has spearheaded many interreligious talks personally. That shows his committment to peace despite having countless cardinals and bishops that he can send in his stead.<br><br>The pope has made his stance on peace and tolerence very clear. Have the various muslim clerics and mullahs done the same?<br><br><blockquote>The catholics did it, why can't you?<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>Did the Catholics do it, or was it forced onto the Catholic Church and its Faithful Followers ? </blockquote>Must the change be forced on the muslims by virture of arms and blood before they are willing to conduct change themselves? There may only be one salman in sgforums. There are hundreds or salmans in usa and europe. For each active salman, there are hundreds of passive salmans.<br><br>I shudder to see the day that the non muslims have to band together to teach the muslims with blood and human lives the value of peaceful coexistence.<br><br><blockquote>You think the cardinals and archbishops were happy when their power was taken from them when the church was separated from politics? Did you not wonder how the priests handled the separation since they too believed that religion is also life and to remove religion from politics would be illogical?<br><br>All those questions, doubts and social problems have been confronted by catholics, taoists and buddists before. You're not the first one, you won't be the last.<br><br>Its time that muslim leaders start to study the feasibility of reforms.<br><br>Response by Atobe:<br>If your response is based on the UNIQUE Singapore Experience, then you have again WRONGED our Singapore Muslim brothers and sisters - as they have always been a partner to the social contract amongst all the religiuos leaders forced onto them by the Political Leaders.<br></blockquote>My response once again, is in the capacity of the catholic commuinty in the global village, not just singapore.<br><br>You'd be surprised at the actual semtiment many of our muslim bretheren hold. I posted in another thread that when questioned, these muslims actually support terrorism against america. As much as I find american foreign policy childish and wrong, I still believe in the sancity of life, american or otherwise. That includes muslims.</div>
