            <div class='col-md body'><br><blockquote>How much can we expect the ability of a "no brainer" to discern facts from delusions ? . Rolling Eyes<br><br>If you cannot understand the responses given in my replies to your baseless statements made in this 'thread', surely one can confidently conclude with some certainty your 'no brainer' status is not wrong ? . Cool<br><br>'Scream "no brainer" ' Question<br><br>Hardly, merely a repetition of the term on the many 'no brainer' statements that reflects ignorance of an empty vessel spouting bigotry. . Mr. Green    </blockquote>Well, all we see is you not being able to answer the inherent contradictions in practices by Muslims and islamic teachings.<br>And all you can do is shout 'no brainer' at me. I am obviously a winner in this debate.<br><br><blockquote><br>Are you certain that terrorist only exist amongst the followers of the Islamic faith ? . Cool</blockquote>I am ceratin that Muslims make up only abt 20% of the world population but commit almost 100% of all terrorist acts. Why is that so? Please explain.<br><br><blockquote><br>How will you explain the terror bombings in UK by the Catholic IRA ?</blockquote>First of all IRA do not have the support nor sympathy of Catholics.<br>Secondly, they didn't fight in the name of religion nor use scriptures in tehir struggle.<br>Thirdly, the fighting in NI is more ethnic than sectarian if you know the history of the conflict.<br>Contrast that with islamic terrorism. Openly associated with jihad. Openly sympathised by Muslims all over the world. Including you.<br><br><blockquote><br>What about the terror spread by the largely White Christian dominated KKK in Southern USA ?</blockquote>Again not supported by Christians.<br><br><blockquote><br>What about the terror campaign of the largely Christian Serbs towards the Muslim Bosnians and even towards Christian Croatians ?</blockquote>Ethnic in nature, not religious.<br><br><blockquote><br>The terror bombings and viciously violent attacks on Indian Muslims by a largely Hindu populated India during the days before 'partition' and occassionally during recent times ?</blockquote>Its the Muslims who started it first. Study your history.<br>Gandhi wanted peace but these fanatics insist of seperation.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>What about the Tibetan violent struggles against the forced take over of Tibet by China, or the Nepalese Maoist bombings and murders of Nepalese Citizens when their fight is against the Nepalese government ?</blockquote>Again ethnic &amp; political in nature, nothing to do with religion.<br>Communists hate all religions. Screw them dead.<br><br><blockquote><br>Are these religions not espousing tolerance, patience, peaceful co-existence, forgiveness, non-violence ? . Rolling Eyes</blockquote>Yes, thats why Buddhist and Christians do not start conflicts like muslims.<br>Look at Catholic East Timor. A quarter of the population was slaughtered by Indonesians but they never once commited terrorism.<br>These East Timorese know morality, you don't.<br><br><blockquote><br>What makes you think that only the Human Christian have "the brain to ask"; while a Muslim Human have "no brain to ask questions of their faith" ? . Cool<br><br>On what basis do you form this opinion ? . Cool</blockquote>Very simple, go ask any Muslim.<br>Lokk at your own behavior, I asked you questions on islam, you avoid them and shout 'no brainer'.<br>Thats exactly the kinda behaviors Muslims get from their religious teachers.<br>Otherwise you would have been able to answer me.<br><br><blockquote><br>How wide a circle are your Muslim friends, are they an authority on the Islamic faith ? . Rolling Eyes</blockquote>About twenty, from all over the world.<br>Don't trust my sample, go check out yourselves, go ask your Muslim friends and see what kinda answers you get.<br><br><blockquote><br>If you dare to post your public statements of bigotry based on your a shallow understanding of Islam derived from simple conversation with only a few Muslim friends, we can only conclude with a degree of certainty your status as a "no brainer".</blockquote>Like I said, I tested on you and it proved me point.<br>Try it out on other muslims and see what kinda responses you get.<br>They will tell you that only Allah knows or that it is not good to question the wisdom of Alah and risk going astray or something like that.<br><br><blockquote><br>Look at the breakup of Yugoslavia in which the Orthodox Serbs terrorised the Croats, Bosnian, and the Albanians - which is a very recent event in the history of our lives.<br></blockquote>The conflict was ethnic in nature and it was Christians who stopped it remember? It proves that Christians do have a sense of right and wrong, they don't care if its a Christian or not who commited an error. The same cannot be said of you. Its seems all you care is whether a person is muslim or not.<br>Its like Sudan, where Arabs kill &amp; raped hundreds of thousands of black Muslims, none of the Muslim countries said anything.<br><br><blockquote><br>Christian Terrorism exist since the Middle Ages until this day in its many different organisations as the more ingenious Human Minds can create, which cannot be said of your limited capacity to even fathom such events.</blockquote>It was the jihadhists who taught Christians terrorism.<br><br><blockquote><br>Even the quiet Sikhism religion had seen its own violent faithful splintered from the mainstream, to form the Babbar Khalsa and caused violent assassination and public terror in its bombing campaign.s.</blockquote>again they learnt it from the jihadhists.<br><br><blockquote><br>Can we believe that even the best brain in the many Islamic universities on this globe are of the same quality as that of your "no brainer" status ?<br></blockquote>They don't even have the right to question, what good is a brain to these people.<br></div>
