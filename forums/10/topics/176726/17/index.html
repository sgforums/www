            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe seems to be glossing and denying the existence of terrorists in our midst. JI does exist and they did plan to bomb our MRT and water pipeline to try to provoke a war with Malaysia. And this happens after 40 years of nation building and integration.<br>Why does Atobe need to deny the existence of such a real threat? Why does Atobe and his nicks sympathise with terrorists?<br><br></div>
