            <div class='col-md body'>I have had discussions with Muslims and I found that most of them do not study or even read the Quran. Some learn to recite it w/o knowing what it is really all about. They think it is a blessing just to read Quran in Arabic.<br><br>Their understanding of Islam comes from books written by others or through the teachings of imams who themselves got their knowledge from others and not through serious study.<br><br>The reason for this are :<br>1. laziness - human nature<br>2. belief that Quran cannot be properly translated and must be understood best in Arabic.<br>3. Quran is difficult to read because there is no chronological or logical organisation. I personally find the logic jumpy as the stories jump back and forth over time and settings.<br>4. believe they need a middle man in the form of teachers to interpret Quran for them because it is very difficult to read.<br><br>So instead of studying and learning for themselves, most Muslims simply delegate understanding of their religion to others.<br><br>I therefore encourage all Muslims to read and study the quran carefully and ask logical questions. don't depend on others to interpret, interpret, interpret for them.<br><br></div>

When a terrorist kidnaps and beheads a foreigner, when a bomb kills hundreds of non believer, they tell me its good.<br><br>Of course these are MY FEW FRIENDS AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AVERAGE MUSLIM IN SG.<br><br>The point I'm trying to bring up is that, I was rather shocked at this as I thought muslims in sg are very very moderate and do no condone senseless killing and bombings.</div></blockquote>I too have muslim acquaintances/colleagues whom I thought were moderates until I hear them actually extolling the vicious acts of the terrorists.  It is indeed sad.  What percentage of our muslims can be said to be moderates and what percentage can be said to be at least sympathisers/supporters of the terrorists?  Has anyone any clue?</div>
