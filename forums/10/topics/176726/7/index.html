            <div class='col-md body'>This cartoon issue seemed to be quoted out of context. It was not actually meant to criticize any religion but to support freedom of speech. Bear's referral on Boston Globe:<br><br>Jyllands-Posten, Denmark's largest daily, commissioned the cartoons to make a point about freedom of speech. It was protesting the climate of intimidation that had made it impossible for a Danish author to find an illustrator for his children's book about Mohammed. No artist would agree to illustrate the book for fear of being harmed by Muslim extremists. Appalled by this self-censorship, Jyllands-Posten invited Danish artists to submit drawings of Mohammed, and published the 12 it received.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I'm a Muslim Singaporean. If, from my first sentence, you feel that my views are going to be biased. Feel free to be that way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Obviously, the recent caricatures of Prophet Muhammad has caused an uproar in countries where majority of the population are Muslims. even so in European countries where there are Muslims. I would like to highlight that Islamic teachings brought down by regulated organisations (like madrasahs, MUIS and religious groups in Singapore) and those by insane, wayward radical islamic extremists are WAY different.<br><br>Nevertheless, in Singapore, I can't deny that all Singapore Muslims are so true to the religion. We come out tops in crimes. There are also some who drink and gamble. Teenagers take part in pre-marital sex and gang crimes. The Malay-Muslim community has come together to clamp down on such instances. There is still a long way to go but surely, we are on the right track.<br><br>In Islam, Muslims are not even allowed to visualise how Allah and Prophet Muhammad looks like. What we know, is that they are there. And we may get to see them once we pass on. This time round, the Danish media draws Prophet Muhammad. Not only that, Prophet Muhammad is portrayed as a terrorist!<br><br>Free press is an incentive. But they have abused it by doing such things.<br><br>Worldwide, secular, mainstream Muslims have been trying hard to blend with everyone else after 9/11. Unfortunately, racial discrimination is something that we can't avoid in this world. We've been trying hard, but each time we're at it, the provoking gets larger, such as the drawing of the Prophet Muhammad. I believe those who are rioting in Indonesia and the Middle East are those who just couldnt take it anymore. In Singapore, we're just in a bubble. We can't do much, we know that. By rioting, we know we've let Allah down. He who strictly doesnt condone violence, we've done it. We Muslims must get back on our feet and be more faithful to him. We've seen His power in natural disaters like the tsunami tragedy.<br><br>About the Muslim infidels who are rioting, leave them alone. Let them be. One day, He would punish them.<br><br>But my stance is that, the Danish have gone too much on the caricatures. If there are Muslim organisations that have drawings of Buddha and Jesus Christ portrayed in a similar manner, common sense would already tell you they're radical Muslims.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wish every Muslim is like you my friend. But unfortunately, thats not good enough. You still kinda justify the rioting. There is absolutely no justification for such things. You should condemn it w/o qualifications.<br>Buddhists don't riot over the destruction of irreplacable giant buddhas or beheading of monks. Catholics didn't riot over the attempted assasinsation of the pope. Why are Muslims rioting over cartoons? What peace and tolerance is there in this religion?<br><br>Also unfortunately, there are enough of those fanatics among Muslims, both terrorists and their sympathisers that give islam a bad name. You will never be able to change them.<br><br>As for the state of the Muslim youths in Singapore, I feel very sorry about that too. Wish i can help.<br><br></div>

I had came across pictures showing a buddhist temple being damaged , burned and sprayed " Allah Akhbar"<br><br>- If these ppl are the "black" sheep, it is just too much and the religous leaders must do something serious about it if they carry the "muslim" name, if not , you would be responsible for the hatred.<br><br>-quote"  This passage has been cited to justify expelling non-Muslims from Muslim countries. But Imam Hendi says that not only does the Qur'an avoid any such suggestion, it even prohibits aggressive efforts to convert. "<strong>No Muslim is allowed to go out and force people to become Muslim</strong>. In the early days of Islam, Jews came to Islam and had younger children and asked Muhammad if they could force Islam on their children because they are younger. This verse [which was] revealed to him says that there can be no compulsion on other religions. This is very clear. "<br><br>I am sorry, i beg to differ. Take a look at Malaysia's law. Anyone who marries a muslim, MUST be a muslim. Is this not forcing? if this is not, what would be consider yes? There is basically no freedom in choosing if u love a muslim spouse.<br><br>Sometimes ppl around the world get angry for a certain reason. I believe what the danish did was wrong. However, it is always wrong to resolve in violence. An act of evil to correct a wrong/evil deed will never consider to be right.<br><br>I had close muslims frens and they are nice ppl. They obey and do have moral values in them. However, you got to admit " the flock of black sheep" is growing day by day and if the muslim community doesnt take action to prevent this, then you could not blame the world for their reaction.<br><br>I believe it takes 2 hands to clap. Just take a greater depth to find out what these ppl had done to the chinese in indonesia during the riot and to other victims around the world including the attempt to murder the pope ( forgiven by pope) .<br><br>Just my comments and i do not mean to flame anyone.</div>

The Danish prime minister called the protests a global crisis and appealed for calm.<br><br>In a new turn, a prominent Iranian newspaper, Hamshahri, invited artists to enter a Holocaust cartoon competition, saying it wanted to see if freedom of expression - the banner under which many Western publications reprinted the prophet drawings - also applied to Holocaust images.<br><br>The drawings - including one depicting the prophet wearing a turban shaped as a bomb - have touched a raw nerve among Muslims. Islam is interpreted to forbid any illustrations of Muhammad for fear they could lead to idolatry.<br><br>Violence has escalated sharply in Afghanistan this week, and seven people have died in demonstrations during the past two days. Protests, sometimes involving armed men, have been directed at foreign and Afghan government targets - fueling suspicions there's more behind the unrest than religious sensitivities.<br><br>"It's an incredibly emotive issue. This is something that really upset Afghans," said Joanna Nathan, senior Afghanistan analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research institute. "But it is also being used to agitate and motivate the crowds by those against the government and foreign forces" in Afghanistan.<br><br>On Tuesday, protesters armed with assault rifles and grenades attacked the NATO base in the northern city of Maymana, which is manned by peacekeepers from Norway, Finland, Latvia and Sweden, local officials said.<br><br>Sayed Aslam Ziaratia, the provincial deputy police chief, said three protesters were shot and killed by Afghan and Norwegian forces and that 22 others were wounded. However, NATO said it only fired live ammunition into the air and rubber bullets. Five Norwegian peacekeepers suffered minor injuries.<br><br>Provincial governor Mohammed Latif said he suspected al-Qaida may have had a hand in the unrest. He said two men from eastern Afghanistan were arrested during the protest and were being interrogated.<br><br>"The violence today looked like a massive uprising. It was very unusual," Latif said.<br><br>On Monday, about 2,000 protesters tried to storm the main U.S. military base at Bagram, the hub of the operations for some 20,000 American forces in the country. Police shot dead two protesters. A top local official said al-Qaida and Taliban militants incited the crowd.<br><br>Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak told The Associated Press by telephone Tuesday that it was possible militants egged on the demonstrators, but he stressed the government has no evidence.<br><br>"Once these crowds get together, they often get out of control, here and in other countries," he said. "But if this goes on, we're going to have to take a closer look to see if there is more behind it."<br><br>The unrest in Maymana prompted NATO to send 150 British troops to help secure the base, and two American A-10 attack aircraft were flown to the city. The U.N. evacuated nonessential staff.<br><br>In Washington, President Bush called Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen to express "our solidarity and support." A Danish newspaper first printed the cartoons of Muhammad in September, and they were reprinted this month by other European papers, setting off a new round of proptests.<br><br>Bush and Fogh Rasmussen agreed that all sides must move forward "through dialogue and tolerance, not violence," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.<br><br>In Copenhagen, Fogh Rasmussen showed no sign of diverting from his government's stance that it cannot apologize for the actions of an independent newspaper, as demanded by governments in several Muslim nations.<br><br>Fogh Rasmussen called the protests "a growing global crisis."<br><br>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Tuesday that publication of the caricatures was an Israeli conspiracy motivated by anger over the victory of the militant Hamas group in last mont's Palestinian elections.<br><br>"The West condemns any denial of the Jewish Holocaust, but it permits the insult of Islamic sanctities," Khamenei said.<br><br>Tuesday saw the biggest protest yet in Pakistan, where 5,000 people chanted, "Hang the man who insulted the prophet," and burned effigies of one cartoonist and Denmark's prime minister. The rally ended peacefully.<br><br>Thousands of Egyptians and Jordanians also demonstrated peacefully, calling for a boycott of Danish products and the cutting of ties with Copenhagen.<br><br></div>

Knowing that the Tsunami hit on christmas eve, before that, Christians in Aceh requested to celebrate Christmas in the town but was rejected by the council, they then told them to go to somewhere far to celebrate. Hence they went up to the mountain and celebrate. The day after Christmas, they came down and saw huge flood.<br><br>Another Tsunami then took place later on last year after the December tsunami, and it was a day before Easter.</div>
