            <div class='col-md body'>I think both the Christians and Muslims should stop and think about what they have been doing. It seems that conflict nowadays seems to be between Christians and Muslims more than anything else. Of course, I'm not saying Christianity and Islam are bad but I think the Europeans and Middle Easterners should really stop demanding too much and learn to compromise. If the Muslims and Christians in Singapore can live together peacefully, I think it's time the rest of the world learn from us.<br><br>And just to clarify some things with the person who posted just before me, Bhuddists do not believe that you will be punished for not being a Bhuddist, unlike Jews, Christians and Muslims who believe that all those not of their religeon will go to hell. Bhuddists on the other hand believe that if you do good deeds, you will be rewarded in your next life regardless of whether you are a Bhuddist or not.</div>

Islam (and Judaism) forbids idolatrous images of any kind. The Taliban blew up the images in their own country when they were in power. Many Muslims feel it is their responsibility to remove all idols from an Islamic state (much as the Old Testament spoke of Jewish kings destroying idols and pagan temples in Palestine).<br><br>I think the Taliban action was unnecessary as the Buddhist carvings were not used as objects of worship but were really objects of art. But who are we to tell them how to interprete and practise their own religion? The Talibans should have invited other nations to cart off the carvings from their country if the international community wanted them so much. Destroying the carvings was an insensitive and intolerant act that could have been averted.<br><br>I think you mean that just as the Muslims had been intolerant and insulted the Buddhists, their religion deserves to be insulted as well. 'An eye for an eye', I guess...you may be right but going down that path will yield nothing apart from generating more animosity and a more hostile world for all of us. Muslims have a seige mentality now given recent world events and it is the duty of the strong to make the first move to step back.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just think that there is a lack of a proper form of view on the part of the Middle Eastern Arabs.<br>Forgive, instead of burning flags and raising hell everytime there is a caricature.A truly religious man will pray for those who have transgressed against him, not simply grabbing the nearest weapon and smashing the living daylights out of him.<br><br>I agree that these cartoons are inflammatory to them, but there is something called give and take, and tolerance too.Who's to say who is morally right in this case?The Danes believe in their form of religious freedom, and the Muslims believe that it is a sin to make images of their God, so by default are we saying that the latter is right while the former is wrong?<br><br>We cannot say that too.That will be highly divisive too.Therefore, a reactionary response is what is NOT needed from Muslims, but rather they should seek a dialogue and come to a common understanding, a compromise.The world is not black and white, it is grey.What is deemed as religious blasphemy is deemed as freedom of expression by another race?<br><br>Surely religion teaches us to fight against base and instant responses, and instead focus on building our own innate character and guiding others, not being the dictator..<br><br>I hope they find a common ground, for there is too much sectarian conflict already.Both parties should take a step back.PM Rasmussen has already apologized, but state that he cannot stop the press.And instead of flagburning, why not take the newspaper to court instead?<br><br>Cultural and religious sensitivity should not have to be at the expense of common understanding and respect for diversity of views.This is sorely lacking in this increasingly dogmatic world with all sorts of extremists from many diferent faiths polluting this world with their falsehood.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
