            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by AMD2004:<strong><br>Dear Atobe, you mentioned "In all probability, religious beliefs may not necessarily change cultural, social or political values that are part of the historical character of the adoptive country, or community, or race, or ethnicity.?"<br><br>This is where I will strongly diagree. Who will not accede the message from the God if you believe in one? there should be no such thing as cultural, social or political values that we could not change , is whethere you WANT to change it or not? So, if these people are going to go around killing ppl, are we going to accept these fact and give lame excuses of such?<br><br>How could one accept this. You must FIGHT for what you believe, if not this is not religion. You even fight the evil in you if u must to follow the words of God. If people around you are doing the wrong thing in the name of your own religion, by NOT telling them, by NOT voicing out to them , and by NO EFFORT of CHANGING them, I believe you are already wrong!!! Simple, because you dont live your life for your religion. You wont wan to spread the word of God to these people if they are astray.<br><br>In conclusion, if cultural,social or political values may not he change by the principle in the religion, it would be failure of mankind in the name of their religion, both, those righteous and those who aren't. And it all falls back to the fundamental of the religion, which is to SPREAD the TRUTH , which includes to FIGHT for the truth, and not keep quiet and give meer excuses.<br><br>I do agree with certain points that you give in all the posts by you, however, you know it clearly in your heart, denial can resolve anything. Denying an act which was committed, denying the "faith" of certain brethen and denying the terrorism that some had done to innocent people it is wrong. Scold them, change them, forced them if you must because they are your so call brethens because it is your responsibility to bring those lost sheep back. NO ONE ELSE will do it, if u guys who are righteous dont make the first move.<br><br>Just my thoughts, and be reminded, we must learn to forgive and love. Forgive is an easy word to say, but it takes 1000 guts to do so. For me, i am a Christian to be honest, and we share the old testament. I do admire my pope who really still love a person who tries to murder him and his love is to everyone, even to those who scorned and insulted him. Same goes with Mother Thressa, she is so damnn poor. But she care to sacrifice her life for others. Not to say you are from Afghanistan, Pakistan you cant do charity..yes you are poor , but that doest stop you in doing charity. Words sometimes are useless if they are not put into action. You can quote 1000 beautiful quotations, however, if no action is done, is merely NOTHING. </strong></blockquote>Dear AMD2004, your well considered comments are read and I would like to return a humble compliment for your effort.<br><br>Should I understand correctly your position that submitting oneself to a religion, one has to be reborn and void of all traditions, customs, beliefs, that is demanded by one's tribe, ethnicity, race, community, and country ?<br><br>By your personal beliefs, it will require that in accepting one's new Faith and committing oneself to the Faith will require us to take on NEW VALUES, CUSTOMS, TRADITIONS, BELIEFS, PRACTICES that is compatible to one's "new found" FAITH.<br><br>If we narrow our discussion to the Christian Faith, how many Christians continue to follow the customs of the one's ethnicity - Chinese, Indian, Eurasians - that do not conflict with the Christian Faith ?<br><br>While we live in an urban cosmopolitan settings, how familiar are we with the tribal customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices of a rural place that will require the people of such regions to continue despite adopting and being committed to a "new" Faith ?<br><br>Can we pass judgment on these people who are living in a world totally different from the one that we are living in ?<br><br></div>

Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, two Indian actors, fall to earth after an Air India jumbo jet explodes 30,000 feet above the English Channel. This refers to a real act of terrorism, when an Air India Boeing 747 was blown up in 1985 - supposedly by Sikh terrorist.<br><br>Gibreel Farishta in Urdu, means Gabriel Angel, which makes him the archangel whom Islamic tradition regards as "bringing down" the Qur'an from God to Muhammad.<br><br>"'To be born again,' sang Gibreel Farishta tumbling from the heavens, 'first you have to die. Ho ji! To land upon the bosomy earth, first one needs to fly. Tat-taa! Taka-thun! How to ever smile again, if first you won't cry? How to win the darling's love, mister, without a sigh? Baba, if you want to get born again...'<br><br>Just before dawn one winter's morning, New Year's Day or thereabouts, two real, full-grown, living men fell from a great height, twenty-nine thousand and two feet, towards the English Channel, without benefit of parachutes or wings, out of a clear sky." (from The Satanic Verses) Gibreel Farishta and Saladin are miraculously saved, and chosen as protagonist in the fight between Good and Evil.<br><br>In the following cycle of bizarre adventures, dreams, and tales of past and future, the reader meets Mahound, the Prophet of Jahilia, the recipient of a revelation in which satanic verses mingle with divine. "'I told you a long time back,' Gibreel Farishta quietly said, 'that if I thought the sickness would never leave me, that it would always return, I would not be able to bear up to it.'<br><br>Then, very quickly, before Salahuddin could move a finger, Gobreel put the barrel of the gun into his own mouth; and pulled the trigger; and was free."<br><br>The character modelled on the Prophet Muhammad and his transcription of the Quran is portrayed in an unconventional light. The quotations from the Quran are composites of the English version of N.J. Dawood and of Maulana Muhammad Ali, with a few touches of Rushdie's own.<br></blockquote>For a further quick summary, read the following: <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/anglophone/satanic_verses/unity.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>The Unity of the Satanic Verses</strong></a>; and <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/anglophone/satanic_verses/contents.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>the complete Satanic Verses</strong></a>  is available here.<br><br></div>

Does that make it ok to stage violent protests and call for the extermination of a race?<br><br>Its amazing how many people in this thread can justify terrorism and violence. We say its their culture, its their religion, and we happily allow them to infringe on our culture of tolerance and peace.<br><br>Yes, it was wrong of the Danish newspaper to publish those drawings. Yes, Islam is a religion that preaches love and understanding. Yes, there are many racist and anti muslims in the western world. Yes, there are lots of anti christians in the islamic world.<br><br>So?<br><br>The drawings have already been published.

            <div class='col-md body'>I find this puzzling.  Why should the suicide bombers be enticed to do what they did by promising them 72 (!) virgins when they get to paradise (or hell)? Are they so sex-starved?  Are virgins so difficlult to find where they are from? Are the promised virgins male or female? If they are male, then those blighters might find themselves sc*wing each other's asses not knowing before hand that they themselves are the promised virgins.  Talk about stupid sex-maniacs!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

"The rage of Islam sweeps Europe," said another. "The clash of civilizations is coming," warned one commentator. All this refers to the row provoked by the publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper four months ago. Since then a number of demonstrations have been held, mostly -- though not exclusively -- in the West, and Scandinavian embassies and consulates have been besieged.<br><br>But how representative of Islam are all those demonstrators? The "rage machine" was set in motion when the Muslim Brotherhood -- a political, not a religious, organization -- called on sympathizers in the Middle East and Europe to take the field. A fatwa was issued by Yussuf al-Qaradawi, a Brotherhood sheikh with his own program on al-Jazeera. Not to be left behind, the Brotherhood's rivals, Hizb al-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Liberation Party) and the Movement of the Exiles (Ghuraba), joined the fray. Believing that there might be something in it for themselves, the Syrian Baathist leaders abandoned their party's 60-year-old secular pretensions and organized attacks on the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Damascus and Beirut.<br><br>The Muslim Brotherhood's position, put by one of its younger militants, Tariq Ramadan -- who is, strangely enough, also an adviser to the British home secretary -- can be summed up as follows: It is against Islamic principles to represent by imagery not only Muhammad but all the prophets of Islam; and the Muslim world is not used to laughing at religion. Both claims, however, are false.<br><br>There is no Quranic injunction against images, whether of Muhammad or anyone else. When it spread into the Levant, Islam came into contact with a version of Christianity that was militantly iconoclastic. As a result some Muslim theologians, at a time when Islam still had an organic theology, issued "fatwas" against any depiction of the Godhead. That position was further buttressed by the fact that Islam acknowledges the Jewish Ten Commandments -- which include a ban on depicting God -- as part of its heritage. The issue has never been decided one way or another, and the claim that a ban on images is "an absolute principle of Islam" is purely political. Islam has only one absolute principle: the Oneness of God. Trying to invent other absolutes is, from the point of view of Islamic theology, nothing but sherk, i.e., the bestowal on the Many of the attributes of the One.<br><br>The claim that the ban on depicting Muhammad and other prophets is an absolute principle of Islam is also refuted by history. Many portraits of Muhammad have been drawn by Muslim artists, often commissioned by Muslim rulers. There is no space here to provide an exhaustive list, but these are some of the most famous:<br><br>A miniature by Sultan Muhammad-Nur Bokharai, showing Muhammad riding Buraq, a horse with the face of a beautiful woman, on his way to Jerusalem for his M'eraj or nocturnal journey to Heavens (16th century); a painting showing Archangel Gabriel guiding Muhammad into Medina, the prophet's capital after he fled from Mecca (16th c.); a portrait of Muhammad, his face covered with a mask, on a pulpit in Medina (16th c.); an Isfahan miniature depicting the prophet with his favorite kitten, Hurairah (17th c.); Kamaleddin Behzad's miniature showing Muhammad contemplating a rose produced by a drop of sweat that fell from his face (19th c.); a painting, "Massacre of the Family of the Prophet," showing Muhammad watching as his grandson Hussain is put to death by the Umayyads in Karbala (19th c.); a painting showing Muhammad and seven of his first followers (18th c.); and Kamal ul-Mulk's portrait of Muhammad showing the prophet holding the Quran in one hand while with the index finger of the other hand he points to the Oneness of God (19th c.).<br><br>Some of these can be seen in museums within the Muslim world, including the Topkapi in Istanbul, and in Bokhara, Samarkand and Haroun-Walat (a suburb of Isfahan). Visitors to other museums, including some in Europe, would find miniatures and book illuminations depicting Muhammad, at times wearing his Meccan burqa (cover) or his Medinan niqab (mask). There have been few statues of Muhammad, although several Iranian and Arab contemporary sculptors have produced busts of the prophet. One statue of Muhammad can be seen at the building of the U.S. Supreme Court, where the prophet is honored as one of the great "lawgivers" of mankind.<br><br>There has been other imagery: the Janissaries -- the elite of the Ottoman army -- carried a medallion stamped with the prophet's head (sabz qaba). Their Persian Qizilbash rivals had their own icon, depicting the head of Ali, the prophet's son-in-law and the first Imam of Shiism. As for images of other prophets, they run into millions. Perhaps the most popular is Joseph, who is presented by the Quran as the most beautiful human being created by God.<br><br>Now to the second claim, that the Muslim world is not used to laughing at religion. That is true if we restrict the Muslim world to the Brotherhood and its siblings in the Salafist movement, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda. But these are all political organizations masquerading as religious ones. They are not the sole representatives of Islam just as the Nazi party was not the sole representative of German culture. Their attempt at portraying Islam as a sullen culture that lacks a sense of humor is part of the same discourse that claims "suicide-martyrdom" as the highest goal for all true believers.<br><br>The truth is that Islam has always had a sense of humor and has never called for chopping heads as the answer to satirists. Muhammad himself pardoned a famous Meccan poet who had lampooned him for more than a decade. Both Arabic and Persian literature, the two great literatures of Islam, are full of examples of "laughing at religion," at times to the point of irreverence. Again, offering an exhaustive list is not possible. But those familiar with Islam's literature know of Ubaid Zakani's "Mush va Gorbeh" (Mouse and Cat), a match for Rabelais when it comes to mocking religion.<br><br>Sa'adi's eloquent soliloquy on behalf of Satan mocks the "dry pious ones." And Attar portrays a hypocritical sheikh who, having fallen into the Tigris, is choked by his enormous beard. Islamic satire reaches its heights in Rumi, where a shepherd conspires with God to pull a stunt on Moses; all three end up having a good laugh.<br><br>Islamic ethics is based on "limits and proportions," which means that the answer to an offensive cartoon is a cartoon, not the burning of embassies or the kidnapping of people designated as the enemy. Islam rejects guilt by association. Just as Muslims should not blame all Westerners for the poor taste of a cartoonist who wanted to be offensive, those horrified by the spectacle of rent-a-mob sackings of embassies in the name of Islam should not blame all Muslims for what is an outburst of fascist energy.<br><br>Mr. Taheri is the author of "L'Irak: Le Dessous Des Cartes" (Editions Complexe, 2002).</div>
