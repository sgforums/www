Bring Muslim behaviors up for debate in this small world. Play it up on all the satellites and the airwaves. Take advantage of modern communications.

Both clergymen were asked the same question: what role does religion play in politics?<br><br>The priest replied, "Religion and politics do not mix. Politics is ruled by the mind. There are times when deception is used. Deception has no place in our hearts. Religion is ruled by our hearts. We believe that God is watching over us and He performs miracles. We cannot explain these miracles, but we know its from God."<br><br>The reply from the cleric, "Politics is about governing our lives. Every aspects of our lives. What to do, what not to do. Religion is the same thing. It tells you what to do, what not to do. Both have rules and laws. Both govern every aspect of our lives. Hence, politics and religion is interwined and cannot be separated."<br><br>I was shocked at the sutle meaning from the cleric.
