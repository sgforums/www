Can I practise my faith in a muslim country? Will another priest be killed if the danish drew another picture of the prophet?<br><br>Once the whole world starts to hate us, we must begin to ask ourselves why. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Should we allow a few militants destroy our faith in fellow Humans ?<br><br>Have faith in the Human Spirit, Trust in the fellowship of Humans, and the Great Divide between peoples can be overcome.<br><br>Even during the 1960s, when racial riots occurred in Malaysia and Singapore, there were those minority groups being protected by the kindness of those who dare to stand up against Evil.<br><br>Evil exist on both sides of the Great Divide, as much as there are evil militants amongst those whom we should fear, there are also the evil ones within our midst who stand to benefit from our constant fear and suspicion towards the "Other Side".</span><br><blockquote>Response by Atobe: <strong><br>From your very flippant reply, it merely suggest the shallow consideration that you have given to a very complex subject that has major implications to itself as to the billions of its faithful. </strong><br><br>Post by SilverPal:<br>When the catholic church was removed from its political place, there were many implications to the millions of followers too. Today the catholic faith is still very strong. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Yes, so it should be - if you are referring to the persecution of the Catholic Church by the Singapore Government in the mid-1980s.<br><br>However, what about the moral values of the Government, Country, Society, Community, and the Citizens ?</span><br><blockquote>Response by Atobe: <strong><br>The Catholics have a unified organisation, with its very formal organisation structures in the Vatican.<br><br>Do the Muslims have the benefit of such a FORMAL and UNIFIED ENTITY ?<br><br>Can you put a "little effort" from your simplistic "no brainer, one-liner" type of RECKLESS and FLIPPANT thinking ? </strong><br><br>Post by SilverPal:<br>You only hear about the ROMAN catholic church, lead by the pope. The orthodox catholics are lead by their own leader and have no formal connection to the roman catholic church. They have no obligation to listen to the pope.<br><br>There are a few other catholic bodies that have nothing to do with the roman and orthodox church. An example is the china catholic church. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Whatever the differences of the roman and orthodox churches, they are all organised with its own "Titular Head" - and with the Churches moving towards a common ground.<br><br>If you will look up the February 13, 2006 edition of Newsweek, you will be surprised with the changes taking place in China's Catholic Church. </span><br><blockquote>Response by Atobe: <strong><br>Garbage IN, will result in Garbage OUT.<br><br>The 2 Billions are divided into the main stream Catholics and Christians - with the Christians being "brached" into the main "groups" of Anglicanism, Baptism, Methodism, Protestants, and some other minor Christian Groups and older orthodox Christianity.<br><br>In each of these groups there exist a formal body that sits in the different centres of religious capital - with Catholics in the Vatican, Anglicanism in the Church of England, Methodist in the Methodist Council in the USA, and the others having their own Governing Body that guide their respective religious practices.<br><br>These groups are not allienated by sect, tribe, ethnicity, race, nor culture, traditions, politics, etc.<br><br>Can ISLAM and its Faithful Followers transcend the complexities of their religion that is intertwined into the many tribal, sectarian, ethnic, cultural, traditional, and political practices ? </strong><br><br>Post by SilverPal:<br>Christianity is very diverse, more so than islam. Any yahoo can get a few friends to his house and strum the guitar to some popular christian songs and claim that he has started a new church.<br><br>There are Baptists, faith baptists, bible baptists, methodist baptists... that's just one string of denomination alone.<br><br>There are also those that do not brance from any major denominations, such as new creations and city harvest. They claim no ties to any other denominations. There are hundreds more in USA and europe.<br><br>Catholics are the most stringent and tightly managed, hence there are less catholic denominations.<br><br>The history of christianity is as complex, bloody and intertwined as islamic denominations. Can you imagine that every christian denomination claims to be the original and first church? </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The History of Mankind is also as complex, bloody, and intertwined with competition, partnership and breakups between the various shades and diversities of political ideologies.<br><br>The question remains as to the location where Man had first appeared on earth.</span><br><blockquote>Response by Atobe: <strong><br>Can we believe in your confusing and contradicting statement ? .<br><br>If Religion is about LIFE and one conveniently forget about religious teachings when practicing POLITICS, is it any wonder that we have "no brainers" who believe in killing innocent LIVES for the sake of their POLITCS and WILL FORGET their religious teachings ? .<br><br>Did we listen to you blaming those extremists for being Muslims and committing Terrorist Acts ? .<br><br>Or did they follow your "no brainer" approach by separating Religion from Politics and commit their terrorist political acts ? . .<br></strong><br><br>Post by SilverPal:<br>If religion is about tolerance and respect, then in politics, how come I see muslim countries practising an utter lack of tolerance and respect for other religions?<br><br>If religion is about the sancity of life, then a muslim country cannot go to war?<br><br>Even when politics and religion are put together, that did not stop 5 countries from attacking Isreal? That did not stop indonesia from calling singapore a red dot? That did not stop saddam from gassing the kurds? That did not help the polics in muslim countries to protect the american embassies that were destroyed?<br><br>So tell me now, does putting religion with politics help improve the behaviour of the govt? Where is the faith in politics then? </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Have you confused the <strong>WEAKNESS of the "Religious" MAN</strong> to <strong>any WEAKNESS of The Religion</strong> ?<br><br>To reply to your last question, you should look at the moral values of a religious Man - in the Dalai Lama.<br><br>When the Dalai Lama was overthrown by the Communist Government of China during its invasion of Tibet, the Dalai Lama opted for a passive resistant towards the Communist Government of China.<br><br>With the takeover of Tibet, the Chinese Communist Government installed a child as the reincarnate "new Dalai Lama".<br><br>Was it not surprising that the 'younger' Dalai Lama - on maturing - decide to <a href="http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2000/3/1_1.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>escape from Tibet </strong></a>, to search for the Elder Dalai Lama ?</span><br><br></div>
