You can read it up in wikipedia.<br><br><blockquote><br>quote:Originally posted by Salman: 20 February 2006 Â– 10.29PM<br>The real root of the problem isn't the cartoons but islamic extremism.<br>Arab media is full of anti Christian, anti Jew and anti pagan propaganda, its staple.

Salman talked about extremists and not Muslims in general? So who's the broad brusher here? It is you Atobe who is the trouble maker, not others.<br><br><blockquote><br>quote:Originally posted by Salman: 21 February 2006 Â– 12.07AM<br>I think these people shopuld go back to where they come from if they don't like western culture. </blockquote>These people?

Its like people who don't like Singapore, they should migrate.<br><br><blockquote><br>Do they want to take this statement as an excuse to attack somebody again?<br>I read the papers yesterday that Christians in Nigeria were killed over the cartoons.

Maybe not to you Atobe. You tend to lump extremists with Muslims at large.<br><br><blockquote><br>Still cannot figure out the lump of the Fish Cake stuck in Salman's throat ? </blockquote>neither can we understand why proton can be atobe.</div>

I'm not angry at Muslims at all. I'm nice to Muslims. But we do need to recognise the extremists among Muslims for who they are and they are a real threat.<br><br><blockquote><br>The point that I have been trying to make is that this general anger is not altogether irrational.

Atobe is angry.<br><br><blockquote><br>At some point in time, we can't just stop at dismissing extremists as extremists.

Thats what I have been saying. Its what the media and the schools feed the people in these countries.<br><br><blockquote><br>If I run a school, and there are constantly blacksheep going about committing crimes on the basis of the school's teachings, I would certainly be a little concerned about what has gone wrong within my school.</blockquote>There are many extremists schools in Pakistan. These are the schools that needs to be destroyed. There are also many such schools in Malaysia but the government is withdrawing funding from them and trying to control cirriculum in public funded madrasahs.<br>Can extremism grow in this region? Yes, thats why we need to be vigilant and confront these extremists wherever they are so that they don't not poison the minds of the youths.<br>These extremists go onto the net and defend terrorism in teh anme of injustice and human rights.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its easy to clean up. Atobe just needs to stop his spamming and personal attacks. He is trying desperately to shut down all discussion on extremism and terrorism by saying that such discussions attack all Muslims. At the same time, he justifies terrorism and extremism with talks of injustice and sympathy. This is a dishonest mode of discussion employed by extremists all over the media.
