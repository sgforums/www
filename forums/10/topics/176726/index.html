            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>By Tom Heneghan<br><br>PARIS (Reuters) - An international row over newspaper cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad gathered pace on Thursday as more European dailies printed Danish caricatures of him and Muslims stepped up pressure to stop them.<br><br>About a dozen Palestinian gunmen surrounded European Union offices in the Gaza Strip demanding an apology for the cartoons, one of which shows Islam's founder wearing a bomb-shaped turban. Muslims consider any images of Mohammad to be blasphemous.<br><br>The owner of France Soir, a Paris daily that reprinted them on Wednesday along with one German and two Spanish papers, sacked its managing editor to show "a strong sign of respect for the beliefs and intimate convictions of every individual".<br><br>But the tabloid staunchly defended its right to print the cartoons. Switzerland's Le Temps and La Tribune de Geneve ran some of them on Thursday, as did Magyar Hirlap in Budapest. Some European dailies ran cartoons making fun of the controversy.<br><br>Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the issue had gone beyond a row between Copenhagen and the Muslim world and now centred on Western free speech versus taboos in Islam, which is now the second religion in many European countries.<br><br>"We are talking about an issue with fundamental significance to how democracies work," Rasmussen told the Copenhagen daily Politiken. "One can safely say it is now an even bigger issue."<br><br>The clash has commercial repercussions. Danish companies have reported sales falling in the Middle East after protests against the cartoons in the Arab world and calls for boycotts.<br><br>SCATHING ARAB REACTION<br><br>Reaction in Middle East countries has been scathing.<br><br>"In the West, one discovers there are different moral ceilings and all moral parameters and measures are not equal," wrote the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat.<br><br>"If the Danish cartoon had been about a Jewish rabbi, it would never have been published."<br><br>Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef said Riyadh considered the cartoons an insult to Mohammad and all Muslims. "We hope that religious centres like the Vatican will clarify their opinion in this respect," he told the state news agency SPA.<br><br>In Beirut, the leader of Lebanon's Shi'ite Hizbollah said the row would never had occurred if a 17-year-old death edict against British writer Salman Rushdie been carried out.<br><br>"Had a Muslim carried out Imam Khomeini's fatwa against the apostate Salman Rushdie, then those lowlifers would not have dared discredit the Prophet, not in Denmark, Norway or France," Hizbollah head Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Wednesday night.<br><br>The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Muslims in 1989 to kill Rushdie for blasphemy against Islam in his book "The Satanic Verses". Rushdie went into hiding and was never attacked.<br><br>Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Mohammad, and Syria have recalled their ambassadors to Denmark.<br><br>FRANCE SOIR'S SELF-DEFENCE<br><br>Defending its decision to publish the cartoons, France Soir wrote: "Imagine a society that added up all the prohibitions of different religions. What would remain of the freedom to think, to speak and even to come and go?<br><br>"We know societies like that all too well. The Iran of the mullahs, for example. But yesterday, it was the France of the Inquisitions, the burning stakes and the Saint Bartholomew's Day (massacre of Protestants)."<br><br>Other European dailies printed cartoons mocking the row. Le Monde in Paris ran a sketch of a man whose beard and turban were made up of lines saying "I must not draw Mohammad".<br><br>Jyllands-Posten has apologised for any hurt the caricatures may have caused, but police said the paper's offices in Aarhus were evacuated on Wednesday evening for the second time in two days after a bomb threat. Workers returned after the all-clear.<br><br>Denmark says it cannot tell free media what to do.<br><br>Danish police said on Wednesday they had told the country's imams they were "highly aware of the risks of an escalation of the case, including the calls to burn the Koran, which these days flourish on the Internet and via SMS (phone messages)".</blockquote>(Source: <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-02-02T113128Z_01_L02622515_RTRUKOC_0_UK-RELIGION-DENMARK-CARTOONS.xml&amp;archived=False" rel="nofollow">http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-02-02T113128Z_01_L02622515_RTRUKOC_0_UK-RELIGION-DENMARK-CARTOONS.xml&amp;archived=False</a><br><br><strong>Ignore signature block for the purposes of this thread.

            <div class='col-md body'>Pfft, these erudite Europeans needs to flex their intellectual muscles and my expected reactionary fellow Muslims. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Anyway, the drawings were published FOUR MONTHS ago. Yeah I've seen them, they're drawn badly, but nothing so vile about it lah. I'm indifferent towards these instigations, to and from Muslims, but I like seeing it from the Quran's point of view.<br><br>First of all, its stated that Prophets and mocks goes hand in hand. It iz za nothing new about ita. Abraham, Moses, Jesus (Peace be upon them), the same thing happened to them. "Mocked were (many) apostle before thee; But their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked." Chapter 21: Verse 41<br><br>The "free speech" rhetoric (*cough*freedomtooffend*cough*) is as well endorsed in Islam in the 5th century. "And when you see those who enter into false discourses about Our revelations, withdraw from them until they enter to a different theme." "And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: "To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant." Chapter 28: Verse 55<br>Peace, no threats. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The following verses among others also mandate free speech and the freedom to practice a religion of personal choice.  "Say: 'The truth [has come] from your Sustainer: let, then, him who wills, believe it, and let him who wills, reject it." Chapter 18: Verse 29<br><br>The initial reluctance of the people of Arabia to accept Islam disturbed the Prophet. Then, chapter 10, verse 99 was articulated to fight coercion in any form. It states: "And had your Lord willed, whoever in the earth would have believed all together. Will you then coerce the people to become believers?" According to the above verse, not even God forces a particular form of religion upon anyone.<br><br>Therefore, mockers of prophets or Islam have the God-given right to believe what he wants to believe. However, the Islamic response is to point out, in a kindly manner, what is wrong with the mockery. The Qur'an states in chapter 16, verse 125: "Call thou (all mankind) unto thy Sustainer's path with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and argue with them in the most kindly manner: for behold, thy Sustainer knows best as to who strays from His path, and best knows He as to who are the right-guided."

Yeah I've seen them, they're drawn badly, but nothing so vile about it lah. I'm indifferent towards these instigations, to and from Muslims, but I like seeing it from the Quran's point of view.<br><br>First of all, its stated that Prophets and mocks goes hand in hand. It iz za nothing new about ita. Abraham, Moses, Jesus (Peace be upon them), the same thing happened to them. "Mocked were (many) apostle before thee; But their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked." Chapter 21: Verse 41<br><br>The "free speech" rhetoric (*cough*freedomtooffend*cough*) is as well endorsed in Islam in the 5th century. "And when you see those who enter into false discourses about Our revelations, withdraw from them until they enter to a different theme." "And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: "To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant." Chapter 28: Verse 55<br>Peace, no threats. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The following verses among others also mandate free speech and the freedom to practice a religion of personal choice.  "Say: 'The truth [has come] from your Sustainer: let, then, him who wills, believe it, and let him who wills, reject it." Chapter 18: Verse 29<br><br>The initial reluctance of the people of Arabia to accept Islam disturbed the Prophet. Then, chapter 10, verse 99 was articulated to fight coercion in any form. It states: "And had your Lord willed, whoever in the earth would have believed all together. Will you then coerce the people to become believers?" According to the above verse, not even God forces a particular form of religion upon anyone.<br><br>Therefore, mockers of prophets or Islam have the God-given right to believe what he wants to believe. However, the Islamic response is to point out, in a kindly manner, what is wrong with the mockery. The Qur'an states in chapter 16, verse 125: "Call thou (all mankind) unto thy Sustainer's path with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and argue with them in the most kindly manner: for behold, thy Sustainer knows best as to who strays from His path, and best knows He as to who are the right-guided."

I can't believe you are saying that. Even most of our fellow Western mates directly affected by the terrorism refused to entertain that kind of conviction.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rockhound:</div><div class="quote_body">there is a reason why there is no pictorial depiction of the prophet or prophets b4 him...its not allowed</div></blockquote>Yeah its to prevent any believers in worshipping him as a deity/idol and to direct to God. Prophets are just messengers.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Agenda:<br><strong>And apparently, The Quran allows suicide bombing during holy war..

Virgins as rewards? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Dude, its okay scoffer religion, and you are usually probably right about it, because the religionists themselves display obvious cultish behaviour rather than acts of sensibilities.

            <div class='col-md body'>But whether it is not allowed depends on the laws of each country? I think this exercise in free speech has acheived a lot.<br><br>For one, the hypocrisy of many of the countries and their people have been exposed; I do not see them rioting when someone claims to kill in the name of islam! I do not see them recalling ambassadors when people encourage assasination in the name of islam! The beliefs of these people are frankly incomprehensible to me and these cartoons have forced many people to confront that.<br><br>In addition, the barbarism of many have been exposed. Hamas, for instance has certainly lost whatever goodwill or legitimacy its winning of elections have produced. You do not storm the property of others just because you feel wronged.<br><br>Now, some have blamed the danish. I do not see how that can be. The danish did not institute boycotts over a cartoon. They did not threaten suicide bombs. They exercised their hard fought right of free speech. At worst they were insensitive. The other parties however are, at the very least, violent, barbaric and frankly very stupid.<br><br>My message to these people is: You are not the only people on earth. There are many cultures around and if you even remotely want peace, then perhaps you ought to learn the virtue of tolerance. As You can tell me I am going to hell, so can i mock you.<br><br>Lastly, I will be clogging up my arteries with some danish butter cookies tonights. Sure it will send me on my way earlier....but its my life and i am not harming anyone.<br><br><a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21097.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i1.tinypic.com/n3lnde.gif"></a></div>
