            <div class='col-md body'>The Man Behind the Cartoons :<br>Do You Know This Man ? You Must Know This Man<br><br>1)      Do You Know This Man?<br><br>History has recorded the appearance and deeds of many religious leaders: Moses, Jesus Christ, Zoroaster, and Abraham, to name just a few. There have also been many self-proclaimed prophets and messengers, each of whom has claimed to bring a divine revelation for mankind. Some have proven to be false, and others have been forgotten. But there is one religious leader who stands alone, an unlettered man who transmitted a revelation from God that literally changed the course of history and the destinies of a major portion of mankind: Muhammad, the Prophet and Messenger of God.<br><br>Encyclopedia Britannica confirms:<br><br>"...a mass of detail in the early sources shows that he was an honest and upright man who had gained the respect and loyalty of others who were likewise honest and upright men." (Vol. 12) B<br><br>George Bernard Shaw said about him:<br><br>"He must be called the Savior of humanity I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it much-needed peace and happiness." (The Genuine Islam, Singapore, Vol. 1, No. X 1936)<br><br>"If any religion had the chance of ruling over England, nay Europe within the next hundred years, it could be Islam."<br><br>"I have always held the religion of Muhammad in high estimation because of its wonderful vitality. It is the only religion, which appears to me to possess that assimilating capacity to the changing phase of existence, which can make itself appeal to every age. I have studied him - the wonderful man and in my opinion for from being an anti-Christ, he must be called the Savior of Humanity."<br><br>"I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness: I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad that it would be acceptable to the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today." (Sir George Bernard Shaw in 'The Genuine Islam,' Vol. 1, No. 8, 1936.)<br><br>He was by far the most remarkable man that ever set foot on this earth. He preached a religion, founded a state, built a nation, laid down a moral code, initiated numerous social and political reforms, established a powerful and dynamic society to practice and represent his teachings, and completely revolutionized the worlds of human thought and behavior for all time to come.<br><br>"HIS NAME IS MUHAMMAD" May the Peace of God Be upon Him (PBUH).<br><br>He was born in Arabia in the year 570 CE, Muhammad started his mission of preaching Islam, the religion of truth and the submission of man to One God, at the age of forty and died at the age of sixty-three. During the short twenty-three year period of his prophet hood, Muhammad (PBUH) changed the entire Arabian peninsula forever. Within the space of one generation, the vast majority of people went from paganism and idolatry to devout and strict monotheism, from tribal quarrels and wars to national solidarity and cohesion, from drunkenness and debauchery to sobriety and piety, from lawlessness and anarchy to a lifestyle characterized by discipline, from moral bankruptcy to the highest standards of moral excellence.<br><br>Human history has never seen such a complete transformation of a people or a place before or since-and just imagine that all of these unbelievable wonders took place in just over two decades and because of the efforts of one man.<br><br>Michael H. Hart, in his recently published book on the rating of individuals who have contributed towards the benefit and upliftment of mankind writes:<br><br>"My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world's most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular levels. (M H. Hart, The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, New York, 1978, pp. 33)<br><br>Lamartine, the renowned historian, when speaking on the essentials of human greatness, wonders:<br><br>"If greatness of purpose, smallness of means and astounding results are the three criteria of human genius, who could dare to compare any great man in modern history with Muhammad? The most famous men created arms, laws and empires only they founded, if anything at all, no more than material powers which often crumbled away before their eyes. This man moved not only armies, legislation, empires, peoples and dynasties but millions of men in one-third of the then-inhabited world; and more than that, he moved the altars, the gods, the religions, the ideas, the beliefs and souls.... his forbearance in victory, his ambition, which was entirely devoted to one idea and in no manner striving for an empire; his endless prayers; his mystic conversations with God; his death and his triumph after death; all these attest not to an imposture but to a firm conviction which gave him the power to restore a dogma. This dogma was two-fold: the unity of God and the immateriality of God-the former telling what God is, the latter telling what God is not; the one overthrowing false gods with the sword, the other starting an idea with the words.<br><br>Philosopher, orator, apostle, legislator, warrior, conqueror of ideas, restorer of rational dogmas, of a cult without images, the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire: that is MUHAMMAD. As regards all the standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask IS THERE ANY MAN GREATER THAN HE?" (Lamartine: Histoire de la Turquie, Paris, 1854Vol.11, pp 276- 277).<br><br>The world has had its share of great personalities. But these were one-sided figures who distinguished themselves in only one or two fields, such as religious thought or military leadership. The lives and teachings of these great personalities are shrouded in the mists of time. There is so much speculation about the time and place of their birth, the mode and style of their life, the nature and detail of their teachings, and the degree and measure of their success or failure that it is impossible for humanity to reconstruct accurately the lives and teachings of these men.<br><br>Not so this man The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) accomplished so much in so many fields of human thought and behavior in the fullest blaze of human history. Every detail of his private life and public utterances has been accurately documented and faithfully preserved to our day. The authenticity of the records so preserved are vouched for not only by the faithful followers but even by his prejudiced critics.<br><br>Muhammad (PBUH) was a religious teacher, a social reformer, a moral guide, an administrative colossus, a faithful friend, a wonderful companion, a devoted husband, a loving father-all in one. No other man in history ever excelled or equaled him in any of these different aspects of life- but it was only for the selfless personality of Muhammad (PBUH) to achieve such incredible perfection.<br><br>Mahatma Gandhi, speaking on the character of Muhammad (PBUH), says in Young India:<br><br>"I wanted to know the best of one who holds today undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind....I became more than convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidness, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle. When I closed the 2nd volume (of the Prophet's biography) I was sorry there was not more for me to read of the great life."<br><br>Thomas Carlyle, in his Heroes and Hero-worship, was simply amazed as to "how one man single-handedly could weld warring tribes and wandering Bedouins into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than two decades."<br><br>"The lies (Western slander) which well-meaning zeal has heaped round this man (Muhammad) are disgraceful to ourselves only."<br><br>"A silent great soul, one of that who cannot but be earnest. He was to kindle the world, the world's Maker had ordered so."<br><br>Diwan Chand Sharma wrote:<br><br>"Muhammad was the soul of kindness and his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him. " (D. C. Sharma, The Prophets of the East, Calcutta 1935, pp. 12)<br><br>Edward Gibbon and Simon Ockley, speaking on the profession of Islam write:<br><br>"I believe in one God, and Mahomet, a Apostle of God" is the simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honor of the Prophet has never transgressed the measure of human virtues; and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds or reason and religion." (History of the Saracen Empires, London, 1870, p. 54).<br><br>Muhammad was nothing more or less than a human being But he was a man with a noble mission, one which was to unite all human beings on the worship of the one and only God and to teach them the way to honest and upright living based on the commands of God. He always described himself as "a servant and messenger of God," and every single one of his actions proclaimed loudly the truth of this phrase.<br><br>Bosworth Smith: "He was Caesar and Pope in one; but he was Pope without Pope's pretensions, Caesar without the legions of Caesar: without a standing army, without a bodyguard, without a palace, without a fixed revenue; if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by the right divine, it was Mohammed, for he had all the power without its instruments and without its supports." (Bosworth Smith, MOHAMMAD AND MOHAMMADANISM, London, 1874, p. 92.)<br><br>Annie Besant: "It is impossible for anyone who studies the life and character of the great Prophet of Arabia, who knows how he taught and how he lived, to feel anything but reverence for that mighty Prophet, one of the great messengers of the Supreme. And although in what I put to you I shall say many things which may be familiar to many, yet I myself feel whenever I re-read them, a new way of admiration, a new sense of reverence for that mighty Arabian teacher." (Annie Besant, THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF MUHAMMAD, Madras,1932, p. 4.)<br><br>W. Montgomery Watt: "His readiness to undergo persecutions for his beliefs, the high moral character of the men who believed in him and looked up to him as leader, and the greatness of his ultimate achievement - all argue his fundamental integrity. To suppose Muhammad an impostor raises more problems than it solves. Moreover, none of the great figures of history is so poorly appreciated in the West as Muhammad." (W. Montgomery Watt, MOHAMMAD AT MECCA, Oxford, 1953, p. 52.)<br><br>James A. Michener: "In all things Muhammad was profoundly practical. When his beloved son Ibrahim died, an eclipse occurred, and rumours of God's personal condolence quickly arose. Whereupon Muhammad is said to have announced, "An eclipse is a phenomenon of nature. It is foolish to attribute such things to the death or birth of a human being." "At Muhammad's own death an attempt was made to deify him, but the man who was to become his administrative successor killed the hysteria with one of the noblest speeches in religious history: "If there are any among you who worshipped Muhammad, he is dead. But if it is God you worshipped, He lives forever." (James A. Michener, "ISLAM: THE MISUNDERSTOOD RELIGION," in READER'S DIGEST (American edition), May 1955, pp. 68-70.)<br><br>Sarojini Naidu, the famous Indian poetess speaking on the aspect of equality before God in Islam, stated:<br><br>"It was the first religion that preached and practiced democracy for, in the mosque when the call for prayer is sounded and worshippers are gathered together, the democracy of Islam is embodied five times a day when the peasant and king kneel side by side and proclaim: "God Alone is Great." I have been struck over and over again by this indivisible unity of Islam that makes man instinctively a brother. (S. Naidu, "Ideals of Islam," vide Speaches ~ Writings, Madras, 1918, p. 169).<br><br>Prof. Hurgronje: "The League of Nations founded by the prophet of Islam put the principle of international unity and human brotherhood on such universal foundations as to show candle to other nations ... the fact is that no nation of the world can show a parallel to what Islam has done towards the realization of the idea of the League of Nations." The world has not hesitated to raise to divinity individuals whose lives and missions have been lost in legend. Historically speaking, none of these legends achieved even a fraction of what Muhammad accomplished. And all of his striving was for the sole purpose of uniting mankind for the worship of the one God on the codes of moral excellence. Muhammad or his followers never at any time claimed that he was a son of God, a God-incarnate, or a man having a divine nature-he always was and is even today considered as only a human messenger chosen by God.<br><br>Today even after a lapse of fourteen century, the life and teachings of Muhammad (PBUH) have survived without the slightest loss, alteration, or interpolation. They offer the same undying hope for treating mankind's many ills that they did when he was alive. This is not a claim of Muhammad's followers but also the inescapable conclusion reached by a critical and unbiased study of human history. Maybe it is time for you to get to know this outstanding person who has influenced the life of billions of people over the last fourteen hundred years. He could also change your life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cartoons and Hypocrisy<br>Danes Finally Apologize to Muslims (But for the Wrong Reasons)<br>By RACHARD ITANI<br>In many European countries, there are laws that will land in jail any person who has the chutzpah to deny not only the historicity of the Jewish holocaust, but also the method by which Jews were put to death by the Nazis. In some of these countries, this prohibition goes as far as prosecuting those who would claim or attempt to prove that less than 6 million jews were slaughtered by the Nazis. In none of these countries are there similar laws that threaten people with loss of freedom and wealth for denying that large percentages of gypsies, gays, mentally retarded, and other miscellaneous "debris of humanity" were also eliminated by the Jew-slaughtering Nazis.<br><br>Quickly now: what defines a hypocrite? Answer: a person who follows the letter of the law, but not its spirit. The laws against anti-semitism are just that: laws against anti-semitism enacted by hypocritical Europeans with blood on their hands from the genocides in their recent and distant past, and much guilt to atone for in their hearts and minds.<br><br>The spirit of the law, which would extend this protection to Muslims as well, if not indeed other religious groups, is nowhere to be found in the Western legal code. You can curse the Prophet of the Muslims at will and with total impunity. However, approach the holocaust at your own risks and perils if you do not include in your discussion the standard, ritualistic incantations about the six million Jewish victims of the European Nazis.<br><br>There is a word for this in the English language: hypocrisy.<br><br>I used to have a lot of respect for the Dutch, the Danes, and the Norwegians, and still do. However, I cannot claim that this respect is not more nuanced today. The coloring started when the Dutch, who are invariably and automatically described as being amongst the most "tolerant" people in the West, if not the world, proved that their tolerance was little more than skin deep. Their reaction to the murder of Theo Van Gogh was anything but driven by tolerance. They behaved as a mob in reaction to the criminal, despicable action of an extremist and murderer, by painting the whole Dutch muslim community with the same broad brush that Vincent Van Gogh would have eschewed. They burnt Muslim schools and mosques. They directed opprobrium at Muslims in their midst, calling on them "to go home" though many had been born in the Netherlands. No subtlety in the Dutch reaction. Just collective anti-semitism which they directed not at the Jews, but at the Jews' cousins, the Muslims.<br><br>Then the Danes, who must have felt left out, decided to go the Dutch one better: a Danish paper published cartoons that are no less offensive to Muslims than anti-semitism is to Jews. The cartoons were described by Danish politicians and the press as not provocation, but a principled case of free speech, although many Danish and Scandinavian newspaper editors are on record stating that they published the cartoons as an act of defiance against "radical Islam." This is akin to these ignorant morons recommending that the U.S. ought to nuke Tehran because that would teach Iranian President Ahmadinejad a lesson.<br><br>What free speech are we talking about here? The law says thou shalt not utilize or publish anti-semitic language or imagery. Consequently, Danish (and other European) papers will refrain from doing so, lest they fall foul of the law and offend Jewish sensitivities. The law does not say: thou shalt not offend Muslims or use imagery that may be deeply offensive to them. So Danish papers will not refrain from doing so, in fact they will go out of their way to offend Muslims both in Denmark and around the world, in the name of "free speech." And the Norwegians? Well, they just decided to follow the Danes down perdition lane, all in the name of holy hypocrisy, so a Norwegian paper also published the offending cartoons.<br><br>The statement about "confronting radical Islam" was in fact made by the Norwegian editor of a newspaper that is described as a "Norwegian Christian Paper." And now that other European papers and Magazines have also followed suit, if there was any doubt that this affair is one of anti-Muslim bias, it was swept away by the statements of the Editor in Chief of Die Welt, the German magazine, who declared that the right to publish the cartoons was "at the very core of our culture" and that Europeans cannot "stop using our journalistic right of freedom of _expression within legal boundaries." It's the "legal boundaries" qualifier that gives the game away: there are no legal boundaries in Europe protecting Muslims from the same ignominies that the law protects Jews from.<br><br>And what further argument does Die Welt put forward to justify its "legal" action? " It pointed out that "Syrian TV had depicted Jewish rabbis as cannibals." You can imagine how helpful a similar argument would hold up in a court of law: "But your honor, I only killed one guy and raped two women: the other guy killed four and raped 10!" That a German editor-in-chief of a major German paper should use the "legal" argument to justify offending the religious sensitivities of Muslims, when that same "legal" framework would see him thrown in jail faster than he could spell the word legal if he offended the sensitivities of Jews, may be a testament at least of his own deep-seated contempt for Muslims. That so many European papers have now reprinted the offensive cartoons is an indication that the contempt for Muslims does not stop with the editor-in-chief of Die Welt.<br><br>This whole affair is nothing but an over-reaction to a simple cartoon, you say? Not if you remember a certain other cartoon that appeared in the British newspaper, The Independent, on 27 January 2003. It depicted Prime Minister Sharon of Israel eating the head of a Palestinian child while saying: "What's wrong? You've never seen a politician kissing babies before?" Jews in Britain and around the world erupted with indignation, arguably because the depiction reminded them of millennial charges levied against them by Christians who accused them of using the blood of babies in ritualistic killings. You see, Sharon can actually kill, maim and spill the real, actual blood of Palestinian babies: that is not offensive to Zionist Jews and their apologists in the West. But let Sharon be depicted in a cartoon metaphorically as the ogre that he has proved to be in his real life, symbolically eating a Palestinian child, and the world will erupt in offended indignation. A cartoon that is offensive to Muslims, on the other hand, is depicted as nothing but an _expression of "free speech." There is a word for this in any language: hypocrisy.<br><br>Before the Danish cartoon incident started to evolve into a growing international crisis, the Danish Prime Minister and the publisher of the Danish newspaper that first published the offending cartoons both declared that they would never apologize on grounds of free speech and because publishing the cartoons had not broken any Danish laws. (Yes, the "no law broken" argument again.) Yesterday, however, they both ended up apologizing in the face of a growing tsunami of protests on the part of Arab and Muslim governments, some of whom withdrew their Ambassadors from Copenhagen. The Danish prime minister did not apologize because his moral compas suddenly found True North again. The real reason, of course, is that he understood, though a tad too late, the potential economic consequences of a widespread boycott of Danish goods on the part of one billion people. There is a word for this in the Danish language: realpolitik.<br><br>Muslims and other reasoning people around the world understand well that European laws against anti-Semitic speech, writing, and behavior, were enacted for two reasons. The stated reason was to protect the Jews from the continued onslaught of anti-Semitic attacks, both verbal and physical, which culminated historically in the repeated pogroms that Christian Europeans launched against Jews repeatedly through the centuries. (Historically, it was the Arabs who protected the Jews and took them in whenever they fled Christian barbarity, especially in the Middle Ages.)<br><br>The real reason, of course, is to protect the Europeans from the pangs of their own conscience, which has very good reason to feel guilty indeed, given what Europeans did to Jews in the last millennium, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries, not to mention what they did to the indiginous people of the Carribean and the Americas since the 1600s, and to the people of Asia, Africa and Oceania as well. I have long thought that it's European Christians, more so than Jews, who ought to observe Yom Kippur, or adopt a similar atonement observance of their own.<br><br>While the spirit of the law is that Europeans shalt not offend any ethnic or religious groups including Muslims, this seems to be lost only on the Europeans themselves, or at least the Danes, the Germans and their ilk amongst them, who only care about, or fear, the letter of the law. Why should we therefore be shocked when Muslims depict Europeans as nothing but a bunch of hypocrites? Why shouldn't Governments of Muslim countries recall their Ambassadors to Denmark in protest, as some did? The only disappointment is that no Western or non-Muslim government, the meek complaints to a French newspaper by the French Foreign Office excepted, had the moral and ethical courage to publicly, unequivocally and forcefully condemn an act that is as deeply offensive to Muslims as the desecration of a Torah scroll, or of a Jewish cemetery, is offensive to all civilized people in the world, be they Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Animist, or Atheist.<br><br>There are two ways for Europeans to redeem themselves: the immediate temptation would be to call on their national parliaments to extend the protections of the laws against anti-Semitism and Holocaust denying to Islam and Muslims, as well as any other religious group . That would be the wrong recommendation however. The right recommendation would be to repeal the laws that govern holocaust denying and other laws that favor one group over another, so that the issue truly becomes one of free speech. And if Europeans are the civilized people they claim to be, then their politicians and newspaper publishers ought to find it easy to immediately apologize when they have unwittingly offended the taboos of any human community, be it religious or otherwise.<br><br>Muslims and Arabs have suffered enough hypocrisy on the hands of European Christians, just as Jews suffered in the past on the hands of these same Europeans, and as Palestinian Muslims and Christians alike are suffering today on the hands of Americans, Europeans and, of course, Zionist Jews, both Sephardim and Ashkenazi. If Europe thinks of itself as a civilized society, then it ought to do its utmost to redress the wrongs that too many people around the world have suffered as a result of European misbehavior and often outright criminal actions, most especially since the 1400s.<br><br>Muslims deserve nothing more nor less than for Christians in the U.S. and Europe, and Zionist Jews in Israel, to simply abide by the golden rule: treat others as you would have others treat you. So far, Christians and Zionist Jews have proven that they only abide by the alternative definition of this rule: "They who have the gold, make the rule." The gold in this case is a combination of economic and military might. Of this, Europeans, Zionist Jews and their American overlords have aplenty in reserve. Were it that they also had an equal reserve of un-hypocritical, civilized morality and ethical behavior to underpin their feelings of sanctimonious superiority.<br><br>And the other measure that Europeans can adopt to redeem themselves? The European people can start by throwing out of office, and initiating criminal proceedings against, any politician responsible for sending a single soldier to invade, occupy, and initiate pogroms against the people of Iraq: these politicians have been guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which makes them unfit for the honors that continued office holding bestows upon them. Europeans can also give the boot to any politician who has approved or turned a blind eye to a single rendition flight that sent any person to the torture chambers of the Americans or their surrogate torturers in some Arab or Muslim countries. These are the same countries whose religious sensitivities we should all respect as strongly as we respect Jewish sensitivities when it comes to the Jewish holocaust, not because the law says so, but because it's the right thing to do. These are also the same countries whose human rights trespasses Europeans ought to condemn as equally and vehemently as they should condemn the continued human rights abuses and state terrorism perpetrated by the Israeli government in Palestine/Israel, and by some European governments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in other out-of-sight/out-of-mind places like Haiti, Africa, and elsewhere.<br><br>In other words, Europeans can start by applying the simple rule of one weight and one measure to both friends and foes, equally to themselves and to the rest of the world, because policy and politics, both domestic and foreign, ought to be based upon and subject to principled moral considerations, not expediency of the economic, financial or religious kind.<br><br>Is that such an unreasonable moral proposition to consider?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who's fault is the Danish boycott?<br>By Svend White<br><br>When I look at analysis of the Danish cartoon controversy, I'm struck by how so many otherwise well informed and intelligent commentators simply don't get it.   The basic reasons for and issues involved in this  crisis are pretty easy to grasp, but one is nonetheless hard pressed to find them in most discussions of the saga in the media.   Instead, one finds all these ethereal discursions on freedom of religion and freedom of speech, ideals that actually have precious little to do with this lamentable turn of events.  This is about politics and prejudices, not constitutional rights.<br><br>Mona Eltahawy of MWU writes :<br><br>Can we finally admit that Muslims have blown out of all proportion their outrage over 12 cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad published in a Danish newspaper last September?<br><br>Umm, no we can't.  At least not in the way you mean.<br><br>Eltahaway, like so many other liberal Muslim commentators at the moment--it seems everyone's working overtime to prove to non-Muslims how secular and progressive they are by defending the Jyllands-Posten outrageous and irresponsible attacks on the Prophet Muhammad--overlooks  basic political and cultural context to those cartoons, and ignores the significance of the openly hostile way they were presented in the first place.<br><br>In recent years, Denmark has been lurching rightward and turning increasingly hostile to Islam and Muslims (who now make up about 4% of the population).  It is becoming increasingly common to see headlines about prominent Danish figures openly expressing prejudice against Islam, and mainstream parties are working increasingly closely with hardline nationalist (and, of course, Muslim-baiting) parties that were once rightly viewed as fringe and beyond the pale.  It's gotten so bad in Denmark--and I'm sorry to say so as someone whose maternal side of the family is there and who has long taken pride in Denmark's once enlightened policies--that a prominent pundit in neighboring Sweden declared Denmark the most xenophobic country in Europe.  By all accounts, inter-communal relations in Denmark (which for the most part are Muslim/non-Muslim relations) are becoming worryingly strained and beset with prejudice and misunderstandings.  This is the political and social context that Jyllands-Posten's attacks on the Prophet occured in, and which is conspicuously absent from the MWU piece.<br><br>Then there's the *way* this so-called defense of freedom of speech was launched by Jyllands-Posten.  They didn't simply defy the traditional Islamic ban on portraying the Prophet--as any lover of Persian art knows, there are many classics of Islamic art which also completely ignore this taboo; a few mundane sketches of the Prophet by aren't going to roil the Ummah--with predictable drawings, they chose to attack his character and portray him as a bloodthirsty killer.   Not so long ago during the 1980s, many American Christians were up in arms for much, much less in Martin Scorcese's infinitely more respectful rendering of a religious icon in "The Last Temptation of Christ".<br><br>There's another fundamental problem with this apologia--it rest on a demonstrably false assumption that other religions are routinely treated in this manner.  For all this, if you'll forgive the ironic choice of words, pious talk by the secular intelligentsia about how other religions are supposedly subjected to the same withering treatment that Islam and Muslims are now weathering, you'll be hard pressed to think of many comparable examples.<br><br>For example, how many times have you seen a portrait of Jesus Christ portrayed in a deliberately offensive and controversial manner in a Western publication that is read by millions?  How many times have you seen a portrait of Christ that is remotely uncomplementary?  The closest analogue I can think of to this controversy in recent American history is the furor over the  "Piss Christ" art exhibit (which, while admittedly disgusting and offensive, pales by comparison to the bile of Jyllands-Posten's "defense" of free speech)?  Did the New York Times include an insert of photos from that exhibit?  Was it televised on ABC?  Has it since been repeatedly republished by other media outlets?<br><br>How about Buddha?  Moses?  Abraham?  Can't think of any public mockery of them in the mainstream media?  Okay, how lesser known religious figures, like Guru Nanak (the founder of Sikhism), Joseph Smith (Mormonism), or Mary Baker Eddy (Christian Science)?  Still none?  Hmm, how about even L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology)?<br><br>Really, try to find deliberate, open assaults on these revered figures that were dignified by publication in the major outlet.  Find a case where a person revered as a spiritual guide by many millions of people is intentionally and openly pilloried in the crudest terms in a major newspaper.  You won't succeed.  My guess is that you'll be hard pressed to even found a case of such an icon being affectionately parrodies with a fake nose and glasses, so reverent is media mainstream coverage of these revered figures.<br><br>There's a reason for this.  As Edward Said has pointed out long ago, Islam and Muslims are the perennial exceptions to the rules of consistency, objectivity and scholarly rigor in contemporary Western policy debates.  A newspaper can crudely and deliberately malign the Prophet Muhammad at a time when Muslims are increasingly being mocked and discriminated against throughout the West--and in a manner guaranteed to stoke the flames of prejudice and hatred--and we're all supposed to stand by it in the name of freedom of religion?  Give me a break.  Get back to me when Jyllands-Posten runs comparably offensive cartoons about Jews, Christians or even Rastafarians.  Then I'll understand the "bigger picture" here.<br><br>Eltahawy observes:<br><br>Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen was right not to intervene, insisting the government has no say over media - the argument used by Arab leaders when they are asked about anti-Semitism in their media, by the way. But in a New Year's speech, Rasmussen condemned "any _expression, action or indication that attempts to demonize groups of people on the basis of their religion or ethnic background."<br><br>To portray this as a simple choice between state intervention or freedom of speech is to miss the whole point, I'm afraid.<br><br>It's also an example, in my opinion, of how blind liberal Muslim commentators can be to the dynamics of power in Muslim/non-Muslim relations today.  Like a white  intellectual discussing American race  problems in abstract categories of right and wrong ("Black racism is just wrong!"), such overly philosophical analysis overlooks the messy ethical nuances and pyschological twists introduced by great disparities of power and preexisting histories of discrimination and marginalization.  It is always tempting to discuss such thorny problems in a historical vacuum--in fact, this is the preferred tactic of Muslim bashers--but this condemns the analysis to irrelevance in the real world. But that's another discussion.<br><br>The problem was not Prime Minister Rasmussen's stance against censorship--which I support and I don't think many Muslims would be terribly surprised by--but his unwillingness to openly disavow this outburst of rank prejudice and xenophobia by a major Danish publication.  His refusal to meet with the host of ambassadors from Muslims states worsened the situation greatly, sending the message that the Danish government was so indifferent to the concern of Muslims around the world that it couldn't even *discuss* the matter and giving hardliners on the other side the perfect pretext for stirring up conflict.<br><br>An aside.  This is where I have issues with the shows of solidarity by various other European media in republishing those cartoons recently.  Not only are they allowing Jyllands-Posten to duck  responsibility for sparking this crisis--its actions displayed grievously poor judgment, if not outright bigotry-- in running those cartoons, but these other European media are creating the impression in the Muslim world that, you guessed it, Europe is united in supporting  attacks on Islam and spitting on Muslim sensibilities.  It is doing so at the very same time that it's incessantly preaching to Muslims about religious extremism, anti-Semitism and other unsightly social phenomen in Muslim societies.  Muslims will understandably wonder at their silence on open prejudice and Islamophobia.<br><br>I understand their desire to support freedom of speech, but I'm not sure this was a particularly constructive move.  And I doubt it'll make all that much of a difference for Denmark in the long run, anyway.  Unforunately, negative impressions born of terrible press like this is hard to undo.  This damage can only be done through diplomacy that demonstrates that this has been a collosal misunderstanding.  I don' t think the spectacle of European media rallying to not only implicitly endorse but to greatly increase the distribution of the scurrilous drawings that caused the rift in the first place will help much.  Jyllands-Posten's tawdry case is unworthy of this grand and politically risky gesture.<br><br>Also, it must be said that this cause is being exploited by Middle Eastern governments to burnish their often dubious credentials of respect for religious tradition.  As one Danish commentator Rune Engelbreth Larsen noted , Jyllands-Posten should rather have exercised its vaunted right to freedom of _expression not to denigrate Islam, but to mock these dictatorial and hypocritical regimes, which are now cynically exploiting this crisis for domestic political consuption.  But that fact that doesn't change anything.  Two wrongs, as they say, don't make a right.<br><br>Part of leadership is distancing yourself and your government from unhealthy trends in your society, even if only rhetorically--Had those cartoons been of Ariel Sharon with horns on his head you and matzoh dripping with Gentile blood, you can be sure he would have said something for the record, and rightly so.--and leaders speak out all the time on far less weighty matters.  Leaders also meet constantly with representatives of important consistencies (and, as the calamitous impact of this brewing boycott has shown, those ambassadors definitely represented an important constituency).  Unfortunately, the government under Rasmussen sent a clear political message to Danish Muslims and Muslims around the world by refusing to take these concerns  seriously until it was far too late.<br><br>The other thing that many observers fail to understand is that this is basically a case where hardliners lashed out, as they periodically do, at an already scapegoated and vulnerable minority and, for a change, found themselves on the receiving end.    It's not unlike a bully who makes a habit of picking on the smallest kid in the schoolyard finding himself in hot water when he happens to pick a child with a large family.  Zealots picked a fight that they thought was safe and now we're supposed to agonize because that they're suddenly outnumbered?<br><br>I'm very saddened by this surreal international crisis, which is as unnecessary as it is unfortunate, but we need to think about who "started it".  It is exceedingly tragic that Danes around the world and the Danish economy are being caught in the crossfire and it is my fervid hope is that this bizarre episode will be defused quickly, but they need to understand how we reached this point. Is it fair that Denmark should be in this pickle for the actions of a few?  Certainly not.  But neither is it fair that the founder of Islam should be singled out for such singular abuse, nor that such outbursts of contempt for Muslims and Islam should be increasingly commonplace in Danish politics. It's a sure-fire recipe for confrontation.<br><br>It's also my hope that Denmark, whose political climate has really taken a nasty, xenophobic turn in recent years vis-a-vis its Muslim minority, learns something from it.  As they quite understandably rail against Denmark's suddenly precarious situation--Danish business leaders are in a panic at the prospect of a boycott, security officials are increasingly worried about the risk of terrorist attacks in retaliation, and there are cases of hackers indiscriminately attacking websites in Danish--I think rank and file Danes ought to stop in the midst of all this mayhem and ask themselves, "Have I played a role in bringing this confrontation about?  Do I tacitly support the denigration and scapegoating of immigrants?  Did I condone Jyllands-Posten's entirely unnecessary public _expression of contempt for Muslims and their beliefs?"  If you did, I submit with all due respect you're not a completely innocent bystander after all.  Some would argue that the proverbial chickens are coming home to roost.  Perhaps, you need to reexamine your attitudes towards your Muslim neighbors to ensure that you're not part of the problem that landed Denmark in this bizarre mess.<br><br>Finally, regardless of what side we come down on, let's get something straight:  We all have a right to boycott the products of those who we feel insult us.  This insight applies especially to all you libertarians and other promoters of the free market as pie-in-the-sky solution to all the world's problems.   (Boycotts are your omniscent Invisible Hand at work, people.)  It is not extremism or terrorism. (I'm reminded of all the claptrap by pro-Israeli apologists in the American media in the past about the great "injustice" and "extremism" of the old Arab boycott against Israel, as if Israel had a right to Arab money while it built settlements on Palestinian land and regularly ignored Palestinian human rights.)  In all but the most unusual of circumstances, boycotts are a peaceful and legitimate protest. In fact, they are often the only effective means of protest left to the masses in our day of globalization, unrestrained multi-national corporations, and co-opted media.   It's often the only way the little guy can be heard (just ask Selma Park).<br><br>The bottom line is this:  Shortsighted leadership (by an administration that is, it should be noted, allied with hard-liners) let what should have been a minor local hiccup in inter-communal relations mushroom into an international, geopolitical cause celebre and icon of Muslim frustrations.  Prime Minister Rasmussen's ham-handed response has made Denmark, no doubt unfairly, into the latest poster child for the Clash of Civilizations.  Frankly, it should come as no surprise that a boycott should be in the works, tragic though its consequences for normal Danes may be.<br><br>Muslims didn't start this fight--obnoxious hardliners on the other side did.  Hopefully these unsavory elements in Denmark (and bigots and xenophobes everywhere) will remember this lesson next time they're tempted to score cheap points at the expense of a small, embattled community.  It's a small, interconnected world.  Like in kindergarten, you never know when your bullying might backfire on you.<br></div>

If the very basic framework is violated the religion will cease to exist.<br><br>In other words religion cannot be reformed out of existence. As we say a person cannot sign his own death warrant, a religion cannot allow itself to be done away with.<br><br>However, one should be free to renounce his/her religion if it ceases to appeal to his/her conscience. <strong><span style="color: green;">A religion which does not appeal to once conscience or does not form part of once inner conviction can have no meaning for that person</span>.</strong><br><br>But does Islam permit this freedom of conscience?<br>In my considered opinion it does.<br><br>But why then some Islamic countries insist on punishment of death for renouncing Islam (i.e. irtidad)? We will throw light on this little later.<br><br>However, such a punishment for renouncing Islam cannot be supported from the QurÂ’anic teachings. <strong><span style="color: red;">There is no verse directly supporting such punishment</span></strong>.<br><br>Of course there are ahadith quoted in its support. But these ahadith need to be examined carefully. Not only their authenticity but also their context needs to be looked into.<br><br>But most important thing is that religion is an integral part of once inner conviction and is a matter of once conscience. Even according to a hadith mere confession by tongue (iqrar biÂ’ al-lisan) is not enough . It must be followed by an inner endorsement or once conscience (tasdiq biÂ’ al-janan). Mere confession by once tongue will not acquire the status of truly held conviction.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">The QurÂ’an clearly declares la ikrah fiÂ’ al-din (2:256) i.e. there cannot be in compulsion in religion</span>.</strong><br><br>Some commentators maintain that this verse was aimed at early converts and that it was later abrogated. But there is absolutely no basis for such an assertion. It is declaration of a universally valid principle rather than any contextual statement. It is valid until today and will remain valid in future also.<br><br><strong>It is also substantiated by the fact that Islam accepted validity of other contemporary religions like Judaism, Christianity etc. and <span style="color: brown;">even permitted marriages with them</span>.</strong> They were not coerced into accepting Islam at all.<br><br><strong>Any coercion wold lead to acceptance by tongue, not endorsement by heart.</strong><br><br>Here in the above verse the word used is <strong>din</strong> which is usually translated as religion. But it has wider meaning. The word <strong>din</strong> not only includes the moral law but also pertains to its doctrinal contents and their practical implications, as well as to manÂ’s attitude towards the object of his worship, thus comprising also the concept of Â“faithÂ”.<br><br><strong>Thus according to the QurÂ’an human being is absolutely free to pursue religion of his/her choice. And this freedom does not pertain to only acceptance or non-acceptance of Islam; <span style="color: red;">it also pertains to renunciation of Islam.</span> </strong><br><br>Many Muslim jurists may reject this outright and maintain that though one is free to accept or not accept Islam but having accepted it one is not free to renounce it. Thus according to them freedom is limited to only acceptance or non-acceptance of Islam but does not extend to its renunciation. This position does not appear to be logical.<br><br>Freedom of conscience cannot be a one way traffic.<br><br><strong>Obviously the freedom of renunciation was curtailed for political and not religious reason.</strong><br><br>If the Islamic jurists seek to circumscribe the freedom to renounce Islam the question is whether it is based on QurÂ’an or on hadith (i.e. the ProphetÂ’s sayings).<br><br>A careful study of the holy QurÂ’an shows that there is no basis whatsoever in it to sustain such a position i.e. qatl-e-murtad (i.e. slaying of one renouncing Islam).<br><br><strong>On the contrary there is a verse in the Holy Book which leaves one in no doubt that such a punishment has no basis and that it is based on the opinion of jurists and that these jurists took this position to protect interests of state rather than those of Islam. </strong><br><br>Thus we find in the verse 4:137 in the QurÂ’an Â“ Those who believe then disbelieve (kafaru), again believe and again disbelieve, then increase in disbelief, Allah will never forgive them or guide them in the (right) way.Â” </span></blockquote></div>
