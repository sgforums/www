With credible Political and Military muscles, China will be able to face any interventionist challenge from the USA in coming to the defense of Taiwan.<br><br>Similary, Singapore has to continue to be economically successful, so as to have the financial clout to build up and maintain a modern Military Machine that has a quality standard of at least one generation ahead of the other countries in the region.<br><br>The "Opening Up" of Singapore has many connotations, and much will depend on what LHL has in mind when such a term is used.<br><br>Does the "Opening Up" of Singapore refer to the Political Arena, in which the Government will not use the Law to suppress strong Opposition Personalities, and allow alternative viewpoints to thrive ?<br><br>Or does "Opening Up" of Singapore merely refer to non-Political issues only ?<br><br>Perhaps by the term - "Opening Up" the present Singapore Government had meant the relaxation of tight legislations that tightly supervise economic activities, which can only rsult in individual entrepreneurial efforts being stifled.<br><br>Before China's Deng Siow Peng encourage the "opening up" of China, its national reserves was nothing compared to the more then US Dollar 90 Billions in the Singapore Treasury.<br><br>Yet in less then twenty years, China's reserves is more than three times that of Singapore.<br><br>Singapore no longer has the monopoly of being the gateway to South-east and East Asia.<br><br>The population numbers and the size of the neighboring countries are far larger than Singapore, and allow their citizens far greater opportunities at  higher levels of economic activities that keep the citizens employed.<br><br></div>
