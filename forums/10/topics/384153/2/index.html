So, not withstanding your hatre toward the govt, you need to look at our citizens, love and understand them.</p>

              <p>A Taiwanese 'hum' will always be a Taiwanese 'hum' - can it be a Singaporean in any ways by merely getting a pseudo-citizenship from the PAP ?</p>
              <p>It is simply pathetic that when it is time for a Taiwanese 'hum' to decide to be clever - it does not even have the intelligence how to be.</p>
              <p>Is the objective about where to direct "hate" or to object to anybody' choice ?</p>
              <p>The stupidity of the Taiwanese 'hum' is totally insufferable not to realise that the objective is to stop the Taiwanese 'hum' to spread its ignorance in this Speaker's Corner so as to deliberately drive the threads off-track to achieve its objective to get its orgasm as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Whenever I was invited to attend those tripartite forums and dinner, i am truly awe by the understanding, trust and comarderieship of these 3 parties, and I dine with Union leaders and Ministers together on the same table, such scene will never happen anywhere in the world, beside, i attended because my Dad alway got no time to go, but it give me that insight of what our industrial relationship is all about. Good.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did the Taiwanese 'hum' get the invitation to attend those tripartite forum to provide a display of its oratory skills by flapping its clitoris in a public forum to achieve its desire to reach its orgasmic high ?</p>
              <p>Surely we can believe that you dine with the Union Leaders and Ministers together with your foreign talents in the flesh trade.</p>
              <p>Did they bring you to the Sofitel Hotel and to the same room as the director from Keppel had brought your foreign talent who received a big tip after a satisfactory private service ?</p>
              <p>What was your tip for flapping your clitoris at the dinner ?</p>
              <p>Was it paid with currency marked as the personal income or from tax payer's money for the entertainment provided by the Taiwanese 'hum' and its partners in its flesh trade ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Politic aside, LKY aside, LHL aside, the labour movement is heading in a correct way, pro business, pro workers and pro citizenship  is very well balanced. I hope that even if Opposition Won the election with a landslide victory, please keep in mind our fellows singapore workers and citizens working condition and welfare, and not to indulge in self interest objective.</p>
              <p>Thank you</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Why will the labor movement not be heading in a correct direction ?</p>
              <p>With the Taiwanese 'hum' consumating its services over dinner with the leadership from the union and ministries, the 'hum' will soon be laboring in nine months time if not earlier.</p>
              <p>With the big tip received after the flapping service, one can expect the Taiwanese 'hum' to sing praises for the leadership from the union and the ministries.</p>
              <p>The only ones who knows how to indulge in "self-interest objective" is the experienced Taiwanese 'hum' with its clitoris flapping in its mouth and determined to draw more attention then it can handle to satisfy its needs as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>
