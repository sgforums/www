              <p><br>That is the basic of the NTUC set objectives, a union for all. In every NGO organisation, membership is the blood of the organsiation, without it, what is Unions?? or Clubs?? As what i heard their chief, that Lim said, from all collars to no collars can join the unions, all are welcome, no matter who you are, you can be a part of Union, even MD and Directors. For such organisation, as long as you can attract memberships, be it who they are, you have done a good job.</p>
              <p>I am also a member of Unions, they give me, but i have to pay about $9 per month. But it worthwhile, tho i may not have those grievences like workers do, I still consult them on Labour Laws matters, their Industry Officers are very well verse, friendly and helpful. These alone save me thousand of dollars just to consult those Conn sultant. So, what is $9?? beside i get good discount at petrol station and many other perks, even i was surprise that they subsidize professional courses and great discount at zoo, parks and the singapore flyer. In another words, whatever you paid for, it is much much more worth than you take from...I took those supervisory and leadership courses at a 10th of what i have to pay in private school.</p>
              <p>With a 500,000 membership, each paying $9/mth, that will be 4.5millions per mth, and with the income from insurance, supermarket, childcares and many other of their cooperatives..they are one of the richest Union in the world.

              <p>Tho i had a tough negotiation with Unions official from NTUC in regarding to my employees terms and benefits, i find them very cooperative, friendly, understanding and negotiable peoples, it was not what i initally thought like those banging table demanding here and there, in taiwan, my birthplace, you cannot have such relationship, most will be demanding and if you do not give in anything, nobody will turn up at your organisation the next day, all will be protesting. They can even get Mafia to harass you.</p>
              <p>So, i see singapore govt, labour and employer relationship is the best in the world, like it or not, NTUC do a good job, they really created the trust and bridged we, the employers, be it SME like our business with govt and workers. It is a relationship that no other countries in this world can model it even if they copy it. Therefore speaking from an employer perspective, we must not let this unique relationship fall apart. Even as an employer, I admired what had NTUC done and help the workers.</p>

              <p><br>That is the basic of the NTUC set objectives, a union for all. In every NGO organisation, membership is the blood of the organsiation, without it, what is Unions?? or Clubs?? As what i heard their chief, that Lim said, from all collars to no collars can join the unions, all are welcome, no matter who you are, you can be a part of Union, even MD and Directors. For such organisation, as long as you can attract memberships, be it who they are, you have done a good job.</p>
              <p>I am also a member of Unions, they give me, but i have to pay about $9 per month. But it worthwhile, tho i may not have those grievences like workers do, I still consult them on Labour Laws matters, their Industry Officers are very well verse, friendly and helpful. These alone save me thousand of dollars just to consult those Conn sultant. So, what is $9?? beside i get good discount at petrol station and many other perks, even i was surprise that they subsidize professional courses and great discount at zoo, parks and the singapore flyer.

              <p>It had been proven from time to time that a peaceful industrial relationship is to key to economy success, without it, we can never pass thru the oil crisis, the asian crisis, the 911, Sars and the current financial crisis. We are a fragile state without natural resources, not even a water melon, so we depended very much on financial services and industrials, if we will to take on the employers with strong demand, we will not be here today. For that, you must understand, it is not a laughing matters, the good tripartite relationship in Singapore must maintain and progress.</p>
              <p>Other countries work in a different ways, their unions is very independent, therefore they have to fight for their rights, for Singaporeans, we negiotate for our rights. That is the different, we would rather aim of a win win situation than a win lose or lose lose situation. I got nothing to do with the unions, as a member of the employers' federation, i also must appreciate my Federation cooperation with Unions and Govt.</p>
              <p>The model is something i learned in my school days as a Brownie, they thot us how to make a fire, for that u need a triangle of air, material and fuel, without one of it, it will be very difficult or simply failed. So the three parties, the Unions, Employers and the Govt of Singapore work in way of getting our economy and industrial to a vibrant situation. It is not that there is no fighting for their rights, but rather said negotiate for their rights, the framework is set, if you cannot settle, there is concillating at MOM and follow by abitration at Labour court. So our system is good.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The insufferable Taiwanese 'hum' is at its best when it 'Talk Cock and Sing Song' in this Speaker's Corner after its nightly walk to sell itself at night as it slime its ways from the bars at Geylang to Joo Chiat and walk the streets at Desker, Petain and Keong Siak.</p>
              <p>And as the Taiwanese 'hum' has claimed, what it cannot sell at Night, it will sell itself in the Day in this Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> With the Taiwanese 'hum' being a talent scout recruited by PAPa, 'swei-siao' Lim from NTUC can challenge <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkpcdez4U4Q&amp;amp;feature=related">‘Mark Lee (*1)’ </a>to be the next upcoming candidate to star in Jack Neo's next movie.</p>
              <p>The brilliance of 'swei-siao' Lim will no longer be needed as a Cabinet Minister with no Portfolio, as 'swei-siao' Lim is better being out of the cabinet with his multiple talents. With one clown less, it will make more room in an over crowded cabinet. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly again, PAPa seeds planted in the Taiwanese 'hum' never received enough attention and allowed the weeds to infest inside the 'hum' to let it grow wild to kill the carefully planted seeds.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that PAPa seeds have all grown wrongly in the Taiwan 'hum' - and led the Taiwanese 'hum' to spread its ignorance with its tongue flapping like a clitoris left deliberately on public display ?</p>
              <p>Not even a water melon in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the ignorant Taiwanese 'hum' is better walking its familiar slimy streets then strolling down Singapore's north-western parts to know the private ventures that led to more <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ava.gov.sg/AgricultureFisheriesSector/FarmingInSingapore/AgroTechParks/">‘Agrotechnology Parks developed by Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore’ (*2) </a>and also with the many <a rel="nofollow" href="http://images.google.com.sg/images?hl=en&amp;amp;q=hydroponics+farming&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;ei=eNoiS43bJc-TkAWmhrWnAw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;amp;ct=title&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;ved=0CCEQsAQwAw">‘hydroponic farming in vertical gardens’ (*3) </a></p>
              <p>The products from the Agrotechnology Parks and Hydroponic Farms is a major source to supplement the other sources from neighboring countries that are funded by Singapore private capital too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Only a Taiwanese 'hum' with PAPa's seeds planted in it will be dumb to think that it can negotiate(?) with the "Unions and Govt" - when the Government is the Union, and the Union belongs to the Government.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=J9-iUG25VPEC&amp;amp;pg=PA25&amp;amp;lpg=PA25&amp;amp;dq=singapore+trade+union+symbiotic+relations&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=jhyhb9rJph&amp;amp;sig=IOfojmZ66MZvTxlkDEwaA-mTlYo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=6dwiS-6ILcuTkAWMoMCnAw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=9&amp;amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=singapore%20trade%20union%20symbiotic%20relations&amp;amp;f=false">‘Singapore trade union symbiotic relations may lead to wage stability, but had also caused inflexibility and placed artificial impediments in the use of Singapore’s only resource effectively’ (*2) </a></p>
              <p> With PAPa's Government involved in every aspect of planning and influencing the outcome of the implementation to achieve the desired results, success is based on its own criteria based on a set of local standards for local circumstances.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that Singapore cannot match the industrial output and advancement of "<em>other Asian NIEs, particularly South Korea and Taiwan</em>" - which was recognised as an "<em>earlier under-investment in formal and informal education (that) had resulted in a workforce</em>" as these other Asian NIEs ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The intelligence of a Taiwanese 'hum' is best kept at the elementary school level, and should stay that way if its career has also taken on the elementary level of satisfying the human needs with its flesh trade.</p>
              <p>Can anyone depend on the intellectual abilities of the Taiwanese 'hum' ?</p>
              <p>While it can appreciate that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">to make a fire, for that u need a triangle of air, material and fuel, without one of it, it will be very difficult or simply failed</span></em>" - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which are three separate elements</span></strong> - are there any separate elements to be seen in "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the three parties, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unions</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Employers</span> and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Govt of Singapore</span></span></em>" that it sees has helped "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">getting our economy and industrial to a vibrant situation</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Is the Singapore "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">economy and industrial</span></em>" in any state of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">vibrant situation</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>The economy has been in a flip-flop situation since 1997, and due largely to the fact that there are no fire to light up the Singapore Economy, when the hoped for three elements to start the fire do not exist. </p>
              <p>Has the Taiwanese 'hum' found the three elements to light up its energy to be so vigorous in its flesh trade in the bars and streets at night, and to continue flapping its clitoris to spread its ignorance in the day in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>

              <p><br>You diam diam lah, everything i said also HUM, even you dun like PAP, you also must respect our fellows Singaporeans choice of accepting NTUC, we need to be objective on what we hate, at times, there are good Organisation that need to be praise, I have no doubt that if Opposition is to take over the govt, they will continue to have a symbolic relationship with the labour, they may name it differently, but the essence of a peaceful industrial relationship is every political leader dream. So, not withstanding your hatre toward the govt, you need to look at our citizens, love and understand them.</p>
              <p>Whenever I was invited to attend those tripartite forums and dinner, i am truly awe by the understanding, trust and comarderieship of these 3 parties, and I dine with Union leaders and Ministers together on the same table, such scene will never happen anywhere in the world, beside, i attended because my Dad alway got no time to go, but it give me that insight of what our industrial relationship is all about. Good.</p>
              <p>Politic aside, LKY aside, LHL aside, the labour movement is heading in a correct way, pro business, pro workers and pro citizenship  is very well balanced. I hope that even if Opposition Won the election with a landslide victory, please keep in mind our fellows singapore workers and citizens working condition and welfare, and not to indulge in self interest objective.</p>

              <p>actually union memberships decrease in Singapore because people didnt join them because unions have little roles to play here. They dun help people bargain for higher wages (which is why unions exist for). And NTUC give out memberships to aunties and ah mas who go to NTUC to buy groceries too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You are right.   I was curious about union and approached them to explore possibility of joining as a member.   To my disappointment, I was told that I will not be protected if the employer wants to play dirty.    </p>
              <p>Forget about joining union if you are not the low skilled workers in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is all bullshit.   The govt only wanna recruit people to join them as union members to collect more money from the people.</p>
