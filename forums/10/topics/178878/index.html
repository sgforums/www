            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe it is time for us to introduce the local council election.

            <div class='col-md body'>I volunteer at a GRO currently. Hmm.. and I think political involvement is an option the individual choose to take or not. I have seen some people come in as volunteers but with an obvious agenda. And there are some, (like me), who are generally politically apathetic and just want to do some community work conveniently.<br><br>Honestly I find people who use GROs to achieve their own political agendas sometimes manipulative - but if we are not interested to step up and be a political leader, then I guess I rather someone involved in community work (seriously involved, not hold positions and only involve in high profile projects) with a deeper understanding of how the community work lead the people in future. Unfortunately, so far, it is often the reluctant leader (instead of the hungry leader who wanna be high profile) who is more effective at DOING work as opposed to TALKING work. As for political parties concerned, isn't it better that they are looking for potential candidates in community work then simply looking at status or other demographics?</div>
