            <div class='col-md body'>In the 1960s, Singapore had struggled and achieved independence.<br><br>People supported its government for its ability to create jobs and provide affordable housing and essential services.<br><br>By 1970s, talents and pro-foreign investment policies became the bywords of governance which were auto-piloted into 1980s and 1990s. Are MNCs still attracted to set up their businesses here ? Did anyone ask whether these pro-foreign policies might stifle our own domestic growth? How to overcome disadvantages or make policies really work?<br><br>The fact remains that many old policies are deeply entrenched in our system and none among our 2nd tier leaders are able to change them. We might still remember the great pains suffered by many as foreigners pulled out in large numbers during the Asian Financial Crisis and recent recessions. Unworkable past policies should be re-examined in today environment because:-<br><br>(1) The general population is more educated. It is more important to nurture in-house talents or practical knowledge application to create resilience and self-reliance.<br><br>(2) Numerous government Talents were found incapable at solving our high cost and unemployment problems.<br><br>(3) Foreign investments are no longer attracted by tax incentives or S-passes alone. We need to target at our own domestic growth and self-reliance. Yet at every budget we have only limited solutions based on past policy approach.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>On the other hand, China has become competitive with an emerging educated workforce prepared to work harder at a lower reward. India had re-made its economy to into one offering job-searching export services, Singapore must ask : HOW TO DO IT AGAIN.<br><br>While other Asian economies are forging ahead, ours in Singapore appeared to persist in flogging the dead horse of pro-talent policy at the expense of our domestic sector. At the rate we are going, we may end up protecting the existing vested interests and create a narrow and elitist society. Ordinary people, the true talents are marginalized and constrained by high costs. There is a lack of entrepreneurship in re-vitalizing the lack-lustre economy.<br><br>HOW TO DO IT AGAIN. On the eve of national day, (8/8/2004) Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng was reported on TV as saying: "The new leadership will look into getting more younger people to go into politics as 58% of the population are young. Unless the young are interested in politics, Singapore may run short of people of right calibre...The young should not be afraid that politics are dirty and shy away of taking part."<br><br>This is not the first time ministers are talking about getting the young to join politics. Why such calls were not getting the right response. If there is no actions taken to address fundamental issues, such calls will remain empty talks. Try to promote in-house talents and practical knowledge application instead of constant re-training or getting more foreigners and foreign companies. Existing knowledge acquired by citizens are vast and should be turned to use and application in the first instance. Justifications and presentations will not work and the young will surely know better than what were proposed so far.<br><br>Truly open up and liberalize to show that forthright and honest letters written to the press about high costs and unemployment will be published. Match words with action in promoting entrepreneurial ideas from the masses. Involvement of young should not merely be justifications or presentations gimmick. Let's do it for real then the young will really see true change.<br><br>Establish a two-way (feedback presently is only one-way) communication for genuine interaction with the masses to prevent elites from indulging in self-justifications and presentations.<br><br>Lower costs of living or doing business, and prevent massive worksite accidents and power failures. The only way to match words with actions is to establish core activities to be carried out ministry by ministry in accountable and doable work processes to facilitate mass participation and practical knowledge application as stated in HOW TO DO IT.  Just do it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sans-culotte:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't get what you mean by 'big words' in this sense. Had read his article, still can understand what he is trying to say. Maybe he is more comfortable to write like this. Then how you gonna expect him to tell us his ideas? Everyone has a different way of writing and expressing their views. As long the idea is there, why bother with so much about 'big words' or 'small words'?</div></blockquote>Just a recommendation since most of his postings have no replys or people taking part. I had no intention of flamming him. If he has to react so adversery to my criticism I will keep my mouth shut in the future.</div>

Some people make a thread just to share with us his ideas or views. Read or reply is up to personal choice. Personally i have read some of his other threads and i also did not reply. I did not reply not because i can't understand what he said.  The reason is most of his posts are quite objective and also convey what i am thinking so i think there is no need to post something just to say a few words like " I totally agreed what u said".<br><br>Secondly, i know you do not have the intention of flamming him. Is just that you need not to tell him about his usage of words in public. You can PM him right?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
