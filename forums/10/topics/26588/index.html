            <div class='col-md body'>got a degree last year Dec, was serving out my NS liability since last Jan. I have ORDed almost 3 months now and still no job offers....disappointing man..its not that i have lousy grades..average distinction..all i lack is Working experience. Does working experience equates to good performance? maybe yes maybe no...know when to sneak off and eat snake more likely.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>All i am waiting is just an opportunity to prove my worth in the society. Darn it. damn osama, freaky rich bugger using the world as his playing board.<br><br>Resulting in the economy downturn..taking a nose dive last Sept...<br><br>Reading the news paper around the increase in the unemployment rate again..really make me freaking pissed....<br><br>Dont they know that as unemployment rate increase, more ppl will be out of job, and with no decent income to support themselves or their family...meaning that they have to tighen their purse-strings.....<br><br>Its like a cycle...down sizing the company to reduce expenses, ppl will be retrenced, with no income they will not be able to spending lesser...which will in turn affect the consumer market. Profitability of companies will start declining as consumer spending decrease...which will eventually affect the overall economy ..<br><br>sigh....didnt expect to experience 'the second not that great *as yet* depression' in this millenium.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

You can't bake the best cake based on scientific calculations and a good recipe. You need to bake more so that you will know which are the procedures to take extra care of etc etc. Get what I mean? Theory alone does not suffice.<br><br>Companies are employing people with experience, especially in this lousy economy now because they want people who KNOW exactly HOW to work and WHAT is required of the job, and not just people who know how to do the job. They cannot afford to lose anything now by employing inexperienced graduates.<br><br>Also, the bad economy now may be a chance to show your entrepreneurial skills!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Now that you know you cannot depend on the Recruit section of the Straits Times, why not take the initiative and start a business of your own? It doesn't necessarily require a large amount of capital, that is, if you know how to work smart.<br><br>(The above is just a humble contribution of my views. I'm not a widely read person hence I er, just speak out how I feel. So there might be errors in my judgement! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)</div>
