              <p>1) I did not brag about it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I merely stated <span style="color: #ff0000;">there is such a thing in Singapore</span></span>. Even if we follow Suntec's report on the payout, do you or do you not agree that it is already <span style="text-decoration: underline;">higher</span> than CPF's payout? You are now asking for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finer details</span>, and questioning on my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gf's purchase</span>.</p>
              <p>I'm very sure you will agree that it is sufficient to tell you where it came from and the bank that it was bought. I'm not a seller, nor do I earn any commission from it. I've no obligations to tell you the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fine details</span></strong>. You ask that from the seller/banker, not from the buyer who has bought it.</p>
              <p>Also, after I have already told you the amount that can be collected, you continued to ask for the source. Pray tell me what RIGHTS you have to ask for it, if I cannot ask you for proof of your liquid asset?</p>

              <p>2) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are the one bragging that you have a $1m investment property</span></strong> (something in which I didn't asked you for). What is the point of asking? To show you how you were practicing double standards.</p>

              <p><br>I stand corrected.<img title="Laughing" src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>
              <p>But, what I knew was this depreciation is not immediate. The more immediate effect is an appreciation because of the fluidity of capital around the world. A monetary expansion would lead to a drop in interest rates which going by the buy-low-sell-high thing, would lead to short-term capital inflow.</p>
              <p>But of course empirical evidence almost always shows otherwise like many other cases.</p>

              <p>I made a point that the bond was $250k. And nowhere did I say they bought a terrace house. In addition, every one of the sentences that you thought was bragging were there to raise a point. Pls look back at the posts. There were not there without reason.</p>
              <p>However, to answer just a mere question if you have $250k liquid cash, you have to tell us you have a $1m investment property. What is your point in that? Obvious bragging.</p>
              <p>I guess everyone could see what a pathetic lifeform you are. Wonder how many new accounts you have started already.</p>

              <p>I think sheep is more appropriate for you, because sheep are harmless, they usually do things without know why and they simply follow what other sheep are doing....:D</p>
              <p>Do you have anything to comments about what your Sheep buddy Eagle was saying about investment and property?</p>
              <p>Hahaha.. </p>

              <p>To be frank, I cannot comment about investment and property when I have only limited knowledge about them.</p>
              <p>So no comment from me. Isnt it better to ask a economist instead?</p>
