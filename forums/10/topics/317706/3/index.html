              <p>CPF is never an investment. Like what is mentioned, it is a forced savings plan and in fact, a plan that you can never receive in cash until you are almost dead haha. CPF is a savings plan so that when you reach a certain age, say 35 and you need to buy a flat, there is at least a sum of money for you to buy your flat or should I say pay the downpayment. But it is never an investment. At 2.5%, it is risk free and if you choose to look at it that way as an investment, it is a good investment return with no risks.</p>
              <p>BUT!</p>
              <p>Why should you let it stay inside there for 2.5% when there are so many better options out there with manageable risks and yielding higher returns. Before April 1st this year, I have cleared out whatever money in the CPF as investments because at my age, I do not foresee myself needing the CPF money to buy a flat till 4 years later so why not invest it?</p>
              <p>Of cos now, with the 20K cap, there is nothing much you can do with the first 20K of your CPF money but hey why the cap is there is another issue, partly to do with what those "wayward" finanical planners do to "spoil" market. So dun blame the CPF for just giving the 2.5%, there is always another choice one!</p>

              <p>If you think you can do better than 2.5%, then you should invest your CPF fund through CPFIS. Over the last 7 years, by yield from stock investment only is about 275% or 39% a year.. But then again during good times, or when the market is on its up trend, it is always easier to make money.</p>
              <p>However if you get burn, please dont blame the government for letting you use the money to invest.</p>

              <p>Are you dumb or what? You mean you seriously think investing is for the short term, that you have to see month by month prices? If Warren Buffett followed your thinking, he wouldn't have what he has today. In his words, the best period to hold is forever.</p>
              <p>If analysts were always right in the news, everyone would have been millionaires now... Duh... If you want to buy at a high now, then of course you wouldn't earn... Prices were up nearly 80% for some districts before the current bull run, and given a 32% drop, there would be still an overall rise... Let me give you this fact. Take a look at the straits times index, or the US S&amp;P 500. For sti, for the last 10+ years, it has been constantly on the uptrend. Even if you have bought the etf (if it was present at that time, but it wasn't) just before the 97 crash, the current price is still higher than the peak point in 96. The same goes for S&amp;P 500; constantly on the uptrend with the occasional ups and downs. The same goes for housing prices.</p>

                      there are opposing views and people take different
                      stand. often times, getting into emotional verbal assault is
                      fine too, and even enjoyable to some (those in the ring and outside
                      as well); but the ones resorting to name calling &amp; lacing
                      expletives (me sometimes guilty too but will exercise restrain
                      going forward) really have nothing better to offer. your
                      credible views offered is often diminished when you
                      resort to these nick association just to discredit

              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Thats because Singaporeans are not allowed to invest CPF in Unit Trusts until 1999.</strong> With all their CPF investments concentrated in the Singapore share market, the choices to diversify risk </span><span style="color: #800000;">are </span><span style="color: #800000;">limited.<strong> </strong></span></p>

              <p><strong>Source http://www.singapore-window.org/sw04/041012aw.htm</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The company managed just a 3% annual return to its sole shareholder </strong>-- Singapore's Ministry of Finance -- during the past 10 years in part
                                      because of the effects of the Asian financial crisis, the 2001 terrorist
                                      attacks in the US, and last year's outbreak of severe acute respiratory
                                      syndrome, or SARS, in Asia.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>CPF is simply a hidden tax on Singaporean's retirement savings. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p>Any financial advisor will tell you that one must always set

              <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">As M13 has pointed out, CPF is not a liquid asset. If you fall sick or need emergency money, can you use CPF?</span></strong><br></p>

              <p>Duh, who else better to hear it from other than the one who recommended and sold the bond. If you are too lazy to even go down to UOB to ask for the information, just keep to your 2.5% CPF ok?</p>
              <p>And don't put words into my mouth again. I didn't say the bond is risk-free. Apparently, you can't understand english.</p>
              <p>No point trying to tell you what is good. Doesn't benefit me, and doesn't bother me at all if you are contented with a measly 2.5%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And finally if you know which dividends stocks I'm talking about, you would have seen that it is quite as risky as a fixed d, and it is much much more liquid than fixed d.</p>
              <p>If you are too lazy to do your research, just live with your 2.5%.</p>

              <p><br>Eagle, I hope you are aware that this thread is talking about CPF returns, NOT about which investment give you the best returns. As we all (maybe excluding some in this forum) know that investments with higher returns always comes with higher risk. Hence what is the point of comparing higher risk and higher returns investment to CPF?.</p>
              <p>You talk about ComfortDelgro, high dividend, however you have failed to highlight that share price of Comfortdelgro has fallen by 33% since Apr2007 last year.?</p>
              <p>You talk about Suntec City Bonds, but you have failed to even tell us what exactly this bond is all about and now you are calling others lazy?</p>
              <p>My suggestion to you is that, if you dont know what you are talking about, just keep you mouth shut.  </p>

If you don't believe then don't believe lor. I never ask you to believe. I'm not a seller nor do I earn any commission from selling it. Duh... Just keep your money in your CPF and don't worry about this bond. Period.</p>
