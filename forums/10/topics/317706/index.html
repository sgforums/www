              <p>Since 1st April 2008, the CPF Board has been paying interest rate at 2.50% for Ordinary Accounts. The suppressed interest rate will be extended till 30 September 2008. While Inflation for the first quarter of 2008 has been in the region of 6.6%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All CPF members are getting negative returns from their retirement funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a house say cost $200,000 and inflates at 6.6% and CPF pays you 2.50% for your retirement funds. If you keep your funds with the CPF board, you won't be able to afford your house at the end of the year. As price has inflated to $213,200, while the funds in your retirement account will only grow to $205,000.</p>

              <p>Does the HDB still provide ''housing loans'' to new home owners ?</p>
              <p>Have they not divested this responsibility to the commercial banks in 2006, which will require new home owners or re-purchasers of HDB units to be subjected to usual commercial bank rates and conditions of loan ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CPF has become a monolithic institution that is more concerned with its own interests than that of the Account Holders.</p>
              <p>Prior to 2003{?}, account holders were allowed to invest the balance amount in their OA - after providing a minimum amount for their retirement.</p>
              <p>The balance amount in the OA was drastically reduced as the minimum amount for Retirement has been bloated from $25K {?} to $45K {?} - and subsequently to a higher raised level of $75K {?}.</p>
              <p>Even with the additional interest pay-out for the Retirement Fund, it will hardly make-up for the inflationary pressures that will surely pare down the real value of the Retirement Fund despite the planned Singapore Dollar getting stronger vis-a-vis a basket of foreign currencies.</p>
              <p>This Government can directly influence the cost of living, but has locked itself in a predicament caused by its own money-grabbing policies that date back to the 1980s.</p>
              <p>Even one of the founding fathers - S.Rajaratnam - had raised his concern then by coining the label - ''Moneytheism'' - in describing the mad fixxation with the money chase.</p>
              <p>This social ''dysfunction'' was symptomatic of the Government policies in encouraging the growth of personal wealth at the expense of the other social implications.</p>

Your stamp duty is a one off payment for the purchase of the property, not recurring. If you don't know the market, don't crap too much, 1,200 sq ft non-central condos costing $730,000 (3 bedrooms) are already going at above $3,000 per month. It's not difficult for terrace house to get $5,000 a month. 2 condos of $730,000 will cost almost the same as the terrace house of $1.4 million and yield rental of $6,000 a month.</a></p>
              <p>The second element is inflation, the property you bought for $1,400,000 with an inflation of 6.7% a year, would have been priced at $1,493,800 at the end of 1 year.</p>

              <p>Property goes up in price with inflation. You forgot about that.</p>
              <p>For SPH and ComfortDelGro stocks, they have been consistently giving out 5% (6% if you buy at the low) dividends each year.</p>
              <p>There's one more way to achieve even greater returns (~10%) with equally low risk, but you have to hold if for long term (at least 10 years). But I guess since you won't understand the market, no point sharing with you.</p>

              <p>US seems to have lower inflation than Singapore, despite all the increases in money supply to help shore up the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Shouldn't increases in money supply depreciate the USD against all other currencies?</p>
              <p>The US inflation for 3 months ending April 2008 was 2.3% while an unadjusted 12 months rate was 3.9%. </p>

              <p><br>You may wish to further strengthen your case on the seemingly irreconcilable paradox with the following : in theory (<em>ceteris paribus</em>), this regime's artificially-induced brand of wage suppression to prevent a wage-price spiral (notwithstanding Keynesian's view that prices and wages are particularly sticky downwards, which actually compounds the dire reality) on the pretext of curtailing inflation, coupled with its exchange rate targetted measures in controlling inflation, should actually churn out a lower inflation rate than that in the US (whose more acute brand of wage-price spiral and interest rate-targetting should be pivotal to a higher inflation).</p>
              <p>Just as this regime chooses to adopt a brand of democracy that fits its own demographic, the cause of your paradigm may very well lay in the brand of economics which is quite simply also "uniquely Singapore"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p><br>US is almost a perfect market based economy in which Free Enterprise compete for the consumer dollar, unlike Singapore which pretend to be a market based economy when in actual fact all the essential goods and services are provided by the Government.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government has its hand in every aspect of the market economy that manipulate the supply chains, and help the suppliers when demand slacken - so that its own investments in the entire economy is not jeopardised.</p>

              <p>Suntec City bond. My gf has already put the money in, so I can definitely say for sure. Already bought it in March. Armchair critic? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> It is fact!</p>
              <p>Property goes up in price with inflation. You forgot about that.</p>
              <p>For SPH and ComfortDelGro stocks, they have been consistently giving out 5% (6% if you buy at the low) dividends each year.</p>
              <p>There's one more way to achieve even greater returns (~10%) with equally low risk, but you have to hold if for long term (at least 10 years). But I guess since you won't understand the market, no point sharing with you.</p>
              <p>A perfectly new one costs around $1.6 to $1.7 million. Again, my gf's family bought it (because their current house has gone to en bloc sale). And according to my property agent friend, that type of house (supposed not new), even if in ulu area, can fetch minimum of $5k a month for rental</p>
