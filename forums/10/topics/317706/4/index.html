              goes up with inflation...:D </p>

              statement....hahaha</p>

              property are an excellent hedge against inflation. With inflation the
              construction costs are bound to go upwards. As the years roll by, the value of
              the property increases many times. Unlike investments in debt, the returns here
              are in line with inflation. </span></p>

              property price will drop in the long run.  Sometimes your investment
              may not be profitable but the value of your currency will always
              becomes smaller and this will some-how result in higher property prices.</p>

              Monetary Fund. Economic growth is among the single biggest drivers of
              real estate value growth, and the rate at which inflation increases
              drastically alters the value of an investment.</span></p>

              Holders.</p>
              <p>Prior to 2003{?}, account holders were allowed to invest the
              balance amount in their OA - after providing a minimum amount for
              their retirement.</p>
              <p>The balance amount in the OA was drastically reduced as the

              $45K {?} - and subsequently to a higher raised level of $75K

              has locked itself in a predicament caused by its own money-grabbing
              policies that date back to the 1980s.</p>
              <p>Even one of the founding fathers - S.Rajaratnam - had
              raised his concern then by coining the label - ''Moneytheism'' - in
              describing the mad fixxation with the money chase.</p>
              <p>This social ''dysfunction'' was symptomatic of the Government

              <p>Reading about the wage policy of S'pore now, it is interesting to know that the CPF creators created this chiefly to prevent the economy from overheating in the boom years back then.</p>
              <p>Wages were increasing rapidly then and the NWC (National Wage Council) worried about demand-pull and cost-push inflation. To counter demand-pull inflation, the foreign leakage was simply increased, and CPF was created to form one of the world's largest savings leakage in % of GDP. To counter the cost-push side, the SDF was set up. Interestingly also, the SDF (Singapore Development Fund) was set up also, to cut firms' costs when the need arises without having to resort to other unpleasant means later, in other words a buffer.</p>

              <p><br>Wrong. When the money supply goes up, in the short-term, you will have hot money inflow into the economy. It will lead to an appreciation in the short-run.</p>
              <p>Whether these short-term capital will stay on will depend on external environment and the conditions inside, whether they will be favourable or not.</p>

              <p><br> Um......snapping up HDB flats now may seem like a smart move. But
              it could very well lead to a unsustainable property bubble. It is

              <p>Obviously these 2 idiots think that everyone in this world are more idiot than them and they think that by quoting some articles which contain the words property and inflation are going to give new meaning to their BS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets read what wanker No.1 wrote earlier.</p>

              <p>He claim that property price will go up <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WITH</span> inflation.  Obviously when he uses the word WITH, he was trying to say that property price will follow inflation rate. NO?</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>And then we have his gay partner, wanker No. 2,  who also like to talk like some investment GURU, trying to explain what wanker no.1 was trying to say.</p>

              <p>The second element is inflation, the property you bought for $1,400,000 with an inflation of 6.7% a year, would have been priced at $1,493,800 at the end of 1 year.</p>

              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>And now after someone have exposed their stupidity, they went all over the internet to dig out articles talking about how property can be use to hedge against inflation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OVER TIME</span>. But none of the article ever mention that property price will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">follow</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mirror</span> inflation rate. Do they? hahah..</p>
              <p>I think both these wankers have to understand the difference between quoting something and understanding what they are quoting or else it will only make them look more like some bloody fools.</p>
              <p>As for Eagle, he started by talking so loudly about his GF terrace house, rental income, Suntec City Bond, when kenna questioned, he starts giving excuses like you are lazy, you never check with UOB and bla bla bla..</p>
              <p>This is classic example of how armchair critics will react when kenna questioned...</p>
              <p>However dont need to worry, I am sure there are more same minded idiots like you in this forums who will believe what you both are trying to say.</p>

              <p>Somehow you don't understand English. Goes with implies a correlation. Property can hedge against inflation because there's a correlation between them. No idea why you would continuously put words into my mouth. Probably you are autistic.</p>
