              <p>eagle:  HK is very different from Singapore in the sense of
              private property. </p>
              <p>In Singapore, 85% of the population live in HDB ie government
              flats.  Opposite is true for HK.  Generally, couples in
              HK got to work and save till mid-life in order to afford
              the ownership of a roof over their heads.  Thats how precious
              a private property in HK compared to Singapore.  That explains
              much of the price differential between HK's and Sing's private
              properties.  Having said that, it is much easier to control
              mass market condo prices in Singapore than in HK.</p>

              <p>There are analysts who claimed there's a property bubble now. There are also analysts who claimed that there isn't. As you said, who knows the future.</p>
              <p>But even at the recent peak, housing prices are actually still cheaper than Hong Kong's. Their population is near 7 mil, and their usable land area is maybe just slightly more than Singapore since a lot are mountains.</p>
              <p>We can expect when Singapore gradually reach the 5.5 mil or 6.5 mil or whatever population mark, housing prices will rise accordingly to perhaps near Hong Kong's level.</p>
              <p>But of course, to maximise earnings, it would be better to wait for a downturn before buying.</p>

              <p><br> Eagle, please cut the chase and stop calling others
                  lazy because it doesnt make you look smart. If you want to
                  brag about your GF's investment in Suntec City Bond and claiming
                  that it offers risk free guranteed returns of over 5%. It will only
                  make sense if you show us the details of the bond.</p>
              <p>If you cant, it can only means 2 things</p>
              <p>a) You are a big LIAR</p>
              <p>b) You dont know what you are talking about.</p>
              <p>My guess is that you are a combination of both.</p>
              <p>If you want to prove your innocent?</p>
              <p>Please show us the website to this bond and stop giving more
                  excuses. I am getting tired of talking to some so-call NUS scholar
                  with such low IQ.</p>

              <p>If you dont already know, when people use the word bubbles, it is meant to say that the state of the industry is not supported by fundamentals such as supply and demand etc.. But for Singapore case, there are plenty of fundamentals which is supporting the the property boom.</p>

              <p><br> Eagle, it is obvious that they only article you have read so far is
              search engine "google.com".</p>
              <p>If you dont already know, when people use the word bubbles, it
              is meant to say that the state of the industry is not
              supported by fundamentals such as supply and demand etc.. But
              for Singapore case, there are plenty of fundamentals which is
              supporting the the property boom.</p>
              <p>So, please dont anyhow smoke and lie through your nose, it
              is disgusting and not healthy for you.  </p>

              <p>So you have agreed that the analyst has said there's a bubble. Don't try to twist the context. I didn't say there was a bubble. I said some analysts said that. He might be wrong, he might be right. I didn't comment on that.</p>
