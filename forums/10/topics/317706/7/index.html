              <p>The cause of bubbles is a subject of debate. It has been variously suggested that bubbles may be rational, intrinsic,<sup> </sup>and contagious. To date, there is no widely accepted theory to explain their occurrence.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And lastly, none of my posts mentioned that any analysts said there's a bubble crisis.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>An <strong>economic bubble</strong> (sometimes referred to as a <strong>speculative bubble</strong>, a <strong>market bubble</strong>, a <strong>price bubble</strong>, a <strong>financial bubble</strong>, or a <strong>speculative mania</strong>) is “trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance from intrinsic values”.</p>

              <p>Somehow, you would want to not read the following sentence I made:<br>"As you said,
                                      who knows the future"</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Because it is often difficult to observe intrinsic values
              in real-life markets, bubbles are often identified only in retrospect,
              when a sudden drop in prices appears. Such drop is known as a <strong>crash</strong> or a <strong>bubble burst</strong></p>

              <p>Firstly, you tell us that there's no such bond. Now there is, you ask for numbers. When numbers were given to you, you asked for source. Even if there's scanned source, you will still claim it is faked. Not going to waste any more time telling you all these since you won't be able to buy it anyway. You are merely a consistent liar, seeking merely to win an argument even at the expense of being labelled an idiot.</p>
              <p>Secondly, this thread is about investments better than the 2.5% from CPF. This bond has already displayed a better return than 2.5%. That was my main point. If you want to continue to portray publicly your autistic self, feel free to do so.</p>

              <p>Nah, I'm not going to show you any source. Believe a not is up to you. I've no obligation to show you any.</p>
              <p>Firstly, you tell us that there's no such bond. Now there is, you ask for numbers. When numbers were given to you, you asked for source. Even if there's scanned source, you will still claim it is faked. Not going to waste any more time telling you all these since you won't be able to buy it anyway. You are merely a consistent liar, seeking merely to win an argument even at the expense of being labelled an idiot.</p>
              <p>Secondly, this thread is about investments better than the 2.5% from CPF. This bond has already displayed a better return than 2.5%. That was my main point. If you want to continue to portray publicly your autistic self, feel free to do so.</p>

              <p>Ofcourse, because this thred is talking about CPF 2.5% and your are bragging that you can make more money from other investments hence I am sure I have the RIGHTS to ask you for details.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you again. What is the point of asking if I have $250,000? Are you trying to discredit me with your GF's family money? You really think that your GF is rich?</p>

              <p>1) I did not brag about it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I merely stated <span style="color: #ff0000;">there is such a thing in Singapore</span></span>. Even if we follow Suntec's report on the payout, do you or do you not agree that it is already <span style="text-decoration: underline;">higher</span> than CPF's payout? You are now asking for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finer details</span>, and questioning on my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gf's purchase</span>.</p>
              <p>I'm very sure you will agree that it is sufficient to tell you where it came from and the bank that it was bought. I'm not a seller, nor do I earn any commission from it. I've no obligations to tell you the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fine details</span></strong>. You ask that from the seller/banker, not from the buyer who has bought it.</p>
              <p>Also, after I have already told you the amount that can be collected, you continued to ask for the source. Pray tell me what RIGHTS you have to ask for it, if I cannot ask you for proof of your liquid asset?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are the one bragging that you have a $1m investment property</span></strong> (something in which I didn't asked you for). What is the point of asking? To show you how you were practicing double standards.</p>
