              <p>real estate as a hedge for inflation?</p>
              <p>seasoned investors will ask you this question:  when do you buy the real estate to hedge for inflation, before inflation (ie in 2003/2004) or after you have realised there is inflation like now?</p>
              <p>lesson 1:  all of us know there is inflation today, it is reported all over the newspaper.  So to hedge this inflation, we go long real estate (assumed mass market) which jumped by 40% in 2007?  Are you sure?</p>
              <p>guys, you can only leverage up on property today if you believe that inflation rate is going to be higher than current level going forward.  You lose money if inflation rate collapses into the future and the worst case is deflation.</p>
              <p>all the talk of buying property to hedge for inflation is rubbish.  It should be rephrased, buying property to hedge for future inflation which is expected to be higher than current level.  Who knows the future? </p>

              <p>There are analysts who claimed there's a property bubble now. There are also analysts who claimed that there isn't. As you said, who knows the future.</p>
              <p>But even at the recent peak, housing prices are actually still cheaper than Hong Kong's. Their population is near 7 mil, and their usable land area is maybe just slightly more than Singapore since a lot are mountains.</p>
              <p>We can expect when Singapore gradually reach the 5.5 mil or 6.5 mil or whatever population mark, housing prices will rise accordingly to perhaps near Hong Kong's level.</p>
              <p>But of course, to maximise earnings, it would be better to wait for a downturn before buying.</p>

              <p>The second element is inflation, the property you bought for $1,400,000 with an inflation of 6.7% a year, would have been priced at $1,493,800 at the end of 1 year.</p>

              <p>eagle:  HK is very different from Singapore in the sense of private property. </p>
              <p>In Singapore, 85% of the population live in HDB ie government flats.  Opposite is true for HK.  Generally, couples in HK got to work and save till mid-life in order to afford the ownership of a roof over their heads.  Thats how precious a private property in HK compared to Singapore.  That explains much of the price differential between HK's and Sing's private properties.  Having said that, it is much easier to control mass market condo prices in Singapore than in HK.</p>
