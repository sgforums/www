              <p>If you are interested, invest $3 million with me for 20 years. Give me your lawyer's contact? I will get the lawyers to draft a contract with a reputable bank guaranteeing you the 3% interest and capital risk free. 3% interest is substantially higher than your 2.5% risk free you are getting from CPF Board. But whatever profits that is above 3% is mine and you have no claim to it. Do you have the guts to put your money where your mouth is? Or are you just talking crap?</p>

              <p>The government doesn't need to have US$300 billions (according to you) assets to pay your CPF money. The government can always ask MAS avail more money to them, that's why it's risk free. You mean if the government doesn't have US$300 billions, they cannot pay you all the CPF money? Risk free doesn't equate to inflation free dodo.</p>
              <p>You got memory problems, either that or inflation is so high that the initial $3 million has grown to $30 million. If you don't have money, then don't talk big. You need at least $1 million to open a private banking account to invest. Obviously you don't have the money, so you can't show me the money. So you should just zip your mouth instead of making yourself to be a fool.</p>

              <p>Both Eagle and Maurizio are saying that investing in property will help you to hedge against inflation. And they both seems to agree that, if you buy a 1.4m property today and if the inflation is 6.7%, by next year, the property will be valued at $1.4m x 106.7% = $1.4938m</p>
              <p>Hahahaha...</p>
              <p>a) Price of Singapore private property down by 2.1% in April 2008.</p>
              <p><a href="http://idealresidence.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/luxury-home-prices-down-21-says-report/">http://idealresidence.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/luxury-home-prices-down-21-says-report/</a></p>
              <p>b) Analyst is predicting that luxury property prices in Singapore could fall 32% by 2010.  </p>
              <p><a href="http://singaporepropertyfrontiers.com/2008/03/27/luxury-home-prices-to-fall-32-by-2010-nomura/">http://singaporepropertyfrontiers.com/2008/03/27/luxury-home-prices-to-fall-32-by-2010-nomura/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess if what they are saying is true, then Singapore should be experiencing deflation by now..:) </p>

              <p>CPF is never an investment. Like what is mentioned, it is a forced savings plan and in fact, a plan that you can never receive in cash until you are almost dead haha. CPF is a savings plan so that when you reach a certain age, say 35 and you need to buy a flat, there is at least a sum of money for you to buy your flat or should I say pay the downpayment. But it is never an investment. At 2.5%, it is risk free and if you choose to look at it that way as an investment, it is a good investment return with no risks.</p>
              <p>BUT!</p>
              <p>Why should you let it stay inside there for 2.5% when there are so many better options out there with manageable risks and yielding higher returns. Before April 1st this year, I have cleared out whatever money in the CPF as investments because at my age, I do not foresee myself needing the CPF money to buy a flat till 4 years later so why not invest it?</p>
              <p>Of cos now, with the 20K cap, there is nothing much you can do with the first 20K of your CPF money but hey why the cap is there is another issue, partly to do with what those "wayward" finanical planners do to "spoil" market. So dun blame the CPF for just giving the 2.5%, there is always another choice one!</p>

Even better is to invest in an asset with growing demand and limited supply whose intrinsic value is increasing. </span></span></p>
