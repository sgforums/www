This "bonus" is not even enough to cover for the one month of income loss due to cut in employer CPF contribution!!<br><br>1st Hit : Loss of income due to employer CPF cut<br>2nd Hit: More cash due to lower employee contribution but more taxable income<br>3rd Hit: Lower CPF total contribution means fork out more cash for home loans<br>4rd Hit: Home loan appreciate 4 times in the last year. Less expendible income<br><br>The government says lower CPF income means more cash to spend. But we have to pay for more tax, more home loans, more GST..!!!<br><br>WTF! How to vote for PAP???!!! All the lies about better economy. Where's is the promise that they'll gradually increase back the contribution??<br><br>I think can forget about it liow. Government is the largest employer in Singapore and they must have saved tons of money!!<br><br>Please give me a chance to vote. Let me vote for the opposition! Those who has a chance to vote. <strong>Please do not be blinded by the goodies the government is giving out. Remember what they took from us!

And learned people in power will know that power corrupts and to relinquish power is VERY DIFFICULT  to accomplish. Just look at the continuous creation of first, the position of SENIOR MINISTER, followed by MINISTER MENTOR just to permit Lee Senior to remain in office.<br><br>If those among us who can perceive the shortcomings of the Ruling Party, acknowledge the need for strong opposition and give them their shot, then change will eventually take place.<br><br>Let's not forget that during the turbulant years, the Ruling Party was relatively unknown, with ideas that may or may not have succeeded. The people placed their trust in them and in return, we were rewarded.<br><br>But with the current stagnation of our economy (despite their optimistic claims), the slow rise of inflation (unparalleled increases in costs of living without a corresponding rise in salary packages) and the dearth of creativity (incidently blamed on Singaporeans), fresh blood is needed to stifle the rot.<br><br>A more open govt with greater awareness, less arrogance and more humility can bring forward our society into the 22nd century.<br><br></div>
