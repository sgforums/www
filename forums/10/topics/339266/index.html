              <p>Ethics is a pledge of future success in business.An ethical businessman is a person who meets his obligations and guarantees his word. I used to meet people like that — they always kept their word and promises and that helped them acquire good reputations in business circles. The essential component of future success for any organization is good business and the reputation of its employees; this attracts new clients and partners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ethics is a component of success everywhere in life, not only in business, because morality is the basis of everything.  But, still, ethical businessmen are very rare in our country; in most cases businessmen will do anything to get money.The problem is that business ethics don’t really exist in Singapore. Maybe after 50 or even 60 years our country will enter a new phase in its development and such concepts like ethics, morality and conscience will be essential in business affairs. I think that a businessman is ethical if he can sleep free of guilt at night and has gotten his good reputation with good deeds</p>
              <p>The recent minibond issue is one of the ways of unethical behaviour after dozens of investors were left in the lurch.</p>
              <p>i do know of overseas businesses which devote to environmental friendlyness and charity. But there is none in our country. Why is this so?</p>
              <p>As a business, bth young and old buy your products and it will be a good idea to project your business has having a "social cause" to buyers, especially the young. In the western world, indeed the old people who are more well off than the young due to their years savings and pension, they are actually my returning customers because i did make up a good reputation with them.</p>
              <p>I know people who, when they started doing business, sometimes did illegal things in order to survive, but now that they have succeeded they donate big money to charity. One example is Microsoft, Which learnt the hard way, due tot heir supposed monopolisitic practices as viewed by some in the community, Gates indeed donated large amounts of money to charity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are indeed some ethical businessmen in singapore, but they have all their businesses elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Ho can we project our country, apart from the superficially outside appearance of  1st world to the one of a truly first world place to do business in terms of ethics?</p>

              <p>As the saying goes å•†åœºå¦‚æˆ˜åœº. Business world is a brutal world. Being ethical means you goes about doing your business without harming yourself and your interest and then of others.</p>
              <p>You make a decent profit that will keep your business ongoing and that of your employee needs being taken care. This is also ethical.</p>

              <p>also understand that being unethical also open up your business to predators who will use the concept of ethics to rip u off in the form of refunds, replacements or lawsuits. In the first place these entitites know that the  business is unethical. Lesson is; what goes around comes around.</p>

              <p>Well, example being u will be at a disadvantage if u have higher ethical standards n ur colleague or ur client doesnt n u normally get either eaten out or somehow removed or sidelined in the company. But if u have a group of like minded people like you , u tend to have a stronger standing and support.</p>
              <p>But it gets more deep after that as bigger business involves more people u need to have more like minded people with you to face the challenges. And at times its hard to find these people because currently in this world they are few and isolated individuals.</p>
              <p>Once u grow in numbers and power and reputation ,u can sideline those that are unehitcal because of a stronger position, And ur words n actions weights much more.</p>
              <p>My post was refering in general on being an ethical businessman. Ethics always bring extra burden , cost n stress. But its because of that overall it brings greater standards. But alot of ppl... including me at times, just find it too... tedious , its llike fighting an uphill battle. Hence u need like minded people .</p>
