                  participate in a procession, Dr Chee Soon Juan asked District Judge Toh
                  Yong Joo to allow the defendants to question the police on why it
                  rejected the application for a permit to conduct a rally and march. The
                  Judge refused.<br> <br> Dr Chee also asked the Judge to determine that the policy to ban all
                  demonstrations and processions in Singapore is unconstitutional. The
                  Judge also refused.<br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Dr Chee is charged together with Mr Gandhi Ambalam, Ms Chee Siok Chin
                  and Mr Teoh Tian Jing for protesting during the WB-IMF meeting in Sep
                  06.</strong></span><br> <br> In his submissions Dr Chee cited a decision made by former Chief
                  Justice Yong Pung How who had relied on Lord Justice Woolf's judgment
                  in an English case.<br> <br> Woolf LJ had ruled that where it is pointed that there has been an
                  abuse of power and bad faith on the policy maker a criminal court
                  should allow cross-examination of the prosecution witness to determine
                  the issue.<br> <br> The issue stemmed from prosecution witness Deputy Superintendent Marc E
                  Kwan Szer's testimony that the "policy position of the police regarding
                  outdoor processions and demonstrations is one of disallowance."<br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Dr Chee asked Judge Toh to rule that this policy contravenes the

                  out.<br> <br> He added that the police are playing the fool with the Constitution
                  which according to Article 4 "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is the supreme law of the Republic of
                  Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement
                  of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution
                  shall...be void."</strong></span><br> <br> He cited Lord Justice Woolf's judgement on this issue: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No citizen is
                  required to comply with a law which is bad on its face. If the citizen
                  is satisfied that that is the situation, he is entitled to ignore the
                  law."</strong></span><br> <br> The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Prosecutor insisted that the only thing that mattered was whether
                  or not the defendants had a permit to conduct their activity. </strong></span>But
                  didn't DSP Marc E testify that all applications for demonstrations and
                  processions would be disallowed?<br> <br> "The illogic of the charge jars the reasonable mind. Can the police
                  accuse anyone of not having a permit when it makes clear that it will

                  thing that was important was the "existence or non-existence of a
                  permit."</strong></span><br> <br> <em>The hearing continues at Subordinate Court 19 at 9:30 am tomorrow.</em></p>

              <div><strong>Full text of Dr Chee's submissions</strong><br></div>
              <p>Your Honour,<br> <br> When the defence tried to question the witness, licensing officer DSP
                  Marc E Kwan Szer, to show that the police had acted in bad faith when
                  they rejected my application for a rally and march on 16 September
                  2006, and hence violating my constitutional rights, the prosecution
                  objected on two grounds:<br> <br> One, the line of questioning was irrelevant to the charge and, two,
                  that even if it was relevant, this court is not the forum to hear such
                  an issue. The proper forum should be by way of a Judicial Review.<br> <br> Let me begin by addressing the second question first, that is, whether
                  this court is the proper forum to canvas issues about bad faith and
                  mala fide on the part of the police as it relates to the constitution. <br> <br> I will do this by citing the decision of Yong Pung How, then CJ, in <em>Colin Chan v PP</em> (1994) 3 SLR 662. In the decision, Yong CJ had examined a host of
                  authorities and culminated with the citing of an English case <em>Bugg v PP</em> (1993) 2 WLR 628 which was heard by Woolf LJ. <br> <br> Yong CJ remarked that some “conflicting decisions seem to have been finally determined“ by Woolf LJ in <em>Bugg v DPP</em>.
                  I quote Yong CJ to emphasize the weight he placed on Woolf's LJ
                  judgment, that there was a sense of a finality, and hence great
                  importance, in Woolf's decision.<br> <br> Woolf had addressed the issue of the role of a criminal court, such as
                  this one, as it related to the question of substantive validity of a
                  law or subordinate law. Woolf LJ said:<br> <br> <em>"These developments are, in our judgment, of importance when
                  considering the proper role of a criminal court where a defendant who
                  is charged with breaching a byelaw seeks to challenge the validity of
                  that byelaw. It is possible to identify at least two different
                  situations in which this will arise. The first is where the byelaw is
                  on its face invalid because either it is without the power pursuant to
                  which it was made because, for example, it seeks to deal with matters
                  outside the scope of the enabling legislation, or it is patently
                  unreasonable. This can be described as substantive invalidity."<br> <br> </em>Is there a question of substantive invalidity in the present case?
                  Of course, there is. I want to place these two statements side by side.
                  The first statement is Article 14 (1) of the Constitution which is the
                  supreme law of the land:<br> <br> (a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression;<br> (b) all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms; and<br> (c) all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations.<br> <br> The second statement is from the witness DSP Marc E: "police position
                  regarding outdoor processions and demonstrations is one of
                  disallowance...Our policy position is clear: Outdoor processions and
                  demonstrations are disallowed whether or not there is a major meeting
                  going on.”<br> <br> Your Honour, you will first have to rule whether, on the face of it,
                  this police policy enunciated by DSP Marc E is substantively invalid <em>vis-a-vis</em> the Constitution.<br> <br> I recognise that subsection 2 of Article 14 provides that Parliament
                  may by law impose restrictions. But these restrictions are imposed only
                  under certain circumstances such as the security of Singapore is
                  concerned, or where public order is threatened. <br> <br> It is does not allow the government, or worse the police, to adopt a
                  "position" that "outdoor processions and demonstrations is one of
                  disallowance" and that "all applications are rejected."<br> <br> The police are playing the fool with the Constitution. They are making
                  a mockery of our Constitution which states in Article 4: "This
                  Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any
                  law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this
                  Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the
                  extent of the inconsistency, be void."<br> <br> It would take someone very reckless to say that there is no substantive
                  invalidity in this police policy. No person, able to reason, would
                  conclude that the policy is not substantially out of line and patently
                  unreasonable with the Constitution, both in spirit and in the letter.<br> <br> Or course the next question that is: Does this court have the power to
                  consider such a question of substantive validity? Of course, you have.
                  Woolf LJ writes:<br> <br> <em>"In the criminal proceeding what has to be established is that the
                  byelaw is unreasonable in the way in which it operates. This aspect of
                  substantive invalidity was illustrated by Lord Russell of Killowen CJ
                  in Kruse v Johnson (1898) 2 Q B 91, 99 as occurring, for instance, if
                  the byelaws:</em><em>'were found to be partial and unequal in their
                  operation as between different classes; if they were manifestly unjust;
                  if they disclosed bad faith; if they involved such oppressive or
                  gratuitous interference with the rights of those subject to them as
                  could find no justification in the minds of reasonable men...' "</em><br> <br> Woolf reiterates this point later:<br> <br> <em>"In the case of substantive invalidity, it is a matter of law
                  whether, for example, a byelaw is unreasonable in operation or is out
                  with the authorising power. No evidence is required; the [criminal]
                  court can decide the issue by looking at the terms of the primary
                  legislation and the subordinate legislation which is alleged to be
                  invalid."</em><br> <br> So the law is utterly clear that the criminal court, that is this
                  present court, can consider the question of whether the written policy
                  of the Singapore Police Force is substantively invalid of the
                  Constitution.<br> <br> Which brings us to the next question: What does this Court do with a
                  policy that is substantively invalid? On this subject Woolf LJ he
                  didn'tt mince his words:<br> <br> "<em>Where the law is substantively invalid...No citizen is
                  required to comply with a law which is bad on its face. If the citizen
                  is satisfied that that is the situation, he is entitled to ignore the
                  law."</em><br> <br> I had a discussion with lawyer and she had tried explaining to me what
                  an "element of the charge" was. She used the analogy of a person being
                  charged for, say, not displaying a parking coupon. An element of the
                  charge is that there was no coupon displayed at the time the car was
                  checked.<br> <br> She went on to explain that the driver cannot then say that at that
                  time the shops were all closed and there was no one from whom he could
                  purchase the parking coupon. Such a defence was irrelevant to the
                  element of the charge.<br> <br> But what if the authorities said they did not sell the coupons? Would
                  the matter now change? The driver had no way of buying such coupons at
                  any time to display on his car. Could he still be charged for parking
                  his without a coupon?<br> <br> This is exactly what is happening in our present charge. The
                  prosecution maintains that the element of the charge, or at least one
                  of the elements, is that we did not have a permit for the procession.
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But as you have heard from DSP Marc E, the police's policy position is
                  that they reject all applications and that they disallow all
                  processions.</strong></span><br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The illogic of the charge jars the reasonable mind. Can the police
                  accuse anyone of not having a permit when it makes clear that it will
                  not give that permit?</strong></span><br> <br> If the Constitution clearly tells me that I have the right to freedom
                  of speech and assembly but the police tells me that it will not grant
                  me a permit for it, then the police policy is clearly substantively
                  invalid and this being the case Woolf's LJ decision, to which Yong CJ
                  attached much importance, tells me that I am not required to comply
                  with such a policy.<br> <br> Clearly there is an abuse of power on the part of the police to not
                  give permits under any circumstance because, as I outlined above, the
                  Constitution does not grant the blanket ban on demonstrations and
                  processions.<br> <br> We have been trying to demonstrate to the court that there is abuse of
                  power, mala fide and bad faith by the police. The only way that we can
                  do this is to adduce evidence through cross-examination of the present
                  witness, Mr Marc E. Should Your Honour allow us to do with such
                  cross-examination?<br> <br> Woolf LJ cannot be clearer on this:<br> <br> "<em>We have particularly in mind cases where it is suggested
                  that there has been an abuse of power because of mala fides on the part
                  of the byelaw maker. In the case of bad faith, there may be an issue
                  which the criminal court can determine and if so, evidence will be
                  required."<br> <br> </em>To recap:<br> <br> The crux of the matter is that our constitutional rights may not be
                  taken away by the police taking on some "policy position." Such policy
                  is substantively invalid.<br> <br> The issue of substantive invalidity of the police policy must be
                  relevant to the charge because it renders the charge null and void. No
                  citizen is expected to obey a law that is substantively invalid to the
                  Constitution.<br> <br> There is more than a suggestion of bad faith and mala fide on the part
                  of the police. This necessitates our cross-examination of the licensing
                  officer in order for us to adduce evidence.<br> <br> Because of the issues of substantive invalidity and bad faith, this
                  court has the power to hear the arguments without the need for a
                  Judicial Review.<br> <br> Your Honour, the law is clearly with the defence and we ask that you administer justice accordingly.</p>
