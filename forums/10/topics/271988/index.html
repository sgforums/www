This came months after Mr. JBJ paid the full sum ordered by the highest court of appeal within the deadline.<br><br>LEEgime can still add yet another S$2500 now, with their First World Calculations!<br><br>Mr. JBJ is furnishing his new office with supporters helps. I urged Mr. Ng &amp; Mr. JBJ to complete the party constitution ASAP without the fine details and perfections, to have it filed on 8th Aug 2007, just before National Day. That way is to make the National Day also the party's anniversary day for Reform Party. :-)<br><br>Quite obviously Mr. JBJ's legal practice cert isn't looking like it would be in time to allow him to defend the Election Speech Trial of 7 charges each to Dr. CSJ &amp; myself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not an unforseen circumstences that JB still have minor obstacles that hinders him knowing that he was such a thorn for the ruling party. i hope JB all the best and hope to hear more from him soon. And my greatest gratitude for all his supporters who helped him through. it only goes to show that he still does have a loyal supporters by his side even though he was out of the scene for a while.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
