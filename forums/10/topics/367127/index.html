              <p><strong>A brand new slate of NMPs in the House</strong></p>
              <p><span class="update">By Loh Chee Kong and Ong Dai Lin, <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/"></a></span></p>
              <p><span class="update"><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="color: #cc0000;">TODAY</span></a> | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 07 July 2009 0731 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It will be a slate of completely new faces in the
              House, all nine of them – the maximum number of Nominated Members of
              Parliament (NMPs) allowed by the Constitution. But you might recognise
              a few familiar names.
              <br> <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One surprise is former national swimmer and Olympian Joscelin Yeo</strong></span></span>,
              who makes the move from pool to politics; while ex-current affairs
              television presenter Viswa Sadasivan will simply be taking his
              long-time involvement on government panels to the next level.
              <br> <br>On Monday evening, an email sent out by the Select Committee,
              tasked with whittling down the list of 46 applications, revealed the
              results of their deliberations. <br> <br> Subject to President S R Nathan's formal approval, the nine picked to
              give voice to non-partisan, alternative views in Parliament comprise an
              entrepreneur, a decorated unionist, a top honcho at a Big Four
              accountancy firm, a vocal sociologist, a shipping industry leader, a
              communications consultant, a sportswoman, a community service veteran
              and an artistic director.
              <br> <br>Former NMPs Mr Siew Kum Hong and Mr Gautam Banerjee, both of whom
              had sought second terms, were conspicuously absent from the list.
              <br> <br>The newbies, who will be sworn in before Parliament sits on July
              20, were selected after interviews held over three days last week.
              <br> <br>Ms Yeo, 30, said she went for the interview without any expectation
              after her name was put up to the panel by the sporting fraternity. She
              views being an NMP as an extension of the work she is doing at the
              swimming school she runs with her brother and with the Youth Ministry
              of New Creation Church.
              <br> <br> "Definitely, some of the things close to my heart are sports and youth," she told TODAY, on the type of issues she might raise. 
              <br> <br> Mr Viswa, 49, who has been active on national panels for years, feels "sufficiently attuned to what's happening on the ground".
              <br> <br>"I'm at a steady state in my life where I'm able to commit the time
              needed ... I also feel strongly that to be able to contribute
              effectively (as an NMP), you need to have sufficient knowledge - and I
              feel today that I have enough to participate in debates on a spectrum
              of Bills," he said.
              <br> <br> </span><strong>Foot up for civil society</strong><span> <br> <br>One area Mr Viswa feels strongly about is the development of civil
              society, and he thinks the public is getting "mixed signals" from the
              top. <br> <br> "I think the government is sincere but quite often, there appears to be
              a sense that it's one step forward and two steps back," he said. <br> <br> Though mindful not to "overstep" his bounds as NMP, he is ready to leverage on his new role. 
              <br> <br> "I would like to form a loose resource panel of individuals with domain
              knowledge in specific areas like economics, social work, education,
              defence policies and so on ... so I'll be able to tap on their
              expertise which I might articulate (through) my views in Parliament,"
              he said. <br> <br> Another NMP hoping to extend her work outside of Parliament is The
              Substation co-artistic director Audrey Wong. Besides seeking to "give
              the arts a foot in the door among decision-makers", and reflecting the
              people's views on issues such as Internet freedom, political films and
              education, she plans to start a blog and run workshops for youth. <br> <br> "I've discussed with The Substation what my role should be ... one is
              to develop a stronger education programme where we give young people
              insights into arts and culture, and how the arts and society are
              intertwined."
              <br> <br> </span><strong>From bread-and-butter to identity issues</strong><span> <br> <br>While veteran unionist Terry Lee said he would focus on workers'
              welfare and employability - especially with Singapore in recession -
              some fellow NMP-appointees want to draw attention to social and
              cultural issues affecting the country.
              <br> <br> Fashion entrepreneur Calvin Cheng hopes to contribute in national debates on "cultural identity".
              <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>"With the Integrated Resorts, a window is opening which will either
              strengthen our cultural identity or weaken it ... At no time is having
              a strong, unique and proud cultural identity more important than right
              now, when we throw open our doors to the world," he said. </strong></span></span><br> <br>Married to an American, National University of Singapore
              sociologist Paulin Straughan wants to share her own experiences in
              drawing attention to the children of such "inter-cultural marriages".
              <br> <br> "Each year, we lose some of these bi-cultural youth when they are forced to give up Singapore citizenship. 
              <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>"As more Singaporeans marry foreigners and grow their families
              here, we must find an innovative way to help these children maintain
              their bi-cultural identity," she said. </strong></span></span><br> <br>TODAY was unable to contact the other three new NMPs. Ernst &amp;
              Young Associates managing director Mildred Tan chairs the public
              communications sub-committee on the National Council on Problem
              Gambling. <br> <br> Mr Teo Siong Seng, managing director of a container-ship operator, is
              president of both the Singapore Chinese Chamber Of Commerce &amp;
              Industry and the Singapore Shipping Association.
              <br> <br> Mr Laurence Wee is the executive director of Presbyterian Community Services. </span></p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">The Punch and Judy show in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore Parliament goes on.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Lee
              Kuan Yew, Singapore's intolerant leader has successfully managed to
              remove even the remotest resemblance, if there ever was, of
              representative government in his Parliament. For a start, there are
              only 2 opposition politicians there, albeit being only pretenders who
              are careful about what they say so as not to offend the dictator.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
              entire remaining 82 members in the house are there to sing his praises.</strong></span></span> With this disgraceful situation, where everyone can see it being
              nothing more than a one party dictatorship, his efforts to hoodwink the
              world into thinking it is a model democracy is failing. So he does the
              next best thing. Which is to make a fool not only of his subjects but
              the entire world audience by faking a representative Parliament.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In
              his state controlled press the Straits Times online edition of July 7,
              2009, there is an article titled "9 NMP names submitted". </strong></span></span>This is what
              it means. Even though the Constitution of Singapore calls for a
              representative government in Parliament, in total contempt for it, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he
              has selected 20 to 30 citizens whom he feels will ask some political
              questions in Parliament which he will approve before hand, and thereby
              give the impression of genuine political debate. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Of course you rightly
              guessed who these selected speakers are, none other than Lee Kuan Yew
              sympathisers of course, who are not there to further any citizen's
              interests but their own; that the right patronage and connections
              naturally bring. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singaporeans who are aware of this shameless
              chicanery will rightfully ask who these Nominated Members are speaking
              for in the first place; not them since they did not elect them. And
              therefore they have no right to be speaking for them, let alone in
              Parliament, not having been elected by anyone. </strong></span></span><br><br>And who are
              these selected clowns (Nominated Members of Parliment) anyway? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is
              a former sportswoman Joscelyn Yeo aged 30. Calvin Cheng 33, a fashion
              manager, Audrey Wong 41, an arts manager etc. No one is bothered about
              any of these individuals and neither does anyone care. </strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If they
              were intending to represent the people in Parliament, then why have
              they not stood for elections especially when they would almost
              certainly win being Lee Kuan Yew's bootlickers.</strong></span></span> You know why this is
              the case of course.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Any real opposition candidate would be sued for
              defamation, criminally charged, bankrupted and impoverished, not
              necessarily in that order. </strong></span></span>And yet, even though winning is almost a
              guaranteed certainty in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore, these individuals
              have no desire to stand up to it. Despite lacking any political
              interest or even the slightest civic consciousness of any sort, they
              are chosen to go to Parliament and speak a lot of nonsense, on your
              behalf, which everyone cares nothing about!<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew is becoming a joke. So is his Parliament and so are his obedient clowns who do the clown show in his Parliament.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>If
              asked about all this, I think Singaporeans should say as they have
              always done "I do not know, and I do not care."</strong></span></span> These handpicked Lee
              Kuan Yew's clowns can do all the talking they want. They would be
              talking to themselves.<br><br>And the Singapore watchers reading this
              would be alerted once more to what Singapore really is; a one party Lee
              Kuan Yew dictatorship trying very hard to fool everyone into thinking
              the island is not what everyone knows it is. Lee Kuan Yew's nonsense is
              not fooling anyone anymore. <br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              Now you see why LKY wanted us to give up dialects for English. You couldn't understand that simple ang mo article! It is Paulin Straughan, NUS sociologist, who wants to find ways to help children of inter-cultural marriages maintain their bicultural id and not Calvin Cheng.
              
              Joke aside, dialects are only a very small part of cultures. I somehow believe that even without the gahmen's intervention dialects will  become less and less frequently used. Singaporeans, or human beings for that matter, are very practical and will only use whatever language that is necessary in ensuring their economic well being. I couldn't remember the figure but it was reported that everyday some dialects or languages will die a natural death.
              
              Ah Chia, open your heart, open your mind and embrace other cultures. Your life will become more interesting and you will become happier and richer spirtually.

              First of all, i wouldn't view anybody from his/her ethnic group.
              
              Secondly, have that particularly person ever asked you or anybody to kowtow to him?
              
              Yes that person had abolished dialects from the public media, mainly TV and radio, but he didn't forbid anybody from speaking dialects at home or in public places.
              
              I still speak dialects and don't think my culture has been eroded just because dialects have been banned in the public media.

              <p>Primary education in Hong Kong covers a wide curriculum. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Core subjects include Chinese, English, Mathematics </strong></span></span>,and General Studies with broad emphasis on Music, Physical Education and Arts. In some schools Science is taught as well.</p>
              <p>Formerly there were 3 knowledge-oriented subjects: Social Studies, Health Education, and Science. In the 1996-1997 academic year the Education Department amalgamated these subjects into the new subject of General Studies. Depending on the religious background of the school, Religious Education or Bible Studies could be incorporated.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The teaching medium in most of the local primary schools is Chinese with English as a second language. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>After the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, only a handful of primary schools and secondary schools are able to keep English as the medium of instruction under new government policies. Those schools are generally referred to as English as Medium of Instruction schools (EMI)...</p>

              Yes most of us were unhappy when he abolished dialects from the public media but to say that we or the old folks suffer as a result of that policy is a tad exaggerated. There are still Chinese programmes and dialects news. If we want dialect shows or songs we can still get them in the forms of CD, VCD or DVD.
              
              So long as we can have access to Chinese papers, shows or songs I wouldn't say that the Chinese culture has been suppressed. Anyway, culture, like languages/dialects is a life thing, it wouldn't remain unchange but keep evolving with our changing lifestyles.
