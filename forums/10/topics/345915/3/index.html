              <p> While Sg is no where close to that, It gives people a rough idea how such syndicates operate. Theres only so much authorities can do, and Sg by international standards has done a pretty good job containing it already. Its an uphill task </p>

              I think a lot of people forgot that Singapore is also thought of as a police state. 
              When they want to condemn Singapore they can suka suka do so. Complain police state, complain Sin City. Complain no freedom of speech, but can anyhow talk.

              <p> </p>
              <p>The seriousness of prositution in Singapore is getting worst and
              worst as days goes by.illegal prositutes from China, India,
              Philippines, Vietnam, Hainanese, all sorts of nationality are here
              to make a quick profit.</p>
              <p>According to my observation when i make a scot along the path,
              when the police van came, they did not bother even to run and to my
              surprise, the police did not even want to catch them.Last time
              whenever the police are here, they will run very fast.Now, seems
              like they are not afraid of them.</p>
              <p>The serious of prositution in Singapore did not stop here, most
              of them will agree not to use condom if the customer agree to pay
              her more.And Aids is a serious threat to us.Why are they making our
              beautiful country a bad name?Should we not all of us standup as one
              whole nation and force the government to crush out the Geylang
              prositution???</p>
              <p>Last time we had legal Thai prositution.They go for checkup.Ok,
              this is acceptable at the very least.But now, those illegal
              prositution are illegal, according to our law, they should be
              banned from Singapore.But when i give a call to the police Anti
              Vice, nothing had been done seriously.I already called alot of
              times but nothing done.</p>
              <p>Hope this message be forward to the high command of Anti Vice,
              if possible everyone here please help me to promote what i said
              here, IF YOU GUYS FROM ANTI VICE NOT GOING TO STOP THEM, I WILL DO
              MY WAY BY TAKING MORE VIDEOS OF THEM AND PUT IT ON youtube to show
              the world what kind of police forces we had.</p>
              <p>I am not joking or threatening.I love Singapore and i dont wish
              Singapore to be a land or prositution!!! If the government can be
              so efficient in crushing out opposition members, with their
              abilities and secret intelligenence, no one will question the
              government abilities to crush out the illegal prositution in
              Singapore UNLESS the governemnt choose to CLOSE BOTH EYES!!!</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>A close up video on how our government let in so many
              prositution in Singapore.Our young generation at risk of aids
              spreading like fire if illegal prositution is not going to stop in
              Singapore.</p>

              <p>Okay.</p>
              <p>What makes you think legalized prostitution = use of condom and who ensures safe sex?</p>

              <p>Complain is ok if it is geninue and action is taken, but the blaming and complaining culture here is complain and blame each other alots only by the words of mouth...but very less or even no action taken.</p>

              <p>The sch told us to go to sch punctually, but the damn teachers is alway late,..then we are suppose to go back punctually, but always make to stay back to rehearsal dance or sketches for VIP..MPs etc etc...damn, do they know what is education punctuality or not, if you say the school end at 1pm, make sure it end at 1 pm. </p>
