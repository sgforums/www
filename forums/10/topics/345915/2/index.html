              <p>The seriousness of prositution in Singapore is getting worst and worst as days goes by.illegal prositutes from China, India, Philippines, Vietnam, Hainanese, all sorts of nationality are here to make a quick profit.</p>
              <p>According to my observation when i make a scot along the path, when the police van came, they did not bother even to run and to my surprise, the police did not even want to catch them.Last time whenever the police are here, they will run very fast.Now, seems like they are not afraid of them.</p>
              <p>The serious of prositution in Singapore did not stop here, most of them will agree not to use condom if the customer agree to pay her more.And Aids is a serious threat to us.Why are they making our beautiful country a bad name?Should we not all of us standup as one whole nation and force the government to crush out the Geylang prositution???</p>
              <p>Last time we had legal Thai prositution.They go for checkup.Ok, this is acceptable at the very least.But now, those illegal prositution are illegal, according to our law, they should be banned from Singapore.But when i give a call to the police Anti Vice, nothing had been done seriously.I already called alot of times but nothing done.</p>
              <p>Hope this message be forward to the high command of Anti Vice, if possible everyone here please help me to promote what i said here, IF YOU GUYS FROM ANTI VICE NOT GOING TO STOP THEM, I WILL DO MY WAY BY TAKING MORE VIDEOS OF THEM AND PUT IT ON youtube to show the world what kind of police forces we had.</p>
              <p>I am not joking or threatening.I love Singapore and i dont wish Singapore to be a land or prositution!!! If the government can be so efficient in crushing out opposition members, with their abilities and secret intelligenence, no one will question the government abilities to crush out the illegal prositution in Singapore UNLESS the governemnt choose to CLOSE BOTH EYES!!!</p>

              <p>corruption in ICA is 100% existing. just a matter whether someone can catch them. the nos and ease of PRCs and worldwide prostitute entering spore is truely amazing. either the Home team are blind or they are the whole bunch of corrupted ministry. WKS, not only u r a bad minister for the home team, you even fail to address the basic threat to singapore.</p>

              <p>Haha, I watch the first one... It says unlawful detention by the police. I thought being detent by the police is the most lawful any detention can get. And the police if really want to be funny, won't give back the camera with tape inside it, but just find some reason to detent it too.</p>
              <p>The second one reminds me of Slums of New York, or Britain, just minus the drugs and Gangs.</p>
