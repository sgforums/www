One wonders whether there should be a more stringent selection criteria. Wait...then again, there is none. With 'politicks' becoming a one-sided affair, few singaporeans see the importance or desire to join and serve.<br><br>Certainly, with the ruling party, there may just one direction: MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY. Hence no innovation, simply the 'my idea beats all' solution.<br><br>Hence the recent furore with LTA and HDB and their insufferable errs.<br><br>The elderly have been squeezed out by an emerging population hungry to make money, inflation is slowly taking hold and costs of living is rising. With many without children to support them, they are left to fend for themselves. MPs like Sin Boon Ann are the personification of the govt who live in their ivory towers, blind to the troubles of the poor and old.<br><br></div>

Just financing the flats, we are tied to 65 years old. At mid life, if we don't make it in life, we are destine to be slave for the rest of our lifes. Be it dish washer, cleaners, newspaper vendor, we work to our graves.<br><br>What do they know about transport fare hikes? How much it affects a middle income family of 4 to 5 ppl? The public housing system of resale levy (this levy is to make sure the poor don't make a profit thru resale. The profit should be for .... wtf?)<br><br>They make us contribute to some kind of silly funds to help us retire comfortably? You think so? It's a fund to make sure we don't owe our medical bills, housing bills etc... It's to make sure we are not a burden when we are old and dying.<br><br>When citizens had done their moral obligations to the country, look after them when they are aged. Not ask them to work into their graves. This is a moral obligation that every Gov must do.

            <div class='col-md body'>LHL recently touched briefly on the issue of transparent ministerial pay in an interview with the straits times.<br><br>He mentioned that as key cabinet members with a task to perform, one must be prepared to pay them an appropriate and commeasurable salary.  Else no one will WANT to serve their country.<br><br>In this aspect, i wonder whether he has mistakenly set too high standards in wage demands. By pricing themselves out of the nominal wage circle, it is therefore easily understandable that certain members do not REALISE the situation of our poor and aging population. Even GLCs have begun the systematic pricing of their own CEOs and board of directors, indirectly influencing the private sector to follow suit. As a result, the wage gap between rich and poor widens significantly with no end in sight. At the same time, costs of living is rising astronomically, raising questions over the affordability for the lower-income groups.<br><br>As with the potential problems with our younger generation, the 5 'C's when first introduced, sparked a sudden leaning of our society towards the materialistic, so much that we gave up our ethical and graciousness as a people in pursuit of MONEY, so much so that LHL himself had to intervene and include another additional  5 'C's to balance character development. But it was somewhat too little too late, for the damage had already been done.<br><br>One need only look at what our society has advanced (or degraded) in the last 5 years to determine whether our ruling party has got the preceived 'roadmap' right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body">LHL recently touched briefly on the issue of transparent ministerial pay in an interview with the straits times.<br><br>He mentioned that as key cabinet members with a task to perform, one must be prepared to pay them an appropriate and commeasurable salary.  Else no one will WANT to serve their country.<br><br>In this aspect, i wonder whether he has mistakenly set too high standards in wage demands. By pricing themselves out of the nominal wage circle, it is therefore easily understandable that certain members do not REALISE the situation of our poor and aging population. Even GLCs have become the systematic pricing of their own CEOs and board of directors, indirectly influencing the private sector to follow suit. As a result, the wage gap between rich and poor widens significantly with no end in sight. At the same time, costs of living is rising astronomically, raising questions over the affordability for the lower-income groups.<br><br>As with the potential problems with our younger generation, the 5 'C's when first introduced, sparked a sudden leaning of our society towards the materialistic, so much that we gave up our ethical and graciousness as a people in pursuit of MONEY, so much so that LHL himself had to intervene and include another additional  5 'C's to balance character development. But it was somewhat too little too late, for the damage had already been done.<br><br>One need only look at what our society has advanced (or degraded) in the last 5 years to determine whether our ruling party has got the preceived 'roadmap' right. </div></blockquote>so he's effectively saying tat the cabinet ministers are there for the money not for the honour of serving the country. no money no honey <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 25, 2005<br>Beach kampung<br>Squatter-campers have to leave Changi Beach Park by tomorrow<br><br>By Melissa Sim<br>FOR odd-job worker Danny, home is three tents pitched on Changi Beach.<br><br>The yellow one is his living room, the blue his bedroom, and the red functions as a kitchen-cum-storeroom.<br><br>Over the last few months, he has bought a gas stove and added a plastic garden set to his sea-side retreat. He tries to catch fish when he has no money for food.<br><br>The 39-year-old, who spent seven years in jail for fighting and was released last February, is one of about a dozen people who have turned part of Changi Beach Park into a shanty town.<br><br>Some have pitched their tents there for months, but said they have been told by the National Parks Board rangers to clear out by tomorrow. NParks could not be contacted for comment yesterday.<br><br>The campers moved there after it did away with camping permits last December. Although NParks rangers have asked them to leave several times before, they generally appease the rangers by keeping the area clean.<br><br>The police also make their rounds regularly and check their passports but do not disturb them beyond that.<br><br>According to the campers, at least two people have already moved out of their makeshift kampung, a patchwork of red, blue and green tents located on the beach in front of carparks 1 and 2.<br><br>Danny, who has been living there for eight months, said that after his release from prison, he slept in void decks and stairwells until his friend suggested he camp out at Changi Beach. In a good week, he gets paid $50 for doing odd jobs.<br><br>Like the others, he bathes in the sea or in the public toilets 200m away.<br><br>When The Sunday Times visited yesterday, clothes were hanging out to dry on lines straddling the coconut trees and some campers were dining alfresco. A few were discussing a Lianhe Zaobao newspaper report yesterday on their hideaway, and did not want to be interviewed.<br><br>One of the few who spoke was Mr Sahidan Sakyon, 55. He said he was waiting for the Housing Board to approve his application to rent a flat. He said he lived with relatives after leaving his two-room HDB flat in Taman Jurong to his wife after divorcing her two years ago.<br><br>But because of the cramped living conditions, he and his second wife, who is 28 and five months pregnant, moved to the beach a month ago.<br><br>He said: 'We're not proud people, and we don't mind. We can use the public toilet for free and can get water from there. There are no mosquitoes and there are street lights at night so we can see.'<br><br>The security guard, who says he earns $1,100 a month, told The Sunday Times that he might rent a room in his friend's Bedok flat for $300 if he is chased out. 'I hope I get to stay two more weeks, maybe I can get my flat by then.'<br><br>As for Danny, he broke into tears when asked about his plans. He said: 'I like living here. It's peaceful.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>many of the current 'help to the poor' schemes are stop gap measures or just some shut yr mouth goodwill fees.  Say, the 50 bucks subsidy for the poor in response to the transport fare hike..is that a lot of money? Rich folks would have a car or many cars and $50 won't even fill a full tank. it is usually the poor who will be staying at some ulu estates and because of the journey, will burn up their fare cards much faster. wonder how the geniuses conjure these schemes and everything gets the go-ahead...perhaps it is such a paltry sum that won't even entice the poor to take up the offer. the argument is that we would like to prevent a 'crutch mentality' but this is such an over-used phrase for not thinking about longer term solutions and the fact is, effective help is not getting out to those that need them now. training and education can work for some but not all as there are just a myriad of circumstances facing each and every individual who may be in need. the strange thing that could happen is that the younger generations may be the ones more likely to succumb to welfarism than the face-saving older generations. with help being dislocated at present, whether these measures will work in the near future towards/against this noble principle is still hard to tell. for now, it is not uncommon to see the poor having difficulties to even raise $50 to top up their cpf just to get some handout. and this is the ground-zero. and, while we get freebies on/off, without fail those monies will faithfully return to paying back some form of taxes or utilities besides the bread and water on the table.  yes, the faceless corporates are creeping up and making more feel unbearable. and with globalization initiatives hailed as strategic visions, have one's life and values improved? are we charging forward blindly or at an over-competitive pace that will just bring more problems?  just hope we don't underestimate the building tensions between the rich-poor divide as for a long time, these were major catalysts for revolutions, wars and social problems of all sorts.  things are going wrong when you read the papers about kids talking about being in top prestigious schools vis a vis neighbourhood schools, different classes of the very rich and poor, gold taps/peanuts and racial discrimination.  if we imagine all these as connective factors held together in a larger framework, any dissatisfaction with the economic-centric model would just break one of the links and unleash destructive manifestations.  the evil eye is something real and the enemy from 'within' will be the most difficult  to manage.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Its maddening isnt it?<br><br>Government is not supposed to be a business entreprise, yet they act like a profit mongering retards.
