            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian judges were sent to an indoctrination "boot camp" and threatened with dismissal to pressure them into making pro-government decisions, a senior judge said according to reports Wednesday. <br><br>In explosive allegations made in open court, Justice Ian Chin also said he was threatened by former premier Mahathir Mohamad over high-profile cases, one involving a close associate of the then-leader. <br><br>"Now, though he is no longer the prime minister and so no longer able to carry out his threat to remove judges, the coalition party that he led is still around," he said, according to the Borneo Post. <br><br>Chin made the allegations, which were picked up by the national press Wednesday, before hearing a dispute over results of March general elections in Sarawak state on Borneo island. <br><br>He said he was targeted by Mahathir after refusing to award "astronomical" payouts in two libel cases in 1997, while a judge who agreed with the then-premier's views was promoted to the Federal Court. <br><br>Afterwards, Chin reportedly said he was packed off to a five-day boot camp with selected judges and judicial officers. <br><br>It was without any doubt "an attempt to indoctrinate those attending the boot camp to hold the view that the government interest as being more important than all else when we are considering our judgement," he said. <br><br>Cabinet minister Zaid Ibrahim, who is in charge of legal affairs, indicated he believed the allegations, and that they would harm the reputation of the nation's justice system. <br><br>"I can't say I'm surprised by the revelations. There have been many stories in the past," he told reporters. <br><br>"It is regrettable that it has happened, it is a bad reflection on our country. We have to make sure it does not happen again," he said. "You should not tell judges what they can or cannot do." <br><br>However, he dismissed calls from the Bar Council for an official probe into the allegations. <br><br>"An investigation will not reveal anything more than what we know. What we need to do is restore judicial independence and make sure such incidents do not happen," he said. <br><br>Bar Council president Ambiga Sreenavasan said the allegations were "both startling and damning." <br><br>"Judges, both present and past, must be encouraged to come forward and provide information on any such instances of interference so that further action may be taken," she said according to the New Straits Times. <br><br>Mahathir stood down in 2003 and his successor Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has been criticised for failing to carry out his promises to tackle corruption, which is deeply entrenched in politics and business. <br><br>Chin's allegations add to the pall cast over the country's judiciary by a recent royal commission into a sensational Mahathir-era video clip that showed a top lawyer brokering judicial appointments with the help of politicians. <br><br>The commission found in May that there was evidence of an "insidious" conspiracy to influence the appointment of judges, and the government promised to investigate those implicated. <br><br>Mahathir, who has fallen out with his successor and accused him of corruption and nepotism, has previously challenged the authorities to charge him. <br><br>His spokesman told AFP the former premier would respond to Chin's comments "in due course." - </span></p></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How does one even define 'independence' in the independence of our judiciary, when</p>
              <p>a. The CJ, head of the judiciary, is not voted or beholden to the electorate, other than being a lawyer and a citizen, nor be responsible for any fallout to our society other than to make a judgement based on our constitution?</p>
              <p>b. the CJ, with due respect to his office, is only a human, a flawed being, with the imperfection of humanity, and not some supernatural higher plane entity?</p>
              <p>c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who else then</span>, but the PM, who is head of the elected party, answerable to the citizens, with the implicit trust of a nation, can assign or select an 'independent' judiciary, carefully and meticuosly ensuring those whom made decisions based on life and death of citizens, are properly chosen?</p>
              <p>d. Is there any other mechanism, in the case of political figures being on trial, to ensure such independence, or should the strength of evidences, reason and logic be sufficient for voters to comprehend the impartiality of a judgement passed down by the judge? </p>
