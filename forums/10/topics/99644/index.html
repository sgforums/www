            <div class='col-md body'>Hi vinlys,<br><br>if the termination is forced upon within the 3 yr bond, then there is no need for the teacher to pay back, unless the termination is something due to a gross breach of conduct e.g. molest student etc etc. otherwise, if they want to terminate you during the bond, they have to give u a very good reason. usually they wont do this because it will cost them money. bad performance is not usually a reason why they would terminate because under the ranking, if u get D grade, u'll be send for counselling/mentoring. only if u get more than i think 3 times, meaning bad performance for more than 3 consecutive yrs then u are asked to leave.<br><br>as for resignation, resigning after the 3 yrs usually have no impact. all u lose if your gratuity (u get gratuity every 3-4 yrs under the new incentive scheme).<br><br>as for bad bosses, within the 3 yr bond u can still apply out, granted that its subjected to the principal's approval but there are ways to get behind it. for example, u can go for open posting. usually if theres a vacancy elsewhere, and if u can get your friend to go for any interview with the other principal, get into some kind of agreement, impress them so much, they can go to MOE to over rule the existing boss, especially if the other principal is someone with clout. yes, even among principals, some have more clout than others. its been done b4. i have friends who go to another principal, someone with a lot of pull, and impressed them so much that the principal 'requested' for them...then MOE will get the original principal to release.<br><br>if your friend is really unhappy, tell em to try the open posting/or ask around other schools. but do this discriminately  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>if he is still a trainee...well....don stay in that school. get a post out after practicum. it is a lot easier.<br><br>hope this helps...i cant rem all the details in your mail but i hope i replied to the gist of it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To bratpig: You're right. I'm not qualified to be in the noble profession of teaching. I feel that teachers nowadays are not treated with the kind of respect that they deserve. Be it from the students, parents or even the media. I like kids  and the closest I've done to teaching is giving tuition to my Primary Five nephew.  (Of which I admit is not an easy task)<br>Imagine a teacher handling 30 of them, and on top of that planning and running extra curriculum activities which school nowadays are so fond of. I wonder how they are going to fit all those activities into the five day work week in the near future. I believe I won't be able to take the kind of stress that a teacher goes through nowadays. So, in that sense, be assured that I won't ruin Singapore's future generation. Except maybe for my 11 year old nephew.<br><br>My friend however, has a genuine love for teaching. Enjoy being with kids and always enthusiatic when talking about the Physical Education Lesssons that he conducts. He likes a good laugh and likes teasing the children. He's also capable of a good shout that will silence the kids when required. What he dislike is the never ending extra curriculum activities that the principal likes to dish out while chasing for honours for the school. I guess he's not the most well liked among the teachers and probably sucks at sucking up to the principal.<br><br>It seems that the choice that he have now is to resign and pay the liquidation damages, (Cos he's still on bond) or wait to be Terminated and then appeal. Lose lose situation. The principal seems to be quite certain that he's not cut out for teaching and doesn't want him to teach. I believe that my friend is "advised" to resign so that he doesn't face the risk of being blackmarked in the Civil Service. To me, it seems like a more convenient way to terminate him. Both ways, he face liquidation charges for breaching the bond.<br><br>If he appeal, to MOE I guess, (I tried calling them today but they don't seem to willing to listen to me, maybe it's their busy day) they'll send someone down to interview and investigate. I believe it's the Superintendent in charge for the zone who'll be investigating. From what I heard, the principal and the superintendent are related, and pass complains about the school were all clamped down. (Yes, it has happened before) The principal probably also have contacts within the MOE. That's some "clouting" power for you Lefleche.<br><br>To be graded "D" is to me is kind of shameful. To appeal means having to be interviewed by the board and going through the "shame" again. And at what rate of success? I believe if the appeal fails, he'll be termed as "Terminated". Even if he succeeds, he'll be known as the teacher "who find problems for the school." He'll probably be "unofficially blackmarked" by the schools.<br><br>It seems to me a really unenviable position to be in. He wants to just resign and forget about the whole thing with a possibility of employment in other areas of Civil Service. I wonder if it'll happen again if he just resigns.<br><br>(PS. I haven't try calling the Teacher's Union yet, I'm not sure what they can do. Maybe I'll call them tomorrow to find out. Thanks for the tip Greengoblin. Thanks dibilo, I stand by your believe that we should keep quiet if we have nothing constructive to say, but I do not wish to start a flaming war here, I guess more important things needs to be done.)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Vinly, it is not true that principals and superintendants are always related and therefore must help one another and cover up.

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yeah...forgot to add..<br><br>no one can force him to resign. he must know his rights on this matter. one of the other forumites is correct...if he is forced to resign, the principal has alot to answer for...so he should be more afraid than your friend.<br><br>ask your fren never never give in to the pressure to write that letter...they cant make him do it. ask him to start asking around for a new school....transfers are easier to do at year end...in fact this is the best time to seek a transfer...</div>

The problem is there's no time left to go around hunting for good schools with good principals with clout to consider my friend as a teacher. Correction on my earlier posting, the principal "advised" against the teacher transferring to another school and not disallow him transfering. Principal 'sweettalk' the teacher to stay and then this.<br><br>The teacher have to decide now whether to resign (Go down quietly) , Get Terminated and appeal (Still going down but with some noise) or what ever you guys can suggest.......<br><br>Termination equals blackmarked for Civil Service.

            <div class='col-md body'>This situation sounds like a case of biasness and sadly, a situation whereby higher authority wins all. Hasn't it always been by default, higher authority (in this case the principal) having more power, more autonomy and therefore more support from governmental bodies and statutory boards. Who's words would be taken more seriously? A pricipal who has been in the system for donkey years, or a teacher still serving bond? If a case were to be presented, chances are, the principal's words would carry more credentials as compared to the individual teacher. Unless a collective group stands out to voice their dissentment, victory is often awarded to the higher personnel.<br><br>Sadly, how many of Singaporean individuals (teachers) are willing to step-up &amp; challenge the power of higher authority? Fear of power and fear of losing their rice bowls prevents then from speaking up and thus, many choose to suffer in silence. Isn't this a great flaw in the education system??<br><br>Also, in an environment that promotes learning and moulding individuals, isn't it the principal's DUTY and responsibilty to guide the teacher in the event that the teacher is underperforming? How is learning incorporated when the pricipal does not take on the role of a motivator and mentor?? What sense does it make to "ask" the teacher to resign?? If such is the attitude displayed by the principal, what could you expect from his teachers? Such, are acts of irresponsibity. The principal plays an important role in guiding his team of teachers to guide and mould the children of the future. If we as adults do not embrace appropriate values, the next generations will not be taught what is right and what is wrong.<br><br>Therefore, my conclusion is that thre are major flaws in the system which should be reviewed ASAP.. Losing dedicated teachers through personal biasness from principals means losing an ASSET in MOE.. Remember, the most efficient way of teaching &amp; motivating comes from personal examples...</div>

Don't let ur friend write the resignation letter . If they want to terminate him under the bond - they have to give a lengthy explanation to MOE in which your friend has to give his side of the story.

Bring the letter to MOE office and ask them if that is the policy of principal to force a resignation letter. That written resignation letter is proof enough that the principal is exceeding his authority to the point of audacity.<br><br>All I can say is : your friend needs to ask for legal advice in regards to the bond and the principal.  It needs to be pre emptive. If your friend gave in to the pressure , then that is too bad.<br><br>That's the best advice I can give.</div>
