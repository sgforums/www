Many doctors in the outside practices are hoping to have half the chance to earn basics plus consultancy fees which balloon remunerations to unprecedented level. This has been the same policy that pushes costs of salaries year after year from mid 1980s. The whole load including non-target groups get the ride of a good remunerative journey and are congratulating themselves privately for good bounties. Facts or fictions?

            <div class='col-md body'>Was just talking to my friends in Australia and US. You know, medical costs in Singapore are actually too low for the level of service we receive and expect. Sorry, I know this is not a popular view but it is true. Problem is that we (myself included) now expect first world medical service but we are not prepared to pay first world prices cos our salaries aren't equivalent to western developed nations.<br><br>Some countries like Thailand and India can ameliorate the differential somewhat cos most of their population is blissfully unaware of the adavances in medical technology and so can keep demand down. High tech medicine is therefore available quite cheaply to the small minority of those who can afford it. The other advantage is their ability to produce cheap generics...that's why our HIV patients have to go to Thailand to get anti-retrovirals. (we cannot make cheap generics cos we want to attract all the pharmaceuticals to do business here).<br><br>Here our doctors want to engage the latest technology available (see the constant boasting in the papers of their latest toys and techniques) but they do not come cheap. We the patients get all excited and demand the latest drug or keyhole surgery or investigation. But it is expensive and we cannot afford to pay the full cost. The government does not want to subsidize or they will have to raise taxes. The hospital goes into the red and so they want to raise charges.<br><br>Another problem is that the doctors who provide these latest techniques demand higher salaries (remember the salary of the eye surgeons at SNEC?). Surgeons as a whole earn 3-10 times more than other specialists because they bring business to the hospital. Hospital administrators have to break even and so squeeze the salary of other specialists, junior doctors and nurses; make them work harder for less pay. Other specialists see the huge difference in remuneration and are not happy....contributing to an exodus to the private sector.<br><br>The private sector pays about two to three times the salary of doctors in the government sector, but sees only a third of patients in Singapore. It is no secret that every young surgeon works hard in the public hospitals to gather experience and clients for his move to the private sector. Those that remain are either not as good or stuck in specialties that are necessary but not easy to go private eg. psychiatry, radiology, pathology..<br><br>So I buy enough medical insurance to cover me so that I can afford good but expensive medical treatment if I need it when I am still economically active. Keep healthy when young so I can work and earn as much as possible, retire early and enjoy myself before I get really old and inevitably fall ill to cancer or whatever degenerative diseases that will eventually get all of us. When that day comes, I will take a handful of sleeping pills and die peacefully rather than bankrupt my family with long and expensive hospital stays.<br><br></div>
