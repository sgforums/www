              <p>i suspect that he is a singaporean living in oz and what he is trying to do is to dissuade singaporeans from flocking to oz (most likely perth), by posting discouraging news about oz., a reverse-racist i presume.</p>

              <p>Anybody ever bothers to really read <strong>all</strong> his cut and paste text in the threads he started?</p>

              <p>For me, I normally try to read his first post and try my very best to see what he is getting at, all subsequent post I just click to admire the long diss-ertation, heaven forbids, if anybody really reads all his post, he will most likely end up schizophrenic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His argument gets lost in the wall of text he spams. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can more of less know of his delusions when during one post he told imaginary readers to just click "view lionnoisy" so that they could get past ST's wall of text. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>His threads are mainly excuses to cut-and-paste random articles from the media, hence I decide to truly use his threads the way he made them to be used...</p>
              <p>The funny thing is that he gets unhappy, maybe because instead of getting an captive audience he's getting swamped by his own medicine.</p>
              <p>This dude's main motive is to bait people into answering him, and then he'll attempt to overwhelm them with cut-and-paste articles and simplistic,childlike replies. More attempts to anwer him or prove to him his folly will only be a waste of energy as he'll carry on his illogical argument to its end and then simply move on to another when he's trapped... and a while later, he'll reuse his old debunked arguments. After a while you'll realize it's practically useless to anwer to his threads... the problem is he's targeting people who do not know about his method of operation, and invariably if you leave his nonsense for all to see a noob is going to try to answer him.</p>
              <p>In fact he used to troll military nuts quite a lot with SAF is the best in the world and Australia Defence Forces can't do anything nonsense, but in the end the forumers there came up with a rather good method of taking care of his nonsense and eventually he got discouraged and came back here instead.</p>
              <p>My advice, don't bother arguing with him, just give him back his own medicine and eventually he'll realize tht his nonsensical behaviour is not working. The wall of text is to deny him the captive audience he so desires.</p>
