            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is just a small red dot on the world map, but its dengue outbreak may have shocked the region!If this outbreak were to happen in other countries like Japan, the minister-in-charge might have already packed up and resigned. Similarly, mishap like that of LTA's Nicoll Highway collapse might have the similar consequences in other nation, but it never happened in the world most highly paid jobs in Singapore!<br><br>Most were wondering what the NEA has been doing all these whiles in the past? There is not a single doubt that to control dengue, you need the co-operations of the people but had they done enough to cap the out break?Are our leaders getting too complacent in their highly paid jobs?Have we done enough to stop the terrorists from bombing the underwater tunnels, or should we wait till thousands of Singaporeans drown in the tunnels when they are on their way to work, then we start to take action like the wars against dengue fever?????</div>

Smaller and smaller mobile harddisk are taking over the reign in computers. It is increasingly popular and will propel our growths in manufacturing of computers and telecommunications.<br><br>I have suggested to Feedback Unit the adoption of an economic master plan to better coordinate and strategize our industries so that we will always catch the right opportunities at the right time but my suggestions were probably too difficult for them to consider.<br><br>Instead, EDB is taking the general pro-investments approach of incentivising foreign MNCs and selected industries on case by case. EDB is sending scholars to do courses in US and western advanced countries and hope that these scholars do not break bonds.<br><br>I suggest that the ministers should not stay complacent by always talking about their past success in attracting foreign investments. What they have to do now is to catch up with small countries like Finland and Switzerland in applying practical knowledge in every field and by overseeing practical planning and strategizing of diverse opportunities that suit our locational and other advantages. By leveraging on the new advantages afforded by IR, we will have more value-adding in many more sectors among other cost-affected industries.<br><br>EDB can facilitate the growth of mobile harddisk manufacturing and hand-phones, solar powers, and fuel cell cars etc, bio-tech etc by creating new technology start-ups if private sector cannot do so to kickstart new areas of growth and macro-tune our current general investment approaches to success.<br><br>The general investment-centred policies of the past are too complacent and will only bring in certain level of industries whereas proactive opportunity seeking among our entrepreneurs will enliven the whole investment climate, especially we have the IR and good location and call-centre management excellence to use as stimulants.
