              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Yesterday,
              the 5th of September 2008, Subordinate Court No. 6, 4.30 pm Singapore.
              I was convicted of disorderly behavior and one count of hurling abuses
              at police officers. I have already narrated the incident in my earlier
              blog.<br><br>I was fined $2,000.00 and if I failed to pay, to serve 2
              weeks jail for the hurling abuses at police officers charge. For the
              disorderly charge, $1,000.00 and if I failed to pay, 1 week in jail. In
              total $3,000.00. I have filed an appeal, which means that I don’t have
              to pay just yet. Mr. Chia Ti Lik will be my lawyer in the appeal.<br><br>This
              case, which I shall call the disorderly case, took 18 days of trial in
              court. I defended myself. After all I am a lawyer. So if I have been
              fined $3,000.00, you may say that I got my money's worth. I have made
              the court and the Singapore Attorney General to work very hard for 18
              days of court time. In return the fine I have to pay them is only
              $3,000.00. If you look at from a financial standpoint, you could say
              that I have ripped them off. What, for 18 days of court time, they get
              only $3,000.00!<br><br>But on a serious note let me summarize what
              happened. The prosecution case had so many holes; you could have called
              it a sieve, and a broken one at that. And what was worse, except for 5
              police officers, there was not a single independent witness, despite
              the fact that there was reported to be more than 25 independent
              onlookers as stated by the police spokesman himself in the Sunday Times
              of July 6, 2008!<br><br>On the morning of Sept 5, 2008 at 10 am, the
              prosecutor Mr. Koy Su Hua rose to address the court. His arguments were
              that I had hurled racial abuses at Malay policemen, which in his view
              should not be tolerated in a multi racial Singapore. Second that I had
              misconduct myself in the case by asking questions, which the judge had
              disallowed. Third that I had insisted that the Tamil Police
              Investigator give his full name instead of being allowed to use his
              nickname, which was S Vicki. Fourth, a similar accusation against Mr.
              Koy and the judge James Leong. That I had used the trial for political
              ends. That I had cast aspersions on the integrity of the judiciary
              including the judge Mr. Leong. That I had shown no remorse. And
              therefore, because of these things, I should be sent to prison because
              a fine was not enough.<br><br>I pointed out to the court that I deny
              ever hurling any abuses at anyone. And that each time someone used a
              racial abuse is used; if the offender is sent to prison, there wouldn’t
              be sufficient prison space to house all the offenders!<br><br>That I
              deny ever having behaved disorderly, as I had no reason to be. I was
              not drunk, as shown by the blood alcohol report, and neither was I mad.
              That I never misbehaved in court in any way, which was nothing more
              than a figment of imagination, Mr. Koy's that is. As for demanding full
              names, it was my understanding that in any country in the world
              including Singapore, people have to give their true names. If a man is
              John Smith, he cannot say that he is Archibald Adams! And that applies
              to this Tamil Investigator from Central Police Station who happens to
              be Vickneswaran s/o Sockalingam (s/o means son of) whose true name I
              only discovered by asking him a direct question during cross
              examination. The surprising thing about this name business is that this
              man, Mr. Koy, as well as the judge himself had flatly refused to give
              their full true names at all. Mr. Koy wanted to be known only as Peter
              Koy and the Judge wanted only to be known as James Koy. In the end we
              discovered that he was in fact Peter Koy Su Hua and the Judge was James
              Leong with 2 other Chinese names.<br><br>I pointed out that demanding
              true names was not being impudent or insulting at all. Although I
              cannot really say why this police officer from Central Police Station
              Vickneswaran s/o Sockalingam, Peter Koy and Judge James Leong were so
              determined to hide their full true names, I can make an intelligent
              guess. As they are aware that I write this blog, and that it is well
              read, and as there is a possibility that I may even write a book on
              this whole unhappy episode, they rather remain unknown to avoid
              embarrassment. They probably don’t want the world to know what they
              have to do for a living.<br><br>I had also pointed out that I had no
              respect for the Singapore judiciary which has been seen to be used as a
              political tool to silence dissent. I pointed out that it was not just I
              saying this but the respected International Bar Association in their
              recent 72-page report says just as much. As for remorse, I said I have
              none. As I have not committed any crime, how can someone expect me to
              have remorse? I told the judge that if it makes him happy, I could say
              I am sorry, but truly I am not; since it is impossible for someone to
              have remorse for a crime he did not commit. Saying sorry will therefore
              not do any good, neither for me nor for the judge. Just because the
              judge James Leong says I am guilty, does not make me so.<br><br>Mr.
              Koy, poor man was trying very hard to justify his claims. For instance
              he relied on a case PP vs. Daniel Lo Kiang Heong, 2007 SGDC 47, the
              facts being the defendant having gone to Devils Bar in Tanglin Road,
              got thoroughly drunk, shouted "baka" and "bakero" which meant “idiot”
              and “stupid bastard” in Japanese, of all languages, at police officers
              and when told to go home by them, showed his middle finger at them, and
              when arrested by a woman police officer, had bit her left breast for
              which she received medical treatment at Alexandra Hospital! This case
              was far more serious from anything that I was accused of. For one, I
              did not bite anyone, let alone a woman in her breast! Furthermore, even
              though the defendant in that case had acted in a very violent manner,
              he was asked to merely go home, when I was given no such opportunity,
              given the fact that I was Gopalan Nair.<br><br>Mr. Koy went on to refer
              to 2 more cases, which again had no relevance to mine at all, they
              being cases involving criminal breach of trust and credit card fraud.
              Mr. Koy was clearly clutching at straws to show that I should be
              severely punished.<br><br>I managed to refute these desperate
              challenges by Mr. Koy to paint me in bad light, but it did no good. I
              have no doubt in my mind, knowing how the legal system in Singapore
              works that the sentence imposed on me by the judge was already
              predetermined well before I walked into court. You see, it was not a
              criminal trial at all, but a political exercise from the start. The
              court was yet again being used by the Lee Kuan Yew dictatorship just as
              they have done for the entire history of Singapore since 1959, for a
              political purpose. It was to punish an openly known critic of the
              Singapore government so as to send a message to every other Singaporean
              that criticizing the government means trouble. And therefore they
              should not do it.<br><br>As for Mr. James Leong, I have this to say. I
              have begun to know him pretty well since it took 18 days of trial. He
              is a good man at heart; there is no doubt about it. If he had his way,
              there is no doubt he would have acquitted me immediately. But alas he
              is weak. He cuts a pathetic figure. A man, because of his
              circumstances, having to do things that he does not really want to do.
              He knows that his employment as a judge in the Singapore courts depends
              on the patronage of Lee Kuan Yew and his friends. He also knows that
              Lee demands his judges to punish political opponents of the government.
              And therefore to keep his job as a judge, he has no choice but to find
              me guilty. The sentence imposed upon me, and the timing of the dates of
              the sentencing were, in all probability, all decided for him by the
              Minister for Law in consultation with Lee Kuan Yew and his friends.<br><br>But
              I have to say this of Judge Leong. He was polite and treated me with
              respect throughout the trial. He was both courteous and decorous. I
              only wish one day, this man will have the courage of his conviction
              either to tell this government in no uncertain terms that he is not a
              politician, and if they wish dirty work to be done, they should find
              someone else. And if the government refuses, he should just walk out
              like a self-respecting man, with his head high on his shoulders and
              with his pride intact. Alas, that may be too much to ask in the fear
              ridden island of Singapore.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>Singapore</p>

              <p>I tell you what, let me suggest to you something even better. <br><br>Don't
              pay a single cent, and go to jail instead which means that the courts
              spent 18 days doing all the work but does not even receive a single
              cent! let alone $3000.<br><br>And when you go to jail, they will have to feed you. Which means that you have free accomodation and free meals!<br><br>So, the government gets no money and have to instead give you shelter and food, how does that sounds?</p>

              <p>The court should have fined you $180,000. Ten thousand for each day of their time wasted on you!<br><br>But
              even at $3000 I doubt you have the money topay up. And now you are

              <p>Hi. I've been reading your blog for quite some time, and to be
              honest, I've taken everything with a pinch of skepticism. I believe you
              will not blame me for that. Your argument seems valid (regarding your
              mistreatment in court), but whether it is sound, isn't something I can
              independently determine. But one thing you've said so far remains true.<br><br>There is fear in most of us. We declare ourselves anonymous (in the same way I have). <br><br>It is brave, what you've done, to be so open with your dissent. But is it really the best way? <br><br>Your
              blog has caused me to think much about Singapore's political scene.
              There was only one conclusion I came to: If there is to be change,
              there will be chaos. Fighting for change seems good. But the thing is,
              are we ready for it?<br><br>PS: This is not meant to be political. I'd
              debated long with myself if I should even post here. As I'd admitted, I
              am, to degrees, fearful.</p>

              <p>Dear Gopalan,<br><br>This sound like a fishing trip gone wrong for Singapore.<br><br>This
              case will only work with the frightened submissive Singapore voters

              lost your freedom to move around and was detained in Singapore for far
              longer than what you wanted. But, at least, you have a chance to show
              off your legal skills and create a deeper understanding of Singapore
              (which will put you in good strive for any up and coming book)<br><br>Singapore
              got to lose more. In the eyes of its citizens and ex-citizens, people
              are realising what happen even if they do not express them. As for LKY,

              <p>Hi Mr Nair,<br><br>Allow me to make several points:<br><br>1. The courts of any country are public institutions.<br><br>2.
              As public institutions, they are FULLY accountable to the public whose
              funds they use (or misuse as the case here obviously is).<br><br>3. ALL court proceedings are matters of THE PUBLIC RECORD.<br><br>4.
              As matters of the public record, all details during the proceedings are
              recorded as factual (i.e. as having occurred - that goes for false
              allegations made as well).<br><br>5. The actual identity of the
              prosecutor is a matter of the public record for if he or she is found
              to abuse his/her power, then the exercise of accountability kicks in.<br><br>It
              is for these reasons, that the full and actual name of the prosecutors,
              witnesses, AS WELL AS THE ACCUSED (i.e. you) are required.<br><br>But these are indeed the kangaroo courts, so nicknames, petnames, or even your mother's first boyfriend's names will be allowed.<br><br>So should your mother's first boyfriend's name if that is the name you wish to choose for the proceedings.</p>

              <p>I stumbled upon your blog and this is what i have to say.<br><br>Yes,
              the government may be corrupted. But you cannot deny that without such
              a government system in Singapore, Singapore would not have progressed
              to where it is today. In a set of rules and regulations, there are
              always people who benefit and people who lose out. I'm sorry to hear
              that your blogposts seems to say that you always seemed to be
              experiencing the latter.<br><br>Maybe it's time to start thinking, why
              is it always you? Why not some random people on the street, or even so
              - The judge James Leong. Why you?<br><br>I tell you why. Because you
              hold on strongly to your rights, to your believes. Because you refused
              to let go and have put your focused on the wrong things in life. You
              revolved your life around politics and when it seems as though the
              system outsmart you, you are deemed determined to oppose it and prove
              it wrong. But ask yourself, what's the point? So what if you managed to
              make the world know of what you believed that the Lee Family are doing
              are wrong? Nobody is going to appreciate you for it, or maybe if it
              makes you happier, maybe ten or twenty. But the majority of the people
              does not care, not because they are apathetic, but because there are
              more important things in life that are much more worth pursuing for.<br><br>Situations
              can continue to remain and not change, but it's your heart and attitude
              that can change to make things better. If you want miracles to happen
              (such as maybe for the downfall of Lee), you can pray for that to God.
              But the point is, there is no point of doing so.<br><br>Character is
              what is most important to survive in this world. Not what you believe,
              are your rights, and people should know. Learn to let go of your pride,
              and the world will be a much better place to live in.<br><br>Maybe what you need, is really God. Only in God, do you find the fulfillment in life that you longed for.<br><br>God bless you,<br>Amen</p>

              <p>You were probably born in the wrong country and it is good that you took yourself out of it.<br><br>You come across as so whiny in your blog. And yes, you can complain all you want in America. You can have that 'freedom'. <br><br>It
              is obvious that you have a personal vendetta against the Singapore
              government. That is why in all honesty, I don't respect what you write
              and I think most Singaporeans will take what you write with a huge
              tablespoon of salt. Because you don't have the greater good at heart.
              You believe in a concept of freedom that is self-serving. You portray
              yourself as some 'hero' to 'free' Singaporeans from some concept of
              'dictatorship'. <br><br>I am proud of what Singapore is and what
              Singapore has become. Without Lee Kuan Yew's transformation of
              Singapore, you, yes you, Gopalan Nair and the rest of Singapore would
              most likely still be stuck in some 'longkang' as a 3rd world country.
              And I am glad that Singapore does not have to call you Singaporean
              anymore, because you obviously don't have Singapore's best interests at
              heart. <br><br>Take your misplaced pride and go ahead and write your book.<br><br>Good
              luck. Empty vessels make the most noise. I dare you to print this in
              your blog comments, together with all the other 'praises' that you get.</p>

              <p><em>Yes, the government may be corrupted. But you cannot deny that
              without such a government system in Singapore, Singapore would not have
              progressed to where it is today.</em><br><br>One can only imagine how much <strong>more</strong> Singapore would have progressed without such a government system. Perhaps the brain drain wouldn't be this bad.</p>
