              <p>most of us have quite a bit of problems with savings, one ex colleague of mine used to borrow from me regular because he couldn't make ends meet.(he spends as much as he makes) i can't imagine 40 years down the road what he do without cpf.</p>
              <p>CPF itself is a good idea for most of us, and it provided a source of funds to the govt. if you allow people to put in bank and let them touch it it'll be gone for a lot of people very soon. so its sort of a win win initially.</p>
              <p>Andrewpkyap's saying also semi-correct minus the insults, it got twisted into something else that made people feel unhappy. can't say for sure who's correct but when you get lawS added that keeps money off your hands and surveys that say companies don't mind the cpf rather cost taken off elsewhere but govt say companies mind no need to consider elsewhere, can stir up a lot of negative feelings.</p>

              <p>CPF is our nation social safety net, it was mend for saving and buying of property.</p>

              <p>Today, there are more and more jobs under contract for service with foreign workers/talents/local professional/contractors who dun need employers to contribute CPF. It has become a hidden cost for employers, if employing Singaporeans, i need to contribute CPF, i rather employ a foreigner and pay levy, and if the foreigner is talented, no levy required.</p>
