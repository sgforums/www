Or is it because CPF policy is against human rights? Remember <span style="color: #003399; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">to compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.

              <p>Jealous and some trying to copy us? Please don't make
              us laugh. If the CPF system is so great other first world countries
              cannot implement? Or is it because CPF policy is against human
              rights? Remember <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #003399;"><span style="color: #000000;">to compel a man to furnish funds for the
              propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and
