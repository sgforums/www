              <p>Well, increased lifespan is a major factor.</p>
              <p>Not to mention if you have a increased lifespan, you're going to be hit by more dehabilating diseases and problems(kidney failure, diabetes, weak knees, high blood pressure, poor eye sight..etc). Which naturally leads to higher medical bills.</p>

              <p>I don't think the CPF was ever intended to be self sufficient on its own, it is at best a backup fund. If it's intended to serve as a guranteed amount against ill health, 20% + 13% from employers is not going to help if you're hit by say kidney failure, diabetes or an assortment of dehibilating diseases.</p>
              <p>How could you be so sure that the healthcare is artificially inflated? And surely it's not unreasonable to expect hospitals to be profitable, or how are they going to retain their stuff and upgrade their equipment?</p>
              <p>I question this because i've had to rush someone to the  SGH in the middle of the night 4 times. And each time we were dealt with promptly in an orderly fashion, and they were willing to bring the patient into the monitoring ward ahead of the queue. And it took around 30-60 minutes for the doctor to come out and explain to us what was wrong.</p>
              <p>Even the cost was acceptable, around 80 dollars including xray scans.Especially for a late night emergency.</p>
              <p>Even when i brought my mother for her annual eye check up in TTSH, normally they had to apply a dilating solution to the eye before the examination and my mother had to deal with blurred vision for several hours.</p>
              <p>Now all they had to do was apply another solution and my mother no longer had to deal with blurred vision. The results shows, because the waiting area is definitely more empty now.</p>
              <p>You only see the rising cost, but you have to experience yourself the rising quality of services as well. Constantly taking the worst case scenario off the newspaper hardly shows the actual stituation. Unless you're only willing to accept the truth you want to accept and unwilling to believe that others may think differently.</p>

              <p>Expected by whom? Certainly not by me at least.</p>
              <p>Canada has free universal healthcare, but it has natural resources to spare to pay for it. Europe has it as well, but they're already complaining about the heavy social costs for it.</p>
              <p>I never believed that good services can ever be free or even cheap. That's an oxymoron and makes no sense given that medical technology will always be improving and the staff has to be constantly upgraded.</p>
              <p>I won't comment on the HDB susidy issue. Because i've not experienced it myself and feel i'm not qualified to say anything on it.</p>

              <p>I can see the virtue in not changing. And i do believe that the PAP has to change itself to better fit the times. Picking high grade scholars and assuming that they're naturally better is a dangerous assumption.</p>
              <p>Regarding LKY and his dynasty, i do believe that he is 70% correct and 30% wrong (A quote from the CCP's account of Mao Tze Dong)</p>
              <p>However, i do not believe in this unreasonable fear of all powerful tyrants and i do NOT believe in having change for change's sake. </p>
              <p>Re-coloring of history will happen irregardless of what we do, because it's only the winners that can decide so. If an opposition takes over from the PAP THEY would be recoloring history the same way so they would look better next to the PAP as well.</p>
              <p>That is the nature of history, and yet you're speaking as if the PAP is an exception to this rule.</p>

              <p>Well done! I admire your courage, even if i personally think you lack the knowledge to know what you are complaining about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, please take an oath before our supreme court, and declare our society need not pity you if you go broke with your own way of investing your CPF fully drawn out, and we, as well as our future young generations, need not offer you any medical services or social care, not even cardboards for you to collect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And don't ever complain you had been shortchanged or ill-treated. You have made your choice, and sworn before society</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Be brave! Don't be like those foolhardy graduates who cursed and disparage their fellow citizens here and proudly left us, after years of our society providing for them, to other countries. And now with the crisis, quietly slinked back to our shores looking for jobs.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking i have attend quite a nos of international seminars with my daddy, and in term of welfare system, singapore CPF is an envy of many...they tried to copy our model, but failed due to corruption, system failure, riot, jobless, strike, and many other domestic problem that their welfare system can hardly work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For certain commonwealth countries, the like of Brits, Aussies, canadians, there are welfare system whereby if you are jobless, u can get a certain amount of  monthly welfare money from the govt. This system  encourages laziness, blaming culture, social stagnancy, lack of improvement and will to work. Today with the recession, more and more go jobless, and the this system is going to be a big big problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, thru such external exposure, i hv come to apprecaite our CPF system, it is one of it kind that help us in a social economical way. Others are just envy of it, and envy alway come with jealousy. </p>

              <p>To put it simply, the government thinks that we are not financially savvy to manage our own money. Only know how to spend right? That makes us FOOLS! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> We will never grow out of it when they keep asking us to pay them millions to NANNY us.

              <p><br>It 's like chewing gum. Some people do not know how to dispose properly and they came out with law to ban it completely which is like punishing those who like to eat chewing gum who would dispose it well. Why pay million when even fools can come out with that?</p>

              <p>Jealous and some trying to copy us? Please don't make us laugh. If the CPF system is so great other first world countries cannot implement? Or is it because CPF policy is against human rights? Remember <span style="color: #003399; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;">to compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.

              <p>Human rights? <strong>To deny</strong> providing to a saving funds, of which you will get back the principal with interests, which is used to help the disadvantaged and for social spending to elevate our society, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the right of a human?</span></p>
              <p><br>Sounds more like animal rights than human rights! It's frightening to see how haywired your thinking processes had become! Where did our education system went wrong with you?</p>
