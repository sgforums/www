              <p>I don't think the point is you can't be trusted to take care of yourself. The point is humans aren't exactly built to plan long term, the more money we have the more we're likely to spend more.</p>
              <p>Hell, i don't even trust myself to spend responsibly if i got more money. Once i got the money in the bank it's hard to avoid mixing up my needs and wants.</p>
              <p> I won't deny that the CPF is a pretty ingenious idea of the government to have a easy source of income. But it's not like we're banned from touching the money in it, we can still use it to pay off housing loans, use a portion of it for investments and paying our medical bills.</p>
              <p>I rather like the idea that i have money being saved and i'm restricted from touching it.</p>

              <p>I think you got it the wrong way around. CPF is a good thing for financially irresponsible people as it helps them save for retirement. For those who are financially responsible, it will be a bane instead as they can use their savings to do investments with better returns.</p>

              <p>CPF is not an ingenious idea of the PAP govt but an institutionalised social security system implemented the world over. Some governments (like in India) also offer life insurance as a similar long-term, rainyday financial protection. And in the US you have pension funds and 401 plans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the money is invariably invested in various instruments - where do you think the interest comes from?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CPF is a very useful cushion and could be seen as one way of the government giving money back to its citizens (because you can use it to pay bills, mortgages). Of course, like all sectors it could do with some reform.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We could start with fixed-term CPF schemes, wherein you have the option of signing up for a 20-year or 30-year tenure, albeit at a lower rate of interest or lower percentage of contribution. Imagine you start working at 22, with you and your employer contributing $300 a month - when you are 42, it would add up to more than 150K, which you can encash.</p>

              <p>I think you got it the wrong way around. CPF is a good thing for
              financially irresponsible people as it helps them save for
              retirement. For those who are financially responsible, it will be a
              bane instead as they can use their savings to do investments with
              better returns.</p>

              <p>Not in my opinion. If there was no CPF or similar system, people who did not save for their retirement (and there will be many) will need to be supported by the state, and it will be the tax payers that pay for this.</p>

              <p>You want the freedom of doing what you want in a society and then you expect society to be responsible for when you're irresponsible? How long can we sustain ourselves like that?</p>

              <p>It was based on good intentions but the agenda kind of got skewed and abused, it is now a cheap source of funds for GICs, GLCs and Temasek.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Someone once suggested (on Sintercom) that the CPF funds should be given directly to Temasek so that CPF members can get the 10%-20% returns that Temasek is generating. Think again, the government generates these returns from inflated prices it charges for basic necessities, if they use Temasek as an investment vehicle for CPF funds, then hefty electricity prices increases would make no sense; because after such price increases the money goes back to CPF members instead of to the government, which is the case with Singapore Power right now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
