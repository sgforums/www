              <blockquote>On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the full text of which appears in the following pages. Following this historic act the Assembly called upon all Member countries to publicize the text of the Declaration and "to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded principally in schools and other educational institutions, without distinction based on the political status of countries or territories."</blockquote>

              <p><em>PREAMBLE</em></p>
              <ul>
              <p>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,</p>
              <p>Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,</p>
              <p>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,</p>
              <p>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations,</p>
              <p>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,</p>
              <p>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,</p>
              <p>Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,</p>
              </ul>

              <p>It's not really much of a belief, even in America people borrow more than they could repay. Wisdom is only earned through hard lessons, wouldn't it be worse to assume everyone is going to spend their money wisely?  And sometimes, it may not even be due to their fault as demonstrated by the Lehman Brothers bonds.  </p>
              <p>Not really, but the work required to take care of those who do not handle their finances would be a ever increasing burden. It's far easier to get into bankruptcy, than to get out of it.  </p>
              <p>Well now, if a man ( and i intentionally use a male here) spends his money irresponsibly and blows it all. How is he going to pay for food/water/lodgings? He can't, so he has to be a begger/vagabond. </p>
              <p>Now, as like any decent society we don't want to see that happening on the streets  yes? So either the government or charity organisations have to step in to help him. They have to, because men with nothing to lose are willing to do anything even resorting to crime. And they would become a disruption to the running of the society.</p>
              <p>And thus, we have to pay for their mistakes. Humans are social creatures, what we do ultimately affects others.</p>
