The pay is really ridiculous for the size of the country and I don't see them doing much except raise prices. Reduce the number of ministers. Singapore don't need so many .<br><br>Maybe we can try outsourcing as suggested by siew91 of sintercom:<br><br>Outsourcing is now the buzz word for businesses around the world. Singapore govt is also adopting it in the various govt ministries. But PAP should take a step further and outsource its ministerial jobs. This would not only make good economic sense but mght leapfrog Singapore into Swiss standard of living.<br><br>The basic annual salary of Singapore minister is around US$655,530 to US$819,124 while that of the US President is only US$200,000. Singapore will, therefore, be able to save a tidy sum if PAP offshore the ministrial jobs to US. Singapore will even save a fortune if the jobs are relocated to PRC. The annual salary of PRC Chairman being only US$500. The savings made could then be used to pay for the utilities of the 3,000 households which live without electricity and water, or be doled out as relief to those who lost their jobs to structural changes in the employment landscape.<br><br>Besides cost saving, another reason for offshoring is to gain access to foreign market. If ministerial jobs were relocated to PRC, Singapore will gain an immediate foothold in China market. It would then not be necessary to spend millions developing bicultural elites to engage the potential world economic and political superworld.<br><br>To gain access to qualified personnel or services not available locally is yet another motivation to outsource. The unsatisfactory returns (1.7 to 4 per cent from 1999 to 2003) from the govt investment of Singapore reserves hinted that those govt assets managers are really not up to mark. Had the jobs been outsourced to Hong Kong, Singapore would be $17billions richer today.<br><br>With all the benefits derived from the outsourcing of ministrial jobs, Singaporeans then living in Swiss standard will definitely give PAP their 100% support!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ppl have said that I am anti govt, I'd like to tell everyone that I am only anti-idiot, not anti-govt. Its just a coincident that I seem anti-govt.<br><br>In keeping with the govt policies, I'd like to contribute some ideas for improving Singapore.<br><br>I think we should all support foreign talents. We should outsource all functions that takes our attention away from our core competency, making money.<br><br>Therefore we should outsource governance and defence to foreign talents! Hiring Gurkas is a step in the right direction! If we outsource the rest of our defence to Malaysia and Australia, many young men can be freed up to join the private sector.<br><br>We should also get foreign talents to take up top civil service positions like prime minister etc. After all, he high pay is meant to attract them right? Perhaps Clinton can be asked to run our country. He will be accept higher pay than if he was the President of the US, plus he would be able to contribute positively and concretely to the Romancing Singapore campaign. Of course we'll have to outsource our govt internship to PRC foreign talents too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>since the current policy of the govt is to cut cost and attract foreign talents,<br>why not have them at the ministeral level?<br>i'm sure they'll be paid less and doing a better job than the current govt that we have? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>as the govt says, singaporean is "picky in jobs and are paid too high".... hmm....<br>wad about them? hiriing of foreign "talents" will definitely save cost for singapore at their level is definitely going to save cost... i wonder how many millions will be save each year or maybe even billions<br><br>it's a way of cutting cost... wad do you guys think of it?<br></div>
