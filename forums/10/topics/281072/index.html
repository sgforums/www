            <div class='col-md body'>A group of women in Saudi Arabia is for the first time to lobby the kingdom's government for the right to drive cars.<br><br>Members of the Committee of Demanders of Women's Right to Drive Cars plan to deliver a petition to King Abdullah by Sunday, Saudi Arabia's National Day.<br><br>Correspondents say the demand is likely to be rejected, as conservatives argue if women are allowed to drive, they will be able to mix freely with men.<br><br>The issue of women driving has recently become the subject of public debate.<br><br>Two years ago, a member of the Consultative Council sparked a heated debate when he pointed out there was nothing under Islamic law or the constitution that justified the ban, and that the council ought to discuss ways of lifting it.<br><br>Mohammed al-Zulfa's comments later prompted the Saudi interior minister to dismiss calls for the ban to be lifted, saying the country had other priorities.<br><br>'Social issue'<br><br>The current driving ban applies to all women in Saudi Arabia, whatever their nationality.<br><br>It was originally unofficial, but became law after an incident in 1990, when 47 women challenged the authorities by taking their families' cars out for a drive.<br><br>After strong criticism from the Saudi religious authorities, the women were jailed for one day, their passports confiscated and many lost their jobs.<br><br>A founding member of the Committee of Demanders of Women's Right to Drive Cars, Fawzia al-Oyouni, said its electronic petition would highlight what many Saudi men and women consider a "stolen right".<br><br>"We would like to remind officials that this is, as many have said, a social and not religious or political issue," she told the Associated Press. "Since it's a social issue, we have the right to lobby for it."<br><br>"This is a right that has been delayed for too long."<br><br>King Abdullah has in the past said that he thought a day would eventually come when Saudi women were allowed drive.<br><br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7000499.stm<br><br>----<br><br><strong>Btw bear in mind that banning women from driving is a cultural practice under the pretext of religion. There are other Muslim majority countries where women are allowed to drive</strong><br><br>If we looked back in history, we will see clearly that these guys who signed the statement are the same kind of people who opposed King Faisal 30 years ago when he decided to start girlsÂ’ education in the country. They are using the same language, and the same lame excuses. What happened then? King Faisal said, Â“we will open the schools anyway, and if you donÂ’t want your daughters to study at our schools then donÂ’t let them.Â” King Faisal was a wise man. He did not weaken to those people, and today, more than 55% of students in Saudi universities are females."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure how the women rights are like over in Saudi. But I suppose if they are allowed to work and actually dared to protest, they won't kena honour killings. I mean, HOW DARE THEY, if their country is into honour killings?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I found Saudi hardcore Islamic authorities actions rather weird. They are just trying to maintain the high social standing of men by discriminating the women under the pretext of Islam.<br><br>This discrimination has existed for hundred and thousand of years. These Arab men are such losers. If we interpreted carefully, we will notice that some of the Islamic laws are pretty biases against the women. So who set the Islamic laws in the first place? Men.<br><br>Disclaimer: what I said is for topic of discriminations of Arab women. Nothing to do with Islam.</div>
