Could you please list the website where you get the information from regarding the purchase especially the clearance on the aquisition of the missiles such as AMRAAM and SLAM - ER. I am interested in finding out more about the MAF expansion. A distinction should be made between being cleared to acquire the weapons as stated and actually acquiring them. A example is the Malaysian submarine purchase. There has been statements that RMN is planning to acquire submarines over the years but it is only recently that subs were acquired. My point is that Malaysia track record of weapon acquisition often indicate a significant time lag between statement of intent and the actual signing of contract. What you posted only tells us that Malaysia has an interest in or is cleared to purchase certain weapons but did not say that they have been purchased. I believed the FA 18 part but i have some doubts about the JSOW and SLAM ER part.<br><br>2. It is an interesting contrasts between the SAF and MAF modernisation program. The MAF upgrades in spurts while the SAF prefers a gradual systematic approach.<br>A balance have to be achieved between force transformation and force readiness. There is only so much defence budget. Should your defence budget be mostly allocated to force transformation, you run the risk that due to lack of significant finances, force readiness may be compromised. Such a massive one time expenditure would also means that the defence spending will have to be toned down over the next few years and the implication would be that force technology currency might suffer due to non upgrade.<br>Would harimau comment on the combat readiness of MAF?<br>Singaporeans should be concerned about the MAF modernisation but they should also bear in mind the implication of such programs on other aspect of MAF. Personally i prefer the SAF method. It provide a finer balance between the 2 aspects i mentioned above<br><br>3. We should respond to Harimau post in  a mature dignified manner and should not stoop to the virulence of some of his post.<br><br>Harimau - a personal opinion on you. I think the malaysian malays have an inherent tendency to let their nationalism and ethnic egotism get into your judgement and thinking. The difference in the histronic level between the different language newspaper in Malaysia is an interesting insight into how the different races in your country think. I would like an opinion on something<br>If Jeyakumar went to KL for the next round of bilateral talks and ask for long postponement of meetings, refuse to attend the lunch that has been prepared by your ministry of foreign affairs, change their agenda totally, what would your opinion of him be? The only consistency I see in Malaysian foreign affairs is inconsistency<br></div></blockquote>Solaris,have we met before???<br>My sole intention -about MAF news and stuffs -simply to rectified some inaccuracies posted by most of the members of the boards regarding Malaysia defence posture and planning.<br>It is nice to be able to discuss things with those who really knows what's CBM is all about. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Not all of strategic and geopolitic procurement could be posted or found on the net.</div>
