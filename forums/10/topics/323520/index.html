              <p>Tuesday, 08 July 2008	
              
              
              <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/logo/IBA_logo.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br>Dr
              Chee Soon Juan has written to the Supreme Court to ask for the
              assessment for damages hearing to be reconvened (see letter below). The
              hearing took place in May 08 in which Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Lee Hsien
              Loong sued the Singapore Democrats for defamation. <br> <br>During the hearing, Mr Lee testified that the International Bar
              Association (IBA) had written to the Law Society of Singapore (LSS)
              complimenting Singapore on "how successful the meeting was and how
              impressed they were by the standards they found to obtain in the
              judiciary." (See <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-singapore/522-there-is-no-rule-of-law-in-singapore-audio-recording-2a">here</a>)<br><br>The
              Singapore Democrats have received information, however, that no such
              letter was written. Dr Chee wrote to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-singapore/592-transcript-confirms-yeongs-dishonesty">press secretary</a>, Madam Yeong Yoon Ying, to produce a copy of the letter that Mr Lee claimed the IBA had written.<br><br>Madam Yeong has yet to respond. We hope that she will without further delay.<br><br>This
              matter is of utmost importance as the information was presented under
              oath by the Minister Mentor during cross-examination by Dr Chee. Mr
              Lee's testimony will go towards the amount of damages to be awarded to
              him and his son.<br><br>The defendants wish to get to the bottom of the matter so that Judge Belinda Ang will have a clear picture of the incident.<br><br><strong>The sound of silence</strong><br><br>Meanwhile in the newsrooms, our press people all <em>buat bodoh</em> (feigning ignorance). Since the release of the information about the
              missing IBA letter, SPH has refused to report on the matter.<br><br>Usually
              at about this stage the press would kick into high gear. Calls would be
              placed to the IBA and the LSS to confirm the information. If one party
              was caught out, the entire matter would be splashed across the pages
              and the headline, analysis piece, followed by op-ed after op-ed would
              all crucify the guilty party. And you can be sure that no story would
              be run without an uncomplimentary photograph/caricature or two of the
              prey. <br><br>That is, if that party is the SDP. But in this case Mr Lee is the subject of the controversy. Hence the ear-splitting silence. <br><br>Note
              how the press managed to get a hold of Tunku Abdul Aziz of Transparency
              International-Malaysia and Dr Peter Eigen's office at the Transparency
              International, in double quick time, over the award that Mr Aziz gave
              to Mr Lee.<br><br>But over this IBA incident none of our journalists
              seem interested to do a follow-up. Think about it. A simple call to the
              IBA would confirm whether Mr Lee was right or not. And it's not like
              the LSS is in another time zone, its office is right smack in the
              middle of South Bridge Road. <br><br>Maybe they did call and found out something that they would rather not know.<br><br>But
              such is the kind of journalism that Singaporeans have had to live with
              for decades. It is not just a disservice to the public, it is a danger.<br><br><br><strong>Letter to the Supreme Court<br></strong><br>Registrar<br>Supreme Court<br>Singapore</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Court 4B: Judge Belinda Ang<br><br><em>Re: Suit Nos. 261 &amp; 262 of 2006</em><strong><br></strong><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>I
              would like to apply for the hearing in the above matter to be
              reconvened. This is because one of the plaintiffs, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, has
              given evidence that may not be accurate. <br><br>Specifically, Mr Lee
              testified under oath that there was a letter written by the president
              of the International Bar Association (IBA) to the Law Society of
              Singapore (LSS) praising the Judiciary. The IBA has denied that they
              had sent such a letter and has also confirmed that the LSS has not
              received any such letter. <br><br>As Mr Lee's evidence has great
              impact on the determination of the amount of damages to be awarded, it
              is imperative that the hearing be reconvened so that parties can get to
              the bottom of the matter.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Chee Soon Juan</p>

              <p>Rule of law he has aluded to so often to international audience clearly means justice must be done and seen to be done and those who accuse others should themselves come to the court to seek justice without blood stains on their own hands.</p>

              <p><em><strong><span class="title">''Request to reconvene is frivolous: Davinder </span></strong></em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <div id="articleBody" class="artText"><span> OPPOSITION politician Chee Soon Juan has asked the Supreme Court to
                  reconvene a hearing on the assessment for damages relating to a
                  defamation suit to be reconvened, alleging that Minister Mentor Lee
                  Kuan Yew “has given evidence that may not be accurate”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              H:owever, the request has been described as “frivolous and misleading” by Mr Lee’s lawyer, Senior Counsel Davinder Singh.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In his letter dated July 8, Dr
                  Chee pointed to Mr Lee’s reference during the May court hearing that
                  the president of the International Bar Association had written a letter
                  to the Law Society of Singapore, praising the Judiciary.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              However, Dr Chee, said both
                  organisations had denied the existence of such a letter. Since Mr Lee’s
                  evidence has “great impact” on the amount of damages to be awarded, “it
                  is imperative that the hearing be reconvened”, Dr Chee added.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In his reply to the Supreme
                  Court’s Registrar yesterday, Mr Singh described Dr Chee’s request as
                  “frivolous” because “the views of the International Bar Association
                  about our Judiciary have absolutely no bearing on the question of
                  damages”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The “only reason” that Mr Lee
                  had referred to the IBA’s endorsement “was to demolish” Dr Chee’s
                  “baseless suggestion in open court that there is no rule of law in
                  Singapore”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr Singh noted that Dr Chee
                  had, in his letter, “sought to convey the false impression that,
                  contrary to Mr Lee’s evidence, the IBA did not praise the Singapore
                  Judiciary”. In fact, Mr Singh added, “as was the point of Mr Lee’s
                  evidence, the IBA stated that our Judiciary is outstanding’.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr Singh noted that IBA
                  president Fernando Pombo, in his speech at the opening of the
                  grouping’s conference in Singapore on Oct 14 last year, had said that
                  Singapore was picked as the venue for the meeting because of its
                  “outstanding legal profession, an outstanding judiciary and an
                  outstanding academic world in relation to the law”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “The only inaccuracy in Mr
                  Lee’s testimony was his statement that the IBA had conveyed this view
                  in a letter to the Law Society of Singapore, whereas it was actually in
                  a public speech by the IBA president.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “If anything, Mr Lee’s

                  excellence of our Judiciary,” Mr Singh said. Dr Chee’s “desperate
                  hunger for publicity to make a false point will only serve to waste the

              <p> “The <span style="color: #ff0000;">only inaccuracy in Mr Lee’s testimony was his statement that the IBA had conveyed this view in a letter to the Law Society of Singapore, whereas it was actually in a public speech by the IBA president.</span>.</p>
              <p> “If anything, Mr Lee’s testimony did not do enough justice to the fact an international organisation like the IBA was prepared to and did publicly endorse the excellence of our Judiciary,” Mr Singh said. Dr Chee’s “desperate hunger for publicity to make a false point will only serve to waste the Court’s time.”</p>

              <p>Having admitted that LKY was not right or inaccurate in saying he has received a letter from IBA in this manner in a court testimony, will be correct the inaccuracy will he recognise that this is now a court case and it is up to the judge and not his own council to decide whether this inaccuracy was material or immaterial to such a hearing of defamation suit against CSJ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember, LKY has refused to let Gomez get away from legality over a election nomination form. If he wants rule of law then he himself must show he is also subjected to the same rule of law.</p>
