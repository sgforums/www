            <div class='col-md body'>It is better we know '' Malaysia is not a secular state but an Islamic nation with its own interpretation.''<br><br>So we know MY mind set.<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.php?id=273699" rel="nofollow">  General<br>July 17, 2007 12:15 PM 	 ,Malaysia Not Secular State, Says Najib<br></a></strong>---http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.php?id=273699<br><br><blockquote>KUALA LUMPUR, July 17 (Bernama) -- Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said Tuesday Malaysia is not a secular state but an Islamic nation with its own interpretation.<br><br>He said the country had never been affiliated to secularism but was always driven by the fundamentals of Islam as it is clearly stated in the constitution that Islam is the official religion.<br><br>"Islam is the official religion and we are an Islamic state. But as an Islamic state, it does not mean that we don't respect the non-Muslims. The Muslims and the non-Muslims have their own rights (in this country)," he told reporters after officiating the "International Conference on the Role of Islamic States in a Globalised World" on behalf of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi at a hotel here.<br><br>The conference is organised by the Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (Ikim). Ikim chairman Tan Sri Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid and director-general Dr Syed Ali Tawfik Al-Attas were present.<br><br>Najib was asked whether Malaysia was seemingly moving towards being a secular state.<br><br>"I have to correct you. We have never been secular because being secular by Western definition means separation of the Islamic principles in the way we govern a country.<br><br>"We have never been affiliated to that position. We have always been driven by our adherence to the fundamentals of Islam. So, your premise is wrong," he said.<br><br>Najib said Malaysia does not want to be stereotyped with the Western definitions of a secular and a non-secular state.<br><br>The two-day conference beginning today aims to discuss specifically the strategic modus operandi of revitalising the Muslim ummah in the global context, particularly through a system of education, to harness quality human capital.<br><br>Earlier, Najib launched a book entitled "The Ijazah of Abdullah Fahim" authored by Mesut Idris and Syed Ali and published by MPH Group Publishing. It is available at major bookstores at RM59.90 per copy.<br><br>-- BERNAMA </blockquote>2.<strong><a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/18/nation/18330625&amp;sec=nation" rel="nofollow">Wednesday July 18, 2007<br><br>BN and PAS differ on Islamic state</a></strong><br><blockquote>KUALA LUMPUR: While the Federal and PAS governments claim that Malaysia and Kelantan are Islamic states, their versions differ.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said Malaysia is an Islamic state that adheres to the fundamentals of Islam, and having a Constitution which states Islam as the official religion.<br><br>Asked about the difference between the Islamic state led by the Federal Government and the one led by PAS, Najib said: Â“PAS has their version and we have our own interpretation. We have never been a secular state,Â” he said.<br><br>Najib said that being an Islamic state did not mean that the rights of non-Muslims were not respected.<br><br>Â“It does not mean that we donÂ’t protect the rights of non-Muslims,Â” he told reporters after officiating the Â“The Role of Islamic States in a Globalised WorldÂ” seminar.<br><br>Najib also launched a book The Ijazah of Abdullah Fahim by Mesut Idris and Syed Ali Tawfik Al-Attas.<br><br>Abdullah Fahim was the grandfather of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.  </blockquote>3.Pl reply with extra care and in a mature way.<br>This is MY domestic affairs.We know their thinking is good<br>enough.Pl dunt say it is good or bad.<br><br>4.<strong><a href="http://www.sinchew.com.my/content.phtml?sec=1&amp;artid=200707175092" rel="nofollow"><br>the first three Prime Ministers of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tun Razak and Tun Hussein Onn fully supported a secular Malaysia with Islam as the official religion but not an Islamic state;</a></strong>---http://www.sinchew.com.my/content.phtml?sec=1&amp;artid=200707175092<br><br>5.<strong><a href="http://www.dapmalaysia.org/english/lks/aug03/lks2557.htm" rel="nofollow">the majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims in the world live in secular systems and not in Islamic states.</a></strong>---http://www.dapmalaysia.org/english/lks/aug03/lks2557.htm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, TAR was essentially a secularist. UMNO is also a secularists party.<br><br>Mahathir declared islam a national religion to earn some islamic credentials to take on PAS. Thats was a mistake for msia.<br><br>Najib himself isn't much of a muslim. But he is playing the islamic credentials card just like Mahathir though he is not crazy like mahathir.<br><br>Let me assure you that msia will not turn fundie as long as UMNO is in power. UMNO will never give up power and will do anything to stay in power and they have the support of the police, army, malay elites and youths and minorities.<br><br></div>
