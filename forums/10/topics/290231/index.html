            <div class='col-md body'>Chia Ti LikÂ’s Blog<br><a href="http://chiatilik.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://chiatilik.wordpress.com/</a><br><br>Think, peopleÂ… think.<br>November 6th, 2007 Â· No Comments<br><br>2nd November 2007 was a nice day, I woke up feeling good and heard the presses roll. Several phone calls came in. It transpired that my esteemed friend Ng E-Jay had written a letter to the press and it was published. I took hold of the papers as more phone calls came in.<br><br>Interestingly, this was a letter which spoke the hearts of many. Of a wish for an opposition that stood up fearlessly and stood up in a principled manner. I looked through my papers and realised that it was a good start. When I started this blog Party in November 2006, I had then left the WorkersÂ’ Party. At roughly the same time, I clashed with a Sammyboy forumer Ng E-Jay over my strongly worded opinion of how internet engagements ought to take place. One year down, this critic has turned brother and more politically aware and since the mid of 2007, I have begun to see the sparkle of a jewel.<br><br>The letter of 2nd November 2007 was a wake up call for me. I have not been keeping up with the political scene and this little brother had been doing a good job. A damn good job in fact. It ought to have been a good wake up call for certain people. Was it taken as a wake up call? Apparently not.<br><br>It is strange how sometimes, dreams of grandeur can prevent people from looking in the mirror to find their own faults. Instead, everyone else except themselves are blamed. More often than not, a rational critic reflecting flaws to a person or a group ends up getting seriously muddied, ostracized and character assassinated.<br><br>6th November 2007, I woke up today to a number of amusing postings by many sammyboy forumners (some clonic) attacking the Singapore Democratic Party with suggestions that its partyÂ’s supporters were involved in the public backlash against the WorkersÂ’ Party with even more absurd suggestions that the former intended to discredit the latter.<br><br>Think, people, think. If people had put some thought into it before speaking:<br><br>1. Low Thia Khiang would not have been so sorely rebutted by Ho Peng Kee for his cycling along east coast debate.<br><br>2. Sylvia Lim would not have uttered words at the International Bar Association Conference for which she is so heavily criticised for.<br><br>3. Low Thia Khiang would not have given such antagonising interviews to LianHe ZaoBao and the Straits Times on 31st October 2007and 1st November 2007.<br><br>4. The up and coming WorkersÂ’ Party would not have placed itself in such a conundrum.<br><br>5. There would not have been such a public backlash against the WorkersÂ’ Party.<br><br>Think, people, think. If things were so simple as to point a finger towards others. Would there be more than meets the eye?  Or are you eagerly repeating history again?<br><br>Ti Lik<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It isn't my wish to downplay a fellow oppositionist; however, somehow, I find a couple points inherently incongruent, with due respect. Allow me to address them with the attempt not to take sides.<br><br>Firstly, the writer appears to applaud a letter in ST Forum. Granted that was written by someone invariably close. However, it is noted that many critical of the PAP have at points of time mocked the Straits Times for its 141st rankings when they refuse to publish certain information of the opposition.<br><br>Secondly, Low Thia Khiang was "sorely rebutted" by Ho Peng Kee for his pugnacity over WP's cycling event, which a permit was not granted. Whatever the outcome has a bearing on other party's activities and the civil society as a whole. Yet, it appears unappreciated and has been felt that the Minister had made a good rebuttal.<br><br>Anyway, I shall cease here and hope this is taken as a freedom of expression on my part and by no means to disparage. I also wish everyone in opposition politics good luck.<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What has Chia Ti Lik spoken up on since the general elections? Lets look at his blog: <a href="http://chiatilik.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://chiatilik.wordpress.com/ </a><br><br>Digital cameras, wires and cables, hi fi speakers, little girl lose toes in escalator, etc. And now he is making noise about other people? I would like to see Chia Ti Lik give us an alternative solution to REAL problems - such as our traffic/transport problems, creating and maintaining jobs, CPF funds, ageing population, etc.<br><br>Can he do it? If not, then he is really Mr Hindsight Chia. All talk, do f*** off.</div>

Go ask around and see how "well known" Chia Ti Lik is. You are probably the only moron who think that. You must be his gay lover, NgEjay from Sammyboy forum who has been exposed as a liar.</div>
