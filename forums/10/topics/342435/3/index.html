              <p>It's the belief that drives people like CSJ and the late JBJ
              on...</p>
              <p>I mean.. look at JBJ.. God bless his soul.. he was a rich lawyer
              who had everything... but when he finally decided to speak out his
              beliefs and point out the flaws of our government, he was silenced,
              bankrupted and kicked out of parliament.</p>
              <p>JBJ could have left long ago. But he chose not to. I guess he
              knew full well that S'poreans are generally not as empowered. After
              what walesa said, being spoon-fed propaganda and all. JBJ wasn't
              doing this for himself. He was doing it for all we chicken-hearted
              S'poreans afraid of losing everything and being jailed for our
              beliefs.</p>
              <p>It's the same with CSJ. Back when he just returned to Singapore
              in 1990 he was a lecturer at NUS.. he had a car, happily married
              and a healthy income. After he got first got sued in 1993..(i might
              be wrong) he could have jolly well packed-up and go, but he stayed
              on, for the same reason. Even until now, with 3 kids, he still does
              it.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Because like JBJ, he knows S'poreans still need that extra push
              to empower themselves.</span></p>

              which</p>
              <p>was based on CIA figures.Both of them do not mention CIA.</p>
              <p>In fact,they are just damn wrong.CIA mean the opposite---</p>
              <p>Both countries were facing highest incoming migration</p>
              <p>per 100,000 in the world!East Timor just enjoyed peace,</p>
              <p>while SG was enjoying booming enconomy and huge influx</p>
              <p>of foreign students.If anyone has been  traveling MRT every

              <p>If so,pl send to Chee or past to him tonight!!</p>
              <p>The fact is HDB stopped building 3 room flat (2 bed rooms ) and
              below</p>
              <p>in 1980's.HDB started rebuild them in around 2004 becos of</p>

              <p>--------more unmarried single and widow/er!!</p>

              <p><em>It was reported today that the Government is building more
              two- and three-room flats because they are presently in demand.
              Two-room flats are those with a living room and one bedroom. The
              sale price for such a new flat starts at $76,000. What this really
              means is that Singaporeans are getting poorer and unable to afford
              bigger flats. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">few years ago the
              Government was saying that it would phase out</span> the smaller
              flats because Singaporeans were moving into 4- and 5-room flats as
              they got richer. What happened?<br> <br> There is only one answer: Singaporeans are getting poorer. The HDB
              tells us that "there are more people who will need to downgrade to
              smaller flats, as well as first timer families who would also like
              to start with smaller flats to be financially prudent."</em></p>

              <p>Can the noisy pussy know more about Singaporeans than the politicians like Chee Soon Juan ?</p>

              <p>In his book "A Nation Cheated", CSJ had produced little known facts that were hidden since the late 1950s - which seems to have been ignored by noisy pussy.</p>

              <p>Chee Soon Juan’s new book <em>A Nation Cheated</em> touches on the official history of Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP.  <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/997-has-singapore-been-cheated"><span style="color: #da1071;">CSJ’s speech, as quoted on the SDP website:</span></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><em>The picture that emerged was one not quite the story that I heard and read growing up. In a nutshell, the Professor’s [Tim Harper] account was that the people of Singapore wanted Lim Chin Siong as their leader but the British would not allow it and wanted Lee Kuan Yew instead.</em></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So we have two versions of what happened: one written written by a disinterested, third-party academic and based on verifiable de-classifed papers, and the other by Lee Kuan Yew who still has vested personal interests in telling these events. I do not think I would be far wrong if I say that the majority of people would look to the former for a more accurate and objective account of that part of history.</p>
