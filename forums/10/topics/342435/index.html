              <p>Some times,i am wandering if Chee Soon Juan still living in SG!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chee quoted SG was losing people</span></strong></p>
              <p>Last time was he quoted SG emigration(outgoing) was the second worst in the world,</p>
              <p>right after East Timor.Chee quoted a western professor article which</p>
              <p>was based on CIA figures.Both of them do not mention CIA.</p>
              <p>In fact,they are just damn wrong.CIA mean the opposite---</p>
              <p>Both countries were facing highest incoming migration</p>
              <p>per 100,000 in the world!East Timor just enjoyed peace,</p>
              <p>while SG was enjoying booming enconomy and huge influx</p>
              <p>of foreign students.If anyone has been  traveling MRT every day</p>
              <p>in SG  in the past few years,he should note the train get more</p>
              <p>crowded.But  Chee did not take note!!</p>
              <p>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2112rank.html</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now Chee said HDB stopped building small HDB flats few years ago</strong></span></p>
              <p>He said--</p>
              <p><em> "A<span style="color: #ff0000;"> few years ago the Government was saying that it would phase out</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">the smaller flats..."</span> </em></p>
              <p>I think Chee  really need to polish his knowledge in Social Studies.</p>
              <p>Do u guys have any spare old text books,primary or secondary?</p>
              <p>If so,pl send to Chee or past to him tonight!!</p>
              <p>The fact is HDB stopped building 3 room flat (2 bed rooms ) and below</p>
              <p>in 1980's.HDB started rebuild them in around 2004 becos of</p>
              <p>----aging population</p>
              <p>--------more unmarried single and widow/er!!</p>
              <p>I admit more people look for smaller units becos of down turn.</p>
              <p>How can a potential Prime Minister of Singapore make this kind</p>
              <p>of mistake?He just said the opposite!!</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>The above two are not small mistakes.</p>
              <p>It shows Chee did not take note of what are happening in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He just quote without thinking and to vertify.</p>
              <p>My English is not a good example.I do dare say my facts and figures</p>
              <p>are pretty correct.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>Pl ask Chee some questions about SG tonight.See if he can answer it!!</p>
              <p>Yes.Tonight is also exam time of Social Studies for SDP!!</p>

              <p><em>It was reported today that the Government is building more two- and
                  three-room flats because they are presently in demand. Two-room flats
                  are those with a living room and one bedroom. The sale price for such a
                  new flat starts at $76,000. What this really means is that Singaporeans
                  are getting poorer and unable to afford bigger flats. 
                  A<span style="color: #ff0000;"> few years ago the Government was saying that it would phase out</span> the smaller flats because Singaporeans were moving into 4- and 5-room
                  flats as they got richer. What happened?<br><br>There is only one
                  answer: Singaporeans are getting poorer. The HDB tells us that "there
                  are more people who will need to downgrade to smaller flats, as well as
                  first timer families who would also like to start with smaller flats to
                  be financially prudent." </em></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He is one of the few that understood the problem with the Singapore economy before the present crisis. No hindsight here, see: (</span><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/320112"><span style="font-weight: bold;">http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/320112</span></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One of the biggest issues is the high costs of doing business in Singapore. The despots know but the greedy<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Sg despots of the PAP</span> care more about their own pockets, the pockets of their crelatives, cronies and dogs than the economy of Singapore and the welfare of Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr Chee Soon Juan led a protest against the high costs </span>and what did the despots do? They arrested him and his fellow activists instead of lowering the costs <span style="color: #ff0000;">(they refused and arrested them because it is not to their advantage to lower even when it is crucial to do it for the welfare of the Singapore economy.)</span></span></p>

              <p><br>Sure, Uncle Chee knows about the in and out of singapore courts, the prisons, the prison foods, the toilets and all those short cut road of singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of confronting the despots, many viewed him as not clever enuf. A clever politician will not go against a high hand ruling govt, instead, he should hv join PAP, climbed the ministry level to the top, become PM and then execute his plan to ouster PAP. Uncle Chee is too impatient, that's why, he failed....misearably...les miserables</p>

              <p>Haha. Sad to say, he's still in Singapore. Saw him twice with his daughter. </p>
              <p>He got brains and plans, but is too aggressive in attacking pap gov.. and obviously they want to counter his insinuating comments by shutting him up la. But then again, I think with at the right time and when he's all ready (and with less protests but more support), I don't think he's any way off lousier in capability as compared to lky's pm son. </p>

              <p>Shall I say that politics is ultimately a dirty game?</p>
              <p>The two sides will stop at nothing, I emphasise, <strong>NOTHING</strong>, in their bid to drag the others down.</p>
              <p>I am not defending the regime. They are far from angelic. They have serious shortcomings which deserve to be fixed as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>However, Dr CSJ is not an angel either. He is branding his one-man-political-circus into political struggle but knowing full well that most Singaporeans glean nothing but entertainment from seeing him knock his head against the wall so many times.</p>
              <p>It is one thing about struggling. It's another to brand futility as an "ongoing struggle".</p>
              <p>A smart person will keep using his head to try to knock the wall down. A smarter one will bring it down from within or enlist the help of something (e.g. dynamite).</p>
              <p>All in all, politics is a dirty game. No side is faultless. Why bother siding with one side unequivocally when you just paper over and turn a blind eye to any faults on your favoured side?</p>
              <p>In turning a blind eye to faults, aren't you being similar to the regime which you are trying to bring down in the first place?</p>

              <p>if he knew singapore, he should know that singapoeans are genetically "hum chee" and are therefore unwilling to risk whatever they already have, however little it might be, for some lofty ideals. we have good food, good housing, "good" education now, so why risk it?</p>

If he wants to openly insult and criticize LKY and his governement you don't need an biased court to send him to jail.
