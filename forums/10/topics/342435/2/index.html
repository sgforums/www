              <p>Speaking without a brain?</p>
              <p>How should I say?</p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that most of the things he is doing has not been thought through thoroughly enough, or what most of us will colloquailly term as "not using a brain".</p>
              <p>In my personal opinion, if he bothered to think through, he will know that civil disobedience will not bring about desired tangible outcomes. Even though people may agree with what he says, they face difficulty in channelling that agreement into support for him simply because the methods in which he brought up issues are simply to antagonistic.</p>
              <p>Getting yourself bankrupt is definitely not the best way to show political survivability when those money could have been better used to improve his party or his platforms. Instead he found himself in hot soup/lawsuits with the regime because he tends to be too honest about certain things. Regime becomes unhappy and sues him. He is ordered to pay. He becomes bankrupt. His SDP lacks funds and its reputation takes a dive with his reputation.</p>
              <p>Now, let's chunk the issue of judicial independence/fairness aside for the moment. A skilled/shrewd politician will know when to play which cards. When the moment calls for silence, he will not utter a single comment. Civil disobedience is different from political survival. Want to see political survival? Check out how Wen Jia Bao survived the 1989 Tiananmen Incident and rose to be China's Premier today. Does Dr CSJ know when to shut up? Hardly so. If he does not know when to shut up, is he speaking with his brains then? Biologically yes, but figuratively, metaphorically, antologically and morally, he is not.</p>
              <p>In short, he speaks without using his brains because he does not know when to speak and how to speak. You can fight for the most just cause ever but without the correct tactics or strategy, you are just sending yourself to slaughter.</p>
              <p>Is there any wonder why Chiam See Tong left SDP when he had a dispute with Dr CSJ? Yes those who admire Dr CSJ close to a degree that resembles a worship, you will brand Chiam See Tong as being "too soft" or "too meek" to stand up to the regime. To me, he represents the shrewd politician who is able to survive as an opposition in spite of the policies which are significantly unfriendly towards the opposition.</p>
              <p>Is Dr CSJ then comparable to people like Mandela, Gandhi or Martin Luther King? Hardly so. Those people were smarter because they were able to mobilise widespread support through the correct actions. Do we see a similar degree of support for Dr CSJ in Singapore today?</p>
              <p>All in all, the above represents my personal opinion.</p>
              <p>For those who are displeased because I said something negative about Dr CSJ, go ahead and label me a "PAP dog". I have only 2 things to say to you. First, your close-mindedness to criticisms of Dr CSJ is nowhere better than the close-mindedness of the regime to criticisms. Next, I don't believe that the regime is flawless. Just that we need to know <strong>HOW</strong> to fix it even though we may already know <strong>WHAT</strong> to fix.</p>
              <p>For those who are more rational, I hope this gives an insight into what I think is hindering Dr CSJ from ever achieving the ideals which he holds dear and fights so fervently for. That is the reason why I will never support him unconditionally.</p>

              <p>To be fair, as things stand, Chee probably offers the best hope of toppling this dictatorship.</p>
              <p>Let's set the record straight on some points - Chee isn't wrong to envisage civil disobedience being an effective tool to trouble a despotic regime; if anything, his mistake stems from assuming a bunch of ill-informed, misguided, propaganda-fed, delusion-induced citizenry would achieve the feats through civil disobedience (which requires the cooperation of the masses to be effective) in the same manner the populace under the illustrious leaderships of Ghandhi, Walesa, King and Mandela did. That said, it hardly renders Chee brainless to engage in his actions - after all, Aung San Suu Kyi (and hordes of others worldwide) is in the same boat; what separates the latter from the former (Ghandhi, Walesa, King, Mandela) is the end-result of which the struggle is an inevitable by-product. To drive home this point, would you therefore be labelling the likes of Ghandhi, Walesa, King and Mandela as brainless if their titanic efforts had not been successful?</p>
              <p>More importantly, the concept of being effective in the conventional sense of the word hardly crosses Chee's mind - he doesn't give a damn about winning an election; neither does he care about becoming a Prime Minister someday. If anything, he's more interested in toppling this regime than reaping the benefits of his labour (you could always argue he's cut out to be an activist, but not a politician; that said, that is probably what this regime needs now). In that regard, while it's probably fair to suggest Chee is the last man you'd bet on toppling this regime through the electoral process dictated by this regime, he probably offers a much likelier bet of bringing about a lasting democratic change.</p>
              <p>After all, for all the civility and diplomacy Chiam offers (as opposed to Chee), what hope can you realistically pin on what is effectively a toothless sycopant who is a hopeless political strategist? For all his rhetoric about the merits of running a "by-election" campaign in the past (where he openly encouraged the electorate to vote for the opposition by ceding power to the fascists on nomination day), what has he achieved - or for that matter, is there anything to suggest he even has more to offer than Chee? - in terms of empowering the opposition? While you could pin the blame for the opposition's poor showing on a shambolic electoral process and a substantial bunch of misinformed electorate who aren't necessarily empowered to make an informed decision, Chiam's failed campaigns clearly reinforce the notion that - as Chee rightly points out - you don't vote out dictatorships (and this is a trend observed the world over).</p>
              <p>What are the chances of Chiam bringing about the long-lasting democratic changes he so vehemently champions (albeit through a conciliatory and accommodating tone in line with what the regime expects) through an electoral process that takes on farcical proportions? As likely as having a monkey type out the complete works of Shakespeare if you asked me...</p>

                  neurologist! He's qualified to operate on brains and make big money
                  out of it. But what is he doing?</p>
              <p>Regardless of the results, anyone will have to salute him. If I
                  were in his shoes, and the country and its media took a collective
                  shit on my head, I would've emigrated ages ago and give myself, and
                  my family a very, very comfortable life.</p>

              <p>It's the belief that drives people like CSJ and the late JBJ on...</p>
              <p>I mean.. look at JBJ.. God bless his soul.. he was a rich lawyer who had everything... but when he finally decided to speak out his beliefs and point out the flaws of our government, he was silenced, bankrupted and kicked out of parliament.</p>
              <p>JBJ could have left long ago. But he chose not to. I guess he knew full well that S'poreans are generally not as empowered. After what walesa said, being spoon-fed propaganda and all. JBJ wasn't doing this for himself. He was doing it for all we chicken-hearted S'poreans afraid of losing everything and being jailed for our beliefs.</p>
              <p>It's the same with CSJ. Back when he just returned to Singapore in 1990 he was a lecturer at NUS.. he had a car, happily married and a healthy income. After he got first got sued in 1993..(i might be wrong) he could have jolly well packed-up and go, but he stayed on, for the same reason. Even until now, with 3 kids, he still does it. Because like JBJ, he knows S'poreans still need that extra push to empower themselves.</p>

              <p>As what i mentioned earlier, JBJ and CSJ lack that witty ideologies to bring PAP to their knees, they do not understand that an egg can never win a rock. They should join the rock, mould themselve to be solid and better than the rock so as to become a diamond, then they can turn around and challenge the rock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our oppositions alway claim that PAP are cunning and witty, but that is politic at it very best. As an opposition, you should be more cunning and witty inorder to beat them. But sad to say that our opposition are too straightforward and fail to know their enemy well before engaging them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at terrorism of 911, the pilot joined the US airforce, learn the trade, joined the commercial airline and finally fulfil his obligation he set out for...patience, endurance and tolerance is the key to success.</p>

              <p><br>the opposition should at first submit themselve to PAP, join them, learn from them, know their secret, learn their trade, make them trust you, then get promoted to higher PAP govt position, from there, slowly change to concept of governing, gather strenght and support and once the time is ripe, perform a coup de grace, bring down the PAP, and raise the hammer flag.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>To facillitate change, one needs to  be a leader, with a clear manifesto and get elected. This generation is no longer the uneducated generation our forefathers were. Sloganism is dead. Accountability and true capability is wanted. Once elected, he only needs to work on his electorate on municipal issues to show that he is capable of small things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF not, then there is no credibility on his worth to move on to loftier issues affecting the nation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he cannot even get elected, it already shows one's capability. A leader has no excuses, otherwise, anyone one of us would be a hero and get generations later to worship each and everyone of us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's beating the odds and coming out ontop and staying on top with sound policies that makes one a hero, worthy of respect and emulation for generations such as Dr Goh Kweng Swee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Going to jail stupidly, going against society's rules, going against the electorate, making wild allegations without real evidence is no hero. Heaven forbide, others following his example!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My 2cts worth. am never interested in politics, cause whomever gets elected, i still have to pay taxes.</p>
