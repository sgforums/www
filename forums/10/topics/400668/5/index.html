              <p>1) This is not about side tracked. You have yet to say which sentence implied.</p>
              <p>Don't tell me you don't have the basic ability to finish one thing before starting on the next?</p>
              <p><strong>Which sentence did I imply about 2.5%.</strong> I'm still waiting. As long as you cannot show the sentence or post, you are basically just talking rubbish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) My chat was primarily with Calvin. Who were the people we were referring to?</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about something else related to the thread, but totally unrelated to my discussion with Calvin, sorry, I'm not interested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) It's not even technical analysis. You raised statistics via your so called research. I showed you back statistics.</p>
              <p>Get your facts right. Oh ya, wonder if you could read. I have already mentioned the word statistics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Your sentences are all out of point. There's no point to start tackling at all because they don't even fit the point of contention here. And sorry, I'm not insulting you. I merely state a fact of you that you admitted too. How is that insult?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) You missed the whole point because we are talking about GIC being able to earn 8% and pocketing the difference of 5%. You tell me whether they can secure 8% is irrelevant.</p>
              <p>How much more out of point can you get?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) Geez, which post was I referring to the OA at all? All along, I was referring to the SA.</p>
              <p>And I have already told you the OA isn't even worthy of comparison.</p>
              <p>Out of context yet again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vague explanations? I didn't even bother to explain to you unlike to Calvin because all your points aren't even into what my discussions were with him. There wasn't even any explanations, so I can't even see how you could see vague explanations.</p>
              <p>If you like to start on something else that isn't related to my discussion with Calvin, I have already told you I'm not interested.</p>

              <p>That is true to a limited extent. Many people for the past 10 years have had their HDBs paid up and they have balances of hundreds of thousands in there. It makes a difference. If you're talking about the newer generation in the era of super high HDB prices, then I would say your words apply.</p>
