              <p>The CPF board has consistently said it only invests funds in "risk-free" government bonds and bank deposits, but both opposition and PAP politicians have contradicted those claims. Opposition politicians, including Low Thia Khiang, have questioned whether the funds paid into the CPF actually provide a de facto cheap source of finance for GIC in particular to invest abroad.<br><br>GIC officially acknowledges that it invests overseas some of the proceeds raised from government bonds. However, the government does not publicly release information on assets held abroad or data on the position of the consolidated public sector, according to the IMF. That's historically raised criticisms that could intensify in the months ahead as the economy weakens. Opposition MP Low was quoted in the Straits Times in September 2007 asking in parliament whether the "government short-changes Singaporeans by giving CPF members 3.5% of the interest rate while the GIC makes 9% and pockets the balance of 5.5%".</p>

              <p>I find nothing wrong with GIC earning 9% with risks (if they can achieve it), and giving 2.5%~4% to Singaporeans risk-free.</p>

              <p>Don't you find it an anomaly that despite one of the
                                              highest savings rates in the world  most Singaporeans do not have enough retirement? Its
                                              not that because Singaporeans are not saving enough, but rather
                                              Singaporeans are not taking enough risks. Yet the govt is forcing
                                              Singaporeans to take lower risks.</p>
              <p>1.04^ 30 = 3.24  times ( compounded returns over 30 years at 4%)</p>
              <p>1.08^30 = 10.06 times ( compounded returns over 30 years at 8%)</p>
              <p><strong>Because most Singaporeans take lower risks, they may have to save 3 times more to
                                              get a similar retirement payout compared to countries that
                                              invests in equities.</strong></p>
              <p>The govt advocates individuals taking their own responsbility for
                                              retirement, yet its not possible equip majority of Singaporeans with
                                              financial knowledge. Many end up buying lower risks products such as
                                              endowment plan or unit trusts with high fees and sales charge instead of ETFs. Worst still, some may end up losing large sums of money speculating.</p>
              <p>Why does the govt force Singaporeans to save for housing (via CPF) when working Singaporeans would probably have saved for housing (a near term need) ?</p>
              <p>On the other hand, most
                                              Singaporeans do not save enough for retirement because it is a good
                                              20-30 years away.</p>

              <p>Don't you find it an anomaly that despite one of the highest
              savings rates in the world  most Singaporeans do not have
              enough retirement? Its not that because Singaporeans are not saving
              enough, but rather Singaporeans are not taking enough risks. Yet
              the govt is forcing Singaporeans to take lower risks.</p>
              <p>1.04^ 30 = 3.24  times ( compounded returns over 30 years
              at 4%)</p>
              <p>1.08^30 = 10.06 times ( compounded returns over 30 years at
              8%)</p>
              <p><strong>Because most Singaporeans take lower risks, they may
              have to save 3 times more to get a similar retirement payout
              compared to countries that invests in equities.</strong></p>
              <p>The govt advocates individuals taking their own responsbility
              for retirement, yet its not possible equip majority of Singaporeans
              with financial knowledge. Many end up buying lower risks products
              such as endowment plan or unit trusts with high fees and sales
              charge instead of ETFs. Worst still, some may end up losing large
              sums of money speculating.</p>
              <p>Why does the govt force Singaporeans to save for housing (via
              CPF) when working Singaporeans would probably have saved for
              housing (a near term need) ?</p>
              <p>On the other hand, most Singaporeans do not save enough for
              retirement because it is a good 20-30 years away.</p>

              <p>You think it is that easy to compound at 8% p.a. for 30 years with minimal risks and effort????</p>
              <p>If you are that good to compound your money at 8% or more, you do not even need your CPF monies at all.</p>
              <p>Financial knowledge has to be personally acquired. You talk as if everyone should and have to know it. You think ETFs are that great? Based on? Just because all the books are talking about how great ETFs are compared to Unit Trusts? You are believing the perpetrators of these ETFs who has specific interests in getting you to buy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do not save enough simply because you do not work hard enough. Ask yourself if you have put in the effort and energy to earn more while young, so that the power of compounding (since you like it) can have greater effect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, not using a lot of effort at all, I received another $170 cheque from google adsense. And remember all your time spent in complaining in this forum by typing can actually translates to even more income elsewhere, but you chose to spend it here.</p>

              <p>When surplus get extremely large there is a risk of generating negative return on the surplus reserved as such there is a need to re-investing the surplus financial capital for that i think it is not wrong.</p>
              <p>The notion of "risk free" is provided that financial capital are standing on sound footing. These days most govts are standing on "billion dollars" deficit spending. How much "Risk Free" can one gets.</p>
              <p>Stock market slided 1000 points within half a day of total selling depict that institutions investors are holding stock not for investment but speculative. The true nature is that institution who held large stocks really don't have much confident in stocks.  </p>
              <p>Value of monies is becoming more like regular paper.</p>
              <p>The key is how do you maintain the value of your surplus. and what is a reasonable loss of valuation during the crisi?</p>

              <p>You are correct in the sense that not everyone would know how to invest in financial products that yield 9% if the monies were return to the population.</p>
              <p>fundamental thinking.....</p>
              <p>I sometime ponder the notion of "correct goods to consume" and that it is the "protector" that knows more vs let it to the private establishment to make that decision.</p>
              <p>But i think there should be a choice given for the population. If individual choose to Remain in CPF, they enjoy an after tax returned of 2.5% or pull out the monies to private establishment to manage the fund at market risk.  But i think there would still be taxed on the private returned.</p>
              <p>Personnally i see alot more benefit in private sector getting a pie of the CPF retail investment because</p>
              <p>1) it will relief the demand inflation pressure on property especially on HDB.</p>
              <p>2) Our private investment market will operate in a more efficient manner. Create Jobs in private investment sector. Rather than restrict to insurance/unit trust and an over crowded of property agents .... </p>

CPF tops up is merely a fraction of the returns the invesment earned. For your info, the salaries of the civil servants are paid by taxes, whereas gains by Temasek and GIC are mostly kept in reserves.</span></p>
              <p>You think it is that easy to compound at 8% p.a. for 30 years
                                                      with minimal risks and effort?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Most pension funds target at least 8%, even the conversatives ones. Its a realistic target. Historically, stocks yield 12% on average. </span></p>

If the govt wants to advocate individual responsibility for retirement, schools should equip them with the financial skills, otherwise, most will have difficulty retiring earning paltry returns on low interest rates.</span></p>

              <p>You do not save enough simply because you do

                                                      enough. Ask yourself if you have put in the

                               here.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">You sound pretty young and arrogant. If you really want to know i draw on average $1800/month on starhub dividends alone. As for passive business income, its defintely way way bigger than what you are getting.</span></p>

              <p>Financial knowledge has to be personally acquired. You talk as
                      if everyone should and have to know it. You think ETFs are that
                      great? Based on? Just because all the books are talking about how
                      great ETFs are compared to Unit Trusts? You are believing the
                      perpetrators of these ETFs who has specific interests in getting
                      you to buy?</p>

                      earn more while young, so that the power of compounding (since you
                      like it) can have greater effect.</p>

                      and me.Morally i think its not right for a govt to tax heavily on
                      Singaporeans's savings when they are already insufficient. CPF tops
                      up is merely a fraction of the returns the invesment earned. For
                      your info, the salaries of the civil servants are paid by taxes,
                      whereas gains by Temasek and GIC are mostly kept in
                      reserves.</span></p>

              <p>Actually, there are pretty easy ways to make guaranteed returns of up to 6% or more.</p>
              <p>For example, any AUD fixed deposit of 1 year or more can earn you at least 6% pa or more. I think the Kiwi has also really good returns. The only issue is about exchange rate fluctuations.</p>

              <p>There have been talks of 20 year cycles. And if you take the start of the 20 year cycle's bottom to the end of the same cycle (another bottom), the returns is definitely less than 8% per annum.</p>

              <p>Don't you find it an anomaly that despite one of the highest savings rates in the world  most Singaporeans do not have enough retirement? Its not that because Singaporeans are not saving enough, but rather Singaporeans are not taking enough risks. Yet the govt is forcing Singaporeans to take lower risks.</p>
              <p>1.04^ 30 = 3.24  times ( compounded returns over 30 years at 4%)</p>
              <p>1.08^30 = 10.06 times ( compounded returns over 30 years at 8%)</p>
              <p><strong>Because most Singaporeans take lower risks, they may have to save 3 times more to get a similar retirement payout compared to countries that invests in equities.</strong></p>
              <p>The govt advocates individuals taking their own responsbility for retirement, yet its not possible equip majority of Singaporeans with financial knowledge. Many end up buying lower risks products such as endowment plan or unit trusts with high fees and sales charge instead of ETFs. Worst still, some may end up losing large sums of money speculating.</p>
              <p>Why does the govt force Singaporeans to save for housing (via CPF) when working Singaporeans would probably have saved for housing (a near term need) ?</p>
              <p>On the other hand, most Singaporeans do not save enough for retirement because it is a good 20-30 years away.</p>

              <p><br>in comparing to others, in term of average income of per capital 50,000k per year, we are much better than most countries, even if we do not have enuf saving, we still got saving, many countries average people also dun have any saving at all. Ours is different, at least we got saving, tho it may not be enuf.</p>
              <p>Well, CPIS thru SA can be use to invest in AAA rated stocks and shares, so CPF is flexible, it allow you to invest and build a bigger nest, so dun come here and talk shit that Singaporeans are not getting more out of it, or got no money for retirement, there maybe a few who just simply splash their money seeking self happiness, so end up no money, that is not a country problem, that is an individual created self problem. We got to be clear about this. Let see, my lion global bonds went up, Sg equity also went up...wah,...make money liao..</p>
