              <p>Eagle and soul rage have agreed 4% guaranteed returns is fine ( over 30 years  or more). 4% is like buying 30 years govt bonds, guaranteed to be safe.</p>
              <p>Yet one man's meat is another man's poison. George Soros or Jim rogers may scoff at 4% guaranteed over 30 years. They might do the opposite, that is borrowing 30 years at 4% to invest. ( which is what temasek and GIC is doing)</p>
              <p>Do we want minimal risks or optimal risks over 30 years? <strong>My yardstick is that there is need to strike a balance between taking risk and returns.</strong> Earning 4% guaranteed returns over 30 years may mean insufficient funds or having to save a lot more for retirement. Hence my conclusion that investing in a good mix of equity and bonds over 30 years as a pension fund to pool the risks on the ups and down of the market is better than earning guaranteed returns of 4%. This has been the prefered solution for many countries as well.</p>

              <p>First, you talk about your friends who are not financially well trained. Then you take out George Soros and Jim Rogers to compare. Your think your comparison is fair?</p>
              <p>If you want a good mix of equity and bonds over 30 years, I have already given you the calculations which I will summarize:</p>
              <p>1) 5.5% compounded, or if you want dividends, let's say 8% compounded interest. But take note I have not included any fees for managing the funds, not extra interest rates being given to you.</p>
              <p>2) You cannot be 100% invested, so you will never be able to achieve the full potential of 8%. This is one point you failed to look out for.</p>
              <p>3) A mix of equity and bonds? That will bring your 8% average even lower. Your 8% is for equities only, bonds traditionally give much lesser.</p>
              <p>Combining points 1, 2, and 3, I fail to see how 4% <strong>guaranteed</strong> is unfair.</p>

              <p><br>You are missing a big point, there are gals here too ya..not just guys or gays.</p>
              <p>I try to answer yr Q,</p>
              <p>Firstly, the retirement age had extented from 55 to 60 to now 62, and maybe later 65yo, therefore the withdrawer of CPF monies had also extended in line with retirement age</p>
              <p>Secondly, due to an aging population, we expect people to work older and also live longer due to good care on health and medicines. As such the life span of Singaporean have increased to 76yo for guys and 80yo for gals whereas 20 years ago, it was at 60s for both gender.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, which is more frank then the above 2 points, the govt need the CPF funds to invest, so they make it in a way that you cannot even take out the CPF completely, add in the curry flavor of 4% interest to stimulate individual greedy brain which in a way, or actually, you also cannot take it out, so if you got a $100k inside, 4% will become 104k and so on, and if you look at it on your statement, you feel so happy that it went up, and the govt is also happy, infact more happier to use the 104k to reinvest and earn more for themselves and so on. So, it is a kind of win win situation where one look at the statement, one is happy, and the other looks at the investment opportunity with excess funds, one is also happy.</p>
              <p>O by the way, now you cannot get back your CPF at all...the so called eternal living</p>

              <p>He just realized earlier than me that you have to take responsibility for your life. I realized it a little later.</p>
              <p>But realizing sooner or later, it's better than never. There are way too many people in this world that rather put the blame of not being able to retire with adequate funds on other people, than realizing that it is him or her who has to work towards that goal.</p>

                          managing the funds, not extra interest rates being given to

                          look out for.</p>

                          even lower. Your 8% is for equities only, bonds traditionally give
                          much lesser.</p>
              <p>Combining points 1, 2, and 3, I fail to see how 4%
                          <strong>guaranteed</strong> is unfair.</p>

              <p>Hi eagle,</p>
              <p>1) Your data point for the supposedly 5.5% return for 23 years from 1987 till 2010 only provides a limited view. If you want to ascertain the likely average returns for a dollar cost averaging over 23 years, you have to collect many multiple sample points of 23 years. e.g. 1981 - 2004 or 1982 - 2005. After collecting many 23 years spans and taking returns of different sample points, calculate the overall average, that will give you a true picture of likely average return of investing over 23 years.</p>
              <p>1)Then factor in dividends and</p>
              <p>2) then effect of reinvesment of dividends.</p>
              <p>Currently the STI ETF yields 3% dividends.</p>
              <p>2,3) As for why pension funds chose not to buy only 30 year govt bonds, this is because using the sampling technique i mentioned, the long term return of stocks is 12%.</p>
              <p>Hence 8-9% is returns based on a composition of both stocks and bonds.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In a long time horizon, most stock markets make returns of 10% to 15% annually.</p>
              <p>Insurance companies who receives fix premiums from the insured uses these funds to invest in the stock markets and other investments. When the insurance contract matures, the insurance company pays out the interest of maybe 6% to the insured, the rest of the profits goes into paying out expenses and dividends to shareholders. Insurance contract like CPF is not liquid, if you choose to withdraw early, you might not even get back the initial money you put in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is the ultimate shareholder of CPF? The government or the people?</p>
              <p>Who took the risk? The people or the government?</p>
              <p>If say tomorrow, all the investments in Temasek and GLC is worth nothing.</p>
              <p>Do you think CPF will have problems paying out all the CPF money to retirees as they fall due? Why do you think US has no problems paying out it's mountain of debt?

              <p>All they ever need to do is get MAS to increase the money supply (welcome to fiat currency) which raises inflation. Who suffers when inflation is high? The government or the people? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Why have a cap for those with accounts less than $30k from investing to get more returns? Why not have a capped for those whose accounts are in excess of $30k and let them make 3% interest; and those who have less than $30k make 5% interest?</p>

              <p>I think Hong Kong's MPFA is a much more equitable organisation, it has finance professional to educate investors about the kind of investments they should take and let the investors make their own choice. The gains and losses are of no consequence to the organisation, they don't make or lose any money from the investment choices of investors. While CPF pays a flat nominal interest rate which is manipulated by itself (In a way, because the government has all the cheap funds it needs from CPF, no need to raise interest rates to obtain funds; who sets the interbank rates in Singapore which in turn dictates the CPF interest rates.) and exploits the CPF balances of the poor. It's like "The Ring" it comes full circle. åŽ„è¿�å¾ªçŽ¯ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>In a long time horizon, most stock markets make returns of 10% to 15% annually.</p>
              <p>Insurance companies who receives fix premiums from the insured uses these funds to invest in the stock markets and other investments. When the insurance contract matures, the insurance company pays out the interest of maybe 6% to the insured, the rest of the profits goes into paying out expenses and dividends to shareholders. Insurance contract like CPF is not liquid, if you choose to withdraw early, you might not even get back the initial money you put in.</p>

              <p>listen to Jim Rogers on 6.35 mins. He said all along in America, people worked for 50-60 years and the government will give them their social security, but then Washington changed  its law on this and Jim find it outrageous to say the least.</p>
              <p>doesnt this sounded exactly the same with the CPF in Singapore? I am wondering if we are learning this from US or vice versa? how can the government keep changing the the CPF policy from time to time to suit them?</p>
